          FADE IN:
          CLOSE ON the face of WESLEY GIBSON, 25, STARING AT THE.

          CAMERA.

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and
          pathetic.
          His wry smile gives way to...
          Black. And then...

          INT. APPLEBY'S - DAY

          The CAMERA STARTS FROM THE CEILING, pointing straight
          down, overlooking a table of twenty-five people dressed
          in business casual, pretending to have a good time at
          lunch in. this cookie-cutter crappy restaurant.
          At the end of the table, a bowl of spinach dip is in.
          front of Wesley,'and the CAMERA STARTS descending
          directly for it, slowly, as we hear...

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          It was Rochelle's birthday, which meant
          there was a certain amount of inter-
          office pressure to go to Appleby's and
          sit at a table of twenty-five with my
          boss Janice presiding at the head even
          though she's too tight to pick up the
          bill. Which meant, the poor bastard
          waiting on us had to split the check
          twenty-four ways -- everyone contributing
          to Rochelle's free meal -- surf and turf,
          no less -- don't do us any favors,
          Rochelle. Anyway, I ate a plate of
          extreme nachos and then polished off a
          bowlful of spinach dip pretty much single-
          handedly...
          The CAMERA DISAPPEARS in the bowl of spinach dip and
          we...

          CUT TO:

          INT. WESLEY'S CUBICLE - DAY

          .where Wesley drops his head down on his desk.

          

          

          

          

          2.

          WESLEY
          .so by the time I got back to my
          cubicle, my eyelids were so damn heavy, I
          had to put my head down, even if it was
          just for a wink.

          SMASH CUT TO:

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          A sharply dressed man, MR. X, wearing a dark .Armani suit,
          enters a skyscraper through the lobby. He's a shade
          taller than most of the office workers who are coming and
          going.

          INT. LOBBY - DAY

          He heads to an elevator and presses a button for the top
          floor.
          And as his finger presses the button, just where the
          thumb meets the forefinger, we see a TATTOO of a three-
          headed dog.
          Soon...

          INT. TOP FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

          .the doors open again and he finds himself in an
          opulent corridor -- sleek and expensively designed.
          Only one office is at the end of the hall.
          Expressionless, he makes his way toward it. Without
          knocking, he steps inside...

          INT. PUJA'S OFFICE - DAY

          .an office fit for a king. Or a queen. Because behind
          a glass desk sits a beautiful Indian woman dressed
          traditionally in a serape, with a red bindi on her
          forehead, the holy third eye. Her name is PUJA.
          Mr. X sits in the single chair opposite her.
          After a moment, Puja looks up.

          PUJA
          I didn't expect for you yourself to come.
          One of the heads, in the flesh.

          MR. X
          You're an important fence.

          

          

          

          

          3.

          PUJA
          I'm flattered.
          She reaches over to an attachâ¬ case and removes a file.

          PUJA (CONT'D)
          The name of the target is Henry Helms.
          Carrying the file, she moves around the desk and stands a
          few feet away from Mr. X, who rises so that they are both
          standing. She really is quite beautiful, exotic even,.
          with piercing eyes.

          PUJA (CONT'D)
          He's a journalist who stumbled on to a
          story exposing a lot of powerful people,
          people who don't like having their power
          threatened.
          MR. x
          Poor Helms.

          PUJA
          There.have been five attempts on his
          life, but he has been well protected...
          and well hidden. Turns out his wife's
          family has a lot of money. He's in town
          to accept an award.

          MR. X
          We'll see to it that it never makes his
          mantle.

          PUJA
          And for that, my clients will pay
          handsomely.
          Mr. X is looking at Puja when a curious thing happens...
          .he notices that the red bindi on he r forehead tarts
          to move a little, like a second dot is trying to emerge
          from it, like an amoeba splitting.
          It's a sh hooter's laser!
          His eyes go wide as saucers.
          MR. x

          GET DOWN1!1
          .but it's too late as bullets rip into her head.
          splattering everything above her eyebrows into the wet
          bar.

          

          

          

          

          4.
          Mr. X crouches, drops his hands behind his back, and a.
          PAIR OF GUNS -- as technologically advanced as anything
          we've ever seen -- spring into his hands.
          The bullets .stop flying and he sprints at the window from
          which they came, smashing t rough what remains of it,
          disappearing from the demolished room...
          .all this as Puja's dead body hits the floor, blood
          seeping out of that holy third eye.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE SKYSCRAPER - FORTY FLOORS UP - DAY

          Mr. X's momentum carries him from one building to the
          next, over an alleyway, the wet-concrete shining below.
          He lands on the...

          ROOF OF THE NEXT BUILDING:
          ...and rolls up quickly, guns ready.
          His eyes spot FOUR MARKSMEN running and ducking for cover
          on the neighboring rooftop..
          .and on a dead sprint across the roof...
          . he spots about a CENTIMETER OF FLESH sticking out from
          around an air-conditioning vent. He fiKes the his
          left band.
          The bullet flies through the air and rockets into the
          flesh... which happens to be one of the marksmen's ears.
          The guy YELPS IN PAIN and falls back from the vent,
          exposing himself. That's all Mr. X needs, and another
          shot rings out while he's still on a dead run. THWAP!
          The bullet finds its mark in the yelping man's forehead,
          silencing him, just as...
          .Mr. X ducks behind a stairwell door.
          He pulls up his right hand and looks down the barrel of
          this pistol: built into the barrel is thin c u r
          screen. It actually shows the heat signatures of the
          three remaining marksmen, one of which is directly in
          front of him, hiding behind a small rooftop supply shed.
          A second marksmen is just on the other side of the
          stairwell. The third is on the far side of the rooftop.
          Mr. X takes another look at the heat signature of the
          marksman hiding behind the shed and he FIRES his gun...

          

          

          

          

          5.

          /~,
          ...then does an amazing thing: in the split second that
          the bullet travels forward, he jerks his gun to the
          side... actually steering the bullet around the wall and
          into the ksman's throat.
          Before the guy's blood hits the ground, the assassin is
          moving again: he dashes away from the stairwell then
          makes two incredible shots; one knocks a piece of
          aluminum off the top of the stairwell...
          ..which causes it to flip up in the air above the head
          of the hiding marksman...
          . the second shot strikes the aluminum again, ,,..,sending
          the bullet ricocheting down into the ton of the
          marksman's heads As he falls...
          THE CAMERA MOVES OVER TO WHERE... the FINAL MARKSMAN is
          breathing hard, like an engine with a chronic misfire, as
          he looks out at the dead bodies of his fallen comrades...
          all chopped down in a matter of seconds.
          He squeezes his eyes shut, trying to psyche himself up...

          LAST MARKSMAN

          (SOFTLY)
          C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
          He looks out at the stairwell door... and all is quiet.
          Maybe Mr. X didn't know he was there, maybe he left,
          maybe the last marksman can sneak away after all.

          LAST MARKSMEN

          (SOFTLY)
          Okay... okay...
          He finally decides...
          .and takes one step forward...
          THWAP1!1 A bullet disintegrates his knee.
          He falls, clutching the knee in agony, as Mr. X walks
          toward him slowly until he stands right over him like a
          hunter over his prey.
          Mr. X's shoe comes down on the final marksman's wrist,
          pinning it away from his dropped weapon.

          MR. X

          (GROWLS)
          Who sent you?

          

          

          

          

          6.
          For a moment, we're not sure the last marksman's going.to
          answer. Then...

          LAST MARKSMEN

          (NERVOUSLY)
          We're... we're just the decoys, man. We
          were paid to get you out here...
          The marksman points at a small VIDEO CAMERA sitting on
          the roof, relaying their every move...
          Mr. X's face falls as.those words register, and just
          then...
          RA ROCKETS over thetreets of the city, block
          after block in the blink of any eye...
          .until it reaches a rooftop, over a mile away.

          ON THE NEW ROOFTOP:
          A man named CROSS is in a crouch, holding a massive RIFLE
          pointed upward, at an angle...
          A small SCREEN on Cross' gun shows the scene from the
          roof, along with various elemental measurements: wind
          speed, pressure, temperature, distance, altitude...
          .. the information on __the reflects off of Cross'
          eyeball as he processes,,the shot... a quick adjustment to
          the gun and a slight pull of the trigger...

          BOOM...
          We follow the arcing bullet back over the rooftops in an
          instant. Somehow it keeps it's elevation and it's
          path...
          .to the resigned look on Mr. X's face: an outsmarted
          man, a dead man.
          The bullet hits him square in the chest, and he falls to
          his knees, then slumps over, dead.
          Flies start to gather as he lies there.
          First one, then two, then several as night TIME-DISSOLVES
          to day...

          EXT. ROOFTOP - LATER

          .and two pairs of legs approach the dead body of Mr. X.

          

          

          

          

          7.
          The first set belong to an older man, SLOAN, who looks.
          like he has seen his share of death. The other set
          belong to the hottest black woman on the planet, FOX.
          As they look down at the dead body...

          FOX
          It was a set-up all the way?
          Sloan just nods.
          He then stoops down, shoos some of the flies away with
          the back of his hand and picks up the file that Puja gave
          Mr. X.
          The CAMERA PUSHES IN on the back of Sloan's hand as he
          reads the file. It, too, has the tattoo pf the three-
          headed do q, in the same spot as Mr. X.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          (re: the dead body)
          That's two heads in two weeks. Which
          leaves only one: you.
          Sloan nods.

          SLOAN
          He wants out.

          FOX
          And killing all three heads gets him
          that?
          Sloan nods again.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Well, I don't know if we have anyone who
          can stop him.
          Sloan squints back up at Fox.

          SLOAN
          There's one person who can.

          FOX
          Yeah? Who?
          And with that, we...

          7 INT. WESLEY'S CUBICLE - DAY

          .Wesley Gibson, the guy from the opening scene, fast
          asleep in his little cubicle. Some drool falls off his
          lip and 'erks h' awake.
          Just then, the shot FREEZE-FRAMES, and we see IN THE
          BACKGROUND OF THE SHOT, his fat boss JANICE caught in mid-
          stride coming toward him, looking like she's ready to
          bring the wrath of God.

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          My name is Wesley Gibson. If you look at
          the corner of my desk, you'll see the
          billing reports I was supposed to hand in
          to Janice an hour ago.
          The BILLING ORT is highlighted on the screen for just
          a moment.
          .then the movie RESUMES normal speed and Janice reaches
          Wesley's cube in no time...

          BOSS JANICE
          Oh my fucking god I hope that's not my
          billing report sitting on your fucking
          desk. Holy shit on an altar, it isl
          A couple of the other OFFICE WORKERS look up at the
          fireworks and smile... like they're actually enjoying
          Janice's histrionics.

          BOSS JANICE (CONT'D)
          why don't you just take a dump in your
          hands, fork it over to me and say, "this
          is the best effort I'm gonna give to you,
          Janice. This is the best you're ever
          gonna get out of me." Hell, Rochelle on
          her bbirthdav is doing a better a job than
          your lazy ass and she's already left for
          the day. Je-sus CHRIST!
          Wesley looks like he'd rather be anywhere else.

          WESLEY
          I meant to...

          BOSS JANICE
          (imitating him)
          I meant to... I meant to... Well I meant
          to be a size four but meaning to doesn't
          pick no cotton.

          

          

          

          

          9.
          She snatches up the report off his desk.

          BOSS JANICE (CONT'D)
          Tell you what. I'll just input the four-
          ones myself.

          (ANNOUNCES)
          Look everyone, I'm gonna do Wesley's four-
          ones for him! I don't have enough to do
          with my own damn job so I'll do Wesley's
          too!
          Wesley grabs the report back.

          WESLEY
          I'll do it.

          BOSS JANICE
          Minimum for the maximum. That's all you
          ever do. The minimum you can do to suck
          the maximum from this company.

          WESLEY
          I said I'll get it done. I'm sorry.

          BOSS JANICE
          No, you're worthless. I'm the one who's
          sorry I hired you.
          She storms away, fuming.
          Wesley looks over and sees some of the other workers
          still staring at him, amused.
          He sits back down to the semi-privacy of his little
          cubicle.

          CUT TO:

          INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

          A CONSULTANT in a suit is droning on and on in front of a
          nifty power-point presentation.
          The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Wesley, bored to tears,
          sitting at a long table with Janice and other corporate
          minions.
          The CAMERA FINDS Wesley's note-pad where it looks like
          he's taking notes on the presentation. Instead, covering
          every inch of the page, is the phrase "life sucks then
          you die."

          

          

          

          

          10.

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          My job title is Account Manager. I used
          to be called an Account Service
          Representative, but a consultant told us
          we needed to "manage" our clients and not
          " service- them.
          Onemore "life sucks then you die."

          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage
          nor service.

          CUT TO:

          INT. GIRLFRIEND'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Wesley's GIRLFRIEND is currently riding some guy named
          BARRY on her living room.couch. She's not very
          attractive, sort of plain and ordinary.

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          Her name's Cathy. She works at Banana
          Republic. The guy she's humping is my
          best friend, Barry.
          She's giving it her best. As her MOANS reach a
          crescendo, we...

          CUT BACK TO:

          INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

          Wesley is still sitting there with his note pad, while
          the consultant continues to rattle on and on about God
          knows what.
          Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley can spot
          his company.'s hot intern, NICOLE, talking on the phone.
          He zeroes in on her, until...
          Wesley suddenly looks around the room and everyone ijL_
          staring at him.

          WESLEY

          (HESITANTLY)
          Yes. Uh... Well the 602 deals with
           applications sent by prospective clients
           and the 603 is when the client is...
          Everyone is still just staring...

          

          

          

          

          11.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, Jesus... uh... what was the
          question?

          CONSULTANT
          I asked you about the effects of net
          investment income with regards to
          underwriting cycles.

          WESLEY
          Well, that's the thing.-

          CONSULTANT
          What's the thing?

          WESLEY
          (trying to redeem himself)
          Cycles. Hard market, industry-wide
          cycles differ from our firm's cycles so I
          think it's amistake to apply...

          JANICE
          Good God a'mighty.

          CONSULTANT
          Son... everyone knows that net
          investment income is inversely related to
          both premium and loss reserves, making
          firm cycles inherently dependent on
          industry cycles!
          Everyone snickers.

          CONSULTANT (CONT'D)
          In fact, to prove my point, I'd like you
          to spend some time this afternoon adding
          up the yearly differential responses.

          JANICE
          Get it to me by five.

          WESLEY
          Sure.
          Wesley jots down on his pad: "ACTION ITEMS," and
          underneath it: "Differential responses... then you die."
          He underlines it three times.

          INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY

          Wesley sits at a small round table by himself, eating a
          ham and cheese on white.

          

          

          

          

          12.
          A group of. other WORKERS sit at a table nearby, gossiping
          and guffawing about whatever shit they have to discuss.

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          There are people, everyday you meet them,
          who you wish could see you in a different
          setting, a different place...
          Just then, Nicole, the pretty intern, approaches and
          starts fishing through the refrigerator.

          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          .instead of where you are, what you've
          become.
          Wesley sits upright, glad now that no one is sitting at
          his table. Nicole turns and smiles at Wesley, starts to
          head his way, when...

          LOUDMOUTH AT OTHER TABLE
          Nicole! Get your ass over here and.tell
          us what the hell is going on with you and
          Whitcock the big cock!
          He pulls a chair over from next to Wesley to make room
          for her at his table.
          Wesley just takes another bite of his sandwich.

          INT. WESLEY'S CUBICLE - DAY

          Wesley is staring, at his monitor...

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          And you wish to god your eyeballs weren't
          being sucked out of their sockets by
          monitor fatigue. That you didn't spend
          five years in college to do goddamn
          differential responses.
          see that he is actually i>laying solitaire on the
          computer. He keeps checking over his shoulder for
          Janice, but she is talking on the phone in her office
          with the door shut.
          He looks up and watches the computer clock turn from 4:59
          to 5:00. He saves his solitaire game and then turns off
          the computer, snatches up his jacket, waits for Janice to
          turn her back to him as she is engrossed in her call, and
          then sneaks away.

          INT. ELEVATOR BANK - DAY

          Wesley presses the down button and waits.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          WESLEY
          C'mon, c'mon.
          After an eternity, the doors open.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          But at least at the end. of the day...
          Wesley steps in and turns around. Before the doors
          close, he sees his boss Janice down the hall, looking at
          him. She checks her watch and looks back at him,
          pissed...

          WESLEY (CONT'D)

          (DEFEATED)
          .you know that tomorrow it's going to
          start all over again.
          ..and then the doors close.

          EXT.. CITY STREET - DAY

          Wesley pedals a ten-speed down a busy street. It's
          raining, and he squints to keep the water out of his
          eyes.

          EXT. ATM MACHINE - DAY

          He stands nervously at an ATM machine. He checks to see
          if anyone is looking, and then hits the "check balance"
          button.
          A message comes up: "You have $47.92 in your account.
          Would you like another transaction?"
          He clicks "yes" and then "quick cash" and waits for the
          $40 to dispense.

          IN . WESLEY'S APARTMENT - DUSK
          Wesley enters, toting his bike, only to find Cathy and
          Barry laughing on the couch, watching some crap on
          television.
          He's two steps in the door when...

          CATHY
          Where's the spaghetti?

          WESLEY
          What?

          

          

          

          

          14.

          CATHY
          I specifically told you to get noodles on
          your way home. God, Wesley, I already
          put the sauce on.

          WESLEY
          Sorry. Iâ¢didn't...

          CATHY
          You didn't listen is what you didn't.- I
          might as well talk to the wall.

          WESLEY
          I'll be right back.
          He turns around.

          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE WESLEY'S APARTMENT - DUSK

          He starts to head away when Barry pokes his head out of
          the apartment door.

          BARRY

          (INSINCERELY)
          You want me to go with you, buddy?
          What a dick. Wesley doesn't turn around, defeated...

          WESLEY
          I got it.

          EXT. CITY STREET - DUSK

          He's back on the ten-speed, pedaling again in the rain,.a
          pissed expression on his face.

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          My parents both died when I was born.
          He grits his teeth as we...

          CUT TO:

          INT. FOSTER HOME - DAY

          A young Wesley, 10, sits at a table with a couple of

          RELIGIOUS FOSTER PARENT WACKOS.

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          The nutjobs I had as foster parents
          thought any book that didn't contain a
          red-letter edition was the spawn of the
          devil...

          

          

          

          
          .is.

          EXT. FOSTER HOME - DAY

          The ten-year-old Wesley moves furtively to a side of the
          clap trap house, and pries loose a board.

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          ..so I had to hide my stash like it was
          a bag of many jane.
          Stuck in a hole is a copy of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO.
          He moves back around the corner and standing there is his
          FOSTER MOTHER, pissed as hell...

          WESLEY (V.0.), (CONT'D)
          One time my foster mother found my copy
          of CATCHER IN THE RYE...
          .she holds a copy of the book in,her hand, getting
          ready, to strike..

          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          .and God told her to beat me with it.
          Young Wesley takes a beating, WHAP, WHAP, WRAP!
          .his face screws up, taking the blows...

          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          .But despite them, I thought I was gonna
          be something special.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. CITY STREET - DUSK

          .that same expression is plastered on Wesley's face as
          he pedals. He banks the bike up a curb and into a
          grocery store parking lot.
          Across the street, a man watches from behind the wheel of
          a 171 Chevy Chevelle.
          In fact, it's Cross, the man we last saw assassinating
          Mr. X on the rooftop.
          He watches Wesley park the bike and move into the store.

          INT. KROGER - PASTA AISLE - NIGHT

          Wesley stands, looking over all the different kinds of
          noodles. None of them just say "spaghetti."

          

          

          

          

          16.
          Suddenly, a woman's voice pops up behind-him...

          FOX
          There is a remedy for all things but
          death.
          She said it so fast he's not sure he heard it right.
          He turns and sees the-hottest zQZM ever to ace
          Kroger's aisles: ox. She's wearing barely enough
          clothing to cover her tight body.

          WESLEY
          (like he.didn't hear)
          I'm sorry?

          FOX
          You apologize too much.

          WESLEY
          (stammers again)
          Sorry?
          She looks him in the eye.

          FOX
          Spina bifida babies have more backbone
          than you.
          With that, she walks toward the end of the aisle, eyes
          scanning the whole time.
          Stunned, all Wesley can do is watch her walk.
          on the sMll f her back is a tatt It'
          tattoo we saw in the be i n n : a thKee-head2d dog.
          She gets to the end and catches him looking at her.
          Then she makes a very subtle gesture with her head... as
          if to say "come here."
          Wesley still isn't sure what the hell is going on.
          Sheepishly, he makes his way to where she stands.
          She leans in close, her lips just inches from his ear.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          I knew your father.
          Whatever Wesley was expecting_ it wasn't that. He pulls
          back from her.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          WESLEY
          I think you got the wrong guy.

          FOX
          Can't say that I agree with you, Wesley.

          WESLEY
          (running it all together)
          What is this? How d'you know my name?

          FOX
          Your father...

          WESLEY
          My father died in a car wreck the week I
          was born...

          FOX
          ,Your father died two days ago on the
          rooftop. of the Metropolitan Building.
          For a moment, just a moment, Wesley is stunned, but Fox
          just keeps sizing him up.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          He'd be damn disappointed in what you've
          become, too.
          Wesley holds up his hands in a defensive gesture...

          WESLEY
          Lady...

          FOX
          I've been called a lot of things, but
          "lady" ain't one of 'em.
          Wesley starts to talk but Fox interrupts him...

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Damn, Wesley, how d'you ever learn
          anything when you won't keep your mouth
          shut and your ears open? I'm trying to
          tell you about your father.
          Wesley starts to open his mouth again, but then closes
          it. He waits.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Your father, Wesley, wits the greatâ sit
          assassin to ever live. Your father,
          Wesley, worked for the Fraternity.

          

          

          

          
          is.

          WESLEY
          The Fraternity?

          FOX
          (keeps right on going)
          Your father, Wesley, was set up and
          gunned down by a man he used to consider
          a friend. And your father, Wesley...
          Suddenly, s raises her hands and-LS fist' two blgck

          PISTOLS.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          .taught me everything I know.
          Wesley takes a step back.

          WESLEY

          (SLOWLY)
          What is this?

          FOX
          This is what you've dreamt about all your
          life.
          Just then, Cross o s the corner to t e' e
          also fisting a Da'r of alms.
          Wesley's eyes go wide as Fox suddenly starts firing, BAM!
          BAMI BAMZ BAMI BAM: forcing Cross to take cover on the
          far side of the aisle.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Move! Now!
          She screams this, grabbing Wesley's wrist and jerking him
          forward, just as Cross comes back up, firing, a killing
          machine.
          They barely get out of the way, as the pasta aisle
          explodes in an avalanche of bullets! Glass bottles of
          spaghetti sauce shatter, turning the aisle into a
          rainstorm of red droplets -- we're not sure what is sauce
          and what is blood.
          Then... Cross springs on to a display stand of tortillas
          and up to the top of the freezer section, so he can have
          a better angle of attack at the fleeing Fox and Wesley.
          He starts sprinting down the top of the freezer section,
          smashing over styrofoam coolers, as his bullets barely
          miss Fox and Wesley, but slam into the freezers behind
          them, sending ice and glass exploding everywhere.

          

          

          

          

          19.
          But Wesley and Fox are too quick.. She still has a.hold
          of Wesley's wrist and she propels him through the
          swinging doors of the stock room.

          -EXT. OUTSIDE THE GROCERY STORE - DAY

          There is a cherry red FERRARI convertible parked right
          next to the store.
          Wesley is still trying to figure out what the hell is
          going on as Fox tosses him the ke !

          FOX
          Drive!

          WESLEY
          What?!!
          But Fox just leaps into the passenger seat, guns up and
          ready, as Wesley's legs. somehow take over and he hops
          behind the wheel.
          Just then, Cross's ev ll Mound the corner,
          practically going up on two tires.
          Wham! Wesley turns the ignition, pope the clutch, and
          smashes the gas pedal as the car nearly snaps his neck
          when it launches forward.
          He races through the gears and rips around a corner and
          out into traffic.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Where are we going?

          FOX
          Just drive!
          The Chevelle stays on his tail behind them; Cross drives
          and fires his Glock at the same time. Bam! Bam! Sam!
          Fox does her best to send bullets back his way, while
          Wesley mans the wheel, breathing hard, still stunned at
          what is happening.
          He spots a side-street...

          WESLEY
          Hold on!
          ...whips the car into a rubber-squealing turn...

          

          

          

          

          20.

          EXT. ONE WAY STREET - DAY

          ...and ends up going the wrong way down a narrow one-way
          street!
          He now has to weave in and out of cars headed right for
          them, as Cross stays tight on their ass.
          Horns are BLARING in his face, but Wesley somehow keeps
          the. Ferrari on all four tires as he bobs in'and out of
          the paths of oncoming cars.
          A 4 X 4 Chevy Pickup is headed like a missile right at
          them...
          Wesley's eyes go wide.

          WESLEY
          Truck!

          FOX
          Go around it!

          WESLEY
          No! Shoot the tires!
          Fox looks at Wesley, momentarily stunned by his idea,
          then spins and fires away at the oncoming truck.
          The front tires on the truck explode and the truck veers
          hard right, where it bounces off a Fed Extrugk.,,, hat
          sends it into a violent roll.
          Wesley guns the Ferrari at the tumbling truck as it flips
          forward... right over their car!!!
          Wesley watches it fly over them, amazed his idea
          worked... when finally it SMASHES down into the street
          between them and Cross's Chevellel
          Cross is forced to slam on his brakes and slide out...
          but it's too late... his Chevelle smashes into the 4 X 4
          before skidding to a stop, a tangled mess in the street.
          Wesley snaps back to reality and rips the Ferrari off the
          one-way street and down a side street.

          EXT. CITY STREET - LATER

          He pulls the car to a stop, then looks over at Fox,
          amazed.

          

          

          

          

          21.

          FOX

          (SMILING)
          There's a lot of things you don't know
          about yourself, Wesley.

          WESLEY
          Who was that?

          FOX
          That... was the man who killed your
          father. And now he's trying to kill you.
          Wesley forces a laugh, but right now it's hard to paint
          any-thing as ludicrous.

          WESLEY
          No. I mean... I told you my father died
          when I was a baby.
          She leans right into his face so that their noses are
          only inches apart.

          FOX
          Have you ever believed that? Have you
          ever been content with that answer?
          Wesley stops, not sure of anything right now.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Today's your new birthday, Wesley.
          Drive.
          He settles back in his seat and pops the clutch again,
          this time, easing.a little more respectably into traffic.

          EXT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

          The Ferrari cruises to a stop outside a warehouse.

          FOX
          The people I work with... we believe your
          father passed his skills on genetically
          to you. You knew how to handle the car,
          you knew to shoot at the truck.

          WESLEY

          I... I...

          FOX
          It's that confidence we're gonna need to
          work on.
          Wesley is still dazed.

          

          

          

          

          22.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Now I want you to look at me and tell me
          something. And I want you to be honest
          with me.

          WESLEY
          What?

          FOX
          Do you think I look fat in this outfit?

          WESLEY
          What?!

          FOX
          I thought so. Let's go.
          She hops out. They walk inside a...

          INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - DAY

          .t where Mr. Sloan stands next to a hucre man, THE
          BUTCHER, who is slicing beef off of hanging cow
          ca f es. There are flies buzzing around and blood
          draining into the center of the floor.
          If Wesley wasn't nervous before, he is now.

          FOX
          Mr. Sloan.
          The Butcher looks up from his work and lays down the
          knife, right next to where Mr. Sloan has a pair of silver
          pistols and a magnifying glass resting on a rolling
          table.

          FOX (CONT'D)

          (PROUDLY)
          This is Wesley Gibson. He needs his life
          changed.
          The Butcher looks him over.

          THE BUTCHER
          We all end up where we belong, don't we?
          The Butcher snickers. Sloan speaks up...

          SLOAN
          Fox told you about your father?
          Wesley looks from Sloan to Fox to the Butcher and back to
          Sloan.

          

          

          

          

          23.

          WESLEY

          (STAMMERS)
          Like I told... um... the lady here... I
          think you might ha
          ve me mixed up with
          someone else. I'm just an... um...
          account serv... uh..that is... account
          manager... and... my father died...
          He hesitates.

          SLOAN
          When?
          They look at him, imploringly, waiting for an answer.

          WESLEY
          I... I guess I'm not sure.
          Sloan simply picks up one of the pistols and sticks the
          gun in Wesley's hand.

          SLOAN
          Shoot the wings off the flies.

          WESLEY
          What?!

          SLOAN

          (GROWLS)
          Shoot... the wings... off the flies.
          For. the first time, Wesley notices flies buzzing all
          around.

          WESLEY
          I don't...
          In the blink of an eye, Sloan has plucked the second gun
          off the rolling table and ',s
          -pointing it at Weslev's temple. He begins to count...

          SLOAN
          You have three seconds. Three... two...
          Before he can say one, Wesley reacts... blindly firing
          the pistol in his hand, indiscriminately, B,AM! BAM!
          BAM! BAM! CLICK...CLICK...CLICK... until his finger is
          just jamming on the trigger over and over.
          After a moment, he looks up, unsure why he isn't dead.

          

          

          

          

          24.
          Sloan smiles, drops his pistol on the rolling table and
          picks up the magnifying glass. He stoops down and
          signals Wesley to do the same.

          THROUGH THE MAGNIFYING GLASS:
          Four flies lie on - the floor. crawling o d... their
           wings actually separated from their bodies!

           IN THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:
          Wesley jerks upright, trying to process this.

          FOX
          Like I said, you got the skills.

          SLOAN
          And after we fine tune those skills...
          His eyes lock on to Wesley's, holding them in a vice-like
          grip...

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          .you're going to hunt the man who
          killed Your father.
          Wesley is as stunned as we've ever seen him... he blinks
          a couple of times.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          Walk with me.
          He drapes his arm around Wesley and leads him out the
          door.

          EXT. CITY BLOCK - DAY

          Sloan and Wesley move down a busy commercial street.

          SLOAN
          I know thin is hard for you to
          understand, Wesley, but I want you to
          concentrate on what I'm saying. Your
          father was a member of the Fraternity, a
          collection of the most powerful assassins
          the world has ever known.
          They weave against the flow of pedestrians out and about
          on the city streets. Instinctively, people step out of
          their way.

          WESLEY
          But I've never heard of...

          

          

          

          

          25.

          SLOAN
          We don't advertise Wesley. We blend into
          the environment like moths against a
          tree.

          INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

          The CAMERA moves over a diner's counter...

          SLOAN (V.0.)
          We stay in the shadows.
          .. to the kitchen, where a massive man with a three-
          headed dog tattoo on his hand, flips burgers. THE CHEF.

          SLOAN (V.0.)
          We disappear into our surroundings.
          .until it finds a man with a three-headed dog tattoo on
          his hand, trimming a hedge. THE GARDENER.

          CUT TO:

          INT. GUN COUNTER - DAY

          The CAMERA moves down a gun display case...

          SLOAN
          Because the easiest place to hide is in
          plain sight...
          .until it finds a GUN SALESMAN holding out a weapon to
          an Italian customer. He also has the tattoo. He's THE

          GUNSMITH.

          BACK TO:

          EXT. CITY BLOCK - DAY

          Sloan is still walking with Wesley. Wesley watches every
          face that passes them by... any of them could be
          Fraternity members.

          

          

          

          

          26.

          SLOAN
          ..until that time when we are called
          into action.

          CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

          The Chef loads plates of food up on the warmer, where a
          WAITRESS picks them up and delivers them to a group of
          prominent looking BUSINESSMEN.
          The lead businessman digs into his steak, and immediately
          his left arm starts to curl up, like he's having a heart
          attack. His cohorts look on as he spills over, knocking
          all the plates off the table, gasping for breath, his
          throat closed.
          When the CAMERA PANS OVER AGAIN, the Chef is gone.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. MANSION - DAY

          The Gardener works his gardening shears on a hedge in the
          front of this mansion... CLIP, CLIP, CLIP. We realize

          A,
          he's cutting a hole all the way through the hedge.
          Then, he reaches down into his burlap sack and withdraws
          a long range rifle with a scope. He pokes the rifle
          through the freshly-cut hole, looks through the lens,
          starts to squeeze his trigger...
          The CAMERA SHOOTS WAY UP to give us an aerial view of the
          neighborhood. We see that we are in the hills over the
          city, and across the canyon, a Japanese man is just
          pulling into his driveway, driving a black Audi, a mile
          away.
          He brakes his car, opens his door, but THWAPI A bullet
          disintegrates his head and he topples over, never knowing
          what hit him.
          Back at the hole in the hedge, we see the Gardener's
          eyeball looking through from the other side... until it
          disappears and he is gone.

          EXT. STORE PARKING LOT - DAY

          The customer takes the gun from the Gunsmith and pays him
          in cash.

          

          

          

          

          27.
          He then tucks the gun in his belt and walks out the door,
          like he's a bad-ass, instead of the goombah that he is.
          He only gets a block before the gun at his waist
          EXPLODES, causing him to flop on the sidewalk, like he
          just stepped on a land mine.
          The bell to the Gun Shop jingles as the Gunsmith leaves
          and heads in the opposite direction, whistling to
          himself, not paying attention to the pedestrians running
          to help the dying Italian.

          SLOAN (V.0.)
          And when the time comes that we are
          called, death is as certain as the sun.

          CUT BACK TO:

          INT. PHARMACY - DAY

          Sloan and Wesley enter a normal looking pharmacy. They
          pass through the small front room and head directly to
          the back.

          SLOAN
          We have been active for centuries,
          Wesley... outlasting rulers, governments,
          nations, kings. We recognize no borders;
          the entire globe is our killing field.
          They are buzzed through by THE PHARMACIST, and enter...

          INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY

          .a sophisticated back room, where a trio of flat screen
          monitors are mounted on the wall.

          SLOAN
          We are the baddest of the bad, the three-
          headed dog that guards the gates of hell.
          We show no mercy, we destroy the weak, we
          have absolute power.

          (BEAT)
          But recently, a fallen angel, one of our
          own, has challenged that power.
          The screens in the room come to life with the face of
          Cross.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          This man left the Fraternity and decided
          to strike down those who had befriended
          him, trained him, made him who he is.

          SLOAN (V.0.)
          ..a son whose mother died in
          childbirth...
          They reach the baby's bed and a pair of strong arms lift
          up the child. But the CAMERA FINDS the face of the
          second man...

          SLOAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          ..he took the boy to an orphanage so his
          true identity would never be discovered.
          .and now we see that the other man is a YOUNG MR.

          SLOAN.

          SLOAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And I helped him.

          'INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY

          Wesley is still absorbing the story, his life so
          different than when he got up in the morning.

          WESLEY
          Why would you do that?
          Sloan puts a hand on Wesley's shoulder, gently.
          Paternally.

          SLOAN
          Your father was like a brother to me.

          (BEAT)
          I will do anything to avenge his death.'
          Sloan turns off the monitors and pulls over a wooden
          chair from where it rests by a wall.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          So Wesley... you have a choice. Would
          you like to go back to your job, your
          girlfriend, your life, just as it was
          before?

          (BEAT)
          Or would you like to begin your training
          with an assassin's Fraternity that writes
          the world's history in blood and bullets?
          Wesley doesn't know what to say. Sloan moves to a back
          door .

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          If the answer is the latter, then have a
          seat in that chair.

          (MORE)

          (BEAT)
          If not, you're welcome to head out this
          door here and we'll never see each other
          again.
          With that., Sloan leaves through that back door. But...

          ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR:
          He stops. He pulls out a gun and waits for Wesley to
          make his decision, pointing his gun at the door.

          BACK IN THE ROOM:
          Wesley is still standing there, unaware of what is on the
          other side of the door, thinking, thinking, thinking. He
          takes a step toward the door...
          FLASH: His boss Janice, yelling at him, mocking him.
          Wesley hesitates, looks at the chair, then the door
          again...
          FLASH: His girlfriend on the couch, riding high on
          Barry, loving every minute of it.
          Wesley stands frozen, staring hard at the chair as THE
          CAMERA STARTS to swirl around him.
          FLASHES: The consultant haranguing, the other employees
          laughing, eating.alone in the break room, riding his
          bike, all the aspects of his shitty life...
          .. as the CAMERA CONTINUES to swirl around him, his face
          going hard...

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          Fuck consultants and fuck action items
          and fuck differential responses. Fuck it
          all.
          He takes a seat in the chair, which creaks when he sits
          in it.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          (out loud)
          Fuck it all.

          ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BACK DOOR:
          Sloan hears the creak of the chair and lowers his gun.
          He smiles and walks off down an alley.

          

          

          

          

          31.

          IN THE ROOM:
          Wesley waits in the chair for what seems an eternity.
          starts to bite his thumbnail, nervously.
          In comes the Pharmacist. The man is built like a
          mountain, with muscles rippling out of his white smock.
          .He's got a British accent and is extremely polite.

          THE PHARMACIST
          'Ah, made your choice, did 'ja, of boy?

          WESLEY

          (UNCOMFORTABLY)
          Yeah.

          THE PHARMACIST
          Very good, very good.
          He walks behind Wesley.

          THE PHARMACIST (CONT'D)
          The weather's been lovely the last couple
          o' days-- would you mind putting your
          hands back here for me?
          Wesley does, and the Pharmacist binds his hands with some
          rope.

          THE PHARMACIST (CONT'D)
          There, that's it. Very good.

          WESLEY
          Is this the beginning of my training?

          THE PHARMACIST
          Quite right.
          The Pharmacist cracks his knuckles and then,
          WHAM!!! He hits Wesley so hard right in the cheek
          that it almost knocks him out of the chair.

          WESLEY
          What the fuck are...
          WHANIlM 4!!!1 The Pharmacist smashes him again.
          Wesley struggles against the ropes but isn't going
          anywhere. The Pharmacist rears back. and WHAM! WHAMMM!
          WHAMQ! keeps hitting him over-and over again until
          Wesley's eyes roll to the back of his head.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          You know how when you have a dream and
          wake up unexpectedly...

          INT. WESLEY'S A13ARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

          Wesley jerks awake in his bed...

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          ...and the dream is still. on the fringe
          of your brain but you can't quite
          remember the details?
          He looks up at his ceiling fan, barely turning, a few
          blades missing...

          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          But then you see that same old busted
          ceiling fan over your bed and you are so
          damn glad it was just a dream?
          He sits up on his bed and checks himself in the mirror.
          His face has been pummeled; it looks like a piece of
          squashed fruit.

          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          This was nothing like that.

          EXT. ATM MACHINE - DAY

          Wesley shoves his ATM card in the machine and hits the
          "check balance" button. Which reveals: $100,000.92.
          Amazed, Wesley takes out a grand, the machine just
          spitting him money.
          Smiling, Wesley jumps back on his ten speed and zips into
          traffic.
          The s in in wheel of the bicycle turns into...

          INT. WESLEY'S CUBICLE - DAY

          .that little spinning wheel on a monitor tbAt indicates
          your computer stuck. Wesley sits in his cubicle,
          staring at it.
          Then...

          

          

          

          

          33.

          NICOLE
          What happened to your face?
          Wesley turns in his chair, surprised. Nicole stands
          there, looking as pretty as ever, way out of -his league.

          WESLEY

          (SHEEPISH)
          I... uh...I got hit by a man much bigger
          than me.
          Nicole smiles, flirtatiously.

          NICOLE
          Was this over a girl?

          WESLEY
          Something like that.

          NICOLE
          I had no idea you had such a secret life
          outside of here.
          She cocks her head and studies him.

          NICOLE (CONT'D)
          Is there something different about you?
          Besides the... face?

          WESLEY
          No. Not really. Same old Wesley.

          NICOLE
          I don't think so.
          She puts her hand on top of his; he can only stare at
          it... this kind of thing just doesn't happen to him.

          NICOLE (CONT'D)
          You aren't like these people Wesley.
          I've always thought you were different.

          WESLEY
          Would you consider me to be an observant
          person?

          NICOLE
          What's that mean?
          Wesley's about to say something, when he spots Janice
          heading their way.
          Wesley nods at her and Nicole frowns.

          

          

          

          

          34.

          NICOLE (CONT'D)
          Uh-oh, here comes the wicked bitch of the
          west...
          With that, she steps away, just as Janice walks up.
          Wesley stands to face his boss, as Janice launches into
          him...

          BOSS JANICE
          Jesus H. Fucking Popscile, you don't have
          time to get me the differential responses
          but you got time to chitty-chatty with
          the intern? Why do I even keep you
          around, Wesley? Well I know one thing,
          your review is coming up next week and I
          can't wait to start checking me off some
          boxes... attitude: poor, performance:
          poor, management skills: poor, works well
          with others...
          Wesley just focuses on that mouth. Fat lips over fat
          gums over yellow teeth. But now all that's coming out of
          it is JIBBERISH.
          ' I Jibberish that goes straight from her larynx to Wesley's
          ears where it imbeds in the soft flesh of his brain and
          BURNS... It's so goddamn loudl if only...
          ...if only it would just...

          WESLEY

          (ROARS)

          SHUT THE FUCK UP11!!1111
          It's so unbelievably stunning coming out of Wesley's
          mouth that it hits Janice like a slap in the face.
          Heads all over the office start to poke out of the tops
          of their cubicles like gophers coming out of holes.
          Nicole watches, pleasantly stunned, from a few feet away.
          Janice looks around, shocked. Wesley likes the way that
          felt, so...

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Just because you have one single iota of
          tenuous power, you think you can push
          everyone around?

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          35.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          .I understand, Janice, that junior high
          must have been particularly difficult
          being called Tubby all the time, but that
          doesn't give you the goddamn right to
          treat your workers like horseshit. Sure
          we laugh at you behind your back and sure
          we know you keep a stash of jelly
          doughnuts in the top drawer of your
          desk...
          Janice looks down at her fingers, which still have a
          little grape jelly on them...

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          .and sure everyone takes their lunch an
          hour before you so we can get an extra
          hour away from you, and I know that must
          sting sitting by yourself in the White
          Castle parking lot every day gnawing on
          your third burger thinking up ways to
          humiliate us...
          Janice's eyes fall to her feet.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          .you know, if you weren't such a bitch,
          we might actually feel sorry for you. As
          it is, I feel I can speak for the rest of
          the office when I say... FUCK YOU!!!
          With that, he throws all the papers off his desk, sending
          them flying!
          Empowered, Wesley marches toward the elevators as
          everyone watches him go, admiration plastered on their
          faces.
          The loudmouth from the break-room steps out...

          LOUDMOUTH
          That was great dude!
          He holds up his hand for a high-five, but Wesley just
          WALLOPS him with a right cross, not breaking stride on
          his way to the elevators.

          EXT. OUTSIDE WESLEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Wesley flies out the front door, just as Fox's Diablo
          swings around the corner.

          FOX
          What's up, new man?

          

          

          

          

          36.

          WESLEY
          You were watching?

          FOX
          Never stopped. How'd it feel, saying
          exactly what you wanted to say?

          WESLEY
          Like I had a gun in my hands.
          Fox grins as Wesley jumps in the car and she mashes on
          the pedal. The Diablo's tires smoke as she launches it
          out of there.

          INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE ROOM - DAY

          They return to the butcher shop. Sides of beef hang from
          hooks next to a cutting table. The Butcher is sharpening
          a knife.

          FOX
          You need to get used to the blood and the
          muscle and the meat and the sinew and
          what a single blade of steel can do to a
          chunk of flesh.
          The Butcher turns and slices a chunk of tenderloin off of
          one of the hanging carcasses, then slaps it on the table.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Take care of him, Butcher.

          THE BUTCHER
          Will do, Fox.
          The Butcher measures Wesley, then starts to talk in a
          steady, almost bored voice...

          THE BUTCHER (CONT'D)
          Remember, it's the body we are killing.
          Know it like a surgeon.
          Wesley nods, half disgusted, half enthralled.

          THE BUTCHER (CONT'D)
          Okay, we'll start at the beginning. To
          cut the subclavian artery, hold the knife
          ice-pick style and thrust down behind the
          clavicle, cutting side to side.
          He jabs the blade into the beef... and just as he does...

          

          

          

          

          37.

          FLASH - PARKING GARAGE:
          .we smash cut to a BUSINESSMAN walking to his car just
          as the Butcher comes up behind him and performs the exact
          same move he was just demonstrating. Just as quickly,
          we...

          FLASH - BACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:
          .and the Butcher performs the next move...

          THE BUTCHER -
          To slice the diaphragm, first whip your
          wrist into the target's trachea to
          prevent screaming, then drive the knife
          at a forty-five degree angle upward just
          below the rib cage.
          Just as the knife hits the side of beef, we smash cut
          to...

          FLASH - LUXURY HOTEL SUITE:
          . a DRUG KINGPIN coming out of his hotel bathroom
          wearing a bathrobe. Suddenly the Butcher is on him,
          performing what he just described on this poor bastard,
          who can no longer scream because he's missing his
          trachea, and just as quickly...

          FLASH - BACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:
          .we are right back to the hanging side of beef as the
          Butcher performs the next move...

          THE BUTCHER
          If you want the jugular, pull your
          enemy's head to the left and jab your
          knife well into his sterno-cleio-
          mastoideus muscle, here, then cut down
          and left.
          Just like before, we smash cut to...

          FLASH - DIRTY ALLEY:
          ...a MAN moseying down an alley, carrying a briefcase,
          when suddenly, the Butcher comes out of nowhere, pulls
          the enemy's head to the left and then WHAM!, jabs the
          knife into the neck, matching the move-he was just
          demonstrating.

          

          

          

          

          38.

          7 FLASH - HACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:
          The butcher continues to hack away at the hanging meat,
          describing more and more ways to kill with a blade...

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          They never show you this shit on the
          McDonald's commercials.
          .. as the CAMERA FINDS Wesley, who is completely absorbed
          in the lesson. The Butcher hands him the knife, and
          Wesley starts to make his first chops at it, wanting to
          please the Butcher, wanting to get it right...

          EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - NIGHT

          Fox is seated at a small outdoor cafe, sipping on a
          latte, reading the paper. There's a story about the
          death threats to Henry Helms on the front page.
          Just then Wesley approaches, his face splattered with
          flecks of blood. She wipes his face with a napkin.

          FOX
          You haven't quite figured out this whole
          "blending in" thing, yet. Let's go.

          EXT. MORGUE - NIGHT

          A huge Chevy 4X4 pulls up and Fox hope out from behind
          the wheel, followed by Wesley. They get to the door and
          Fox pulls out a metal device to pick the lock.

          WESLEY
          What is this?

          FOX
          This...
          She picks the lock and they step inside...

          INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

           the empty morgue examining room. Empty except for a
          d d ozen dead b s laid out on slabs, covered by white
          sheets.

          FOX
          This is the Roach Motel, Wesley.
          Wesley looks around, disgusted.

          

          

          

          

          39.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          All right, find us some skinny bitches.
          Wesley uncovers the first body... it's a. black male.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Nahh, let the brother rest. Find us some
          white meat. And nothing too fat.
          Wesley covers the black male and moves over to a second
          body. He unveils it to reveal... what looks like a dead
          suburban housewife.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Perfect. Load up soccer mom.

          INT. TARGET ROOM - NIGHT

          Fox and Sloan stand next to a paper target -- the kind of
          thing you see in a police target range. It shows the
          outline of a head and torso with concentric rings for
          where you're supposed to aim.
          The Gunsmith hoists the corpse of the dead soccer mom on
          to a hook that hangs ten feet in front of the paper
          target. Sloan flips a switch and a motor takes the mom
          and target to the end of the range.
          The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Wesley is with them
          standing in one of those firearm booths at the opposite
          end of the range.

          SLOAN
          Selecting your weapon and then disposing
          of it is the most pivotal aspect of every
          assassination.
          An array of firearms are on a shelf next to Wesley.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          Pick one.
          Wesley eyes all the weaponry. Finally, he settles on a
          short-barreled black handgun. Sloan takes it from him
          and inspects it.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          Excellent. This is an Imanishi 18. It
          holds seventeen bullets in the clip and
          one in the chamber. It's made of a
          composite material unrecognizable by
          metal detectors.

          40.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          And the Imanishi's bullets have
          microchips that communicate with similar
          ones in the gun.

          WESLEY
          Computer chips?

          SLOAN

          (NODS)
          Sometimes the closest distance between
          two points is not a straight line. What
          if soccer mom here is between you and
          your target?

          WESLEY
          I suppose you're going to tell me to
          shoot her first.

          SLOAN
          How'd you do in Physics class?

          WESLEY
          Mostly B's.
          Fox cocks her head at Wesley, knows he's lying.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Okay, I got a D.

          SLOAN
          Why?

          WESLEY
          I couldn't remember all the rules --

          SLOAN
          That's it. Rules. What if I told you
          there weren't any?
          He nods at Wesley, like he's on to something.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          People live by the rules set before them.
          We take them on faith that they are
          right. But how many times in your life
          have you thought you had a better way,
          against-the rules that was simply laughed
          at.

          WESLEY
          Every day.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          SLOAN
          Because you use your brain differently
          than other people. All Fraternity
          members do.

          WESLEY
          I don't get it.

          SLOAN
          Humans use neurons to think. But most
          people can only handle a small percentage
          of those neurons firing at once without
          suffering a seizure or an aneurism. Not
          us. And not you. We have the ability to
          think differently than other people.

          WESLEY
          So we set our own rules.

          SLOAN
          That's right.
          Sloan hands him back the weapon.

          SLOAN (CONT'D
          Try it.
          Wesley aims the pistol at the target in front of him. He

          FIRES...
          ..and the bullet plugs soccer mom in the shoulder.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          Have you ever shot a gun before?

          WESLEY
          Just the flies.

          SLOAN
          So you have no pre-conceived habits we
          need to break. Shoot the target. Don't
          hit mom.

          WESLEY
          You mean curve the bullet? How?

          SLOAN
          This isn't about "how." It's about
          "what." If you'd never been told a
          bullet flies straight and I handed you
          this and said hit that target... what
          would you do? Allow your instincts to
          guide you. Just like the flies.

          42.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          The technology is only here to assist
          your natural instinct.
          Wesley lifts the gun, his mind racing...

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          It's not 'will' that makes the physical
          react how we wish, it's 'control.' You
          are in control...

          BAM BAM BAM!
          The bullets blast out of the gun, like they are on a
          track set up by Wesley's brain. He flicks his wrists
          and...
          .they arc qUickly, Just missing the body i e th2
          center of the target!
          Sloan smiles.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          Rules are made to be broken, Wesley. No
          one was better at that than your father.
          He had a pair of pearl-handled revolvers
          with which he could conduct a symphony.
          L i
          Wesley nods proudly, and squeezes off some more shots,
          all chasing through the same hole in the target.

          INT. WESLEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Cathy jumps up from the couch when Wesley comes in.

          CATHY
          Oh my god, Wesley, where have you been?
          I've been so worried!
          But Wesley just pushes past her and starts to throw
          clothes out of drawers into a black duffel bag.

          CATHY (CONT'D)
          What're you doing? Are you leaving? You
          .owe rent!
          But Wesley just keeps packing.

          CATHY (CONT'D)
          You can't leave! This is bullshit,
          Wesley. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

          

          

          

          

          43.
          Wesley just zips up his bag and turns back toward the
          door...
          .where Egx is now standing, wearing outf' that
          would make the devil blush.

          CATHY (CONT'D)
          Who the fuck are you?
          But Fox doesn't even acknowledge her presence, and just
          watches Wesley do his business.
          Wesley walks out the door and Fox follows. Cathy chases
          them out on to the landing...

          CATHY (CONT'D)
          You're nothing, Wesley! And you will
          always be nothing! You think you're
          gonna be happy.with that skank...
          Uh-oh...
          Fox stops and turns around -- fisting her pistols.
          She unloads... BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!
          The CAMERA SWINGS OVER TO CATHY, who is about to pies
          herself, standing in the door frame, with bullet holes
          placed expertly around her head.
          Wesley and Fox keep moving, down the steps. Barry is
          coming up the steps, but he takes one look at them, does
          a U-turn and hurries out of their path.

          INT. FOX'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

          Wesley tosses his bag into the corner of this
          immaculately furnished penthouse apartment, overlooking
          the skyline.

          FOX
          You can take the couch until we find you
          someplace better.

          WESLEY
          Okay.
          She moves toward a separate bedroom.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Fox?
          She stops.

          

          

          

          

          44.

          C WESLEY (CONT'D)
          What was my father like?
          For a moment, she thinks about it. Then...

          FOX
          Come on.

          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

          They walk down a downtown lane, buildings crowding in on
          them from all-sides. Not too many people are out this
          late; they have the sidewalk to themselves.

          FOX
          Your father lov ed you, Wesley. He talked
          about you all the time.

          WESLEY
          Really?
          Wesley looks at her hopefully. She smiles, thinking
          about the past.

          FOX
          That's a fact. He knew he wasn't
          supposed to, but he couldn't help it.

          WESLEY
          You worked with him?

          FOX

          (NODS)
          He trained me. Made me what I am.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

          A younger, greener Fox stands alone in the alley, eyes
          scanning the rooftops.

          FOX (V.0.)
          I remember one night he had me on my own
          .for the first time, and I was tagging
          this target named Buster Burgess. But I
          was green and clumsy and stupid. Buster
          marked me and disappeared into this old
          tenement building.

          

          

          

          

          45.

          (-. EXT. TENEMENT ROOFTOP - SAME - FLASHBACK

          A shadowy figure creeps to the edge of the building and
          looks down. We can't quite make out his face. Fox is
          looking the other way and he's got a clean shot.
          He raises a rifle to his eye...

          BAM!
          He nails Fox in the thigh, and she falls helpless to the
          pavement.

          FOX (V.0.)
          Motherfucker shot mein the leg. Put a
          damn hole in my favorite skirt.
          The figure re-aims, ready to take out the helpless Fox.

          FOX (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Then you know what happened?

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          My father saved your life? Put a bullet
          in Burgess?
          k,

          FOX (V.0.)
          Naww. I ended up with four more slugs in
          me.
          The figure unleashes four more shots.

          BACK TO:

          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

          They turn a corner and head up into the lobby of a tall
          building, their conversation continuing...

          WESLEY
          What kind of training is that?

          FOX
          I'm here, aren't I?

          INSIDE THE LOBBY:
          Wesley weighs all this, puts it together.

          WESLEY
          My father was Burgess, wasn't he?
          Fox nods, smiling. They step...

          

          

          

          

          46.

          INSIDE AN ELEVATOR:
          .andstart riding it up.

          FOX
          He didn't hit me anywhere important, and
          he used pin-shot bullets that didn't do
          any real damage. But you can be damn
          sure I don't let any mark get the high
          ground on me again.
          Shesmiles at another thought.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          And you know what we did instead of go to
          the hospital to stitch me up?

          WESLEY
          What?

          FOX
          We went driving.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT - FLASHBACK

          A PORSCHE SHOWROOM sits on the corner. SMASH! A black
          911 convertible breaks through the glass and skids to a
          stop next to Fox in the street.
          Two hands pull her up and drop her in the passenger seat,
          and the car roars off.

          BACK TO:

          EXT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

          Wesley smiles. The elevator DINGS.

          EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

          Fox and Wesley step out on to the rooftop where Mr. X was
          gunned down.

          WESLEY
          What's this?

          FOX
          This is where your father was killed.
          Wesley's eyes narrow and he looks around, taking it all
          in.

          

          

          

          

          47.

          WESLEY
          How?

          FOX
          We're not sure. The fence he was meeting
          was shot in the head... which led him out
          to here... but it must've been a set-up
          all along. All I know is it would take a
          hell of a trap to bring your father down.
          Wesley crouches down by where his father's body would
          have been, running his fingers over the gravel rooftop.

          WESLEY
          My whole life I thought he was dead. I
          shouldn't feel any differently just
          because it happened 20 years later.

          FOX
          But...

          WESLEY
          But, I do. Like I missed my one chance.

          FOX
          Well that's why you're here. To make up
          for lost time.
          Wesley looks back at her.

          WESLEY
          Can I see his body?

          CUT TO:

          INT. SHITTY MORGUE - NIGHT

          They stand in a dark corner of a decrepit morgue, where a
          couple of urns rest on a counter. The place doesn't look
          like much more than a crack-house.

          FOX
          We cremate our dead. I'd like to say
          it's to honor them, but it's mainly to
          keep anyone from identifying them after
          they're gone.

          WESLEY
          These are my father's ashes?

          FOX
          Yeah.

          

          

          

          

          48.

          WESLEY
          Sloan said his heart stopped but there
          was no entry wound?

          FOX
          That's right.

          WESLEY
          Can I have a minute?

          FOX
          Sure.
          She leaves and Wesley approaches the urn holding his
          father's'remains.
          He runs his finger over it, and just when we think he's
          going to have an emotional moment...'
          ..he smashes the urn on to the stand, the ashes spilling
          out everywhere.
          Wesley runs his fingers through the decay: what a
          mess... there are pieces of bone intermingled in the
          cremains.
          But then hisfingegs find something in the dust... a
          BULLET with a hole running down its center. He holds it
          up to the light for a closer look.
          As he studies it, we start to hear... WHAM! WHAMI...

          INT. SMALL ROOM - DAY


          WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
          Wesley site with his hands tied behind his back, taking
          another beating from The Pharmacist, who spouts
          assassination techniques while he pummels Wesley.

          THE PHARMACIST
          If you get in the hoo-ha of a two on one
          and find yourself the one, remember that
          each foe will likely move at the same
          steady speed away from each other,
          allowing you to keep a gun on each.

          WHAM! WHAM!

          THE PHARMACIST (CONT'D)
          Now, if you find yourself one ' on three,
          that poses a real bit a' ball ache...

          

          

          

          

          49.
          The sound of the Pharmacist's voice fades to the
          background as Wesley's voice-over comes up...

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          There are two kinds of pain. One is an
          object. A living thing that crawls
          around the outside of your body. Cuts,
          broken bones, bruises... all deliver the
          kind of pain you can learn to ignore, and
          they soon disappear to nothing but the
          sound of a gnat in your ear.
          Wesley's eyes are starting to lose consciousness.

          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I've lived with a different kind of pain
          all my life... the kind that comes from
          two decades of being passed over, pushed
          around, ignored. But you can't hide from
          that kind of pain either...
          Wesley takes a brutal shot to the face.

          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          .because it finds you.
          He involuntarily spite blood as his eyes roll back in his
          head.

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

          Sloan sits across from Wesley at a skinny table in an
          otherwise bare room.

          SLOAN
          Watch the eyes. Look for a slight
          swelling of the pupil. You can train
          your body to stay a constant temperature,
          you can control your heartbeat, but you
          can't control the center of your eyes.
          That's how you know when someone is lying
          to you.
          Sloan looks right at him. Wesley narrows his eyes,
          trying to fend off his stare.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          Do you want to fuck Fox?

          WESLEY
          No.

          

          

          

          

          50.

          SLOAN
          I know that's a lie without even seeing
          your eyes.

          WESLEY
          Fine. Try something else.

          SLOAN
          Okay. What are you hiding from me?
          Wesley looks down, then focuses on Sloan.

          WESLEY
          Nothing.
          Sloan waits. Wesley realizes it's useless to try to keep
          something from this man. He reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out the bullet with the hole in its center...
          places it on the table.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          You told me to hunt down my father's
          killer. That's what I'm doing.

          SLOAN
          What's this?

          WESLEY
          The bullet that killed him. You said his
          heart stopped but there was no entrance
          wound. This bullet has a hole cut into
          its center...

          SLOAN
          Yes?

          WESLEY
          You know how a mole buries into the earth
          by pushing the dirt back around it? I
          think this bullet does what the mole
          does... Splits the skin and pushes it
          back through its center, filling the
          space it just passed through.
          Sloan looks at him, like he might have been
          underestimating him until now.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Fox was telling me that my father used
          special bullets. It looks like Cross
          does too... which means these are custom
          made. If we find who makes them, then we
          find someone who has access to Cross.

          

          

          

          

          51.
          Sloan picks up the bullet and leans back.

          SLOAN
          You put this all together on your own?
          Wesley taps his head.

          WESLEY
          Firing neurons.

          (BEAT)
          Whatever happened to my father's guns?
          The pearl handled ones?

          SLOAN
          Don't know. But whoever has them isn't
          long for this place.
          Sloan reaches down and picks up a binder which he drops
          on the desk.

          WESLEY
          What's that?

          SLOAN
          Cross. The details of his life.
          q Continue your hunt.

          WESLEY
          No rules, right?
          This stops Sloan for a second.

          SLOAN
          No rules.

          INT. FOX'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

          Wesley lies on Fox's couch, trying his damndest not to
          peek at her through her bedroom door. It's cracked just
          enough that he can see her draping a towel around her
          body as she heads to take a shower.
          Wesley site up and looks at the binder sitting on the
          table. Slowly he opens it and sees a picture of Cross
          staring back at him. The man who took Wesley's father
          from him.
          Wesley studies the face, wanting to know every detail.

          

          

          

          

          52.

          IN THE BATHROOM:
          Fox peers out the door and looks at Wesley, watching him
          absorb more of Cross with every page.

          CUT TO:

          INT. LIBRARY - DAY

          Sloan leads Wesley into a gigantic room lined from floor
          to ceiling with leather-bound books.

          SLOAN
          We keep a record of every assassination
          mission, going back to the Ides of March.
          Maps, diagrams, logistics, complications,
          weapons of choice... it's all there.
          Wesley nods, impressed. Sloan just keeps leading him
          through a set of double doors, into...

          INT. MAP ROOM -- DAY

          .a large room, the size of an auditorium. On the floor
          is a gigantic model of the entire city, built to scale,
          showing all the buildings, skyscrapers, churches, the
          waterfront, the city streets. Everything the city has to
          offer laid out in miniature.
          Sloan and Wesley stand like giants in the middle of the
          model city...

          WESLEY
          What's all this?

          SLOAN
          Where we plot our local hits. This city
          is one of the Fraternity's major
          headquarters.

          WESLEY
          (looking around)
          This room. The books. Seems low-tech.

          SLOAN
          Part of mastering technology is knowing
          when to use it. Models can't be hacked.
          Your father built this room himself.
          Most of the buildings are white, but interspersed amongst
          them are a few vainted red. Some of the model street
          lamps are also red.

          

          

          

          

          53.
          The color red appears sporadically throughout the entire
          model city: on the sides of buildings, on mailboxes, on
          some of the manhole covers.

          WESLEY
          What's with the red ones?
          Sloan just smiles...
          .and THE CAMERA MOVES TO HIS FEET, then PUSHES'IN on
          one particular street on the map, further in on one RED
          STREETLIGHT and we...

          DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          .the s city street, now full-sized, buzzing with
          activity, pedestrians hurrying to work, cars and taxis
          and trucks whizzing through the street.
          Sloan and Wesley walk down the sidewalk, passing
          streetlight after streetlight until they reach one in
          particular.

          SLOAN
          The Fraternity's grasp reaches every
          facet of the world's major cities,
          including their construction. Look at
          this streetlight.
          Wesley peers at it... there is a plaque affixed to the
          pole... the standard thing you find on these things...
          "Municipal C. W. 63070."
          But then there is something different on this one... a
          tiny symbol on the bottom of the plaque... the Cerberus
          instead of the seal of the cit
          Sloan presses the symbol and the plaque slides aside,
          revealing a hollow space behind it. He reaches his hand
          inside and pulls out a small handgun... flips out the
          clip expertly, then racks the weapon.
          Wesley can't believe it.

          WESLEY
          You have stashes...

          SLOAN
          .everywhere.

          WESLEY
          Jesus.

          

          

          

          

          54.
          Just then, two POLICE OFFICERS walk by, eye.the gun Sloan
          has pulled out.

          POLICE OFFICER
          Sir...
          Sloan flashes his tattoo at them.

          SLOAN
          Keep moving, fellas.
          They nod and do just that.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          They let us do our jobs, we let them
          live.
          THE CAMERA PUSHES IN on Wesley's face as he realizes the
          full scope of this organization and we...

          DISSOLVE TO:

          SERIES OF SHOTS:
          GUN RANGE. Wesley firing his Imanishi 18 on the shooting
          range, steering the bullets wherever he wants them to go.

          WESLEY
          Closer.
          Impressed, the Gunsmith moves the corpse closer to the
          target, making the angle all that much tougher.
          Wesley gets ready to squeeze his trigger, but a pistol
          starts FIRING next to him.
          He looks over... Sloan is standing nr= &o him, firing at
          the target. Every shot bends around the body and hits
          right in the forehead of the target.
          Wesley smiles, impressed.
          LIBRARY. Wesley thumbs through an old Fraternity book,
          which has detailed sketches of an assassination in 17th
          century Paris.
          MEAT LOCKER. Wesley working out on a heavy bag, honing
          his punches, the Chef holding the bag for him, muscles
          rippling.
          MAP ROOM. Wesley walks by himself amongst the miniature
          city, trying to memorize where the red marks are.

          

          

          

          

          55.
          INTERROGATION ROOM. Wesley sitting here,. being grilled
          by Sloan, as he tries to-tell the undetectable lie.

          SLOAN
          Our job isn't just about how fast or true
          you shoot, Wesley. Physical agility will
          always lose to mental agility. It's
          warfare of the mind.
          FO 'S APART. Wesley looking at Fox through the
          bedroom door.

          art of knife play.
          MAP ROOM. The Gardener and Fox show Wesley the rooftop
          of a certain building on the model city, one corner of
          the roof painted red.
          ROOFTOP. Fox and the Gardener now with Wesley on that
          actual rooftop, pointing out firing angles, modes. of
          ascension, and escape routes. The Gardener moves over to
          a cornerstone in the roof of the building and then easily
          lifts it off, revealing a stash of assault rifles.
          k SHOOTING G . Wesley looking at some ammunition while
          the Gunsmith talks and demonstrates. He fires at one of
          the targets, which EXPLODES in a splattered mess and we
          cut to...

          INT. FOX'S PENTHOUSE - MORNING

          Fox making coffee as Wesley sits, studying the binder,
          his mind racing.

          WESLEY
          Cross and my father were tight. But
          Cross thought he should be one of the
          heads of the Fraternity so he left and
          vowed to kill the three heads. Which
          means my father is dead because of petty
          jealousy.

          FOX
          More reason for Cross to die.
          Wesley flips to the picture of cross.

          WESLEY
          But I don't see jealousy in those eyes,
          do you?
          Fox walks over and slams the binder shut.

          

          

          

          

          56.

          FOX
          Listen .to me, Wesley. In two weeks, we
          have to kill Henry Helms. Do-you know
          who that is?

          WESLEY
          The journalist who's got a price-tag on
          his head.

          FOX
          A price-tag that we're going to collect.
          Your father was meeting with a fence
          about the job when Cross took him down.
          So we can only assume Cross knows about
          the target too. We... you... have to
          take Cross out before we prosecute this
          mission. We can't have him out there as
          a wildcard, wreaking havoc, do you
          understand?

          WESLEY
          Yeah.

          FOX
          We've never defaulted on a job and this
          1k one won't be the first.

          INT. TARGET ROOM - DAY

          Sloan fires at the target, the bullets following his
          every command. Wesley does the same, equally skilled.
          Fox sits, watching the two of them. Is it becoming
          competitive? One shoots and then the other follows,
          neither one ever missing.
          Finally, Gunsmith runs the target back in to change out
          the body.
          Fox leans back, impressed.

          FOX
          May have found your match, Sloan.
          Sloan smirks and turns to instruct Wesley.

          SLOAN
          Pick the weapon, make the kill, destroy
          the weapon. No other rules.
          Wesley nods as Gunsmith returns.

          

          

          

          

          57.

          WESLEY
          (to the Gunsmith)
          Close the gap. Push the body closer to
          the target..

          THE GUNSMITH
          It's already at four feet.

          WESLEY
          Closer.

          THE GUNSMITH
          Here's two. Your father couldn't even do
          that.

          WESLEY
          Closer.

          THE GUNSMITH
          Wesley, at some point --

          WESLEY
          Closer. I'll say when.

          WN
          Gunsmith starts sliding the target closer to the body,
          until it's actually touching the back of the dead
          business man!

          THE GUNSMITH
          How you gonna -- ?

          FOX
          Just run it out there. Let the kid work.
          The Gunsmith shrugs and runs the target down the range.
          Wesley looks at Sloan.

          WESLEY
          You wanna go first?

          SLOAN
          There are limits to everything, Wesley.
          At some point the body becomes a shield.
          Wesley pulls his gun and lets loose five rounds,
          lightning fast.
          The Gunsmith brings the target back to them...
          ..a the business man is riddled with es.

          THE GUNSMITH
          I guess not every rule can be broken.

          

          

          

          

          58.

          WESLEY
          Check the target.
          The Gunsmith does and we see that each of the five
          bullets has passed clean through the cadaver and found
          it's mark on the target.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          You'll find one entry below the shoulder,
          missing the major blood vessels there,
          exiting the back. Second shot went
          through the abdomen, clipped only the
          bowel and exited cleanly. Third hit the
          upper right quadrant of the abdomen,
          which is partially protected by the
          ribcage, and passed through the liver and
          probably part of the gallbladder. Upper
          left abdomen is a good place, where
          number four ruptured the spleen before
          continuing down main street. And
          finally, what I like to call "the ,7FK."
          Number five entered the mouth, was
          redirected downward by the upper jawbone
          ON, and exited the back of the neck. That's
          the shot you'll find in the middle of the
          target.
          Gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle of the target.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          (to Sloan)
          Fuck the rules.
          With that, he turns and walks away, a look on his face
          that is his fiercest, a far cry from the kid in the
          cubicle. That same expression is on his face as we...

          CUT TO:

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

          Wesley strains against the ropes that bind his hands as
          The Pharmacist waylays him. But is t' e. Wesley counts
          out the punches as he takes the shots.

          WESLEY
          One!
          There is a look in Wesley's eye we, haven't seen before, a
          burning, searing fire.
          As he continues to take punches and count them out...

          

          

          

          

          59.

           WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Two! (WHAM!) Three! (WHAM!) Four!

          (WHAM!) FIVE!! (WHAM!!)
          ..he pulls his arms tight, and his muscles start to
          twitch and bulge -- muscles we didn't know he had until.
          now -- and as he continues to take punches, WHAM!, WHAM!,
          WHAM!!, the rope strains against the wooden chair, and we
          can HEAR the wooden legs start to pop, until...
          CRACK!!! Wesley Jerks his arms ee and comes
          swillcrincr with the broken of leg of the chair.
          SMASH! SMASH!! The Pharmacist goes down hard and Wesley
          stands over him, out of control,. furious, SMASH! SMASH!,
          beating him with that broken chair leg.
          The CAMERA PUSHES THOUGH one of the walls...

          OBSERVATION ROOM:
          .. to where Fox and Sloan are watching Wesley pummel the
          pummeler through a one-way mirror.

          SLOAN
          He's ready.
          the los2k on Fox's face becomes more and more and
          sexual until...

          INT. FOX'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

          ..she leans on top of Wesley, straddling him on too of
          her bed.
          They unleash on each other, and from the looks of it, Fox
          makes Cathy seem like a nun.

          FOX
          Don't you quit now, baby! Don't you quit
          now!!
          Wesley didn't know it could be like this.
          After they finish, Fox gets up and heads to the shower
          and he watches her go the whole way.
          In the doorway, she turns around...

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Sloan says you're ready.

          INT. TATTOO ROOM - DAY

          Wesley site in a chair as Fox crouches next to him with
          an advanced tattoo machine, inking his hand.

          WESLEY
          Do you like being the only chick in the
          Fraternity?

          FOX

          (COYLY)
          Who said I was the only sister? Maybe
          you just haven't met any others yet.
          Wesley laughs.

          WESLEY
          (playfully back)
          Maybe I have and I'm just not telling
          you.

          FOX

          (GRINNING)
          Hold still.
          He settles down.

          WESLEY
          How did you end up here, Fox?

          FOX
          Same way you did, sugar. They found me.

          WESLEY
          What did you do before?
          Fox looks at him, a wry smile on her face.

          FOX
          Sold perfume. At the mall.

          WESLEY
          No shit?

          FOX
          No shit.

          WESLEY
          I can't see it.

          FOX
          Get in line.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          WESLEY
          What made them come after you? I mean, I
          know why I'm here.

          FOX
          Fraternity members all have something in
          their lineage that shows they'll be good
          at this.

          WESLEY
          And yours is?

          FOX
          My great-great-great-grandfather on my
          mother's side. He was on a slave ship
          coming over from East Africa and as it
          was pulling into Charleston, he killed
          every white man on the ship and swam to
          shore. They caught him and hung him four
          days later.

          WESLEY
          That's terrible.

          FOX
          I Nah. Motherfucker deserved it. Be raped
          eight women in those four days. One of
          them was my great-great-great-grandmama.
          She pushes her chair back, done with her work.
          The CAMERA PUSHES IN as Fox removes the device so we can
          take a look: the three-headed dog has been tattooed into
          his hand.

          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

          Wesley and Fox walk down a crowded urban city street. The
          CAMERA finds Wesley's tattoo and then moves around behind
          Fox and holds on hers.

          WESLEY
          Where's the Diablo?

          FOX

          (SHRUGS)
          I got tired of the color.
          Wesley can't help but smile, then Fox stops. They're
          standing right in front of a CAR SHOWROOM, displayed in
          the window is a MIDNIGHT BLACK PORSCHE 911 convertible
          sitting in a showroom window... 'us like the one
          Wesley's father smashed in Fox's story.

          

          

          

          

          62.

          EXT. SHOWROOM - NIGHT

          Suddenly, the car comes flying out of the window, glass
          shattering everywhere as it tears up the street.

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          Being a member of the Fraternity was like
          winning the lottery...

          ON THE CITY STREETS:
          Traffic lights mean nothing, as Wesley mashes the
          accelerator to the mat, and the Porsche responds, ripping
          up the road like a tiger on the prowl.
          Fox rises up in the passenger seat, looking over the
          windshield, the wind whipping her face...

          WESLEY.(V.0.)
          This... this is what my dad's life was
          like. He was a fucking god.
          He weaves in and out of traffic, then rips around a
          corner, narrowly cutting in front of an eighteen-wheeler,
          which has to slam on its brakes.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Where we headed?

          FOX
          Trial by fire, sugar. Hook a right.
          Wesley whips the car around a corner...

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Park it here, baby.
          He pulls the car to the side of the street...
          .in front of a busy outdoor mall. It's covered with
          shops, eateries, movie theaters and people, people,
          people.
          Fox eyes the crowd.

          WESLEY
          You need a new wardrobe or something?

          FOX
          we're here for a reason and it ain't
          clothes-shopping. Somewhere in that
          crowd is your first target.

          

          

          

          

          63.

          WESLEY
          A test?

          FOX
          (shakes her head)
          The real thing.

          WESLEY
          Who's the mark?

          FOX
          You'll know him when you see him.

          WESLEY
          What if I don't?

          FOX
          Then you get shot.
          Fox hands him his Imanishi pistol, which Wesley rolls
          over in his hand.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          It's graduation day, baby.
          I He nods and makes his way toward...

          THE OUTDOOR MALL:
          .where he quickly mingles with the crowd. He has his
          hands tucked into the front pocket of his hooded-
          sweatshirt, the pistol inside. People pass him on his
          left and right, some make eye contact, some don't...
          anybody could be the target..
          Wesley's eyes scan to the rooftops, surveying... the
          SECURITY GUARD by the theater, the SWEATER-FOLDER at The
          Gap, the SCARY-LOOKING GUY shopping at the sunglasses
          stand.
          And then Wesley's eyes settle on someone he was not
          expecting to see... Barry, his best friend that was
          shagging his girlfriend... is thumbing through books
          outside the BARNES AND NOBLE... seemingly. not paying
          attention to what's around him.
          Wesley can't believe it. It can't be him. Can it?
          Just then, Barry stops looking at the books and starts
          walking toward Wesley, keeping his eyes down. Fuck, this
          can't really be happening...

          

          

          

          

          64.
          ..Wesley gets ready, both hands inside that front
          pocket...
          .and now Barry meets his eyes... still coming... still
          coming...

          BARRY
          Wesley... hey dude.
          Wesley can't believe itl

          BARRY (CONT'D)
          Thanks for calling me. I wanted to
          say...
          Wesley pulls out his gun and Barry throws up his hands...

          BARRY (CONT'D)
          Whoa, man!!
          But now we see Wesley is looking past B_arry. over his
          shoulder...

          WESLEY
          Get down!
          .and he's looking at a man we recognize from his
          office... The Consultant.
          He's approaching rapidly behind Barry, fisting a 'pair of
          pistols!
          Just as Barry hits the deck, Wesley pulls the trigger...
          .but it lust CLICKS, the chamber empty...

          SMASH CUT TO:

          THE PORSCHE:
          Fox holds the clip to Wesley's Imanishi, tapping it in
          her hand. Holy shit, she gave him an empty gun...

          SMASH BACK TO:

          THE OUTDOOR MALL:
          Wesley can't believe his gun is empty. In the split-
          second that it takes him to realize this, the Consultant
          has his guns leveled, taking aim, but...

          

          

          

          

          65.
          ...Wesley moves faster than we thought he could move...
          he darts behind a kiosk hocking monogrammed apparel, and
          dashes full speed through the crowds lining the street.
          The Consultant chases after him, knocking shoppers out of
          the way, sending fanny packs and Nordstrom bags flying.
          Wesley hooks a right around a SHARPER IMAGE and heads
          straight down a narrower section, like he's on a mission,
          knowing exactly where he's going. And now we see why...
          Because the city around us goes stark white like the Mg
          Room. We're seeing what Wesley sees, what he's memorized
          in all those hours staring at the model. Finally we see
          one SMALL BENCH next to a fountain, which is bright red.
          Immediately the natural color of the city c2 Ws back and
          Wesley is running all out for that bench. He goes into a
          slide, hitting the grass .underneath the bench, sliding
          under it, popping up on the other side.
          He rips a metal panel off the back of it as he does,
          revealing an AUTOMATIC PISTOL...
          .and just as quickly, he's up on one knee, aiming,
          using the bench as a shield as the Consultant rushes up,
          surprised and BAM! BAM! BAM:
          The Consultant drops where he is, three bullets hitting
          him in his two shoulders and his chest.
          People start SCREAMING and RUNNING the hell away from the
          gunplay. Wesley is about to run away himself, but when
          he turns, Fox is right there beside him... smiling. A
          couple of SECURITY GUARDS are with her, smiling as well.
          Wesley looks over at The Consultant, who site up, smiling
          too, even though he's bleeding from three spots on his
          body...

          FOX
          Pin shot bullets.
          Wesley looks down at the gun.

          WESLEY
          Just like my father used on you.
          Fox nods, as the Security Guards go to help the
          Consultant to his feet.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          You were watching me in the office.

          Wesley and Fox walk down a long hallway toward a single
          doorway. They open it, revealing...

          INT. SLOAN'S OFFICE - DAY

          . a large office with a single desk and a roaring fire.
          Sloan turns from the fire to greet them.
          He holds up the "mole" bullet, and smiles.

          SLOAN
          The mole bullet is made by a midget
          t Filipino named Pek War. His fingers are
          so small that they can shape and smooth
          the metal better than anyone.

          WESLEY
          You've known all along. You knew before
          I ever broke the urn...

          SLOAN
          I had to let you figure it out for
          yourself.

          A three-foot-seven-inch Asian man site at a worktable
          with his little legs dangling over the end of his chair.
          PEK.WAR is concentrating hard on the metal in his hands.
          The diminutive man looks up from his worktable when he
          hears a loud THUMP.

          PEX WAR
          Andey?
          He gets no answer. He remains perfectly still,
          listening.

          Andey?l
          Two louder THUMPS and a GUNSHOT jerk his head around.
          Then he's up out of the chair, faster than we thought a
          little man could move.
          Breathing ragged, shimmying across his work space, Pek
          War hurries over to a chest of drawers.
          He gets to it and throws open the bottom drawer to reveal
          a stash of handguns. He reaches for one...
          ...but the muzzle off a pistol comes _ uE to the back of his
          head and the hammer clicks as it is pulled back.
          Pek War throws his hands up.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          See I've learned a thing or two about
          human anatomy recently. In fact, this
          blade is stuck just beneath the coastal
          cartilage of your tenth rib. Just a
          little push and it will deflate your
          lung. That's called a pneumothorax.
          V Helluva way to go, suffocating in a'room
          full of fresh air. Plus the sound, the
          sound of all that oxygen hissing out of
          your lung... pssssssh, like a balloon at

          Wesley, you gotta know something. No
          matter what kind of training you've done
          these last few weeks, killing your first,
          well that's gonna change you forever.
          Wesley drives for a while. Then...

          WESLEY
          You know what my foster mother. told me
          when I was six years old?
          Fox shakes her head.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          She caught me eating some jello out of
          the fridge after my bedtime. I knew I
          wasn't supposed to but I was so damn
          hungry, and it was just some fucking
          jello. Anyway, after she hit me so hard
          I couldn't bite down straight for a week,
          she told me... she told me that God had
          killed my parents because I was such a
          wicked boy.

          FOX
          Jesus. Someone needs to find that bitch
          and set her straight.

          WESLEY
          So I grew up thinking I was the reason I
          never knew my parents. But now, to find
          out, that no, my father didn't give me up
          because he had died... he gave me up
          because he was Protecting me... well I
          guess I want to give him something back.

          EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

          They are surrounded by industrial looking warehouses, one
          of which has the words Times-Herald on it. Newspaper
          delivery TRUCKS make their way in and out of the loading
          dock area of this building.
          Overhead, an EL TRAIN scrapes along the worn tracks.
          Fox pulls around a corner and back into an alley, so they
          can have a view of the corner in front of them.
          Wesley scans the area quickly.

          WESLEY
          Not very discreet, are they?
          Fox smiles knowingly, and looks up, revealing what Wesley
          is talking about. On various rooftops we-see FIGURES
          peering down. looking over the site.

          FOX
          The others are only backup singers. This
          is your show.
          Fox subtly moves her head and figures disappear,
          crouching down.
          Just then, out the windshield, they see a MAN wearing a
          long black overcoat approaching the corner near the
          newspaper building.
          Fox's eyes start to dance.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Remember: he's good, baby. But you're
          the best I've ever seen.
          Wesley nods and the two of them step out of the car.

          IN THE STREET:
          From a distance, Wesley approaches Cross from the back.
          His steps become quicker, getting closer every passing
          second. Wesley starts to reach in his coat for his
          gun...
          .and that's when Cross firesl Quick as lightning,
          Cross has guns out and lets loose toward the roof of a
          nearby warehouse.

          

          

          

          

          72.
          His bullet has the instincts of a bird dog, and it curves
          over the edge of the building and finds its mark, causing
          a crouching ASSASSIN to plunge from the roof to the
          street near Wesley!
          The others on the rooftops hail down bullets as Cross
          disappears into the nearest building, the Times-Herald.
          Wesley and Fox run toward the building as three other
          Fraternity members beat them there, the BELLMAN, the
          WAITER, and the ELECTRICIAN.
          Wesley sees them congregate on the loading dock and then
          start inside the building...

          WESLEY
          No!
          The minute Bellman exposes himself in the open loading
          dock door he is cut down from inside, his bloody body
          falling backwards into a newspaper truck parked at the
          dock.
          Wesley and Fox join the other two on the dock as
          screaming WORKERS run from the place.

          WAITER
          We need a way in there.

          ELECTRICIAN
          Let's find another door.

          WESLEY
          He'll be long gone by then.

          FOX
          (shaking her head)
          He's got the high ground.
          Wesley sees an unmanned forklift on the dock.

          WESLEY
          On the pallet.
          They all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the
          lift. Wesley throws the machine in reverse and it backs
          into the warehouse, the four assassins safely crouching
          on the pallet on the front.

          INSIDE THE NEWSPAPER BUILDING:
          Once inside...

          

          

          

          

          73.

          WESLEY
          Separate.
          The lowest level is the loading dock, where pallets of
          newspapers and massive unused paper rolls await.

          WITH THE ELECTRICIAN:
          The Electrician hustles between the pallets and boxes,
          eyes darting, guns drawn. He backs up to a pallet of
          stacked newspapers, using it as cover. What he doesn't
          realize is that between each stack of papers is a space,
          just big enough for a --
          THWAP! A bullet finds its way through the space and hits
          the Electrician in the back of the shoulder, spinning him
          around.
          CLOSE ON: Cross' gun. Another shot and we follow the
          bullet, across the dock and dipping low into the next
          space in the paper stack -- right where Electrician is
          now leaning...
          .the bullet buries in his eye, sending him to the
          flog.
          Wesley sees Cross race for a set of stairs. Just as
          Wesley is about to cut him down, Cross fires at a wooden
          beam holding back some massive rolls of NEWSPAPER. The
          rolls tumble over and Wesley has to dive out of the way,
          allowing Cross to escape up the stairs.
          Wesley, Fox and the Waiter all race for the stairs.

          ON LEVEL TWO:
          Giant printing machines are running full speed, printing
          up the morning edition.
          A group of NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES see the guns the
          Fraternity members are toting and scramble for safety.
          Wesley has to yell to be heard over the whirring
          machines...

          WESLEY
          (to the Waiter)
          Stay here and cover us. There's no angle
          for him to hit you if you stay here.
          Wesley points at a scaffolding that runs above the
          machines.

          

          

          

          

          74.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Don't let him get up there. And stay
          clear of the presses! He'll use them
          however he can.

          WAITER
          How do you know?

          WESLEY
          It's what I'd do.
          With that, Wesley and Fox disappear amongst the
          machinery.
          The Waiter takes a step back from the press, where over a
          hundred pounds of paper spins through every second.
          He sticks his head out to try and keep an eye on that
          scaffolding. Everything looks clear, until...
          ...shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o
          Waiter's head gives way! He turns to see a bunch of cans
          of spray lubricant falling to the floor. No big deal,
          until Cross shoots one of them out of the air, causing it
          to explode!
          The burning oil covers the Waiter, who SCREAMS and
          stumbles nearer the printing press...

          BAM BAM BAM!
          More shots from Cross and one of the RESTRAINING ARMS on
          the roll of paper feeding the machine breaks in half.
          The paper roll spins wildly from the machine and like a.
          saw, cuts the Waiter in hplf !
          With a leap, Cross is on the scaffolding over the
          presses. For just a second, Cross stops as he locks eyes
          with Wesley...
          ..but Fox is already firing at him so Cross has to keep
          moving...
          He heads up a second staircase, but not before he sends a
          stream of bullets back at Fox, who athletically
          cartwheels away...
          .but one of Cross's bullets disintegrates a gear on the
          press near her, sending flying metal everywhere. A piece
          of shXapnel b ies into Fox's leg... making her break out
          of her cartwheel and flop down, wounded.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          FOX
          Fuuuucckkk!
          Cross races along the scaffolding and disappears into a
          door.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Keep goin', baby! Take him!
          Wesley races for the stairs. He is the only one left to
          chase Cross to level three.

          ON LEVEL THREE:
          Wesley bursts through the door, guns ready. The place is
          already in pandemonium, with PEOPLE yelling and screaming
          and running for cover. Quickly, Wesley realizes he's in
          the business offices of the paper, and it looks
          surprisingly similar to his old office. Lame-ass
          cubicles and florescent lighting everywhere.
          Wesley jumps up on a desk.

          WESLEY
          Cross!
          Unafraid, Cross climbs up on a desk on the other side of
          the office. Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire at
          Cross... who immediately returns fire...
          .and his bullets actually collide with Cross's by ets
          in mid-air!!! The bullets ricochet and take out a
          COMPUTER SCREEN where someone was playing SOLITAIRE.
          The two assassins blast away, all while diving and moving
          over and in the cubicles. Cross has a gun similar to the
          Imanishis, and they each steer their bullets at each
          other from sharp angles...
          Strangely,. the first bullet collision was not blind luck,
          but the pattern for the battle. They are fighting the
          same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle, each man
          using the same techniques at the exact same time.
          Wesley needs an angle, and spots a DRY ERASE BOARD the
          words "Action Items" written on it. He fires at it, and
          his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them
          strikes Cross in the shoulder... THWAP!!!
          Cross can't believe he's hit but he doesn't have time to
          flinch... right as Wesley fires again, he turns, barely
          avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby
          window, smashing the glass out,

          

          

          

          

          76.
          Wesley doesn't hesitate behind him... he sprints for the
          same window and dives through it, guns at the ready
          and...

          OUTSIDE THE WINDOW:
          .we stay with Wesley as he falls from the third floor,
          firing his guns the whole time...
          .until he lands top of an "L" train moving at ll
          speed.

          THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT:
          Fox limps out of the newspaper building and hurries to
          the Porsche. She ignores her wounds and rips the car out
          of the alley, chasing after the fleeing L train.

          ON THE L TRAIN:
          Ahead of Wesley, Cross is also on the top of the train.
          He manages to get up, spin around, and fire at Wesley...
          .but they both have to duck as the L train whips under
          an overpass, which misses smashing both of them by mere
          inches.
          Cross takes the opportunity to swing down between cars
          and enter one of the L cars.

          BEHIND HIM:
          Wesley hurries across the top of the train, spying the
          trail of blood that Cross is leaving behind from his
          wound.
          Wesley smiles, a shark on a wounded baby seal, as he also
          swings down between the cars and enters...

          THE FIRST L CAR:
          .where he sees the trail of blood leading all the way
          down the center of the empty car and out the back door.
          Wesley hovers in the entry way, his guns up and ready.
          He takes a step forward to follow the blood trail, and
          immediately, he is decked from the side by an ambushing
          Cross.
          They tumble over the first row of seats, both losing
          their guns.

          

          

          

          

          77.
          Wesley kicks Cross off of him, but Cross-spins with two
          new suns in his hand! Wesley is.on him quick though, and
          SLAMS Cross into one of the train's windows hard enough
          to crack it. With a quick twist of Cross' wrist, Wesley
          takes a sun from him Just as Cross kicks h,m off...
          .Wesley fires as he falls backwards. Cross falls
          backwards too from the momentum...
          ..and they both smash out opposite windows of the train
          before landing on either side of it!

          EXT. DIRTY ALLEY - NIGHT

          But the amazing thing is... they stand up and keep
          firing as the cars are whipping by at 80mph, and
          realize they. are timing their shots to actually blast
          between each car in the s it-second the opening passes.

          ON THE TRAIN:
          COMMUTERS ride along in blissful ignorance, reading their
          papers, holding on to the handrails... completely unaware
          of the gunfight raging outside the train.
          A bullet whizzes through an open window, pierces a
          BUSINESSMAN'S paper, and exits a window on the opposite
          side of the car. The man sticks his finger through the
          hole, unaware of the battle outside. What the hell?

          IN THE ALLEY:
          On opposite sides of the train, Wesley and Cross are both
          sprinting and firing, trying to get to the end of the
          last train, while dodging each other's bullets...
          .as the last car passes, they each jump on the tracks,
          ending u with guns tucked under each other's chin!

          CROSS
          Wesley!
          This takes Wesley aback...

          CROSS (CONT'D)
          Look into my eyes!
          Wesley's finger is starting to squeeze his trigger... as
          is Cross's.

          CROSS (CONT'D)
          (growls, in pain)
          Look into my eyes, goddammit!

          

          

          

          

          78.
          Finally, Wesley does and his face goes slack as he sees
          himself reflected in Cross's Dupils.
          Just then, Fox pulls up in the Porsche about fifty yards
          away, and her headlights illuminate them.
          Cross shifts his eyes to her, then does a curious thing:
          he lowers his gun, then drops it to the ground. Wesley
          can't believe Cross would leave himself defenseless.
          Moving swiftly, Cross men tucks something into the
          Rocket of Wesley's hooded sweatshirt.

          CROSS (CONT'D)

          (WHISPERS)
          Everything they told you was a lie,
          Wesley.
          With that... Cross falls down. His black jacket spills
          open to show a gun shot wound not just to his shoulder,
          but to hig n too. one of Wesley's bullets through
          the train must have found its mark.
          Cross is bleeding profusely. He gasps a couple of
          times... then, with his last bit of energy...

          CROSS (CONT'D)
          Find the missing piece. And... don't...
          let them... dispose of the weapon...
          With that, the life goes out of Cross's eyes.
          Wesley stares at that face, trying to decipher some
          meaning there. But Cross just stares blankly back at
          him, just as Fox comes limping up.

          FOX
          You did it, baby! Son of a bitch, you
          did it. You put down motherfucking
          Cross!
          Wesley looks down and sees some of Cross's blood on his
          hands from their clench. There is also some on the gun
          he is holding. ar --h d ed crun.
          Wesley reaches down and takes the other pearl-handled gun
          from where it dropped and looks over them both.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          What'd he say to you?
          Wesley looks up, sees some sort of anticipation in Fox's
          eyes. He looks back down at Cross's body..

          

          

          

          

          79.

          WESLEY
          He said... he said 'pies on the
          Fraternity...'
          Fox measures him, like she's not sure if he's telling the
          whole story. Finally, she nods...

          FOX
          Well... damn, I couldn't be more proud of
          you, baby! Let's go lay this on Sloan!

          WESLEY
          Yeah, sure.

          FOX
          What's wrong?

          WESLEY
          I think I need.a minute to myself.

          FOX

          (UNDERSTANDING)
          Sure. It's your first kill. I'll wait
          for you...

          WESLEY
          Naah, that's all right. You need to get
          stitched up. I'll meet you at that
          Korean place.

          FOX
          You sure?
          But he's already walking off. She watches him go,
          thinking...

          CUT TO:

          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

          Wesley walks down the street. PEOPLE instinctively get
          out of his way as he cuts a path down the sidewalk.
          Then he pulls out what Cross slipped inside his pocket:
          a beaten-up copy of COUNT OF ONTE CRISTO. In fact,
          there's no mistake, it's the same copy he had as a kid.
          Wesley tries to make sense of this as he opens up the
          cover... printed on the inside in a steady hand are the
          words: "I left you something."
          Wesley lowers the book and sees a cheesy guy park a
          Harley at a curb. He bee-lines for the guy.

          

          

          

          

          80.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING

          Wesley now blazes down the highway, pushing the Harley to
          its limits. His angry expression hasn't dissipated.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

          The Harley pulls up to a lower-middle-class house, the
          kind you might find in any run-down suburb. Kids run
          around the neighborhood, playing.

          ON THE BIKE:
          Wesley sits and looks at one particular house. He climbs
          off'and heads to the side of the house, still carrying
          his book.

          SIDE OF THE HOUSE:
          He ducks through a broken chain-link fence and moves down
          the side of the house...
          .until he finds a familiar wooden BOARD. Familiar
          because we've seen this place before: it's where he
          lived when he was a foster kid.
          He removes the board, then reaches into the hole. His
          hand seizes on something. From the hole, he withdraws a
          KEY attached to a note with an address on it: 1850 North
          Highbury St.
          Wesley's eyes move from the copy of MONTE CRISTO, to the
          key, and back to the book.
          Finally, he lowers his hands... revealing a little eight-
          year-old kid, watching him curiously from the back yard.

          WESLEY
          Hey.

          KID
          Hey.

          WESLEY
          You live here?
          The kid.nods .

           WESLEY (CONT'D)
           Foster home?
          4014 The kid nods again.

          

          

          

          

          81.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Read this.
          He tosses the kid the book and heads off.

          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

          He pulls the Harley over to a curb and then reaches into
          his jacket pocket and withdraws the note and the key.
          Across the street, the address matches: 1850 N.
          Highbury. The place looks like a concrete fortress... no
          windows, just a large-iron door in front.
          Wesley approaches, not sure what the address could mean.
          He gets to the door, looking for a key-hole, but he
          doesn't find one.
          He fidgets there awkwardly for a second, but then...
          .the door opens, revealing a woman, ANNA. She takes a
          look at Wesley and then puts a trembling hand over her
          lips.

          ANNA
          Come in, Wesley.
          He stares at her, trying to figure this out. He steps...

          INSIDE THE HOUSE:
          .and finds that the place is nicely decorated; an
          attempt to cover up what is really a reinforced bunker.
          Anna is now trying to hold back tears, but can't.

          ANNA
          He's dead, isn't he?
          There's no point lying to this woman...

          WESLEY
          Yes, ma'am.
          She nods knowingly, sadly.

          ANNA
          He told me if he didn't come back... it
          would be you who pulled the trigger.

          WESLEY
          â He killed my father...

          

          

          

          

          82.
          Anna looks at him, confused. But then, realization sets
          in...

          ANNA
          I think you need to meet someone...
          she leads Wesley into another room, where a five-year-old
          boy, plays the floor.

          ANNA (CONT'D)
          Wesley. This is your brother... Andrew.
          Wesley's not sure what to make of this.

          WESLEY
          My brother?

          ANNA
          Half-brother. But both of you, you are
          both 100 percent your.father's boys.
          I've seen that from the beginning.
          Andrew is busy playing with a couple of BLACK TOY
          BUILDINGS on the floor. Wesley studies the little guy,
          still confused.

          ANNA (CONT'D)
          Your father... he was with you the whole
          time.
          Wesley looks up and sees what she's referring to. The
          walls are filled with pictures of Andrew, Anna, and...
          remarkably...
          ...photoaraths of Wesley at various ages w hgn he was-
          growing u !

          ANNA (CONT'D)
          This was his favorite.
          She hands him a picture of Wesley at about age 12,
          sitting with his back to a tree, reading COUNT OF MONTE
          CRISTO. The picture has been taken through a windshield,
          across the street.
          Wesley reels, his legs give out, he slumps against one of
          the walls...
          FLASH: Cross firing at Fox and Wesley at the grocery
          store. But now we see that Fox positioned Wesley between
          herself and the shooter. He wasn't trying to hit Wesley,
          he was trying to separate him from her.

          

          

          

          

          83.
          Wesley, thinking, remembering...
          FLASH: Wesley studying Cross's face in the file, seeing
          that there isn't jealousy in those eyes.
          Wesley still slumped against the wall, surrounded by
          pictures of himself...
          FLASH: Wesley reflected in Cross's pupils.
          Holy shitl!! Cross was his father!!! Wesley looks up at
          Anna's kind face...

          ANNA (CONT'D)
          When your father and I found each other,
          when we had Andrew, he said he could no
          longer live the way he had been living.
          He said he wouldn't give us up, the way
          he had given up his first eon.
          Wesley stares at the picture... he can't believe he was
          being watched back when he felt so alone.

          ANNA (CONT'D)
          It was his greatest regret.
          She leaves him in the room, alone, with his brother.
          Wesley watches the kid, trying to process it all.
          For the first time, emotions overcome him, and he breaks
          down...
          .but he's too tough now to sob, so he forces the Bob
          down in his throat and blinks back the tears. Goddamn,
          he has a brother.

          IN THE KITCHEN OF THE SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
          He walks up behind Anna, who is sipping some coffee at a
          kitchen table, red eyed.

          ANNA
          would you like some coffee?

          WESLEY
          I'm okay.
          Wesley sets the key down on the table.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Do you know what this opens?

          CUT TO:

          

          

          

          

          84.
          A LONE KEYHOLE in a solid closet door.
          Wesley sticks the key in and swings the door open
          revealing a LONG BLACK COAT, just like his father's.

          ANNA
          I guess it's not much of an inheritance.

          WESLEY

          (STEELY)
          He left me more than this.
          Wesley takes the coat and folds it over his arm.

          ANNA
          I want you to know that he forgave you
          before you ever pulled the trigger. He
          tried to keep you out of it for so
          long...

          WESLEY
          Why didn't he just tell me?

          ANNA
          once they had you... he couldn't risk it
          unless you were alone. He knew his one
          shot at telling you might be his last.
          Her eyes harden a little bit.

          ANNA (CONT'D)
          You have to finish what he was doing,
          Wesley. It's the only way any of us will
          ever be free. Especially your brother.
          They won't stop hunting us... your father
          knew that.
          Wesley nods.

          WESLEY
          I'll be back as soon as this is over.

          ANNA
          You have family here.
          Wesley nods, these words meaning so much to him.

          INT. KOREAN BAR-B-QUE JOINT - NIGHT

          Fox eats in a small restaurant in the heart of Koreatown,
          the kind of place that has the hot hibachi grills on the
          S table tops.

          

          

          

          

          85.
          The place is mostly empty, quiet, with mainly Korean
          faces both dining and serving. It's the kind of place
          where you can eat and not be bothered.
          The doors swing open and Fox looks up. The silhouette of
          e I URE IN THE DOgJLWM is disturbing, a familiar
          person in a long black coat...

          FOX
          Jesus.
          She squints, the setting sunlight nearly blinding her as
          all she can see is a silhouette...

          FOX (CONT'D)
          For a second there I thought you looked
          just like Cross.
          Wesley steps into the light and moves over to the table
          as Fox lights up a cigarette.

          WESLEY
          Skipped the hospital?

          FOX
          He picked me clean and I don't care much
          for needles.
          She blows out a lungful of smoke and watches as it rises
          toward the ceiling.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Sloan's on his way.
          One of the waiters waves to her to put out her smoke and
          she just stares him down. The man backs off, nodding and
          smiling.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          You want something to eat, baby?

          WESLEY
          I'm all right.

          FOX
          They got some good shit. Ostrich,
          chicken... won't fill you up too much if
          you're watching your calories.

          WESLEY
          Naah.

          

          

          

          

          8â¬.

          FOX
          Well, the big man should be here any
          minute...

          WESLEY
          Yeah.

          (BEAT)
          Listen, can I ask you a :question?

          FOX
          Baby, you can ask me anything you want.
          He focuses on her eyes, zeroing in on the pupils.

          WESLEY
          Did you know Cross was my father?

          FOX
          What?

          WESLEY
          Did you know?
          Closer, closer... tight on those pupils...

          FOX

          O AW
          What're you talking about Wesley? Cross
          killed your father.

          EXTREME CLOSE-UP:
          We see her pupil swell, just a tiny bit.

          KOREAN BAR-B-QUE:
          He saw it... exactly what Sloan told him to look for when
          someone is lying.
          And from the look on Fox's face, she knows he saw it.

          FOX
          Goddammit, Wesley...
          She stabs out her cigarette, crushing it on the hot grill
          so that it SIZZLES.

          FOX (CONT'D)
          Why'd you have to ask me that?
          With that, she kicks back from the table, holding a huge
          black Smith and Wesson revolver.

          

          

          

          

          $7.
          Wesley only has a millisecond to respond,-and he does by
          kicking over the table, which sends food and utensils
          flying, but also shields him from Fox's bullets.
          Just as quickly, Fox leaps up on top of one of the other
          tables, trying to keep her heels on the sides so that her
          feet don't touch the hot grill. If she's wounded, we
          wouldn't know it.
          Wesley does the same on a nearby table. They take shots
          at each other as they leap from table to table, avoiding
          the sizzling centers, but they're both so quick that no
          bullets find their mark.
          Then Fox takes a running leap at him, moving ferociously
          fast. She's like the animal she's named after, and she
          launches off one of the tables...
          .and catches Wesley flush, kno in him backwards, a
          form tackle on to a table...
          ..where he lands Quare on the oven top... PSSSSBHH...
          and his guns go flying across the room as...
          .the table to starts to burn through his clothes!

          %AW

          WESLEY
          Arrrh!

          FOX
          You shoulda known better, baby...
          But he rolls over, taking Fox with him, and now the oven-
          is burning into her back.
          With all her strength, she bucks him off and then flips
          herself backwards off the table. With another kick, she
          sends the hot table flying at him. It rips free from its
          wiring, and the nozzle sprays gas out into the
          restaurant... SSSSSSSSS...
          Wesley knocks the flying table out of the way, but not
          before it burns his arm as he blocks it.
          Spotting his guns, he sprints for them as Fox unleashes a
          hailstorm of bullets.
          But he's too damn fast, and he dives across the floor
          Pete Rose style, sliding to a stop at the precise moment
          where his hands come u holSling his weapons.
          In.one fluid motion, he flips back over and EAM! BAM!

          BAM! BAM! BAM!

          

          

          

          

          88.
          shoots bullets up in the air and then flicks his wrists
          so they arc over at the open gas nozzle!
          The bullets strike it, sparking, and then BOOM!!!:
          fireball b sts from nozzle, while a great Riume of
          sweltering fire keeps pouring out!
          Fox dives to get out of the way, which gives Wesley the
          opening he was looking for. He FIRES again, and one of
          his bullets knocks her crun away and another nicks her in
          the side of the face.
          She stops, seeing the blood drip down her cheek and off
          her chin. This only seems to enrage her.
          Pissed, she produces two S R GUNS out of the small of
          her bac -- where she had them hidden we have no idea --
          and charges Wesley like an unleashed Pit Bull...

          FOX (CONT'D)

          (SCREAMS)
          Aaaaahhhh!
          She's firing both muzzles and her bullets find the marks
          this time, knocking Wesley's guns out of his hands from
          where he lies flat on the floor.
          She's disarmed him, and now he's defenseless...
          .and Fox stands over him, breathing hard, her face
          bleeding, both gun barrels pointed right at Wesley's
          face...

          FOX (CONT'D)
          I gotta admit, baby...
          She starts to squeeze both the triggers...

          FOX (CONT'D)
          I thought we might have a future...
          But, Wesley drives a fist into her wounded leg and she
          reels...
          In the same motion, he grabs her wrists and pulls her
          toward him... taking her guns right out of her hands like
          a quick-change artist.
          Flipping them over, Fox's face full of surprise is the
          last expression she'll ever have because...

          BAM! BAM!!!

          

          

          

          

          69.
          Most of Fox's face is blown clean fr her head, and a
          blood mess s ra s a oss the wall.
          Wesley leans his head back and closes his eyes, the spume
          of fire flickering brightly against his lids, the events
          of the last several hours washing over him.

          FADE OUT:
          For several moments, there is nothing but darkness and a
          silence as permanent as death. Finally...

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          There's a town in Germany called
          Leverkusen that had a bear hunter named
          Hans Koblenz.

          FADE IN:

          EXT. KOREAN BAR-B-QUE JOINT - LATER

          Sloan, the Butcher and the Pharmacist walk across the
          parking lot toward the door of the smoking Bar-b-que
          joint.

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          60 During his life, he was said to have
          killed over four hundred bears and was
          the pride of this small community on the
          Rhine. You want to know how he died? A
          pair of black bears singled out his house
          from the entire village, mauled his wife,
          killed his twin daughters, and then lied
          in wait for him to get back from the
          woods.

          INT. KOREAN BAR-B-QUE JOINT - LATER

          The fire is out, but it has blackened the inside of the
          joint, so that it looks like an absolute war zone.
          Fox is in the same position as when Wesley shot her, but
          there's a sheet of paper folded on her chest.
          The Butcher and the Pharmacist flank Sloan as he
          approaches the body, frowning.

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          When the hunter opened the door, they
          ripped his throat out before he could
          scream.

          90.

          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The two bears then curled up on the rug
          LW in the middle of the floor -- the rug
          that had once been their father -- and
          proceeded to bite. each other till they
          bled to death.
          Sloan reaches down and picks up the paper, and sees
          beneath it that pearl-handled revolver. The one with the
          blood on the handle.

          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          That's a true story.
          He unfolds it, to read printed in black ink on the paper:

          7'HE GATES OF T.T ARE OPEN
          Sloan folds the paper back up and looks at the blood on
          the gun.

          SLOAN
          He knows.

          CUT TO:

          INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE ROOM - NIGHT

          Wesley stands in the slaughterhouse, holding two pistols,
          looking around. The place has been cleaned out. There's
          no sign of the Butcher.

          INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT

          Same thing at the Pharmacy, an empty store now...

          INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

          .and in the Fraternity's library, nothing. All the
          books are gone...
          Wesley processes this, frowning. He keeps walking to
          the...

          MAP ROOM:
          .where the entire model city has been destroyed, like a
          Giant has trampled it beneath its feet.
          Wesley stoops over and pulls one smashed building out of
          the mess, looking at it, thinking, thinking...
          .and then he's up and moving quickly.

          CUT TO:

          

          

          

          

          91.

          INT. CROSS'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Anna opens the door for Wesley, who looks like he is on
          to something...

          WESLEY
          My father... he was working on a plan,
          right?

          ANNA
          I don't know. There was so much he
          wanted to keep away from us...
          Wesley moves into Andrew's roan... where the boy is still
          playing with the black model buildings.
          Wesley moves over and crouches down next to Andrew.

          WESLEY
          Can I see that for a second?
          The boy hands him the building in his hand. It is
          painted jet black, except for one corner of the first
          floor, which is painted red. Wesley looks up at Anna.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Do you know where he got this?

          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

          Anna leads Wesley down some wooden steps into Cross's
          basement.
          Sure enough, the entire floor of the basement has been
          made into a model map, similar to the one that the
          Fraternity used in the map room, but all the buildings
          are black, with an occasional red mark.
          The scale is larger, the model shows only one section of
          the city, and a BLUE LINE indicates a route through the
          streets.
          And on the wall are PICTURES and CLIPPINGS of Henry
          Helms.
          Wesley squats over it, trying to figure out what his
          father's plan was. He sees a missing place for a
          building and puts Andrew's toy back in place, then
          studies the map some more.

          /'" ANNA
          I-" Does this mean anything to you?

          

          

          

          

          92.
          There are large question marks painted on various
          buildings along the Helms' route.

          WESLEY

          (AWED)
          My God, he's been planning it from the
          beginning.

          (BEAT)
          This is a Fraternity hit. Cross... my
          fathar... set up Henry Helms as bait,
          knowing Sloan would use his best men for
          the job. He was going to take them all
          out.
          Wesley looks at it some more.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Only he didn't know where on the route
          they would try and hit Helms. That's the
          missing piece he was t rying to figure
          out.

          ANNA
          Do you know the answer to that?
          Wesley looks up at her, resolve on his face.

          WESLEY
          No. But I know who does.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          A lump in a bed stirs.

          The lump stirs a little more...

          NICOLE, the hot girl from Wesley's office, moves to her
          peephole and looks out, but there's no one there.
          She opens the door and gives a quick look down the hall,
          then shuts it and hurries to her kitchen.

          

          

          

          

          93.
          She starts to open a cabinet but stops, GASPS and jerks
          back, scared shitless.
          Wesley is-in her kitchen, lust a few-feet away. She
          looks at him.

          NICOLE
          Jesus...
          (seeing who it is)
          Wesley? Is that you?
          He looks bruised and battered, but there is a hardness to
          his eyes.

          WESLEY
          It's me, Nicole.

          NICOLE
          What happened to you?
          Wesley wipes his eyebrow with his thumb, like he's
          considering what he wants to say next.

          WESLEY
          I asked you once if you thought I was an
          observant person.
          She doesn't understand... but suddenly we...

          CUT BACK TO:

          INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

          .that meeting room from his old job. In fact, it's a
          replay of that same scene. Wesley is still sitting there
          with his note pad, the words "LIFE SUCKS AND THEN YOU
          DIE" printed over and over, while the consultant
          continues to rattle on and on.
          Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley spots the
          hot intern Nicole, still talking on the phone. And just
          like before, he's zeroing in on her, but this time, we
          keep zeroing in and zeroing in, until we see something we
          didn't see before...
          Nicole reaches up over the counter to grab a stack of
          papers, and her shirt pulls slightly up from her back...
          .and that tattoo of Cerberus. &)A- three-headed !log _is

          Who said I was the only sister? Maybe

          Maybe I have and I'm just not telling
          you.
          .and now with the gift of hindsight, we see that Wesley
          meant what he said, and we...

          Wesley still stands there, just a few feet away from her.

          WESLEY
          Sloan didn't just have one person in my
          office watching me, he had two.

          NICOLE
          What are you talking about?

          WESLEY
          What name do you go by? The Intern?
          He points at her tattoo.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Because I know you have the mark.
          Nicole's face changes, goes hard, like someone flipped a
          switch.
          Like lightning, she grabs for a butcher's knife but
          Wesley is faster. He pins her wrist back, twisting until
          she drops the knife.
          She lunges again, but a pistol comes up right below her
          chin.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Where's the Henry Helms hit going down?
          Where's Sloan?

          WESLEY
          Yeah? Why's that?
          She reaches over, slowly, so he knows she's not going to
          go for a knife... and she turns on a small TELEVISION
          sitting on the kitchen counter.
          The screen comes to life, showing an inf mercial for the
          F ob'e.
          Nicole shakes her head and. flips up the channels... and

          Me.

          NICOLE
          That's right. And the cops were told to
          watch this place too. You have nowhere
          to go. He's smarter than you. He'll
          feed the cops evidence singling you out
          for every hit the Fraternity has pulled
          in the last ten years.

          WESLEY
          (ignoring her)
          I'm only going to ask you one more time.
          Where can I find him?

          NICOLE
          You won't get to him. You can't. The
          cops will be here any second!
          Wesley reaches over- -and cranks up a gas burner, the
          menacing flame on high.

          WESLEY
          Then this is going to get painful
          quickly.
          She stares at that blue flame, fear in her eyes for the
          first time.
          He starts pushing her head toward it, closer and
          closer...

          WESLEY (CONT'D)

          POLICE OFFICER (0. S.)
          Open up! Police!
          The door to Nicole's apartment smashes open and four cops
          burst through the door, guns ready.

          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

          SIRENS wail and a HELICOPTER hovers nearby as Wesley
          stands on a roof, looking down on the scene. He sees
          EMT's roll a gurney out toward an ambulance as COPS cover
          every inch of the ground.
          From where he is, it looks like every cop in the city is
          here.

          ON THE GROUND:
          One COP looks up and sees a figure on the roof, long
          jacket blowing in the breeze. Surprisingly conspicuous.

          COP
          What the fuck?

          COP 2

          Wesley steps out of a dark doorway, his hard eyes
          following a police car as it roars by without noticing
          him.

          

          

          

          

          98.
          He pulls his jacket collar up, puts on.a skull cap, and
          takes off in the opposite direction, away from the scene.
          He passes a newspaper dispenser, but the CAMERA STAYS.on
          the front page, which is still talking about Henry Helms.
          The CAMERA HOLDS ON A photograph of Helms, which...

          DISSOLVES TO:
          Morning...

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

          .where HENRY HELMS himself is tying a tie in a hotel
          mirror. He's a handsome enough guy, distinguished even,
          but he looks tired, like the weight of living under a
          death threat has dragged him down.
          A door opens, and we see his wife, SARAH HELMS, step past
          two, huge BODYGUARDS to come in.

          SARAH HELMS
          The car is here.

          EXT. HOTEL SIDE DOOR - DAY

          A gaggle of large bodyguards surround the Helmses as they
          hurry out of a side door and make it into a LIMOUSINE.
          They notice the half dozen MOTORCYCLE COPS positioned
          around their limo.
          A LEAD BODYGUARD holds the limo door for them.

          HENRY HELMS
          (re: the cops)
          What's all this?

          LEAD BODYGUARD
          We're not taking any chances.
          He shuts the door for them before climbing behind the
          steering wheel.
          The limo starts to make its way down the drive, flanked
          in front and in back by dark SUBURBANS and the motorcycle
          cops.

          EXT. RIVER - DAY

          Commercial ships cruise up and down a river, under an
          expansive BRIDGE.

          

          

          

          

          99.
          Sitting next to the incline to the bridge, is an
          abandoned four story building, what used to be.a

          HOSPITAL.

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOFTOP - DAY

          A guy looks down at the street with his binoculars. It's
          the Gunsmith!

          THE GUNSMITH
          (into a radio)
          Nothing yet, sir.

          EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - SAME

          On another tall building, Sloan talks into a radio.

          SLOAN
          Hold until I give the word.
          He clicks off the radio and looks into his palm, where-
          e's holding that pearl handled aun, fingering the dried
          blood.

          ON A CITY STREET:
          The suburbans and cops flank the limo as it rolls through
          the concrete jungle.

          IN THE LIMO:
          The bodyguards peer up at the buildings ready for
          anything.
          Henry Helms reaches over and grabs his wife's hand, a
          reassuring gesture. But his white knuckles betray his
          trepidation.
          The driver watches as they reach a frontage road on the
          east side of the river.

          ON THE ROAD:
          They make a turn along the river and haul ass toward the
          bridge. Traffic is sparse and they look like they have
          an easy clear passing.

          ON THE HOSPITAL ROOFTOP:
          The Gunsmith sits, waiting patiently...

          

          

          

          

          100.

          ON ANOTHER ROOFTOP:
          Sloan watches the Limo starting to approach the bridge.

          SLOAN
          (into the radio)
          Here comes the car. Any minute now.
          Take your positions.
          Sloan leans out over the edge of his building, gun ready.

          QUICK SHOTS:
          On the hospital roof, the Gunsmith puts down his
          binoculars and picks up a rifle.
          The Pharmacist leans over the edge of a building and
          looks down, high-powered rifle in his hand.
          On another building, the Chef does the same.
          And on still another building, the Gardener also gets
          ready.
          Each killer is in a different spot and has a gun, pointed
          and ready, just waiting for the signal...

          ON THE ROAD:
          The limo is about halfway up the incline now, a sitting
          duck, hellfire about to rain down upon it.

          ON THE HOSPITAL ROOFTOP:
          The Gunsmith waits, waits, waits...
          .and then, out of nowhere, surprising the hell out of
          him, a knife is held to his neck from behind.
          The Gunsmith doesn't even so much as swallow, as the
          blade is so tight against his throat that it draws a drop
          of blood.

          GUNSMITH

          (NERVOUSLY)
          Wesley?
          The CAMERA MOVES TO THE SIDE to show Wesley crouched
          right behind him, a look of icy determination on his face
          as he holds the knife in place.

          

          

          

          

          101.

          WESLEY

          (GROWLS)
          The name is Cross.
          In the distance, the Helms limo moves on, safely.

          WESLEY
          Looks like you missed your chance. Now
          where is Sloan?
          The Gunsmith feels the edge in Wesley's voice.

          GUNSMITH
          You don't understand, man. This ain't
          about Helms. The Intern told you right
          where to go...
          He smiles.

          GUNSMITH (CONT'D)
          .I'm just the decoy.
          THE CAMERA WHIPS around behind Wesley... to show that
          three laser sights are lighting up his back in a perfect
          pattern.
          And now we see it, this was al a Bet-up to get Wesley in
          the open. The three surrounding rooftops, slightly more
          elevated, hold each of the three assassins crouched-in
          sniper positions, zeroed in on Wesley's back.
          But instead of surprise, Wesley just leans in closer to
          the Gunsmith's ear.

          WESLEY

          (WHISPERS)
          She told me that, too.
          And with that, he rolls the o0 over of ,
          just as the assassins on the higher rooftops all unleash
          a hail of bullets.
          BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! The Gunsmith takes a dozen
          shots, all in the chest, but none of the bullets make it
          through the Gunsmith's body.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          Should've studied your anatomy, fellas.
          Wesley FIRES BACK indiscriminately at the neighboring
          rooftops, lying on his back, using the.dead assassin's
          body as a shield.

          

          

          

          

          102.
          Quickly, he bucks the Gunsmith's body off of him and
          scampers for a nearby stairwell.

          ON THE ROOFTOPS:
          The assassinB-all disappear from their positions and head
          to the street.

          CUT TO:

          INT. HOSPITAL BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - DAY

          Wesley bursts from the stairwell doorway and moves to the
          front door of the building. He clicks the empty
          cartridges out of his guns and is about to reload when he
          hears a sickening sound behind him...
          The sound of two knife blades being rubbed together...
          .and Wesley turns to f' the Butcher there waiting for
          The Butcher quickly hurls a knife, which buries in_the
          fleshy part of Wesley's shoulder 1
           Wesley ignores it and fires...
          i L

          SAM BAM! DING DING!
          The Butcher deflects them with the knives in his hands:
          Wesley goes to fire again but his firing chambers recoil,
          showing that he is out of ammo.
          The Butcher's eyes go wide...

          THE BUTCHER
          Like I told you... the blade will always
          live on.

          WESLEY
          I remember some dumb shit like that
          coming out of your mouth.
          Wesley tosses the guns in his pockets and then nulls out
          the kniZ2 in his shoulder.
          They charge each other, the blades whizzing and clanging
          off each other as each tries to gain an edge.
          The fight spills out the front door, and into...

          

          

          

          

          103.

          THE STREET:
          .the two men slashing, ducking, and moving in the
          middle of the street. -
          Wesley strikes three auick swipes acrosiLthe Butcher's
          face And forehead, filling his eyes with blood.
          The Butcher grabs his face and sees the blood streaming
          on to his hands. He tries to wipe the blood from his
          eyes, but it's just getting worse.

          THE BUTCHER
          I can't see!

          WESLEY
          But you can hear. So hear this: To cut
          the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice-
          pick style...
          Wesley lunges and the Butcher is defenseless to stop it.

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          ...and thrust down behind the clavicle,
          cutting side to side.
          He does just as he describes and the big guy topples over
          as his gore spills out into the street.
          But before he can gloat, Wesley realizes his new
          predicament...
          He's standing in the middle of the street, and at one end
          is the chef, and at the other is the Gardener. To make
          things worse, directly across the street from Wesley is
          the Pharmacist, and each has a gun on him.

          THE PHARMACIST
          Three on one, mate. You're out of ammo.
          And you're in a part of the map with no
          Fraternity stashes.

          (LAUGHS)
          That's what I'd call a real ball ache.
          For a moment, Wesley stands there, sizing up the
          situation. His eyes swivel from the Gardener to the Chef
          to the Pharmacist.
          Just then, the buildings ound all of them go black.,
          just like in cross's model! Wesley's eyes fall on the on
          the red corner of the nearest building, a cement block
          making up a decorative support column in front of it.

          

          

          

          

          104.
          Wesley smiles.

          WESLEY
          I'm working off of a different map.
          With that, the world goes back 12 its natural colorB, and
          he races for the building, jumping up onto and over a
          Lexus parked at the curb. The three assassins fire
          relentlessly at him, but their bullets slam into the car,
          smashing it to bits... as...
          . on the other side of it, Wesley goes into a slide just
          as he reaches that cement block... affixed to it is a
          small SILVER CROSSI Wesley slaps his hand on the Cross
          and the cement block mechanically opens, revealing: a new
          pair of sophisticated MA ISHIS I
          As his adversaries converge on him, Wesley takes the
          guns, spins, splits both hands apart and we...

          SPLITSCREEN:
          ...to follow both of his bullets in flight.

          ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN:
          .THE BULLET from the left gun heads for the Chef. He
          tries to drop down, but the bullet curves downward, it
          pierces his body... and...

          INSIDE HIS BODY:
          We see the bullet ricochet off of one of his ribs-exit
          his side and head for the Pharmacist, while...

          ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN:
          ...the bullet from the right gun heads for the Gardener,
          who moves fast to fire his own gun, but the bullet
          catches him in the wrist, knocking his gun out of his
          hand, and...

          INSIDE THE WRIST:
          . it hits the Gardener's scaphoid bone, ricocheting out,
          also, right at the Pharmacist...

          THE SCREEN RETURNS TO NORMAL:
          .just as the two bullets come together...

          THE PHARMACIST
          Bugger.

          

          

          

          

          105.
          hitting the Pharmacist on both sides of-his head,
          before he can even react.
          Wesley watches a pink spray shoot out from both sides of
          the Pharmacist's head as he falls to the asphalt, dead.
          But Wesley's not through, he moves over to the Gardener
          and rolls him over.

          WESLEY
          Where is he?

          THE GARDENER
          Where it started..
          BAN! Wesley ends it for the Gardener.

          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

          We've seen this place before. It's the same roof where
          cross took out the second head of
          The door is kicked open and Wesley walks out, eyes
          blazing.
          Sloan is waiting for standing t feet away,
          holding his father's pearl-handled gun, trained right on
          Wesley's head.

          SLOAN
          Can't say I don't have a sense of irony.
          The place I first decided to bring you
          in.
          Wesley is clutching his wounded shoulder with his wounded
          hand as blood starts to seep out of it in big red drops.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          You once asked why I helped hide you as
          an infant... It gave me power, Wesley'.
          Power to become a head of the Fraternity.
          Power over your father. And ultimately
          it gave me you: the perfect weapon to
          kill your father.

          WESLEY
          But now you have to dispose of the
          weapon.

          SLOAN
          In some ways it pains me to do so. You
          460 are like the son I never had.

          

          

          

          

          106.

          WESLEY
          Fuck you.
          Sloan's eyes narrow.

          SLOAN
          Fine. Keep your worthless dignity.
          You're still just the same loser we
          plucked off the street six weeks ago.
          Wesley continues to bleed, taking this in. Sloan laughs
          derisively.

          SLOAN (CONT'D)
          You can't win, Wesley. The Fraternity is
          everywhere. Even if you kill me others
          will come from other cities to take my
          place. You'll be hunted your whole life.

          (BEAT)
          But that's not gonna happen. Like I told
          you before, when we are called, death is
          as certain as the sun.
          Wesley stands as straight as he can muster. The two men
          face each other like two gunmen on Main Street in Dodge
          city... an old newspaper even blows through like a
          tumbleweed.
          And we are close on Wesley's face. act it i the
          same shot from the opening of the movie.

          WESLEY
          Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and
          pathetic.
          We see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his
          bleeding arm, reaching into his sleeve...

          WESLEY (CONT'D)
          But not today.
          With that, he nulls out the matching pearl-handled gun,
          the twin-brother of the one Sloan is holding, and they
          both open fire...
          .Wesley shoots Sloan's bullets out of the air and Sloan
          does the same. Just like he did with h' father.
          .But Sloan is good, and one of the bullets finds it's
          mark, hitting Wesley sSMarely in the same arm that took
          the knife.

          

          

          

          

          107.

          WESLEY (CONT'D
          Uhhh!
          He can't raise his arm, it's useless, but he's come too
          damn far to stop now... he flips his gun from his good
          hand to his bad hand and manages to keep FIRING!
          Then Wesley does something unexpected... he starts
          sprinting straight at Sloan, still knocking his bullets
          out of the air...
          He closes the gap... ten feet... five feet...
          ..a surprised and worried expression now spreads on
          Sloan's face,.like what is this kid doing?
          But Wesley is not stopping, he shoots the gun out of
          Sloan's hand and then closes on him, tackling him off his
          feet!
          They go flying right over the edge of the building.
          Wesley's able to grab on to a railing cable and stop
          himself...
          ..but Sloan is going to go over.
          At the last moment, Sloan reacher. for-something.
          anything. and grabs one-handed the barrel of
          Wesley's gun...
          For a moment, they dangle there in this precarious
          position, looking each other in the face. Sloan can't
          believe he's been bested by this kid.

          SLOAN

          (SNARLS)
          Go ahead and shoot me, killer. Just like
          you did your old man.
          Wesley's finger starts to squeeze the trigger, but then
          he smiles...

          WESLEY
          I'm done with this life. Just like my
          father.
          And with that, Wes1gy drops the n out of his h

          FROM TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW:
          We watch Sloan's body fall through the sky...

          

          

          

          

          108.
          ..down, down, down...
          .until it SMASHES into the sidewalk, splattering like a
          grapefruit.

          ON THE ROOFTOP:
          Wesley rolls over on to his back, looking up at the
          darkening sky.

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          It's true. Six weeks ago I was ordinary
          and-pathetic. Just like you.
          He sits up, moving OUT OF FRAME.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

          The place is now blanketed with cops, looking at the dead
          bodies, trying to make sense of what happened.

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          But I've learned something in that time.
          I've learned about the man who made me.

          EXT. DOWNTOWN CORNER - DAY

          Cope stand on the street, handing out pictures of Wesley,
          asking pedestrians if they've seen this man.

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          I've learned about the man I am.

          INT. POST OFFICE - DAY

          Patrons stand in line at a post office, but the'CAMERA
          PUSHES PAST THEM, finding a black and white "WANTED"
          poster of Wesley, describing all the killings he's
          responsible for. It holds tight on the picture.

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          I've learned that all of us are unique,
          even though sometimes we're too fucking
          blind to see it.

          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

          The door to the safehouse opens, and Anna, Wesley and
          Andrew step out into the bright sunlight. Wesley is
          carrying his little brother.

          

          

          

          

          109.
          They turn and head up the street, toward the eastern sun.
          The CAMERA RISES UP, UP, UP, where it hovers for a
          minute... and just when we think it is going to leave the
          planet...

          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And I learned, the easiest place to hide
          is in plain sight.
          .it comes back DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, until it finds...

          INT. TYPICAL INSURANCE OFFICE - DAY

          ..Wesley sitting at a computer in the middle of another
          cubicle maze, pecking away at his keyboard. A sign
          attached to one wall reads: "SAN ANGELO INSURANCE
          ASSOCIATES: Setting the Bar Highl"
          Office workers mill about in their drab suits and ties,
          wishing they were anywhere else.
          A pretty RECEPTIONIST comes over to Wesley's desk.

          RECEPTIONIST
          You're the new guy, huh?

          WESLEY
          Just started last week.

          RECEPTIONIST
          Where'd you move here from?

          WESLEY
          All over the place, really. Nothing too
          exciting.

          RECEPTIONIST
          Well, welcome to the team. Just watch
          out for Brokaw. He'll stab you in the
          back first chance he gets.
          Just then, a harried man, BROKAW, comes storming up.

          BROKAW
          Jesus, Connie, don't you have some faxes
          to get to?
          The receptionist hurries away, making a face as she does.

          BROKAW (CONT'D)
          Laziest skirt I ever hired. But nice fun
          bags, I'll give her that.

          

          

          

          

          110.
          He leans over Wesley's desk, right in his space.

          BROKAW (CONT ' D )
          Jim, right?

          WESLEY
          Yes, sir.

          BROKAW
          Listen, Jim, I don't want to get started
          off on the wrong foot here, but we.have
          numbers to make and if we don't make
          those numbers, it's my ass on the line.
          And if my ass gets chewed out by
          regional, I can guarantee.that your ass
          is gonna be Purina doggy chow. Now I'm
          not sure how they ran things...
          Wesley stares at that mouth zeroing in further and--
          further, until the words become gibberish, just like they
          did with Janice.
          Wesley catches himself and snaps out of it, just in time
          to hear...

          BROKAW (CONT'D)
          .so do we understand each other?

          WESLEY
          Of course.

          BROKAW
          Good boy.
          With that, he hurries away, his pants riding so high up
          his ass that they look like they may burst at any second.
          Wesley stares up at the clock on his monitor: it reads
          11:15. He stands up, stretches, and makes his way to the
          receptionist's desk. She looks up, bites her lower
          lip...

          WESLEY
          You want to take a break with me?

          RECEPTIONIST
          Sure!
          She stands and they move toward the elevators, waiting
          for the doors to open.

          RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
          You know, we don't usually get breaks.

          

          
          Just then, the elevator doors DING.

          WESLEY
          Well, you'll find there's nothing "usual"
          about me.
          They climb in.
          THE CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on Wesley's
          face...

          WESLEY (V.O.)
          This life is ours, to make of it what we
          can.
          .until it fills the screen, looking just like the shot
          of Wesley we started with. And then a sly smile spreads
          across his mug...

          WESLEY (V.0.)
          I think I'll give it a shot.
          .and as the doors close, we officially...

          FADE OUT.

               FINAL MOVIE SCRIPT


               ** Resized to fit on minimal number of pages**


               [Showing Pictures of City Life]


                                     NARRATOR

                         No one would have believed in the early 
                         years of the21st century, that our world 
                         was being watched by intelligences greater 
                         than our own. That as men busied themselves 
                         about their various concerns, they observed 
                         and studied. Like the way a man with 
                         a microscope might scrutinize the creatures 
                         that swarm and multiply in a drop of 
                         water. With infinite complacency men 
                         went to and fro about the globe, confident 
                         of our empire over this world. Yet, 
                         across the gulf of space, intellects, 
                         vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded 
                         our plant with envious eyes. And slowly 
                         and surely, drew their plans against 
                         us.

 
               EXT. DOCK - CARGO BAY - DAWN


               Ray (in his 30s, short hair, rough groomed, almost always wears 
               his New York baseball cap, raggedly dressed, looks like he hasn't 
               slept in days) is moving cargo boxes from the ship to ground 
               loading brackets. Shots show him inside the control room operating 
               the levers. As the last car is loaded, he is seen walking down 
               the stairs.

 
                                     SAL

                         Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa!


               Ray turns away and laughs because he already knows what he is 
               going to say.

 
                                     SAL

                         I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00 
                         I got half of Korea coming in.

 
                                     RAY

                         No, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour 
                         blow! Call Tadesko. 

 
               Camera follows them walking down the street.


                                     SAL

                         Tadesko can't move 40 containers in 
                         an hour. I need somebody who can do 
                         double picks.

 
                                     RAY

                         I wish I could help you Sal. God damn 
                         union regulations.

 
                                     SAL

                         (getting angry) Come on, I'm in a position 
                         here!

 
                                     RAY

                         Come on, you remember the union regulations, 
                         Sal.
 
                                     SAL

                         (angrily) You know what your problem 
                         is?

 
               Sal stops on one side of the street while Ray continues walking.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (joking) I can think of a couple of 
                         women who'd be happy to tell you. 

 
                         
               EXT. RAY'S CAR - DRIVEWAY - DAWN


               Ray gets out and takes the last can of trash to the street as 
               Tim (in his 30s, wearing expensive clothes, slicked sharp hair, 
               extremely well groomed, looks like (and is) rich) and Ray's ex-wife 
               Mary Ann (in her 30s, pregnant with maternity clothes on, hair 
               hanging loose and rather unkempt) stand at their new car. Robbie 
               (15, ragged, tough look, long hair, partially groomed, worn clothes 
               (but looks in style), hip side pack with misc. objects in it.) 
               and Rachel (10, still dressed in Barbie color scheme clothing, 
               long unkempt hair in pigtails) are in the car.

 
                                     RAY

                         Is it 8:30? We say that?


                                     MARY ANN

                         We said 8:00.


                                     RAY

                         (changing subject) Hey, this is one 
                         safe looking vehicle you got yourself 
                         here Tim. Congratulations.

 
                                     TIM

                         Thank You.


                                     RAY

                         8 o'clock huh?


                                     MARY ANN

                         Um-Huh. We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday, 
                         depending on the traffic.

 
               Robbie gets out of the car, carelessly banging the door on the 
               electrical pole. He is listening to his MP3 player at a loud 
               enough volume for the camera (10' away to hear).

 
                                     RAY

                         There he is! You got a hug?


               Robbie ignores him as if he was not there and heads up to the 
               front door of the house.

 
                                     RAY

                         (continues) Confusing handshake? (joking) 
                         Kick in the teeth? The door's locked. 
                         (to Mary Ann): Still working on those 
                         manners?

 
               Mary Ann nods "yes" as Rachel gets out of the car.


                                     RACHEL

                         Hello dad.


                                     RAY

                         Hello, Rachel!


               Rachel gives him a hug and goes back to the car to retrieve her 
               bag. She struggles and Mary Ann, Tim, and Ray try to help which 
               results in a small bicker argument. (Ray, Tim, and Mary Ann add 
               lib.)

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (during bickering, at the front door) 
                         The door's locked.

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         (suit case in hand) I'll just get it 
                         in the door.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         It's got rollers, just roll it.


                                     MARY ANN

                         Well we can't roll it up the stairs 
                         now can we?

 
                                     RAY

                         Really, I got it from here, okay?

 
                         
               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN


               Mary Ann, Rachel, Ray, and Tim walk into the kitchen as Robbie 
               heads straight upstairs to his room. Mary Ann sees a car engine 
               next to the kitchen table and looks at Ray in disgust. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (to Tim) It's a 302 V8. It's gonna be 
                         out of here next week.

 
               Mary Ann walks over to the refrigerator to check for the basic 
               food supplies. Ray gets frustrated that she is going through 
               HIS stuff.

 
                                     RAY

                         (trying to get her to leave) You better 
                         get going if you want to beat the traffic, 
                         don't you think?

 
               Mary Ann ignores his comment as she opens the refrigerator which 
               is almost empty. 

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         You're out of milk. (smells it) And 
                         everything else.

 
               Shot of Rachel, intensely listening from the stairs.


                                     RAY

                         (mad) Would you close the door please? 
                         Now that that's my refrigerator.

 
                         
                                     TIM

                         I'm gonna go wait outside. (to Rachel) 
                         I love you sweetheart (hugs her) see 
                         you in a few days.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Bye Tim.


                                     MARY ANN

                         I'd better get this upstairs.


               Ray tries to further rid of her but she continues.


                                     RACHEL

                         (trying to get her bag form Mary Ann) 
                         Mom, Mom!

 
                                     RAY

                         Mary Ann, let me get this.


                                     MARY ANN

                         I can get it.


                                     RAY

                         (rushes to close his bedroom door, as 
                         if hiding something) Excuse me.

 
               Ray gets his door closed as Mary Ann goes into Rachel and Robbie's 
               room.

 
               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RACHEL AND ROBBIE'S ROOM - DAWN


               Mary Ann and Ray go into the room where Robbie is laying on his 
               bed listening to his MP3 player. Rachel sits down on her bed.

 
               
                                     MARY ANN

                         A little old to still be sharing aren't 
                         they?

 
                                     RAY

                         I don't hear any complaints.


                                     MARY ANN

                         No, I do.


               Mary Ann walks over to Robbie on his bed and grabs his MP3 player. 
               She un-plugs the headphones and the music stops. Ray sits down 
               on a desk chair.

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         Robbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie 
                         to make sure he's listening) ...on the 
                         French occupation of Algeria due Monday 
                         which he's yet to begin. It would be 
                         nice if he were done by the time we 
                         got back so we don't have to keep him 
                         up all night on Sunday.

 
               Mary Ann looks at Robbie who promptly says...


                                     ROBBIE

                         I just got to type it up. (makes typing 
                         motion)

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         No, you just got to start writing it 
                         first.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (interrupts her) I love you mom!


               Mary Ann kisses him.


                                     MARY ANN

                         I love you. (begins walking over to 
                         Rachel) Listen to your father.

 
               Mary Ann hugs Rachel and promptly notices...


                                     MARY ANN

                         Oh, no shoes on the bed.

                         We'll be at my parent's house in Boston 
                         but don't call the house line, because 
                         you know. Well the point is I've got 
                         my cell phone. So if anything comes 
                         up, or if you have any questions just 
                         call.

                         Mary Ann? (beat) It's a good look for 
                         you.

 
               Mary Ann opens door and proceeds to walk out the door. She stops 
               to say...

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         You think?

                         Yeah.


                                     MARY ANN

                         Take care of our kids.


                                     RAY

                         Mary Ann, you got nothing to worry about. 
                         Listen, you tell your mother that Ray 
                         sends his love and kisses.

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         (laughs) She'll love that.


               Mary Ann leaves.

               Robbie is watching the TV stories about lighting storms in other 
               parts of the world. Channel changes ever few seconds. Ray turns 
               off the TV and throws Robbie's baseball mitt at him. He catches 
               it and says...

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Baseball season's over.

                         There he is. (Robbie puts on his new 
                         cap) Boston? (hesitating) That's how 
                         it is? (no response from Robbie) That's 
                         how it's gonna be?

 
               Robbie throws ball at Ray unexpectedly who catches it just barely 
               and comments...

 
                                     RAY

                         Careful with that throw.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Whatever Ray!


                                     RAY

                         Your mom says you've got a report due 
                         on Monday, so you are going to work 
                         on that when you're done here.

 
               During next lines (until noted) they throw the ball back and 
               fourth.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah, I'm almost finished, I just got 
                         to type it up.

 
                                     RAY

                         Yeah, bullshit!


                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah, and what do you know Ray?


                                     RAY

                         Everything. Haven't you heard? Between 
                         me and my brother, we know everything.

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         What's the capital of Australia?


                                     RAY

                         That's one my brother knows.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Is it okay with you if I just laugh 
                         the first 500 times you tell that one.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Just do your report. We don't send you 
                         to school so you can flunk out.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         You don't pay for it, Tim does.


               Ray throws the ball at Robbie hard enough to knock dust off his 
               mitt. Robbie shakes his hand in his mitt and grits his teeth 
               in pain.

 
                                     RAY

                         That's half of what I've got.


                                     ROBBIE

                         You're an asshole. I hate coming here.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         That why you act like such a dick?

 
                         
               Ray throws the ball and Robbie purposely misses, shattering a 
               window behind him. Robbie turns his hat backwards and walks up 
               the stairs back into the house. Ray stares at Rachel who stares 
               back.

 
                                     RAY

                         What?

                         to him. You want him to listen to you...

               pull it out. Rachel and Ray ad lib as she stops moving it and 
               he looks at it.

                         From the health food place. I kept one 
                         of their menus last time we were here.

                         I don't know. He just took your car 
                         and left.

               He glances at his open garage door with the car that should have 
               been in it. He runs across the street to search for his car. 
               As he sees everyone else looking at the sky, he looks himself 
               to find a large black cloud with a white hole in the middle of 
               it. The cloud is swirling as if it was being artificially turned.

               Ray runs by the fence to his back yard. As he runs, the wind 
               starts to pick up. 30-40 mph. 

 
                                     RAY

                         That is so weird.


                                     FRIEND 2

                         What?


                                     RAY

                         The wind is blowing toward the storm. 
                         

 
                                     FRIEND 2

                         That is weird.


               Winds pick up faster. 40-50 mph.


                                     RAY

                         Rachel, wanna see something cool?

 

                Rachel rushes down the stairs to his side and hugs him in fear. 
                Pan up to view the 'storm' that appears to be lighting up with 
                multiple colored lights. Wide angle shot of clothes blowing in
                the wind. Suddenly the wind dies down to nothing. Lightning hits
                the pavement about 300 feet away.


                                     RAY

                         It's okay.


                                     RACHEL

                         I want to go inside.


                                     RAY

                         It's okay.


                                     RACHEL

                         I want to go inside.


                                     RAY

                         Okay, you go ahead.


               The friend's baby starts to cry...


                                     FRIEND 2

                         That's enough weather for me. (begins 
                         walking inside)

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I don't want to go by myself.


               BAM!! BAM!! BAM!!! LIGHTNING hits the ground more rapidly and 
               louder now. Rachel and Ray run towards the eves of the house. 
               BAM! The lighting continues. BAM!

 
                                     RAY

                         Kind of fun, ain't it?


                                     RACHEL

                         No.


                                     RAY

                         Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of 
                         July.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         No it's not.


               Ray begins singing as... BAM!! The LIGHTNING gets even louder 
               and scares the both of them enough to hightail it for the house. 
               BAM!!! Half the car alarms go off in a 10 block radius. BAM!! 
               Another few car alarms go off. BAM!!! Louder and louder the LIGHTNING 
               continues.

 
               INT Ray's House - Kitchen - Day


               Ray and Rachel are running as fast as they can up the stairs 
               into the kitchen. BAM!! The lighting continues again and makes 
               Rachel scream.

 
                                     RAY

                         It's okay. You're fine.


                                     RACHEL

                         It hit right behind our house.


                                     RAY

                         Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there 
                         again because lighting doesn't strike 
                         twice in the same place.

 
               BAM!! It hits again and makes Ray jump.


                                     RAY

                         Oh, SHIT!


               They both get under the table for safety as the LIGHTING continues. 
               They both begin panicking. BAM!! BAM!! BAM!! The LIGHTNING goes 
               on with no apparent end. Ray and Rachel both scurry on the floor 
               under the table as the lighting goes on.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where's Robbie?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know.


                                     RACHEL

                         Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you 
                         okay?

 
               BAM! The lighting continues.


                                     RAY

                         Where's the thunder?


                                     RACHEL

                         Why won't it stop?


               Pan out from under the table as the lightning subsides and all 
               is silent.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (with hesitation) Is it over?


               Ray remains speechless as he is fixated on the area where the 
               lightening came from. Ray climbs out from under the table to 
               get an idea of what just happened.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where are you going?


                                     RAY

                         Just checking things out. Just wait, 
                         wait there.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Are we going to be okay?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know.


                                     RACHEL

                         You don't know.


                                     RAY

                         No. I meant... Rachel, please, just 
                         stop asking so many questions. Just 
                         wait here.

 
               Ray walks around to various parts of the kitchen to see if everything 
               is okay. The power is off. After saying "just wait here" he then 
               walks into the living room. Nothing in the living room has power. 
               He checks his phone which doesn't work. He tries his cell phone 
               which also appears to not work at all. He sees his watch which 
               has also stopped working. 

 
               EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD AREA - EVENING


               Pan left to see the storm cloud still lighting up in some spots. 
               

 
               EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - FRONT STREET - EVENING


               Ray walks down the stairs to see that nobody else has power and 
               for some reason all the cars seem to have just stopped working. 
               By now we get the picture (EMP). He walks out onto the sidewalk 
               where he is joined by his friend.

 
                                     FRIEND 2

                         You believe this Ray? Every single car.

 
                         
               Ray walks past her onto the street where he sees ROBBIE walking 
               up the street towards him. Ray begins running towards him.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (worried) Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. 


                                     ROBBIE

                         The car just stopped and...


                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) You're okay? Are you 
                         okay?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         ... and the lighting started hitting 
                         about a block away over and over again. 
                         And me and this other guy we...

 
                                     RAY

                         (getting angry) Where the hell'd you 
                         go?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Over on Lincoln Avenue. (break) ... 
                         by the church.

 
                                     RAY

                         Did you see it? Did you... Were you 
                         near it?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and 
                         over the lighting started hitting. It 
                         opened up this hole or something...

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         26 times?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah.


                                     RAY

                         Okay, well, you're okay?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah.


                                     RAY

                         Good, because your sister is in the 
                         house, I want you to go in that house 
                         and I want you to stay with her. Okay? 
                         (break, as he starts running down the 
                         street) And the next time you take my 
                         car with no driver's license and no 
                         permission, I call the cops. You better 
                         be there when I get back. 

 
               Robbie doesn't move in fear. Ray gets angry that he is not going. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie. (snaps his hands together)

 
                         
               Ray begins walking down the street to the auto shop a few yards 
               away.

 
                                     RAY

                         Manny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it, 
                         dead?

 
                                     MANNY

                         All of them, everything, look at this... 
                         (taps the starter motor) starter's fried. 
                         

 
                                     RAY

                         Lightning hit it? 


                                     MANNY

                         Not even close. I thought if I changed 
                         it... you got any idea what's going 
                         on?

 
                                     RAY

                         I'm on my way to find out. Try umm... 
                         try changing the solenoids.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Right, (to accompanying mechanic) Right 
                         see, I told you that, the solenoids.

 
                         
               Everyone who's car is fried is checking their car to see what 
               went wrong. Ray joins about 30 people walking down to where the 
               lightning started hitting. Ray's friends join him. Cops walk 
               by.

 
                                     COP 1

                         Hey, what up, Ray?


                                     RAY

                         (joking) I should of known you two were 
                         behind this.

 
                                     FRIEND 3

                         Hey, god's pissed off at the Neibor 
                         hood 

 
                                     RAY

                         Can you blame him?


                                     FRIEND 4

                         You see it?


                                     RAY

                         Yep, you got power where you are?

 
                         
                                     FRIEND 3

                         Nope, nothing.


                                     RAY

                         It's the cars though. That's the thing.

 
                         
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Solar Flare, that's what this guy told 
                         me. 

 
                                     RAY

                         A solar flare?


                                     FRIEND 4

                         Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma, 
                         they turn into solar flare flashes. 
                         It's the only thing that can kill all 
                         of the electronic stuff.

 
                                     FRIEND 3

                         Can I say something?


                                     FRIEND 4

                         What bro?

                         The sun does not cause lightning, okay?

 
                         
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Bro, I'm just telling you what that 
                         guy said he heard.

 
                                     FRIEND 3

                         I know but it just sounds dumb saying 
                         that...

 
               Ray and his friends walk up to this hole in the ground where 
               everyone else is gathered around. 

 
                                     COP 1

                         I never seen anything like this before. 
                         That many strikes of lighting in one 
                         spot.

 
               The cops start ushering people to stay back away from the hole.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Is this the only place?


               Ray picks up a stone that is white next to all the black asphalt 
               crumbs. He switches it from hand to hand because it is too cold 
               to hold in one hand.

 
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Is it hot?


                                     RAY

                         No. It's freezing.


               The police officers and the other people gathered around feel 
               a vibration under their feet.

 
                                     COP 2

                         What is that?


                                     RAY

                         You feel that?


                                     FRIEND 3

                         Yeah, I feel that.


                                     FRIEND 4

                         What is it the subway?


                                     COP 1

                         There's no subway here.


                                     FRIEND 4

                         PATH Train maybe?


                                     COP 1

                         That can't be the water main. 


                                     COP 2

                         There's nothing else down there.


                                     COP 1

                         The water main doesn't run through here.

 
                         
                                     COP 2

                         Well, there's something down there and 
                         it's moving.

 
               The pavement starts to crack into a wider circle. People start 
               running away from the crack as it gets bigger and bigger. Windows 
               start to crack under pressure as the pavement separates even 
               more. Entire sheets of road split into pieces causing everyone 
               on the road to loose their balance. Shots of more shattering 
               windows. Busting pipes. The church starts cracking apart and 
               moving with a GIANT CIRCLE of pavement that moves. The pavement 
               lurches up and then caves down. A few cars go tumbling in. Something 
               throws the last car that tumbled in back out flying through the 
               air as a leg of the robot makes a lurch out of the hole. The 
               police continue trying to move people away. The engines of the 
               ship start coming out as they power up. The entire ship comes 
               out and begins dusting it's self off. Ray and his friends hide 
               behind a building. 

 
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Oh my god.


               Ray begins walking out from behind the building.


                                     FRIEND 4

                         Ray, no, stay man.


               The machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to 
               other robots. It arms it's disintegrator beams and opens fire. 
               People can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the 
               beam. The beams, when fired make a zap sound. People start exploding 
               into dust and their clothes are blown away. Ray misses numerous 
               beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store. Again 
               Ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches. 
               He runs his ass off trying to escape the robot. Disintegrator 
               beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path. Ray hides 
               behind a building as the machine walks by.

 
               EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - PORCH -  EVENING


               Ray walks into the house where he is met by Rachel's gawking 
               eyes out the window. Robbie stands in the background looking 
               at the doorway. Ray walks past Rachel then Robbie toward the 
               kitchen. Rachel and Robbie follow him into the kitchen. With 
               anxious eyes, Robbie begins to say...

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         What happened?


               Ray sits down against the wall of the island countertop in the 
               kitchen, not responding.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What's going on?


               Robbie squats down next to Ray as Rachel rests her elbows on 
               the stool at the island.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad, what's the matter?


                                     ROBBIE

                         What's all that stuff all over you?

 
                         
               Ray seems to be delirious as he slurs his head towards Robbie.

                         Rachel reaches through a leg of the 
                         island to pull at Ray's hood on his 
                         shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his 
                         head toward Rachel fast enough to make 
                         some of the white powder poof off as 
                         if jerked back into reality. Robbie 
                         jumps as well in fright.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What's all the stuff?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Hello? Ray?


               Ray looks at his arms which are coated in the white powder. He 
               gets up and begins heading for the bathroom. Still unresponsive 
               to the questions he was just asked. He looks in the mirror to 
               see that he is covered in the whit powder (human ash). He quickly 
               does his best to wash it off realizing what it is. After washing 
               it off, he begins mentally planning what to do.

 
               Walking back into the kitchen...


                                     RAY

                         We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

 
                         
               Ray grabs an old Penzoil box and dumps the tools out of it. He 
               shoves the box into Robbie who grasps it as to not fall over 
               at the force Ray used.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (questioning) What? Wait. I have no 
                         idea what's going on...

 
                                     RAY

                         (while Robbie asks) ... all the food 
                         from the refrigerator and the cupboard, 
                         put it in here.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         I think we are having a bit of a shock 
                         here...what's going on, just tell me...

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Just do it.


               Ray runs toward the table, grabs a flashlight and begins to try 
               to get it to work.

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel, sweetheart... 


                                     RACHEL

                         Dad, you're really scaring me.


                                     RAY

                         I need you to get your suitcase...

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad. (break) Dad!


                                     RAY

                         The one that you brought, bring it to 
                         me, okay?

 
               Ray shoves cereal boxes aside to get to the cabinet over the 
               refrigerator for batteries. Hastily grabbing the package, he 
               realizes they are probably dead due to the EMP.

 
                                     RAY

                         Can you do that for me, darling?


               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RAY'S ROOM - EVENING


               Ray runs into his room while Rachel and Robbie are downstairs. 
               He hastily enters the combination to a metal box that contains 
               a hand gun. He tucks the gun into his belt on his back and folds 
               his shirts over it.

 
               Street Sidewalk - Evening


               Ray, Rachel, and Robbie are walking at a very fast pace down 
               the sidewalk with about 20 other people around them. Rachel is 
               clutching Ray's hand and Robbie is carrying the box of food. 
               

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         What's happening?


                                     RAY

                         Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now. We... 
                         We've only got about another minute.

 
                         
               Ray sees the car that Manny was working on just as Manny's Apprentice 
               closes the hood. Ray mutters...

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, Please, Please.


               People are seen rushing down the street in the intersecting direction. 
               Ray, Robbie and Rachel approach the car.

 
                                     RAY

                         Just keep it down.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Ray, I'm standing right beside you. 
                         Can you please answer me?

 
               Ray does not respond as he looks in the ignition and finds keys.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Just get in the front seat Robbie.

 
                         
               Ray loads Rachel in the middle row of seats as Robbie gets in 
               the passenger seat.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Who's car is this?


                                     RAY

                         Just get in.


                                     RACHEL

                         Who's car is this?


               Ray throws Rachel's bag in the row of seats behind her, slams 
               the door and starts walking to the driver side of the car. He 
               is caught by Manny walking.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Hey, Hey, Ray! You were absolutely right. 
                         I had to change the sole... Ray?

 
                         
               Manny sees Ray has loaded his whole family into the car.


                                     MANNY

                         Hey Ray? Ray? What? 


               Manny walks over to the passenger side as Ray and Robbie watch 
               him.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Ray. Open up.


               Ray, who did no such thing sits there. Robbie looks at ray wondering 
               what he's going to do.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Open the door, come on! OPEN THE DOOR 
                         RAY!

 
               Ray reaches over Robbie and opens the door.


                                     MANNY

                         What are you...


                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) Get in.


                                     MANNY

                         That's funny, you gotta get out of the 
                         car. You can't take it.

 
               Ray tries to get Manny to calm down from the panic he is in...

 
               
                                     MANNY

                         It's not my car. It's not your car. 
                         Where you going? Daddy's acting crazy 
                         kids. Guy's gonna come back...

 
                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) I don't have time to 
                         expl....

 
                                     MANNY

                         (interrupts him) You're busting my chops. 
                         I got a shop to run. You know how many 
                         people...

 
                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) Get in!


                                     MANNY

                         No, RAY GET OUT OF THE...


                                     RAY

                         GET IN MANNY OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE!

 
                         
               Rachel begins crying as she says...


                                     RACHEL

                         What do you mean?


               A dead silent pause falls on everyone. Robbie stares at Ray in 
               fright as Ray and Manny stare at each other.

 
                                     MANNY

                         All right, get out of the truck! I'm 
                         not kidding now. GET OUT OF THE CAR 
                         RAY!

 
               Rachel cries more as a view of an approaching robot shoots flame 
               at a nearby tree. Ray and Manny continue as Rachel looks at the 
               flaming tree.

 
                                     MANNY

                         I'm not fooling around, I got a busy 
                         day ahead of me...

 
                                     RAY

                         (to Robbie) Close the door! CLOSE IT!

 
                         
               Ray helps Robbie close the door on Manny as they begin speeding 
               away.

 
                                     MANNY

                         RAY! BRING THE CAR BACK RAY! IT'S NOT 
                         MY CAR!

 
               Manny just finishes his line as he is zapped by a disintegrator 
               beam. Camera shows the auto shop zapped by the beam and exploding 
               to smithereens. 

 
               INT. CAR - DUSK


               Trying to outrun the beams...


                                     RAY

                         GET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN!


                                     RACHEL

                         Is this the terrorists?!?!


                                     RAY

                         JUST GET DOWN. GET DOWN!


               Ray grabs Robbie's collar of his jacket and shoves him toward 
               the floor.

 
                                     RAY

                         GET DOWN!


                                     ROBBIE

                         HOLY SHIT!


               High shot shows the bridge behind Ray's house being blasted away. 
               The expressway gets hit by the beams and overturns into the houses 
               below. One of them Ray's. An explosion is seen as a fuel tanker 
               falls on Ray's house that obliterates 4 houses. Flaming debris 
               flies all over behind the van.

 
               The van has now made it on to the freeway where hundreds of cars 
               are scattered all over the road broken down. The van speeds by 
               them honking the horn every few cars.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Where are we going?!?!?!


                                     RAY

                         We gotta go! We got to be the only working 
                         car around here. I'm not stopping until 
                         we are clear. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         CLEAR OF WHAT?!?! 


                                     RAY

                         We gotta go.


                                     ROBBIE

                         WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!?!?!?


                                     RAY

                         YOU SAW! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!!


               Rachel begins frantically crying. After a few seconds, she begins 
               hyperventilating. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         BY WHO? WHO IS ATTACKING US?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Rachel... Rachel you've got to keep 
                         it down Rachel!

 
               After honking his horn a few more times, she has only gotten 
               worse.

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel! SHUT UP RACHEL! I CAN'T THINK!

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         (with a vein driven face) YOU ARE FREAKING 
                         HER OUT!!

 
                                     RAY

                         WELL, LOOK, I'M DRIVING, DO SOMETHING!!!

 
                         
               Robbie turns to the back seat as an attempt to calm Rachel. He 
               thinks of an old technique he was taught.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Okay, (slapping his arms together on 
                         top of each other, demonstrating) Put 
                         em' up Rache.

 
               Rachel makes his demonstrated arm formation.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Make the arms. (he grabs her elbows 
                         so she holds the position. He begins 
                         to calm her down) This space right here, 
                         this is yours.

 
               Robbie stares directly into her eyes. She takes deep breaths 
               to regain control. She is able to open her eyes and stare back 
               into his eyes to maintain contact.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         ... This belongs to you, right? 


                                     RACHEL

                         (panting, but keeping eye contact) Yes...

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         (reassuring her) You're safe in your 
                         space. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (keeping eye contact) I'm safe in my 
                         space.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (reassuring her) You're safe in your 
                         space. Nothing is going to happen to 
                         you in your space. 

 
               Ray looks back into the back seat in amazement at Robbie able 
               to do what he's doing.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm really scared.


                                     ROBBIE

                         I'm gonna go to the front seat to talk 
                         to dad...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         No....


                                     ROBBIE

                         (reassuring her) I will be two feet 
                         away. Okay.

 
               Rachel breaks eye contact and starts controlling her breathing 
               while Robbie grabs her hand as reassurance.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Will you hold my hand?


                                     RACHEL

                         Yes.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Are you gonna be okay?


                                     RACHEL

                         (relatively calm) Yes.


               Robbie grabs her hand and they both lean forward toward the front. 
               

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (taking a breath to calm himself) I 
                         want to know everything you know.

 
                         
               Ray looks into Robbie's eyes who is looking straight forward 
               on the road.

 
                                     RAY

                         This thing, this machine, it crawled 
                         out of the ground and started torching 
                         everything, just killing everybody.

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         What is it? (break) Is it terrorists?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         No, this came from some place else.

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         You mean like Europe?


                                     RAY

                         NO ROBBIE!! NOT LIKE EUROPE!!!


               Ray swerves to miss a car as the camera cranes around to the 
               driver's side.

 
                                     RAY

                         That machine, it was already buried. 
                          

 
               Ray looks into the sky. What for is unknown.


                                     RAY

                         Maybe it came down in the lightning 
                         storm. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Wait a minute... you just said it was 
                         buried.

 
                                     RAY

                         No, the machine I'm talking about was 
                         buried. But, what came down in the lighting 
                         storm, what operates it. That's the... 
                         that's the.... You know. The....

 
                         
               Robbie jumps back into the passenger's seat as Rachel scoots 
               forward in the back seat. Robbie is looking toward the sky. 

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         The what?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Why aren't there any helicopters or 
                         airplanes?

 
                                     RAY

                         Hey Rache. How you doing there girl? 
                         (to Robbie) How she doing?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         How you doing?


                                     RACHEL

                         I'm fine.


                                     ROBBIE

                         (to Ray) She's good.


                                     RAY

                         Good.  Hey, what was that thing you 
                         did with her?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Works sometimes. She gets claustrophobic. 
                         

 
                                     RAY

                         Hey Rachel


                                     RACHEL

                                     RAY

                         I know. You feel better?


                                     RACHEL

                         I want mom.


                                     RAY

                         Yeah, tell me about it, you know?

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         Take me to Mom's!


                                     RAY

                         Listen, I just need you to hold it together 
                         for me, okay?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I WANT MOM!!!


                                     RAY

                         When you start screaming like that, 
                         you know, I can't really...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         TAKE ME TO MOM!!!


               Robbie gets back into the back seat to repeat the "arms" process 
               with her to calm her again.

 
                                     RAY

                         I know...


                                     RACHEL

                         TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!


                                     RAY

                         That's where we're going right now.

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!


                                     RAY

                         I KNOW!!


               EXT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - DUSK


               Still in the car...


                                     RACHEL

                         Come on, hurry up Dad...


               As soon as the van stops, Robbie gets out and opens the door 
               for Rachel.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie, get the door.... (she knocks 
                         on it)

 
               Robbie grabs the keys off his belt loop as Rachel begins running 
               up to the front door.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (begins, and continues once in the house) 
                         MOM! TIM!!

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (begins, and continues once in the house) 
                         MOM!! TIM!!

 
               Ray remains in the car realizing how unimportant he really is 
               (kids are shouting for Tim).

 
               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - ENTRY - DUSK


               Rachel and Robbie are shouting for "mom" and "Tim" as Ray walks 
               through the door. Rachel and Robbie meet Ray in the entry from 
               different parts of the house in their search. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         They're gone.


                                     RACHEL

                         Is she dead??


                                     RAY

                         She's not dead. All right? She's just 
                         no here. Okay? They're never here.

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         How do you know?


                                     RAY

                         Because they are on their way to Boston....

 
                         
               The camera goes to the phone which is briskly picked up by Robbie. 
               Then the camera views into the new family vacation portrait next 
               to the phone. It has Ray missing who is replaced by Tim.

 
                                     RAY

                         ... and so they just kept on going, 
                         they're probably up to your grandma's 
                         house by now.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (dialing the phone) I'm gonna call her.

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         How come the lights are on here and 
                         not at your place?

 
                                     RAY

                         Umm.... Because nothing bad happened 
                         here. Okay?

 
               Robbie is having no luck and is only getting error tones out 
               of the phone.

 
                                     RAY

                         So, were safe here. All Right?


               Remembering Robbie's calming "arm" technique...


                                     RAY

                         Okay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay, 
                         you are safe in your area...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad. That's not how it goes.


                                     RAY

                         Okay, well, you hungry, huh? I'll get 
                         you some food. I'm gonna feed you. Get 
                         something to eat.  (digs into the box) 
                         What do we have here??

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         .. Busy signals, one of the fast ones.... 
                         You think all the circuits are down?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (continues) Ketchup, Mustard, Ahh, Tabasco, 
                         Barbeque Sauce. This is really good 
                         Robbie. Vinaigrette. I said pack food. 
                         What... What the hell is this?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         That's all that was in your kitchen.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Okay. No, it's all right, it's all right. 
                         

 
               Robbie takes his hat off and sits down as Ray searches the box 
               for food. He finds peanut butter. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Uh, food... Uh, bread... (getting the 
                         bread) okay, we're gonna have... umm.... 
                         We'll just get some sandwiches.

 
               Ray takes the twist tie off the bread bag and dumps the whole 
               loaf on the counter. He taps his hands together to try to calm 
               Rachel and Robbie.

 
                                     RAY

                         You ever see me deal? Wanna see me deal? 
                         Okay, there's two for you, two for Robbie, 
                         two for me, (he has one extra in his 
                         hand) ...one for the house. (laughs) 
                         

 
               Ray opens the peanut butter and grabs a wooden spoon from the 
               cooking utensil holder on the counter.

 
                                     RAY

                         Maybe after we get done eating, I will 
                         take you down, teach you how to play 
                         some poker. A little five card stud... 
                         a little blackjack...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm allergic to peanut butter.


                                     RAY

                         (laughs) Since when?


                                     RACHEL

                         (with a snotty look) Birth!


               Robbie shakes his head yes to her statement. 


                                     RAY

                         Okay, well, umm, here (hands her two 
                         pieces of bread) You can eat the bread. 
                         Okay?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm not hungry.


                                     RAY

                         Okay, well. Robbie and I are going to 
                         be eating peanut butter sandwiches. 
                         (to Robbie) You want jelly on this sandwich?

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         I'm not hungry either.


                                     RAY

                         You're not hungry either? Well, that's 
                         fine.

 
               Ray picks up the bread pieces and throws them at the sink window. 
               One with peanut butter sticks on the window and slowly slides 
               off.

 
                                     RAY

                         Everybody just relax, okay? Because 
                         we are here now and we're safe, and 
                         we're gonna stay.  And in the morning 
                         your mom and Tim are going to be here 
                         and everything's gonna be fine. Okay? 
                         (no responses) Okay.

 
               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK


               Rachel and Ray are running down the stars carrying their own 
               pillows and blankets. Robbie follows slightly behind them carrying 
               his own and a few extra pillows and blankets. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         If everything's fine, why do we have 
                         to sleep in the basement. We've got 
                         perfectly good beds. 

 
                                     RAY

                         It's like a slumber party.


                                     ROBBIE

                         What are you afraid is gonna happen 
                         to us?

 
                                     RAY

                         (walks over to the weight room corner 
                         of the basement) Nice basement.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I want to sleep in my bed. I've got 
                         back problems.

 
                                     RAY

                         Okay. You know on the Weather Channel 
                         when there's a tornado, and they tell 
                         you to go to the basement for safety? 
                         It's like that.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         There's gonna be tornadoes? 


                                     RAY

                         Rachel, no more talking.


               Robbie puts his hat on Rachel's head and ushers her over to the 
               spot under the stairs where blankets are laid out. Ray walks 
               over to the chair about five feet away from the bed.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Could you be a little nicer to me. God!

 
                         
               Rachel and Robbie are heard in the background...


                                     ROBBIE

                         Wanna stay here?


                                     RACHEL

                         Yeah. Good night, love you.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Love you, Rache.


               Ray takes out his gun and puts it under a pillow of the sofa 
               as he sits down. So Robbie and Rachel wont notice.

 
               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT


               Bushes are heard rattling against the window. They become louder 
               and louder against the window. Eventually they become just shy 
               of loud enough to wake Ray up. FLASH! A strike of lighting gets 
               Ray's eyes to roll back around and open. BAM! The second flash 
               is loud enough to get Robbie (who is now in the seat next to 
               Ray) to jump up next to him. A few more flashes and the lightening 
               starts like the first time. BAM! BAM! Every strike of lighting 
               lights up the entire downstairs. Rachel gets up and looks thought 
               the stairs.

 
               A close up shot of Robbie. With every lightening strike, his 
               breathing becomes more erratic.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Is the lighting back?


                                     RAY

                         No, this is something else...


               Just as ray finishes, an ear piercing noise from a jet engine 
               begins. The howl rattles things off of shelves on the walls. 
               Robbie and Ray wince at the pain in their ears. Rachel runs up 
               to Robbie and hugs him in security. Things fall off of shelves 
               everywhere. 

 
               A shot of the incredibly bright window as the noise grows even 
               louder. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (screams) AHHHH... WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         I NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE!!!


                                     RACHEL

                         IS IT THEM!!! IS IT THEM!!!


               The lighting grows more intense as does the sound.


                                     RAY

                         WE GOTTA GO!! WHERE DO WE GO??? ROBBIE, 
                         THIS IS YOUR HOUSE, WHERE DO WE GO??

 
                         
               Robbie opens the door to the furnace room and shows Rachel down 
               the stairs who runs. Robbie goes back to get Ray.

 
               Ray realizes he has forgotten his gun.


                                     RAY

                         WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! 


               Ray and Robbie run to the door just as a fireball bursts through 
               the windows. Flaming debris follows after. Ray gets the first 
               door closed but the fire blasts through the wooden one. He manages, 
               after a struggle, to get the metal one closed on the inside of 
               the furnace room. 

 
               The door closes and the room is completely black. In the dark, 
               you can hear the debris being thrown around everywhere around 
               them.

               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - FURNACE ROOM - DAWN


               Ray is looking out the window at the top of the room. He is holding 
               on to the metal wire conduit. Seeing hardly anything, he judges 
               it to be safe to go outside the furnace room. 

 
               He walks by Rachel who is sleeping in Robbie's arms who is sleeping 
               against some copper piping. Holding his slightly burned arm in 
               pain, Ray exit's the room through the charred doors and finds 
               most of the basement in ruins. The ground floor is now the top 
               floor because the second floor was completely torn off. 

 
               The camera pans out to find a winding down, burning airplane 
               engine. Panning out further we can see ray walking through the 
               remains of different sections of an airplane. 

 
               EXT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - YARD - DAWN


               Ray sees the fuselage with one surviving person hauling a blue 
               cart through the aisle.

 
                                     RAY

                         Down here! 


               The man continues hauling the cart.


                                     RAY

                         Were you on this plane? Are you a passenger?

 
                         
               The cart comes flying down the fuselage doorway as the man creeps 
               down the floor to the ground.

               The news reporter comes rushing out from the side of the news 
               van in the background.

 
                                     RAY

                         Are you a passenger?

                         He's deaf. The shell went off right 
                         beside him. The camera on his shoulder 
                         saved his life. (to Max) You hear that 
                         Max? Your stupid camera saved your stupid 
                         life.

 
               They succeed in jimmying open the cart and begin bagging all 
               the water and food they can. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Where were you?


                                     NEWS REPORTER

                         Out there in the pine barrens. We were 
                         attached to a National Guard unit, the 
                         83rd Mechanized. They moved to one of 
                         those things around midnight. They've 
                         got some kind of shield around them. 
                         We can't see it, but everything we fire 
                         at them detonates too early before we 
                         can get close enough to cause any damage. 
                         When they flash that thing, everything 
                         lights up like Hiroshima. 

 
               She begins eating one of the meal packages.


                                     RAY

                         There's more than one?

                         We were feeding New York but New York 
                         went dark. So we patched over to D.C., 
                         they went down, L.A., Chicago, uplink 
                         to London. Even called the affiliates 
                         to try and get them to catch the feed, 
                         but nobody answered.

 
               The reporter looks at tapes to find the one she's looking for. 
               When she does so, she jams it into the VCR which promptly begins 
               playing it.

 
                                     REPORTER

                         It's the same everywhere. Once the tripods 
                         start to move, no more news comes out 
                         of that area. 

 
               She shows him a tape of about 30 tripods destroying a city. 

 
               
                                     RAY

                         You ain't seen nothing yet.


               She wheels her chair around to show him the next piece. 


                                     RAY

                         I saw that storm. I was right in the 
                         middle of one of those.

 
                                     REPORTER

                         No, you didn't see it like this. Those 
                         machines come up from under the ground, 
                         right? That means they must have been 
                         buried there a long time ago. So who's 
                         driving the god damn things? (pointing 
                         to the monitor) Watch the lightning. 
                         Watch it..... Watch the lighting.....

 
                         
               She slows the footage down so he can get a good look. She advances 
               it slowly. She points out an alien capsule like object running 
               down the lighting bolt. 

 
                                     RAY

                         What is that?


                                     REPORTER

                         That is them. They come down in capsules, 
                         riding the lighting into the ground 
                         into the machines right?

 
               A vibration noise is heard by an approaching robot. They both 
               jump at the noise.

 
                                     DRIVER

                         You hear that? We're getting the hell 
                         out of here.

 
               The camera man has his hands full of meals as he loads into the 
               van.

 
                                     DRIVER

                         Come on! Get in! Get in! Get in!


               The door almost closes on Ray as she stops and opens it again.

 
               
                                     REPORTER

                         Hey. Were you on that plane?


               Ray shakes his head no.


                                     REPORTER

                         Oh, that's too bad, it would have been 
                         a really great story. 

 
               She closes the door on him.

               Ray is talking to Rachel...


                                     RAY

                         Look at me. Look at me. 


               Rachel and Ray are putting on their coats.


                                     RAY

                         You keep your eyes only on me, you understand?

 
                         
               Rachel has her big eyes on him as she nods yes.


                                     RAY

                         Don't look down, don't look around me. 
                         I'm taking you to the car and you're 
                         gonna want to look around. But you are 
                         not going to, are you?

 
               She shakes her head and whispers "no".

               Ray is carrying Rachel to the van. Robbie is walking along behind 
               them looking at the devastation.

 
                                     RAY

                         You're doing good. You're doing good. 
                         Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right 
                         to Boston, and we're gonna see your

                                     RACHEL

                         I'm not gonna look, dad.


                                     RAY

                         That's a girl. That's my girl.  Okay, 
                         listen, I want you to close your eyes. 
                         Got them closed? 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Um-Huh. 


                                     RAY

                         There you go. Keep em' closed for me.

 
                         
               Camera follows Robbie who puts his hands on his head in amassment 
               of the devastation. Ray starts the car and turns it around to 
               pull out. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie, get in. 


               Robbie does not react at all. Ray becomes agitated. 


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!! GET IN!!!


                                     RACHEL

                         Why are you yelling?


               Ray gives him a mean look as Robbie realizes that they must go.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (to Rachel) It's okay. (to Robbie) Get 
                         in!

 
               They pull away from the wreckage and continue on their journey.

 
               
               EXT. VAN - DAY


               Ray is reading the map while Robbie looks out the window. They 
               are taking back roads that have nothing but farmlands on them. 
               

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Because I don't want everybody to see 
                         we've got a working car. (going over 
                         the plan) We'll stay along the Hudson 
                         until we find an open bridge or ferry, 
                         then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then 
                         take the back roads across Connecticut 
                         all the way to Boston. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where is everybody?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know. Running, hiding, hiding 
                         in their basements. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         If we had any balls, we'd go back there 
                         and find one of those things and kill 
                         it. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Yeah, well, why don't you just let me 
                         make the big decisions, okay?

 
               Ray shoves the map on the floorboard as he becomes more angry 
               at Robbie.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Which would be when? Never Ray? Never's 
                         about your speed.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Okay, enough Robbie!


                                     RAY

                         (angrily) Okay! Enough with the Ray 
                         shit!! It's dad, sir, or if you want 
                         Mr. Ferrier. That sounds a little weird 
                         to me but you decide.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Yes, Rachel.


                                     RACHEL

                         I have to go to the bathroom.


                                     RAY

                         Really?


               Rachel shakes her head "yes" as he pulls the car over.


               Ray grabs Robbie by the shirt arm and holds him in the car. He 
               glares at Rachel mean enough to make her freeze in her seat.

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         Come on. (tugs at his shirt sleeve which 
                         Ray has a hold of) I gotta go!

 
                                     RAY

                         Not so fast, not so fast, all right? 
                         Now, there are two things we have to 
                         watch out for, and the second is people 
                         who might want our car. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         There's nobody around!


                                     RACHEL

                         I gotta go.


               Robbie breaks free of Ray's grasp on his sleeve. Robbie and Rachel 
               both get out of the car. Ray follows the both of them to supervise 
               the whole event from the van.

 
                                     RAY

                         (displeased) Rachel! Rachel, that's 
                         good right there. (points to a spot 
                         20' away)

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'M NOT GOING IN FRONT OF YOU GUYS!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         All right, then just go where I can 
                         see you!

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ARE YOU CRAZY?? DON'T LOOK!!


                                     RAY

                         I'm not gonna look! JUST STAY IN SIGHT!!

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         THAT'S LOOKING!!


               Rachel is about 200 feet away entering a patch of bushes. Robbie 
               has already found a spot about 10' away next to the stream under 
               the road. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Listen. Every time you don't listen 
                         to me, I'm telling your mother, okay? 
                         I'm making a list. (reinforcing) I'm 
                         making a list!

 
               Rachel is entering the wooded area next to the stream looking 
               for a half way decent spot. She sees the river and looks at it 
               in beauty just as she sees a body floating down it. MORE BODIES 
               start coming at a huge rate. 20,30,40,50 bodies floating down 
               the river. Rachel begins to hyperventilate again as Ray comes 
               up from behind her and throws his hands over her eyes and grabs 
               her. 

 
                                     RAY

                         I told you to stay where I could see 
                         you!

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm sorry!


               Ray grabs her into his arms and begins walking back to the van.

 
               
               Army trucks can be heard crossing by the van. Robbie, who's only 
               interest is killing one of the robots sees this as an opportunity 
               to do so. Robbie runs toward the trucks and begins shouting....

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         STOP!! DO YOU HAVE ROOM??? STOP!!!

 
                         
               Some trucks pass by as the soldiers in them look at him blankly.

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         WAIT, STOP!!! LET ME ON!!! LET ME ON!!! 
                         GIVE ME A HAND!!!

 
               Robbie is getting soaked as the tank's tracks roll over the large 
               puddles of water. Robbie is not giving up hope that one may let 
               him on. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         WAIT!!! STOP!!! GIVE ME A HAND!!! YOU 
                         HAVE ROOM!!!

 
                                     SOLDIER

                         Watch it, kid! YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSLELF 
                         RUN OVER!!!

 
               Ray sees Robbie trying to get on with them. He has had enough 
               of Robbie and goes up to him to tell him....

 
                                     RAY

                         WHAT!?!?!  ROBBIE, YOU WANT TO GO IN 
                         THAT DIRECTION?

 
               Robbie, who ignores him is still shouting for them to stop.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         THERE'S NOTHING LIVING IN THAT DIRECTION, 
                         ROBBIE!!!

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         WHAT DO YOU CARE?!?!? YOU NEVER GAVE 
                         A SHIT BEFORE!!! YOU NEVER GAVE A SHIT!!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         OKAY, HARD ASS, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? YOU'RE

                                     ROBBIE

                         THEM!! THAT'S WHAT WE DO!!!

 
                                     RAY

                         WELL, NOW LET'S TRY ONE THAT DOSEN'T 
                         INVOLVE YOUR TEN YEAR OLD SISTER JOINING 
                         THE ARMY! YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT???

 
                         
               Ray and Robbie are about ready to start throwing punches at each 
               other as the tanks continue rolling by.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US THE TRUTH???

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT!


                                     ROBBIE

                         YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHICH WAY TO GO!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT?!?!?!

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         YOU WANNA COME OFF ALL WISE AND SHIT!! 
                         YOU ONLY CHOSE BOSTON BECAUSE YOU HOPE 
                         MOM IS THERE AND IF SHE'S THERE, YOU 
                         CAN DUMP US ON HER!!! YOU CAN DUMP US 
                         ON HER THEN YOU'LL ONLY HAVE TO CARE

                         WAY YOU LIKE IT!!!

 
               Robbie is shivering in the cold of his wet clothes but his adrenaline 
               keeps him fighting at Ray. They both can be seen with the air 
               from their nostrils flaring like a bull. Rachel rushes in as 
               an attempt to get Robbie to realize what he's doing.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ROBBIE!!! WHERE ARE YOU TRYING TO GO?!?! 
                         WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?!?!

 
               Rachel begins to cry as Robbie looks at her in sorrow. 


                                     RACHEL

                         WHOE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME IF YOU 
                         GO!!!

 
               Rachel's last line almost brings Robbie to tears as he picks 
               her up and starts walking over to the van. Ray stands next to 
               the still rolling army vehicles and begins to realize how this 
               brother and sister have come to rely on each other during the 
               divorce of their parents.

 
               INT. VAN - DAY


               Robbie is staring out the window in the exact opposite direction 
               of Ray. The radio is broadcasting the emergency alert test. Ray 
               turns off the radio and says...

 
                                     RAY

                         If I close my eyes, why don't you drive 
                         for a bit.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         I don't have a license.


                                     RAY

                         Since when has that stopped you?


               INT. VAN - DUSK


               Robbie is driving into a city. Ray is sleeping in the passenger 
               seat. The streets are crowded with people walking. Robbie gets 
               worried and gets Ray to drive. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Ray. (no response) Ray. (no response) 
                         Dad!

 
               Ray wakes up and Robbie tries to get him to take the wheel.

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         You think you could.... You think you 
                         could...

 
                                     RAY

                         Don't stop... don't take your foot off... 
                         Okay. I got it... I got it....

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where's everybody going?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know Rach. 


                                     RACHEL

                         But we do right?


                                     RAY

                         Yeah, we do.


               They continue driving through the crowd as they become more and 
               more mad at Ray for not letting them on. They begin banging on 
               the glass. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Why'd he do that?


               The man continues hitting the windshield.


                                     RACHEL

                         Why is he doing that?


                                     RAY

                         He wants a ride. Everybody just wants 
                         a ride.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Can we give him one?


                                     RAY

                         Just sit back and put on your seatbelt. 
                         Robbie, put on your seatbelt. 

 
               Rachel is busy looking at all the people who are now begging 
               for a ride.

 
                                     RAY

                         Put on your seatbelt Rachel.


               The three of them fasten their seatbelts.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Be careful.


               People bang on the windows louder as they shout "give me a ride".

 
               
                                     RAY

                         I'm sorry, I can't. Please get away 
                         from the car.

 
               A police man jumps on the hood and bangs on the window.


                                     RAY

                         HEY!!


                                     POLICE MAN 3

                         Stop the car!!


                                     RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER

                         GET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!!

 
                         
                                     POLICE MAN 3

                         You could carry 20 people in there! 
                         STOP THE CAR!!!

 
               Rachel is panicking and starts to do the "arms" process to stay 
               calm. 

 
                                     RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER

                         GET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!!

 
                         
               Ray hit's the gas pedal as the police man falls off the side 
               of the van. Ray speeds away now and gains some speed just as 
               someone throws debris into the windshield which breaks it. Rachel 
               screams in panic.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (screams) AHHHH!!


                                     RAY

                         Oh hold on!!


               Robbie and Ray see a woman standing dead in their way holding 
               a baby. They swerve to miss her.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Look out! Look out!


                                     RAY

                         (seeing a telephone pole) Oh, GOD!

 
                         
               The van smashes into the telephone pole and the pole lurches 
               about 20 feet. The transformer on the top of the pole begins 
               to arc and spark. The crowd is now rocking the van from side 
               to side shouting at about a riot level. 

 
               INT. VAN - DUSK


                                     RAY

                         Are you okay?


               Rachel has no time to respond before the back windshield is busted 
               open by a crowd member. The driver and passenger side windows 
               are then promptly busted. Robbie ducks to avoid the flying glass. 
               A man jumps on the hood and starts ripping glass away from the 
               hole in the front windshield. He is so desperate to get in the 
               van he rips his hands to shreds. A crowd member suggests to "push 
               it". He does so and the glass falls through.

 
               The passenger side door is opened and Robbie is pulled out by 
               the rioting crowd. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (screams) AHHHHH!!!! RAY!!!


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE?!?! ROBBIE?!?!?


               Ray then screams to the rioting crowd who are now pulling him 
               out of the driver's side window.

 
                                     RAY

                         NO, JUST WAIT!!! WAIT!! STOP!!! JUST 
                         STOP!!!

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DADDY!!!!


               A man from the crowd runs up to Rachel's window, breaks it, and 
               tries to grab Rachel. Ray pulls the man out and throws him back 
               into the crowd. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel!! (grabs guy) GET OUT OF THERE!!!

 
                         
               Ray is pushed by the man he just threw and hit's the driver's 
               side door. Ray kicks the guy square in the gut which gets him 
               back into the crowd.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DADDY!!!


               Ray wrestles another man trying to grab Rachel. The man gets 
               tossed to the ground. Just as Ray stands up... WHAM!!! Ray is 
               hit in the back of the head by a man with a baseball bat. The 
               blow was not severe enough to cause life threatening damage to 
               Ray. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (grasping his head in pain) AHHH!!!

 
                         
               Another man grabs Ray to try to fight him. Women in the crowd 
               yell to "stop them" but nobody does so. The man who is strangling 
               Ray yells to "get in the car". Robbie fought off the men who 
               pulled him out of the car, comes over to Ray's side, and begins 
               choking the man who is choking Ray. Robbie hit's the man's head 
               against the car. The man releases his grip on Ray, the man and 
               Robbie are drug into the rioting crowd beyond frame view. 

 
               
               A man gets into the driver's seat and tries to start the car.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (through a choking grip) Rachel, get 
                         out of the car! GET OUT OF THE CAR RACHEL!!!

 
                         
               Ray just barely finishes as he is drug off into the crowd beyond 
               frame. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DADDY!!!


               Rachel tries to get out, but there is an overflow of people barreling 
               into the car through the windows. She is surrounded by people 
               in the car. Robbie and Ray are getting beat in the crowd.

 
               
               Ray manages to pull out his gun. He fires off two rounds into 
               the air. The crowd instantly moves away from him. One man yells 
               "take it easy!" No sign of Robbie. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (pointing the gun at the people on the 
                         roof of the car) GET OFF THE CAR!! GET 
                         OFF!!!

 
               Men start getting off the car to avoid the gun threatening Ray. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (continues) GET OFF THE CAR!! Move!! 
                         Move!!

 
               Realizing Robbie is nowhere in sight....


                                     RAY

                         Where's my son?!?!


                                     RIOT MAN 1

                         You don't need that, Man!


                                     RAY

                         WHERE'S MY SON?!?! ROBBIE!!    .... 
                           ROBBIE!!

 
                                     RIOT MAN 2

                         Put the gun down, man. It's not me!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (still determined to find Robbie) ROBBIE!!!

 
                         
               Ray is able to pull Robbie out from the crowd. Robbie has a running 
               bloody nose and a badly bruised stomach. He is fighting to catch 
               his breath because he had it knocked out of him.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DAD!!!


               The camera moves from Robbie to Ray, then pivots on his face 
               to reveal a man holding another gun at Ray's head.

 
                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         Okay, man, now listen. Put down the 
                         gun. I'm taking the car. 

 
                                     RAY

                         My daughter's in the car...


                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         (shaking the gun nervously) Put down 
                         the gun, I'm taking the car.

 
                                     RAY

                         All I want is my daughter....


                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         PUT DOWN THE GOD DAMN GUN!!!


               Ray is scared into dropping his gun on the street. Ray then puts 
               his hands near his head to avoid being shot. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, all I want is my daughter. 

 
                         
                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         (surprisingly calm) I'm taking the car.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         I just want my daughter. Please just 
                         let me take my daughter, can I.... All 
                         I want is my daughter. 

 
                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         Yeah. Okay, go ahead, take her, take 
                         her, yeah, yeah....

 
               Ray grabs Rachel out of the car as the riot man gets in the driver's 
               seat and closes the door. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie!!


               Robbie, who has managed to get to his feet, hunched over, walks 
               over to Ray. Ray, with Rachel in his arms, and Robbie walk to 
               the diner on the street. The man backs up the car just as the 
               camera pans down to see a man who sees the gun on the street. 
               The man picks up Ray's gun and looks at the man in the van.

 
               
               INT. DINER - DUSK


               The three of them are walking to a booth in the diner. Ray, with 
               Rachel in his arms, is beginning to bleed from his head wound. 
               He walks with a slight limp. Rachel is panic stricken. Robbie 
               lets go of his bloody nose and, with both hands, clenches his 
               chest in pain. He is still fighting to catch his breath. They 
               are all soaked from the rain. 

 
               They all sit down at the booth. The power is flickering on and 
               off. As they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had, gunshots 
               are heard. BAM!! BAM!! Ray jumps and catches his head in his 
               hands as it throbs. Robbie jumps and flails his arms in pain 
               as the jump tightened muscles in his stomach. Robbie turns around 
               to see the man with Ray's gun firing at Riot Man 3. BAM! One 
               more gunshot is heard. Rachel scurries over to Robbie who, despite 
               his pain, grabs Rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort. 
               The van drives away.

 
               Rachel sobs as Ray also starts crying because nobody knows what 
               to do from here. Robbie looks at Ray for some comfort. He has 
               none.

 
               Walking Down the Street - Dusk


               They are walking in a crowd of about 300. Some men share their 
               stories of assumption. One man says... "Europe's got it the worst...." 
               while another man says "We've got it the worst......" while some 
               people "don't give a shit who it is....."

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Looks like the power's still on here.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Yeah, power's still on because nothing 
                         bad has come up from under the ground.

 
                         
               A rail road crossing guard stick comes down as the bells and 
               lights start going off. The people stand behind the guard just 
               like cars. They wait. 

 
               A train approaches and is blowing off fireballs from an encounter 
               with a robot. The entire train is flaming and burning. The train, 
               as it whisks by is releasing pieces of red hot ash. The bars 
               go up as the train completes it's crossing. The people continue 
               walking.

 
               EXT. FERRY DOCK - DUSK


               Random, pointless music is playing over the PA system as people 
               are being herded by soldiers onto a ferry boat. A blood bank 
               woman says over a megaphone... 

 
                                     WOMAN

                         Unless you are O-positive and Rh negative, 
                         thank you but we already have more blood 
                         than we can use. Again... (repeats message)

 
                         
               Shots of the herded people boarding the ferry.


               Solders are heard and seen saying "this way" and "keep it moving 
               folks".

 
                                     HARBOR MASTER

                         Please move forward calmly, the boat 
                         can make more than one trip. Please 
                         move forward calmly, take your time, 
                         don't rush. (repeats)

 
                                     SHERYL

                         Ray! RAY?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Sheryl?


                                     SHERYL

                         Yeah.


               Ray and Sheryl hug as they are re-united.


                                     SHERYL

                         Oh, my gosh, are these your kids?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Yes, this is Rachel.


                                     SHERYL

                         Hi, I'm Sheryl, this is my daughter, 
                         Nora. 

 
               Ray, Sheryl, Nora, and Rachel exchange handshakes.


                                     RAY

                         Hi, I've heard about you, Nora.


               Rachel looks at sea gulls that are flying rather fast away from 
               the boat. Robbie meets Sheryl with Ray.

 
                                     RAY

                         This is my son, Robbie.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Hi Sheryl.


                                     SHERYL

                         He's just like dad.


               Rachel continues watching the gulls.


                                     SHERYL

                         How you doing? You look like shit.

 
                         
               Rachel is now fully into watching the gulls. Ray, Sheryl, and 
               Robbie are engaged into small talk. Rachel sees the gulls flying 
               around something over the horizon behind the city.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (to herself) The trees are funny.

 
                         
                                     HARBOR MASTER

                         We're gonna move some cars out of the 
                         way to make more space. Give us a few 
                         minutes.

 
               Rachel watches the trees begin to be flattened and moved as something 
               gets brighter on the horizon. Rachel grabs Ray's finger and he 
               realizes that she wants him. Ray turns around to see what Rachel 
               wants as he too sees the thing on the horizon. Robbie sees Ray 
               looking that way, so he too looks that way. A robot puts it's 
               last foot down with a thud and looks at the dock full of people. 
               It makes the vibration noise which gets the attention of everybody. 
               The crowd begins overrunning the soldiers and cramming onto the 
               ship for safety. The captain sees the overflow and prepares the 
               ship for takeoff to try to stop the overflow. 

 
                                     CAPTAIN

                         CAST OFF!!! GET THAT RAMP UP!!!


                                     HARBOR MASTER

                         CAST OFF NOW!!! GET THAT RAMP UP!!! 
                         (to soldiers) No more people! No more 
                         people! We're taking the ramp up.

 
                         
               The soldiers create a blockade which holds back the crowd for 
               quite a while. As the crowd starts to collect, the soldiers start 
               to bulge forward from people pushing them. Three robots now switch 
               on their lights to look over the crowd of people. A moving crowd 
               of about 1,000 people is now collecting on the soldiers who so 
               far are withstanding. 

 
               Ray, now in the front next to a soldier, tries to get them to 
               let him and his family through. They say there is no more room.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (to Sheryl) You just stay with me! Grab 
                         my jacket!

 
                                     SHERYL

                         I got you Ferrier. (trips) oh, Jesus!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         You okay? Come on!


                                     SHERYL

                         Jesus. Oh my god!


                                     RAY

                         Come on.


               The harbor master hit's the switch to start the ramp motor to 
               begin folding up the ramp. Soldiers shove empty cars off the 
               ramp. 

 
               Sheryl is knocked around by a few people and looses grip of Ray's 
               jacket. 

 
                                     SHERYL

                         Oh, Ray!! RAY!!!


               They run faster and Sheryl falls farther behind. Robbie makes 
               a grab for her hand but a soldier stops Sheryl just short. 

 
               
                                     SHERYL

                         NO, I CAN GO WITH HIM!!!  RAY!!!! NO!!!!

 
                         
               The ramp begins lifting as a few people make one last jump and 
               latch on to it. Ray looks back for Sheryl.

 
                                     RAY

                         SHERYL?!?!? SHERYL!!!!


                                     SHERYL

                         RAY!!!!


                                     RAY

                         There's room on the boat!!! 


                                     SHERYL

                         LET US THROUGH GOD DAMN IT!!!


                                     RAY

                         THERE'S STILL ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S 
                         ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S ROOM ON 
                         THE BOAT!!!

 
               Rachel screams as Ray runs to the bow with Rachel in his arms. 
               Robbie is soon to follow...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ROBBIE?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Stay with me! Stay with me Robbie!!!

 
                         
               Robbie runs right past them and up to the captain's deck.


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!!!


               Robbie, panting hard, looks at the inclining ramp and sees there 
               are still people hanging on to the back side of the ramp. He 
               starts running to the stern of the ship.

 
               The captain pushes the throttle all the way full. The propellers 
               start so fast they spray water all over the people still at the 
               dock. Pulling away at it's ties to the dock, the ship begins 
               pulling away.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (seeing Robbie running to the stern) 
                         Robbie? Robbie!?!?!

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie!!!


                                     RACHEL

                         ROBBIE!!!


               Robbie ignores them as he jumps onto the grate of the folded 
               up ramp. Climbing to the top, he begins helping those who are 
               hanging on the back side of the ramp. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Here, grab my hand!! Hold on! I got 
                         you! HOLD ON!!!

 
               Camera turns or Ray's face. Ray looks at Robbie helping people 
               in admiration and proud ness. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         TAKE MY HAND!! TAKE IT!!! 


               INT. CAPTAIN'S CONTROL ROOM - DUSK


               The captain sees some sort of whirlpool sucking water down into 
               a hole. The ship begins to slowly turn toward the hole, being 
               sucked in. 

 
                                     CAPTAIN

                         Oh, my god!


               Passengers rush over to the starboard railing where a robot emerges 
               from the whirlpool. WOOSH!!! Hundreds of gallons of water are 
               tossed up with the robot. The water in the air turns to snow 
               as it falls on the ship. The robot's engines howl in the air. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (fearing danger to his son) ROBBIE!!!

 
                         
               The robot's claws begin pushing the ship making it lean to one 
               side and finally tip over on it's side. Robbie is already running 
               towards Ray. At the turn of the ship, the three go into the water. 
               Cars start coming towards them. WOOSH!!! A car comes right for 
               them. SPLASH!!! The car hit's the water where they are, instantly 
               pinning Robbie and Ray to the front of it. Rachel is holding 
               on to Robbie's back, also going down.

 
               The people in the car are screaming as the car fills with water. 
               

 
               As the ship completely capsizes, people are thrown or washed 
               into the water. Cars sink down, people float and the ship bobs 
               in the water. Ray is able to un-pin himself and pulls Robbie 
               out. They all begin swimming to the surface. Rachel lags behind 
               and Robbie grabs her and helps her up.  At the surface, they 
               meet. A ship propeller at full power. They begin to swim away 
               from it. Claws from the ship over head are grabbing people and 
               pulling them into the robot's holds. 

 
               EXT. BEACH - DARK


               Ray is heaving Rachel up to shore. Robbie is not far behind. 
               They are all fighting to get their breath after swimming for 
               so long. Ray can no longer haul Rachel up the beach. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Help me. Help me with her.


                                     ROBBIE

                         (gagging) Okay.


               Robbie almost slips as he gags, still fighting for breath. 

 
               
               Pulling each other up the hill....


                                     RAY

                         Don't stop. Don't stop.


               Alert sirens can be heard coming from the city.


               Ray pulls the two of them. 


                                     ROBBIE

                         (yells in pain) AHHH.


               They all lay on the hillside, gasping for air. In the distance 
               they look... Two robots are still picking people up out of the 
               water. Two more robots have joined and are picking up people 
               off the streets. Many people scream. 

 
               With jaws clattering, Rachel looks toward the other hillside 
               on the other side of the river. Shivering Ray and Robbie look 
               there with her. 

 
               THREE MORE robots are on the opposite hillside blasting people 
               with their disintegrator beams. Many more people scream. Rachel, 
               in fright, runs towards the bushes behind Ray. Ray sees her, 
               and runs with her. Robbie runs with them. They stop and squat 
               down as they see the top of another robot coming over the hill 
               to join the three. 

 
               Robbie, running, with clenched teeth, stops. His jaw drops as 
               we are able to see hundreds of thousands of articles of clothing 
               falling from the sky. They continue running through the woods 
               where clothes fall like snow. 

 
               Pasture Fence Line - Dark


               Robbie is walking 5' ahead of Ray and Rachel along a fence line 
               of a pasture. Gunfire is seen and heard over the hill about 500 
               yards away. Robbie, who always wanted to help in the fight, begins 
               walking faster toward the gunfire.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie, slow down.


               Robbie follows the fence line and walks a little faster.


                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie, slow down!!!


               Robbie, who is coming closer to the hill, sees army trucks rolling 
               down the road and up the hill. Seeing this, Robbie walks into 
               a slow run along the fence line. Ray and Rachel try to keep up. 
               

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie.


                                     RAY

                         Robbie. We got to stay together Robbie.

 
                         
               Robbie, getting closer, runs faster, faster.


                                     RAY

                         Robbie! Stay together! ROBBIE!!!


               Ray and Rachel duck as a missile comes EXTREMELY CLOSE to their 
               heads. Jets speed by them overhead. Rachel screams.

 
                                     RAY

                         GET BACK HERE!!!


               Robbie, in a full scale run, runs with the army trucks that have 
               now taken to the hills. Ray and Rachel run as fast as they can 
               to try to stay with Robbie.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie!! NO!! ROBBIE!!! COME BACK!!!

 
                         
               Robbie runs with the trucks with all his might. Ray and Rachel 
               are now searching for him.

 
                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!!! (sets Rachel down next to 
                         a tree) NOW DON'T MOVE! FOR GOD'S SAKE, 
                         STAY RIGHT HERE! I'M COMING RIGHT BACK! 
                         (calling out for him) ROBBIE!!!

 
               Ray sees Robbie about 20' ahead of him. 


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!!! ROBBIE!!!


               Robbie is held back by two soldiers. Robbie gets thrown back 
               by them where Ray grabs him and pins him to the ground. Robbie 
               fights to get back up.

 
                                     RAY

                         WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS???


               Soldiers are blasting everything they have to something over 
               the hill. Radio people are telling their officers "no effect 
               on target". 

 
               Robbie is watching all he is able to see while Ray tries to get 
               his attention on him.

 
                                     RAY

                         LISTEN TO ME! TURN AROUND! I WANT YOU 
                         TO LISTEN TO ME!

 
               Robbie ignores him and continues watching artillery blast over 
               the hill. 

 
               Ray gets fed up with Robbie. He grabs his shoulders and flips 
               him over on to his back. Robbie looks at Ray in fright that he 
               did that. Ray grabs his coat shoulders, and climbs on top of 
               him, pining him down to the ground. 

 
                                     RAY

                         LISTEN TO ME! 


               Rachel watches helicopters fire missiles simultaneously over 
               the hill. 

 
                                     RAY

                         DON'T DO THIS! I LOVE YOU!


                                     ROBBIE

                         I NEED TO BE HERE! I NEED TO SEE THIS!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE TO BUT 
                         YOU DON'T!!!

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         LET ME GO!!!


                                     RAY

                         YOU DON'T!!!


                                     ROBBIE

                         PLEASE LET ME GO!!!


               Rachel is approached by people. They think she's alone so they 
               try to talk her into coming with them (ad lib). 

 
                                     RAY

                         I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!! YOU CAN 
                         HATE ME.....

 
               Robbie tries to fight to get up but Ray keeps him pinned to the 
               ground.

 
                                     RAY

                         ... YOU CAN HATE ME. BUT I LOVE YOU!!

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         LET ME GO PLEASE!!!


                                     RAY

                         I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!!!


                                     ROBBIE

                         DAD!!


               Ray sees the couple trying to get Rachel to go with them. For 
               a second, Ray doesn't know what to do. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Just listen to me!


                                     ROBBIE

                         I need to be here! I want to see this!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Wait, stay. Stay for Rachel. Stay for 
                         your sister. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Please let me go! You need to let me 
                         go.

 
               Ray and Robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever. 
               Ray looks to Rachel who is being carried away by the couple. 
               Robbie manages to turn back over to his stomach. After enough 
               trying, Robbie is able to squirm out of Ray's grasp on his shoulders. 
               

 
               Robbie crawls out of Ray's grasp and stands up. They stare at 
               each other for a while and Robbie begins running over the hill. 
               Ray runs over to Rachel to get her back from the couple.

 
                                     RAY

                         GET OFF!!! I'M HER FATHER!!! I'M HER 
                         FATHER!!! 

 
                                     WOMAN

                         We thought she was alone... we....

 
                         
               She doesn't finish as she scurries away. Ray looks at the hill 
               where the soldiers were firing at... A FLAMING army truck rolls 
               over the hill. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie?!?!


               Two more trucks come over the hill ablaze. Suddenly... BOOM!!! 
               A ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill. The explosion 
               blast is almost big enough to knock Ray off of his feet. 

 
               
                                     RAY


                         ROBBIE!!!


               By now, Robbie has run over the hill and is long out of site. 
               A robot that appears to be on fire comes slowly rising over the 
               hill. Ray makes a run for it down the hill. We can see three 
               robots now rising over the hill. Missiles and bullets are being 
               fired at them as their shields block all the fired artillery. 
               

 
               EXT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - CELLAR DOOR - NIGHT


               Harland lives in the basement of his house about 300 feet away 
               from the hill that the robots came over. He is holding a rifle 
               as a signal for anybody who can see him.

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Over here! OVER HERE!!!


               Ray and Rachel run towards him. 


                                     HARLAND

                         Hurry!!


               The three of them scurry into the basement. Ray and Rachel run 
               into the main room while Harland proceeds to close the cellar 
               doors. Gunfire can be heard alongside the screams from people. 
               Lights flash through the cracks in the walls and door. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 


               Harland walks up to the lantern hanging on the wall and looks 
               at Ray and Rachel. His face, half lit looks medieval with the 
               clothes he wears. 

 
               Harland grabs the lantern and carries it over to where Ray and 
               Rachel are huddled shivering in their damp clothes. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (to Rachel) You all right?


               Rachel does not respond most likely due to shock. 


                                     HARLAND

                         (to Ray) And what about you?


               Ray looks up at him and looks at the lantern. He is still heard 
               muttering "Robbie" very quietly.

 
               Harland moves a wheel barrel as rats are seen scurrying about 
               on the floor. The army platoon has gone far enough over the hill 
               that gunfire can no longer be seen or heard. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (while Harland moves the wheel barrel) 
                         (to Rachel) There you go. Is that comfortable? 
                         I need you to close your eyes now, okay? 
                         You need some sleep.

 
               Rachel's face is pure white with some red around her eyes.

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?


               Ray already knows what she is going to ask.


                                     RAY

                         He's gonna meet us. Hey, Robbie's gonna 
                         meet us, Rach, In Boston, at your grandma's.

 
                         
               Harland is watching them through fallen out boards in the wall. 
               

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (about ready to cry) What do you think 
                         mom's doing right this minute?

 
               Harland sits down on the stairs to listen to their conversation. 
               He begins sharpening a shovel with a file. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Mom? She's in Boston. Waiting. And I 
                         know she's not sleeping 'cause she is 
                         so worried about you. (trying to comfort 
                         her) ... And she's in grandma's kitchen, 
                         and she's making that awful tea that 
                         she makes. And they're all just... ... 
                         ...there all just counting the minutes 
                         until they see you again.

 
               Rachel is crying because she misses Robbie and her mom. Ray sees 
               the first place ribbon she keeps carrying around and begins to 
               investigate what it is.

 
                                     RAY

                         (picking up the ribbon) What is this? 
                         What... What is this?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I won.


                                     RAY

                         You won?


                                     RACHEL

                         The walk, trot, and canter. Third place.

 
                         
               She begins to feel dreary...


                                     RACHEL

                         Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight"?


                                     RAY

                         (shakes his head in displeasure because 
                         he can't think of it) I don't remember 
                         that one.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"?


                                     RAY

                         I'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one 
                         either. 

 
               Rachel turns over (her back to Ray) because she realizes that 
               it is a lost hope to get a song out of him. Ray thinks for a 
               moment and remembers an old nursery rhyme he was taught. 

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby. 
                         So don't put me down. Because I've got 
                         the fastest set of wheels in the town. 
                         Something comes up to me that don't 
                         even try....

 
               Rachel turns back over as Ray continues singing...


                                     RAY

                         (continues singing) ... If I had a set 
                         of wings, man, I know she could fly. 
                         She's my little deuce coupe. You don't 
                         know what I've got... just my little 
                         deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't 
                         know what I've got....

 
               Rachel has fallen asleep. Ray kisses her on the forehead. Harland 
               taps two glasses together and says...

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Peach schnapps. 


               Ray gets up and begins walking towards him.


                                     HARLAND

                         Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole 
                         case of this shit. 

 
               Harland hands Ray a glass as they both sit down. 


                                     RAY

                         Thank you. 


               Silence falls over for a period.


                                     HARLAND

                         I'm sorry about your son.


                                     RAY

                         We got separated... he's gonna meet 
                         us in umm... in Boston.

 
               Ray drinks the schnapps as he begins to ask...


                                     RAY

                         Did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did 
                         you loose anybody? 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         All of them. 


               Another pause.


                                     HARLAND

                         (introduces himself) Harland Ogilvy. 
                         

 
                                     RAY

                         (introduces himself) Ray Ferrier.

 
                         
               They shake hands.


                                     HARLAND

                         I got water... Food.... Enough for weeks. 
                         You're welcome to stay, both of yous.

 
                         
               Ray gets up from the conversation.


                                     RAY

                         I'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep. 
                         

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause) 
                         Those machines, those tripods they got... 
                         They buried them... right under our 
                         feet. Since before there were even people 
                         here. They've been planning this for 
                         a million years. We're beat to shit.

 
                         
               Ray looks at Harland sternly because he is afraid Rachel may 
               hear what he may say next. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, my daughter.


                                     HARLAND

                         Think about it.    ...    They defeated 
                         the greatest power in the world in a 
                         couple days. Walked right over us.  
                          ....    And these are only the first, 
                         they'll keep coming. This is not a war 
                         any more than there's a war between 
                         men and maggots. This is an extermination.

 
                         
               Ray walks over to where Rachel is sleeping.


                                     HARLAND

                         (feeling he's not grasping the reality) 
                         Are you afraid?

 
                                     RAY

                         Of course I am.


                                     HARLAND

                         (going on) I been around death plenty. 
                         Drive an ambulance in the city. Well, 
                         drove and ambulance in the city. That's 
                         all over now, huh?    ....   You know 
                         the people who make it Ray? The ones 
                         that don't flatline before the hospital? 
                         It's the ones who keep their eyes open, 
                         keep looking at you, keep thinking. 
                           ....    There the ones who survive... 
                            ....   We can' t loose our heads 
                         Ray.   ....   Running, that's what'll 
                         kill you.    ......     I'm dead set 
                         on livin'.

 
               He pauses and begins chuckling at his own joke.


                                     HARLAND

                         Hah. Dead set on Living. 


               Harland walks back over to the place where the conversation first 
               started. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Thank you for taking us in.


               Ray lies down next to Rachel as Harland finishes...


                                     HARLAND

                         We're not going to be exterminated.

 
                         
               The ground starts shaking from robots walking around outside. 
               Ray gets back up just as BOOM!! A small piece of the corner of 
               the basement collapses from all the vibration. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (with shotgun at side) It's okay! Come 
                         on, I wanna show you something!

 
               They both are waling towards a window. 


                                     HARLAND

                         We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta 
                         have a weakness. Come on, take a look. 
                         

 
               Ray and Harland see two robots spraying vine like strands out 
               of a hole on the bottom of the ship onto the ground.

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Somehow they killed a few of these things 
                         in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling 
                         me the Japanese can figure it out but 
                         we can't? 

 
               Ray goes over to Rachel and picks her up to take her somewhere 
               else. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         We can do it. We can get 'em. We can 
                         figure it out. 

 
               Ray puts the now wide awake Rachel in a chair. 


                                     RAY

                         Stay right there!


               Ray opens up a window guard to see two robots skimming the ground 
               almost as if they are tilling up the soil. He now understands 
               that robots do this on a regular basis.

 
                                     RAY

                         I have a daughter! Why did you bring 
                         us here?

 
                                     HARLAND

                         To fight 'em together, Ray.   ....  
                          Now we'll be the ones coming up from 
                         underground. When the time is right, 
                         we'll take 'em by supries, the way they 
                         took us. We'll take 'em by surprise. 
                         

 
               Ray puts his hands over his face as he realizes he is staying 
               with an insane man. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         We're right under their feet, Ray. Right 
                         here, under their feet. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NEAR DUSK


               Ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing wildly. 
               He feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe. He examines 
               it closely as he walks over to the window where lights are beaming 
               in and out as the robots work. He takes another piece of a wall 
               and studies that one. 

 
               Ray hears a hovering craft over his head. A light flows over 
               the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a board 
               hall in the basement. Harland is sitting on the stairs with Rachel.

 
               
                                     HARLAND

                         You miss your mommy? I had a little 
                         girl nearly your age. You know, if anything 
                         happens to your daddy, I'll take care 
                         of you. 

 
               Ray is very angry that Harland is saying things like that to 
               his daughter.

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel!


               Rachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside him. They 
               both stare at Harland, on the stairs, in dismay. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (distinctly angry, but not yelling) 
                         You don't have anything to say to her, 
                         do you understand? If you want to talk 
                         to somebody, or ask somebody a question, 
                         you ask me!

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (also angry at Ray) What exactly is 
                         your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna 
                         do. How about you? You gonna sit here, 
                         wait for them to come get you? Is that 
                         your plan?

 
               Harland walks around to different parts of the basement doing 
               miscellaneous things. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Maybe you want to get caught. Couple 
                         of days hiding in a basement too much 
                         for you, I bet. You'll probably turn 
                         yourself right in! 

 
               The robots outside stop moving. All the rumbling stops. 


                                     RAY

                         Listen. It stopped.


                                     HARLAND

                         (paying no attention) Maybe you'll be 
                         okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll 
                         train you as their pet. You know, train 
                         you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks...

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!

 
                         
               Pieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera comes floating 
               down into the hole. Ray hides behind the stairs. The camera eye 
               opens and lights turn on for it. 

 
               Rachel is hiding as well. The camera looks around the couch. 
               Ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the couch. It 
               sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds. Ray and 
               Harland exchange looks as Ray runs toward Rachel to hide with 
               her. 

 
               The robot continues checking out the basement. Harland grabs 
               an axe to cut off the camera from it's limb. Ray shakes his head 
               no to get him to stop. Ray silently does expressions to convince 
               him not to. 

 
               Harland goes towards ray so they can hide together. Harland almost 
               makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of glass containers 
               which clang together. The robot hears this and turns around toward 
               the noise. They run to a different spot.

 
               Robot gets closer...


               Ray puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the robot 
               into seeing another robot. The camera looks over the mirror and 
               sees nothing. 

 
               It turns around just as... Rachel's boot slides, making a noise. 
               The robot views into the boot that is hanging out. It looks behind 
               the mirror to find just a boot sitting there. Ray, Rachel and 
               Harland are in the middle of the basement. A sight of relief 
               comes as the robot camera exit's out of the hole.

 
               Now the actual aliens come into the basement. Harland turns the 
               lantern out and runs to hide. The aliens look around the basement. 
               They look at, smell, and touch various different things throughout 
               the basement. Ray, Rachel, and Harland scurry to different parts 
               of the basement.

 
               Harland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the aliens 
               but the gun is pulled back by Ray.

 
                                     RAY

                         (dead silent) Give me that!


               Ray and Harland are in a silent fight for the gun. They both 
               have their hands on it. The aliens continue looking around. 

 
               
               Ray and Harland are both sweating bullets fighting for the gun. 
               Still silently.  Harland pins Ray against the wall and forces 
               him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of his grasp.

 
               
               The aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box. 
               

 
               Ray lets go of the gun and Harland jerks it away from him just 
               as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot. The aliens 
               scurry out through the open hole.

 
               Harland comes down to Ray, now sitting on the floor, and says....

 
               
                                     HARLAND

                         You and I... I don't  think we are on 
                         the same page. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY


               The vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal rate along 
               the concrete slab under the window. Robots are spraying a red 
               mist out of the back of their ships. Ray holds his hand in the 
               mist that is entering the window.  After a moment.... Ray retracts 
               his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be blood. 
               

 
                                     HARLAND

                         RAY!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! 


                                     RAY

                         KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!!! QUIET!!! 

 
                         
               Harland turns around and his whole face is covered in spots of 
               blood. 

 
               They both turn back around then Harland runs. Ray watches a man 
               being set down, fighting to be let go. A needle like object comes 
               down and stabs the man. It then pumps the blood out of him. Ray 
               has a horrified look on his face. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (repeats for about 2 minutes) Not My 
                         Blood!!!

 
               Ray realizes they will have the same fate if he keeps yelling. 
               Then... the robots stop because they hear him. Ray runs to Harland 
               who is digging some sort of hole. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Stop it! Stop it! You gotta stop it! 
                         You gotta be quiet or they'll hear you!

 
                         
                                     HARLAND

                         (with an insane expression and tone) 
                         They drink us!

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, they'll hear you!


                                     HARLAND

                         Then they spray us, like a fertilizer!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         You gotta be quiet!


                                     HARLAND

                         Drink US and....


                                     RAY

                         They're gonna come back down here!

 
                         
               Harland has mentally lost it now. 


                                     HARLAND

                         Then they spit us out all over their 
                         goddamn red weeds!

 
                                     RAY

                         (no longer whispering) Do you understand 
                         what I'm gonna have to do? I can't let 
                         my daughter die because of you. 

 
                         
               Harland pays no attention to him.


                                     HARLAND

                         This tunnel will get us to the city. 
                         We'll have our own tunnels there. Ready 
                         Made! Subway, see what I'm saying!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Stop it!


                                     HARLAND

                         You can hide a whole army down there!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Stop it!!


                                     HARLAND

                         ... We'll go underground!


                                     RAY

                         STOP IT!!!


                                     HARLAND

                         Sneak attacks at night!


                                     RAY

                         YOU STOP IT!!!


               Ray grabs him by the arm just as he hits ray in the forehead 
               with a shovel. Ray releases his grip and lies on a dirt pile 
               next to Harland. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         We're the resistance Ray! They can't 
                         occupy this country! Occupations always 
                         fail! History's taught us that a thousand 
                         times. This is our land.

 
               Ray runs up the stairs of the room to Rachel standing calmly 
               in the middle of the basement. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (continues) ... We eat it, we breathe 
                         it, only we can live on it! They can't 
                         survive here Ray. They weren't built 
                         for it.

 
               Ray hugs Rachel because he knows what he has to do. 


               Harland goes on saying odd things as Ray gets Rachel prepared 
               for what he has to do.

 
               Ray puts a black cloth over Rachel's eyes which makes her breathing 
               go erratic. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What are you doing?


                                     RAY

                         Whatever you hear... don't take this 
                         off.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad??


                                     RAY

                         Rach?


                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?


                                     RAY

                         What was that song... that lullaby I 
                         didn't know?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Hushabye Mountains


                                     RAY

                         Yeah. Please, Rach, sing it. 


                                     RACHEL

                         (begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze....

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Don't stop.


                                     RACHEL

                         ... On Hushabye Mountain...


                                     RAY

                         That's my girl.


                                     RACHEL

                         ... For far away my baby goes...


               Ray kisses her hands and has her put them over her ears. Then 
               walks back to Harland. He is still digging and chanting "not 
               my blood"

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ... it fills the sails ... 


               Harland stops and sees Ray standing in the doorway.


                                     RACHEL

                         ... of boats that are waiting ...

 
                         
               Ray closes the door behind him as he steps in. 


                                     RACHEL

                         ... Waiting to sail your worries away 
                         ...

 
               Rachel hears screams and grunts as the two men fight behind the 
               door.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye 
                         Mountain ... 

 
               Rachel's voice begins trembling as she holds her ears tighter.

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         ... Wave goodbye to the cares of the 
                         day and watch your boat, from Hushabye 
                         Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby 
                         Bay. 

 
               All is silent for a while. Ray opens the door and walks out. 
               Rachel releases her hands and takes off the blindfold. Ray is 
               sitting on the stairs. 

 
               Rachel sits in his lap and puts his arms around her. They both 
               sit there in silence. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK


               Ray and Rachel are sleeping on the couch. As we view down from 
               Ray's face we find that Rachel is wide awake for some reason. 
               She sits up and....

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (screams) AHHHH!!!


               A robot camera is 1' away from her face. Rachel runs to the wall, 
               still screaming as ray hit's the camera with his hands. The camera 
               hit's the ceiling and shakes it's self off of debris. 

 
               Ray begins blasting the axe he had in hand into the camera attachment 
               line. Rachel screams as he hit's the line. Over and over and 
               over. Rachel runs up the basement stairs. Ray continues hitting 
               it and it finally pulls away. The camera, still attached by a 
               hair, hits some wood planks and is pulled out of the hole. 

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Rachel???


               No response for a few seconds, then Rachel lets off a gut wrenching 
               scream. 

 
                                     RAY

                         RACHEL!!!  (to himself) Oh, my god, 
                         no!

 
               He runs up the stairs to search for her in the house. 


                                     RAY

                         Rachel? Rachel? (looks up the stairs) 
                         Rachel??

 
               Ray opens the front door to find red vines coated in blood in 
               the doorway. He quickly brushes them down stepping out the door. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (searching) Rachel, make some noise 
                         baby. Rachel??

 
               He begins walking down a path to look for her farther out.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Rachel? Rachel? Talk to me baby, come 
                         on!

 
               He gets no response from Rachel. All is dead silent accept for 
               him. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel?!? RACHEL?!?!?!


               Ray sees an entire field of blood coated red vines beyond the 
               hill. 

 
                                     RAY

                         RACHEL!!!! RACHEL!!!


               A robot's lights turn on to him as a food lands close enough 
               to him to blow him back. One of the robot's grabbing claws comes 
               after Ray. He hides in a truck. The claw breaks through the glass, 
               grabs the car, and flips it, causing it to roll about 3 times. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (screams) AHH!


               Now in the car, lying upside down, he hears Rachel scream. He 
               looks and Rachel is standing at the top of a hill. 

 
               The robot centers above her and begins to grab her with a claw. 
               Ray runs towards her to try and do what he can to stop it. 

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         (screams) AHHHHH!!!!


                                     RAY

                         NO NO NO!!!


               The robot blasts through a building. Ray is right behind the 
               foot. He runs into an army vehicle and finds a belt full of grenades. 
               He takes on off, removes the pin and throws it at the robot.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         HEY!!!


               It hit's the robot's shields and the robot turns right around. 
               It eyeballs Ray for a moment and picks him up by a grabbing claw. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (screams in pain) AHHH!


               He is thrown into a cage with about 30 other people in it as 
               well. The gate closes on the top as he is thrown in. The camera 
               shows he is in one of two cages. People scream and cry in confusion. 
               Ray spots Rachel sitting on the side of the grate.

 
                                     RAY

                         RACHEL!!


               He goes towards her just as the door opens, it makes a sound 
               and a grabbing claw comes out of a hole on the robot. Ray falls 
               down (luckily), it grabs another person and sucks him into the 
               ship. The same happens in the other cage. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (reaching Rachel) Rachel. (no response) 
                         Rachel.

 
               She seems to be frozen. 


                                     RAY

                         Rachel.


                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?


               Ray goes to speak just as BOOM! The grate shifts, tossing all 
               the people around and the door opens to take another person up. 
               Ray ducks down with Rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing 
               claw. He is swept up by it. Rachel holds on to his neck to go 
               with him. But then, Ray sees his belt of grenades. He prigs Rachel's 
               hands off of him and grabs the grenades. A soldier sees this 
               and latches onto Ray's arm.

                         Pull me! Pull me!!!


               People all start latching on to the soldier and begin heaving 
               him and Ray down. They loose ground until more people join. 

 
               
                                     SOLDIER 2

                         We got him! Keep pulling! Pull me!

 
                         
               Ray is let loose by the clamp and they all fall back into the 
               cage. Ray spits out two grenade pins out of his mouth. This is 
               seen by the soldier. 

 
                                     SOLDIER 2

                         EVERYBODY DOWN!!!


               Hardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot explodes. 
               We can see the robot exploding on the inside. It breaks doors 
               and fluid stars spilling out of it. The robot releases it's cages 
               and they fall into a tree. Splitting open. People promptly climb 
               out. 

 
               Once the robot falls to the ground, Rachel looks at Ray in a 
               way that meant how did you do that.

               Ray walks with Rachel down the road as soldiers are ushering 
               them to "keep moving." The crows are now eating the red plant 
               which appears to be dying rapidly.  Ray picks up a piece, of 
               dead plant.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What happened to it?


               Ray crumples the plant in his hand. It turns to dust and blows 
               away.

 
                                     RAY

                         It's dying. 


               Watching the dust, they walk along to find a robot lying half 
               struck into a building. 

 
                                     RAY

                         What happened?


                                     SOLDIER 3

                         I don't know, something's happening 
                         to them. Please keep moving.

 
               Ray goes up to another soldier for information.


                                     RAY

                         Something's happening to them?


                                     SOLDIER 4

                         Go. Go. Just keep moving, sir. 


               Ray asks another soldier down the road for information.


                                     RAY

                         Excuse me, excuse me, what happened 
                         here? You guys take it down? 

 
                                     SOLDIER 5

                         No sir, it was behaving erratically, 
                         walking in circles then it went down 
                         on it's own about an hour ago. (to people) 
                          Now let's keep moving, don't stop do 
                         not stop! Keep moving!

 
               Rachel and Ray are walking down the road with soldiers and other 
               people.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         How is it dead all by it's self?


                                     RAY

                         Rachel, I'm not sure. 


               Seeing another robot, one soldier motions to get into the water 
               tunnel. Other soldiers make signals to get set up for defense 
               if necessary. Everyone gets into the tunnel. A soldier can be 
               heard telling everyone "calm down and get in the tunnel".

 
               
               Ray notices that birds are flying over AND LANDING ON the robot. 
               The robot's shields are down. As he goes to tell someone, the 
               robot makes the viberating sound. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (to a soldier, during the robot noise) 
                         LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!

 
                                     SOLDIER 6

                         I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!


                                     RAY

                         LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!


                                     SOLDIER 6

                         I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!


                                     RAY

                         (louder) LOOK AT THE GOD DAMN BIRDS!!!

 
                         
               The soldier looks at them and doesn't get what Ray's getting 
               at. He looks back at Ray. The noise continues erratically as 
               if the robot is fighting to stay alive.

 
                                     RAY

                         NO SHIELDS!!!


                                     SOLDIER 6

                         (motions and says) I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (pointing) NO SHIELDS!!!


                                     SOLDIER 6

                         (now getting it) (to the soldiers) THE 
                         JAVELIN'S THE KEY! LOAD THE GUSTAV, 
                         IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH KILL!!! LET'S 
                         GO!!!

 
               Ray gets in the tunnel as all the soldiers come running out.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (to the people in the tunnel and Rachel) 
                         It's safer in here!

 
                                     SOLDIER 6

                         LETS GO!!! BRIGN OUT THE JAVELIN!!!

 
                         
               Soldiers scurry to get set up and they hurriedly fire missiles 
               at the robot. The first missile hit's the grabbing claws and 
               knocks them off. A few more shots and the robot collapses into 
               a nearby factory. The factory explodes and the robot grinds to 
               a halt on the ground. They check it to be clear as an alien falls 
               out of the door. It quickly dies on site. 

 
                                     SOLDIER 6

                         IT'S CLEAR!


               We watch the alien turn to stone as it dies.


               Boston - Walking Down Street near Mary Ann's Mother's house - 
               Day

 
               Mary Ann walks up to the front door and sees Ray walking down 
               the street with Rachel in his arms. She flutters open the doors 
               and she and Rachel run towards each other on the street. Mary 
               Ann begins crying.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         MOM!!!


               They hug each other crying. 


               Mary Ann looks at Ray who is still standing in the middle of 
               the street. 

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         (just barely hearable) Thank you.

 
                         
               Mary Ann's parents come out of the door. The mother has a shocked 
               look on her face. Tim is behind them. 

 
               Ray's eyes and face perk up as we see ROBBIE coming down the 
               front steps towards him. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie?


               Ray and Robbie take a good look at each other and Robbie finally 
               mutters with a dry throat.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Hey dad!


               They hug each other in thankfulness for each other's survival.

                         From the moment the invaders arrived, 
                         breathed our air, ate and drank, they 
                         were doomed. They were undone, destroyed, 
                         after all of man's weapons and devices 
                         had failed, by the tiniest creatures 
                         that God and his wisdom, put upon this 
                         earth. At the toll of a billion deaths, 
                         man had earned his immunity, is right 
                         to survive among this planet's infinite 
                         organisms. And that right is ours against 
                         all challenges, for men do not live 
                         nor die in vein.

          listens to "MOBY DICK" on tape as the last piece of daylight
          bleeds away. With rosary beads swaying from his rear view,
          Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue-
          collar neighborhood high above the city.
                         
                         
          EXT. HOUSE - SAME
                         
          TOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the
          stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter
          coat. A duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a
          brown bag in his hands. He reaches into his coat pocket, pops
          a handful of prescription PILLS, and stares off into the
          approaching night.
                         
                         
          EXT. PADDY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off
          the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. As he
          approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy. Can't believe his
          eyes.
                         
                          PADDY
           Tommy?
                         
          Tommy gives a drunken, crooked smile.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           What're you doing here?
                         
                          TOMMY
           I was just passing through. Figured
           why not have a belt with the old
           man.
           2.
                         
                         
          Father and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a
          long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           She looks good.
                         
                          PADDY
           (patting car hood)
           Yeah, she's hanging in there.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Well, you always did take good care
           of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of
           priorities.
                         
          Paddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the
          stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a
          fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Got a little something for ya. Mom
           always said never go anywhere empty
           handed.
                         
                          PADDY
           She did. But that's not for me
           anymore, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           What? You change brands?
                         
          Paddy shakes his head. Tommy looks at him. Paddy Conlon not
          drinking? What gives?
                         
                          PADDY
           C'mon, let's go inside.
                         
          Paddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a
          confused Tommy follows.

          INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Paddy and Tommy walk through the front door. The house is
          clean, yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s. Tommy
          stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place
          in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I like what you've done with the
           place.
           3.
                         
                         
           PADDY (O.S.)
           Appreciate that.
                         
          The sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes
          off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He
          glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca
          lounge chair.
                         
                          TOMMY
           There's not much of a woman's touch
           around here.
                         
           PADDY (O.S.)
           No more women for me, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl
           who can take a punch nowadays.
                         
          Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a
          series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks
          into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old
          wicker tray. Tommy looks at him, incredulous.
                         
                          PADDY
           Here you go.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in
           14 years and you're not gonna have
           a drink with him?
                         
                          PADDY
           I told you, I'm off it. I'm coming
           up on a thousand days.
                         
                          TOMMY
           C'mon, just one drink.
                         
                          PADDY
           No.
                         
          Tommy shrugs. Takes another pull from his bottle and turns
          back to the photos. He takes them in.

          Tommy's eyes are drawn to another picture, likely taken at a
          mall photography studio, of a MAN AND WOMAN (late 20s) POSING
          WITH A YOUNG GIRL (2). The man looks like the second boy in
          the other photos. His brother BRENDAN.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
                          (OFF PICTURE)
           He's a school teacher down in
           Philly.
                         
          Tommy's face registers surprise.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Remember Tess? They've got two
           beautiful little girls.
                         
          Tommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of
          the woman. Obviously his MOTHER. He puts it down, glances at
          the bible, then stares hard at Paddy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           So you found God, huh? That's
           awesome. Mom kept calling for him,
           but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus
           was down at the mill forgiving all
           the drunks. Who knew?
                         
          Paddy sips his coffee. Says nothing. Tommy keeps pressing.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           So, you gonna ask about her, or you
           just gonna sit there all sober?
                         
                          PADDY
           I know.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Oh, you know? What do you know? Do
           you know it wasn't enough just to
           drive west to get away from you?
           When we hit the water we drove
           north, too.
                         
                          PADDY
           When I got sober I hired a man to
           find you.
           5.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
           (taking a swig)
           Is that one of the 12 steps? Or
           does a guy like you get 24?
                         
                          PADDY
           Just the 12.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Did your guy tell you what you
           needed to know?
                         
                          PADDY
           Just that your mother died in
           Tacoma. And you were in the
           Marines. That was all. That was
           enough.
                         
                          TOMMY
           That's too bad. You could've gotten
           some good details.
                         
          Tommy plops himself into a recliner. Glances at the coffee
          table, where a stack of classic books on tape sits. CRIME AND
          PUNISHMENT. THE SUN ALSO RISES. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO.
          MOBY DICK.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           You could've heard about her
           coughing up blood in a shit box
           with no heat. Having me rub her
           down with holy water, because she
           didn't have no insurance. All the
           while waiting for your pal Jesus to
           save her. Did your man tell you
           that?
                         
                          PADDY
           I'm sorry, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           It's good to know you're sorry,
           Pop. Goes a long way.
                         
          Paddy chokes up. Tommy looks at him. Closes his eyes.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           I think I liked you better when you
           were a drunk.
                         
          An overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy, who
          is fading. The pills are kicking in. He tries to open his
          eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out.
           6.
                         
                         
          Paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of
          Tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug. He watches his son.
          Relieved and heartbroken at the same time.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
                         
          A chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class
          home in the suburbs of Philly. A CLUSTER OF 5-YEAR OLDS run
          about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some
          whizzing down a large blow-up slide, some getting their faces
          painted by a make-up artist dressed like a GYPSY.
                         
          TESS CONLON (29) bounces around the yard, multi-tasking like
          a champion and filming the proceedings with a VIDEO CAMERA.
          She trains the camera on BRENDAN CONLON (30), who sits in a
          lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up.
                         
          THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA LENS: TWO GIRLS, EMILY (5), WHO WEARS A
          BIRTHDAY GIRL CROWN, AND ROSIE (3), MIMIC THE MAKE-UP WOMAN
          AND APPLY MASCARA AND BLUSH TO BRENDAN.
                         
                          TESS
           What's going on here?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Well, I'm not sure, but I think
           Daddy is now a princess.
                         
          Tess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here"
          expression.
                         
                          TESS
           Em, you want to open your presents?
                         
          The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents."
          Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with
          gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around.
                         
          Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to
          the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered
          in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           (off pink box)
           This an awfully big box.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's her birthday.
                         
          Tess turns the video camera toward Brendan again. He couldn't
          look more ridiculous. And he obviously didn't clear the gift
          with his wife. He grins at her as she lowers the camera.
           7.
                         
                         
                          TESS
                          (TEASING)
           I know, but that's why you call it
           a budget. You set it, and you don't
           budge.
                         
          Brendan smiles in his make-up. Kisses his wife.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          The remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the
          lawn. Tess, in a cocktail waitress outfit, says goodbye to
          her MOM and the kids, who play on the swing set.
                         
          She walks toward the garage and enters to find Brendan
          pressing free weights on an old bench.
                         
                         
          INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Brendan continues to lift as Tess rushes in and tosses a bag
          of garbage in the bin. A deep CUT, hidden earlier by the make-
          up, is visible on his cheek.
                         
                          TESS
           Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying
           goodbye to the girls. She's gotta
           get on the road. They've been fed.
           They just need a bath.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm on it.
                         
                          TESS
           Can you get them down at a
           reasonable time tonight? They're
           exhausted.
                         
          Brendan kisses Tess. Looks at her outfit.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Where's the rest of that skirt?
                         
                          TESS
           Babe.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Listen, if any guys give you a
           hassle in that joint tonight you
           give me a call, okay?
           8.
                         
                         
                          TESS
           (off his cut)
           Yeah. Just like you gave me a call
           when those Temple frat boys decided
           to smash up your face.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I told you, most nights I sit on
           the stool and grade papers, but
           every now and then I need some
           action.
                         
                          TESS
           Alright, well wait up for me
           tonight. I'll see what I can do
           about that.
                         
          Tess smiles flirtatiously and and heads for the car.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Promises, promises.

          A big, old-school warehouse, where a handful of GUYS whale
          away at MMA punching dummies and roll around on sweat-
          saturated mats. Sun slants through a dirty, industrial
          skylight. A no frills kind of gym.
                         
          Behind the front counter, FENROY (20s) rolls hand wraps and
          watches ESPN's "MMA LIVE" on a laptop.

           And we return here on MMA Live, Jon
           Anik alongside billionaire fight
           promoter J.J. Riley. The Tapout
           crew is also here. Punk and Skrape
           are in the building. Now J.J., what
           led to this project that is
           redefining Mixed Martial Arts here
           in the States?
                         
           J.J. RILEY (ON SCREEN)
           Well, Mixed Martial Arts is a sport
           that I've always been incredibly
           passionate about. As for where the
           idea for Sparta came from, I've
           always kind of dug the Grand Prix
           format, so I tracked these guys
           down to help me out.

          As Fenroy watches them talk about the upcoming Sparta
          tournament, Tommy walks into the gym, surveys the room with
          curiosity, and approaches the front desk.
                         
                          TOMMY

           Don't know no Fitzy. Colt Boyd owns
           this gym.
                         
          Fenroy goes back to his computer. Tommy stands there. Notices
          a Sparta POSTER on the wall reading: "THE WAR ON THE SHORE.

          INT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
                         
          Brendan stands in a classroom, surrounded by high school
          STUDENTS wearing safety goggles and raising cain. A block of
          wood sits wedged in a vice, and a student, TITO, stands over
          it with a Louisville slugger in his hands as his classmates
          CHEER him on.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in
           this too, OK? Listen up. So we have
           a body at rest, and you have the
           bat which needs--
                         
                          TITO
           Acceleration.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Acceleration, right. If you have
           enough acceleration, you have might
           have a chance to break the body at
           rest. OK. Go ahead.
                         
          Brendan, sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face,
          watches as Tito brings the bat down on the wood. As it CRACKS
          in half, the other students cheer wildly. Tito smiles and
          leans the bat against a blackboard with "NEWTON'S 2nd LAW OF
          MOTION" printed on it.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           There we go. Alright Tito, well
           done. Remind not to mess with you.
           Sit down everybody. Dial it down.
                         
                         
          As Tito high-fives his way back through the group, things
          settle down and the kids take their seats.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           So, have we got it?
                         
          A room full of affirmatives, with the cocky voice of NASH, a
          skinny white kid in a Flyers jersey, standing out.
                         
                          NASH
           Force equals mass times
           acceleration. We got it.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Alright. The third law--
                         
          A black student, STEPHON, looks up from his desk.
           11.
                         
                         
                          STEPHON
           How many laws this dude got?
                         
                          BRENDAN
                          (LAUGHING)
           The dude? The dude has three.
           Newton the dude says that for every
           action, there's an equal and
           opposite reaction.
                         
          Brendan looks toward the classroom door, where two red-and-
          white clad CHEERLEADERS are peering in, then walks over to
          KC, a blonde cheerleader seated in his class. She is working
          a Blackberry and doesn't notice him approaching.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           For example, if KC does not stop
           the action of sending texts in
           class...
                         
          Brendan stands directly in front of her desk. She quickly
          shoves the Blackberry under a stack of books.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           ...and tell her posse outside to
           beat it...
                         
          He turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the
          window.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           ...then my reaction might be to
           send her down to Principal Zito's
           office. Thus setting our world back
           in proper balance.
                         
                          KC
           Mr. C, I put it away.
                         
          The class busts on KC as Brendan walks back to his desk and
          sits on top of it. It's clear from the vibe in the room that
          he's a very popular teacher. Then the BELL rings.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Alright, before you go, I have your
           tests from last week.

          Fenroy sits at the front desk and looks at his computer.
          Watches "MMA LIVE" and another feature on the big upcoming
          Sparta tournament.
           12.
                         
                         
          Tommy, wearing a wife beater and old gray sweats, works a bag
          and eyeballs an ENTOURAGE that surrounds a ring. Inside, a
          heavily-muscled FIGHTER with a mohawk, MAD DOG GRIMES (30s),
          is putting a beating on his SPARRING PARTNER. The obsequious
          nature of the entourage makes it clear that Mad Dog is
          somebody important.
                         
          In the ring, the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning
          back fist to the chin, goes down in a heap, and doesn't get
          up. COLT BOYD (40s), clearly in charge, throws up his hands
          as Mad Dog laughs.
                         
                          MAD DOG
           Where do you find these girls?
                         
          Colt climbs into the ring and looks at the fallen fighter.
          Glances at Mad Dog.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           We got a tournament coming up. You
           gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh?
                          (TO FENROY)
           Fenroy. Get me some ice. And call
           that Puerto Rican kid, the one that
           fights outa the Bottoms. If he's
           here in 20 minutes, he gets 200
           bucks.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yo, I'll fight him.
                         
          Colt turns around and looks at Tommy. As does Mad Dog, who
          smiles down at him from inside the ring.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Do me a favor guy, go back to your
           bag. We don't need anybody else
           getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk.
                         
          Tommy walks back to his bag. Mad Dog smiles. Looks at Tommy's
          outfit.
                         
                          MAD DOG
           Yo Rock, what happened? You leave
           Mick and Paulie at home today?
                         
          Tommy stops. Walks back to the ring as Fenroy approaches.
                         
                          FENROY

                          COLT BOYD
           Then go through the list. Get me
           Joe Bones.
                         
                          TOMMY
                          (TO COLT)
           All I'm saying is if you need
           somebody to help you, I'm happy to
           keep your boy warm for you.
                         
          Colt looks at Mad Dog. What do you think? The Mohawked
          fighter looks at Tommy. Shrugs. It's his funeral.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           You ever fought before?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yeah.
                         
          Colt studies Tommy. Sees he's serious. Gives in.
                         
                          COLT BOYD

                          TOMMY
           Sure, no problem.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Come on in.
                         
          Colt Boyd waves Tommy into the ring. Mad Dog's entourage
          starts whispering amongst themselves. Snickering at what lays
          in wait for Tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped
          out of the ring.
                         
          A TRAINER tapes Tommy's hands and gives him some MMA gloves.
          He slips them on, then at the sound of a BUZZER he starts
          moving toward Mad Dog, who smirks at Tommy's aggression and
          then starts circling him. Tommy nails him with a front kick
          to the chest. Grimes staggers back and shakes it off.
           14.
                         
                         
                          MAD DOG
           Gonna be a hero? Alright.
                         
          He crouches down, gets serious. He throws a right. Blocked. A
          leg kick. Blocked. Tommy snaps his head with a jab. Then he
          does it again. And again. Then he DECKS HIM with a hard
          right, sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his
          entourage and Colt Boyd.
                         
          Fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring.
          Within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing
          and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dog's head, hauls
          it down, and launches knee after knee into his face.
                         
          Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll,
          striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as Fenroy pulls
          out his CELL PHONE and starts filming the action. As Colt
          Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up, Tommy shoves him against
          the ropes and blasts away.
                         
          Tommy continues to pound. It's a full-fledged beating going
          on in there. Finally, he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left
          hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes, UNCONSCIOUS.
                         
          SILENCE in the gym. What the hell just happened here? The
          entourage rushes to Mad Dog's aid, but he's out cold. Colt
          Boyd looks on in disbelief as Tommy walks across the ring and
          approaches him.
                         
                          TOMMY
           You owe me two hundred bucks.
                         
                         
          INT. FIRST UNION BANK - DAY
                         
          Brendan sits in a chair across from loan officer DAN TAYLOR
          (40s). They're mid-meeting and going over documents.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           This is the new appraisal figure,
           and this is how it effects the
           monthly. As you can see, that puts
           you upside down on your mortgage.
           That's the problem. It's the
           country that did the assessment,
           not the bank. So, the numbers are
           what they are, Mr. Conlon.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Brendan.
           15.
                         
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           The numbers are what they are,
           Brendan. I mean, you're a Math
           teacher, you can appreciate that.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I teach Physics.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Physics. OK. But the bank has got
           to go by the new appraisal figures.
           According to these figures, you're
           upside down on your mortgage--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You said that three times already.
           I get that. But I'm asking you if
           there's something else you can do.
           Not the bank, you. Can you shift
           things around, restructure--
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Well, you've already refinanced
           twice.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Because you advised us to do that.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           I presented you with that option.
           It was your choice.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm also showing you netted a
           substantial payout with the refi.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           We had that conversation. I was
           paying medical bills. Is that in
           your file?
                         
          Taylor looks at Brendan. Takes him a second to remember.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Oh, right. Sorry. Your
           daughter's...kidney?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Heart.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Heart, right.
           (off stack of files on desk)
           Lot of stories.
           16.
                         
                         
          Brendan glares at him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           So my option is I've got no
           options? You're not even gonna try
           to help me?
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           I am trying, Brendan. Look, I can
           get you 90 days to get even--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           90 days is not enough. My wife and
           I have three jobs between us and
           that doesn't cut it. So, what do
           you suggest?
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Let me ask you a question: have you
           considered bankruptcy? It's a
           viable option. There's no shame in
           it these days.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's not how I do things.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Well, then you're looking at
           foreclosure.
                         
          Brendan gets up and storms out of the office.

          Paddy sits in front of the TV and watches an old VIDEO TAPE
          of a wrestling tournament. The bottom of the screen reads:
          1994 PA STATE WRESTLING FINALS. CONLON VS. SPEERY.

           ...the prodigy has yet to yield a

           unprecedented.

           Say what you will about the methods
           of the former Marine, but he's led
           his son to six straight junior
           Olympic titles, and now just
           moments away from a high school
           state championship. And there it
           is! Wow!

          As Paddy watches, the DOORBELL RINGS. He makes his way to the
          door as the tape continues to play.
                         
           ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
           Tommy told me that he's chasing the
           record of Theogenes, apparently a
           mythical Greek fighter said to be
           unbeaten in over 1400 bouts...
                         
          Paddy opens the door to find Colt Boyd standing on the stoop.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for
           Tommy Riordan.
                         
          Paddy registers the name "Riordan."
                         
                          PADDY
           Who?
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd.
                         
                          PADDY
           What business you got with Tommy?
           18.
                         
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           None yet. That's why I'm here. I
           manage fighters.
                         
          Colt looks at Paddy. Jams his hands in his pockets. He's
          obviously waiting for an invite inside. It doesn't come.
                         
           COLT BOYD (CONT'D)
           Tommy's been working out at my gym.
           He put a beating on the number one
           middleweight contender in the world
           today. I want to know more about
           the guy. Maybe help him out. I have
           a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.
                         
                          PADDY
           Conlon. Name's Conlon. And anything
           you want to know about Tommy, you
           gotta ask him yourself.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           I'm just looking for some general
           information here.
                         
                          PADDY
           Like I said, anything you want to

           yourself.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Look, I don't mean to interrupt
           your night. He put this address
           down when he signed up at the gym.
                         
                          PADDY
           He doesn't live here.

          Brendan reaches out to touch gloves with Mike Moore, but his

          business. Brendan, looking less sure of himself, retreats to
          his corner.
                         
                          REFEREE (CONT'D)
           Fighters, are you ready? Let's go!
                         
          The bikers raise hell as the BELL sounds. Moore comes out
          bombing. Brendan dodges a couple of wild haymakers, then gets
          caught in the side of the head with a right hand. He stumbles
          back into the ropes and Moore presses into him, swatting at
          him with his huge hands.
                         
          Brendan absorbs the blows, ducks down, grabs Moore by the
          legs, lifts him, and dumps him on the mat with a resounding
          THUD. Obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching
          skills, Brendan sits on his opponent's chest and starts
          raining down shots, banging and banging, pulverizing his face
          and body.
                         
          It's a full on ass-whooping going on in there until finally,
          mercifully, the referee stops the butchery amidst a mixture
          of CHEERS from the crowd and BOOS from the bikers.
                         
          A winded Brendan walks to his corner, touches the side of his
          head, wipes a small amount of blood on his shorts, and climbs
          out of the ring, where a PROMOTER approaches.
                         
                          PROMOTER
           Nice fight. Two more wins and you
           take home the bacon.
                         
                         
          INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The bedroom door opens and Brendan creeps through the room
          and into the bathroom.
                         
                         
          INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - BATHROOM - SAME
                         
          It's dark, except for the moonlight glowing through the
          window. An exhausted Brendan takes off his shirt and begins
          washing his badly SWOLLEN FACE. Then the door opens, and Tess
          shuffles in.
           21.
                         
                         
                          TESS
                          (SLEEPY)
           Hey babe. How was work?
                         
          Brendan doesn't answer. Tess slowly wakes up. As she does,
          she gets a look at his face.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           Oh my God. What happened? You said
           it was going to be a slow night.
                         
          Tess studies his face. Brendan looks at her. Reaches into his
          pocket and hands her $500 in cash.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm not bouncing at a club.
                         
                          TESS
           What do you mean you're not
           bouncing?
                         
          She looks at him. Looks at the money. Puts it together.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           You've been lying to me?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I went in to apply. They were only
           paying nine bucks an hour. Then I
           saw a sign for this other thing.
                         
          Tess can't believe what she's hearing.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           They're putting us out of the house
           in three months, we're running out
                          OF OPTIONS--
                         
                          TESS
                          (FURIOUS)
           Then they'll put us out of the
           house in three months. I'd rather
           go back to the old apartment than
           see you in the back of an ambulance
           again.
                          (BEAT)
           I thought we agreed that we weren't
           going to raise our children in
           a family where their father gets
           beat up for a living.
           22.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           We're not giving up the house. This
           is our home. We're not going
                          BACKWARDS
                         
          Tess reaches up and touches his battered face. Calms herself
          down. Embraces her husband.
                         
                          TESS
           We'll figure it out. But this is
           what we're not going back to.
                         
                         
          EXT. TRACKSIDE DINER - MORNING
                         
          A steady rain tumbles down over an old-school diner in the
          shadow of the railroad tracks.
                         
                         
          INT. DINER - SAME
                         
          Paddy sits in a booth and takes a sip of coffee. Judging by
          the spent sugar packets and the half-eaten club sandwich,
          he's been there a while.
                         
          The front door swings open and Tommy enters wearing his watch
          cap and sweats. He makes his way over to the booth and plops
          himself down. It's clear something's on his mind but he
          doesn't say anything. Finally, Paddy engages him.
                         
                          PADDY
           You wanted to talk?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yeah.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm gonna start fighting.
                         
                          PADDY
           That right?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Don't play babe in the woods with
           me. I know that guy from the gym
           came to see you.
                         
                          PADDY
           Colt Boyd? I didn't tell him
           anything, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           We wouldn't be sitting here now if
           you did.
           23.
                         
                         
          Tommy grabs a fry off Paddy's plate.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Alright. Look. There's this
           tournament. A big tournament. Top
           sixteen middleweights in the world.
           Single elimination. Winner take all
           for a lot of money. I'm gonna do
           that. But if I'm doin' it, then I'm
           gonna need a trainer. Now that much
           you were good at.
           (off Paddy grinning)
           No, no, no. This doesn't mean
           anything.
                         
          Paddy tries to tether it down, but he's happy. Tommy looks at
          him sternly.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           I'm serious. We train. That's it. I
           don't wanna hear a word about
           anything but training, you
           understand? You wanna tell your war
           stories, you can take `em down to
           the VFW. You can take `em to a
           meeting, or church, or wherever the
           hell it is you go nowadays.
                         
                          PADDY
           What about Colt Boyd?
                         
                          TOMMY
           What about him? I told him I don't
           train with people I don't know.
                         
                          PADDY
           Ah, the devil you know.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Excuse me?
                         
                          PADDY
           The devil you know is better than
           the devil you don't.
                         
          Tommy looks at him. Grins for the first time.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Chasing Theogenes. It'll be kinda
           like old times.
           24.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
                          (ANGRY)
           I just told you, this doesn't mean
           anything. You get that through your
           skull right now or I'm walking.
                         
          Paddy calmly sips his coffee, then leans in on Tommy with a
          stern look. The old lion's got a few teeth left.
                         
                          PADDY
           Alright. Alright. But you get
           something through your skull, too.
           You called me. So don't go
           threatening to walk every five
           minutes. And since this is about
           training, you dump whatever it is
           you need to dump as far as those
           pills are concerned. I don't want
           to see `em.
                         
          Tommy gives him a hard look, but the old man doesn't shy
          away.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           In fact, hand `em over right now.
                          (BEAT)
           I know they're on you, Tommy. You
           sounded like a goddamn maraca
           coming through the door.
                         
          Tommy considers, then reaches into his pocket and slides two
          bottles across the table.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           That's not gonna do.
                          (SHAKING BOTTLES)
           When you came through that door it
           was chhh-chhh-chhh.
           (holding up 3 fingers)
           Three.
                         
          Tommy looks at him. Fishes another bottle out of his pocket
          and flips it on the table.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           (off French fries)
           And another thing, you don't eat
           crap like this. This is for losers
           and old men.
                          (BEAT)
           And we're gonna have to bunk up. If
           we're gonna do this right, you
           gotta stay at the house.
                          (MORE)
           25.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           I watch your diet, we follow the
           old regimen. You copy?
                         
          The two men stare at each other. Tommy looks furious, but he
          doesn't get up. A silent, tenuous agreement is reached.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Copy.
                         
                         
          INT. CENTRAL HIGH HALLWAY - MORNING
                         
          Brendan, his face BRUISED badly from the night before, walks
          down the hallway toward his classroom. STUDENTS watch him as
          he passes and whisper.
                         
                         
          INT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - SAME
                         
          The class is filled with the kind of BUZZING that can only
          rise off a major rumor. Tito, Nash, KC, and Stephon discuss.
                         
                          TITO
           My brother said he was at the strip
           club and saw Mr. C fighting MMA---
                         
                          NASH
           What's MMA?
                         
                          STEPHON
           Mixed Martial Arts. Like, different
           styles of fighting.
                         
                          KC
           Your brother's a liar.
                         
          Brendan enters the room. The kids look at him. Holy shit.
          It's true.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Take your seats.
                         
          Brendan puts his bag down on his desk and faces the class. He
          is not amused by the murmuring in there.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Now, please.
                         
          The kids pipe down. Then Tito speaks up.
           26.
                         
                         
                          TITO
           Yo, Mr. C. My brother was at the
           titty bar last night and said you
           was choking brothers out. What's
           up? Is it true?
                         
                          STEPHON
           Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, did you really
           work on some fools or something?
                         
                          KC
           You have to tell us.
                         
          Before Brendan can answer, he sees PRINCIPAL JOE ZITO (50s)
          gesturing to him through the window of the classroom. Zito
          taps his watch and points. Come see me after class.
                         
                         
          INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S OFFICE - LATER
                         
          Zito, puffy faced, hair getting thinner by the hour, hangs up
          his phone as Brendan pokes his head in. Zito waves him in.
          Eyeballs the marks on his face.

           C'mon, it's not as bad as it looks.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Are you being literal or
           figurative? Because literally it
           looks bad. And figuratively it
           looks even worse. The
           superintendent's coming by in a few
           minutes. So gimme a little help
           here, Brendan. Can you explain to
           me what the hell you were doing?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I need the money, Joe.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Yeah, but we can't have this. This
           isn't moonlighting at Applebee's
           for Christ's sake.
                         
          Zito stands up and runs his hands across his head.
                         
           JOE ZITO (CONT'D)
           Shit, Brendan. Leaving everything
           else aside, which we can't, are you
           out of your mind? You're gonna get
           yourself killed. I mean, you're a
           goddamn teacher.

                          BRENDAN
           Actually, I used to be one of those
           animals.
                         
          Zito looks at Brendan. Puzzled.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           I fought for a living.

                          JOE ZITO
           Yeah, I guess you did.
                         
          Zito sits back down.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just--
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Listen, the school district's not

           cockfighting in strip clubs.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It was the parking lot of a strip
           club.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Wherever it was, you can't be doing
           it, alright? I mean this is a
           serious--shit, he's here.
                         
          Zito sees the SUPERINTENDENT enter the foyer outside his
          office. He's looking none too pleased.

          Brendan sits in a miniature playroom off the kid's bedroom,
          putting glue on the leg of a TOY PIANO. Tess enters the
          bedroom, where the girls sleep, and leans into the playroom.
          They speak in whispers.
                         
                          TESS

           They're gonna review your case at
           the end of the semester, but until
           then you're suspended without pay.
           Joe gave me the number of his
           attorney.
                         
                          BRENDAN

           an attorney?
                         
          Tess crouches down and enters the tiny room. She sits on the
          floor.
                         
                          TESS
           He talked to me for free. As a

           He said there's no precedent for
           this. You'll be back by next
           semester.

           Next semester?
                         
          Tess sighs. They sit in silence. There are no easy solutions.
          Finally, Brendan speaks up.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Look, Tess. They have these smoker
           fights all over. There's one in
           Lancaster next week. There's two in
           Dover the week after. Wilmington.
           Camden. Baltimore. It could keep us

                          TESS
           You're gonna put yourself through
           this over and over, for five
           hundred bucks a pop?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Some of them pay a little more than
           that.

           have seen too much UFC on TV. If
           you have a better solution, I'm all
           ears.
                         
          Tess sits quietly. Knows they have limited options.
                         
                          TESS
           What are we gonna tell the girls?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It'll be fine. I'll just leave the
           house as usual, except now I'll be
           going to the gym.

          arm and a cup of coffee in his hands. He enters Tommy's room,
          which is also a monument to the past. Old wrestling TROPHIES,
          Steelers' posters, and an EMPTY SECOND BED that obviously
          once belonged to Brendan.

          Paddy places the cup of coffee on the night stand as Tommy
          stirs, then sits on the empty bed and unrolls the poster.
          It's yellowed with age and covered with a boy's handwriting.

           to that record.
                         
          Tommy says nothing. Not a nostalgic bone in his body. The
          dreams on that poster are long gone.

           Yeah, I'll tell ya something. You
           can take that thing back to where
           you found it. And you can leave the
           coffee in the pot. I can pour that
           myself. I can wake myself up, too.
                         
          Paddy's stung but covers it amiably.

           That's him. That's him.
                         
                         
          INT. CAMPANA FIGHTING SYSTEM - DAY
                         
          In a top MMA gym, FRANK CAMPANA (40s) works in a ring with
          Brazilian superstar MARCO SANTOS (20s) and other FIGHTERS.
          The sound of CLASSICAL MUSIC fills the air.
                         
                          FRANK
           Let the music sink in to you. This
           is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe.
                         
          As Frank teaches, Brendan walks in the door. The great
          trainer notices him and walks over.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Do I know you? I think I know you.
                         
          They embrace warmly.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Long time, brother.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Liking the place, Frank.
                         
                          FRANK
           Thank you, brother.
           (off Brazilian fighter)
           You see this beast? Marco Santos?
           I'm training him for Sparta.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Amazing, man.
                         
                          FRANK
           Come on back.
                         
          The two head for the offices at the back of the gym.
                         
                         
          INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          They walk into an office filled with PHOTOS of Frank in his
          fighting days. He was obviously somebody. The walls are also
          adorned with SPARTA posters. Frank reaches into a mini-
          fridge, pulling out a couple bottles of Vitamin water. He
          hands one to Brendan and motions for him to sit down.
                         
                          FRANK
           You look good, brother. How're the
           girls?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Good. Good. I had another little
           one. Rosie.
                         
                          FRANK
           I know. Johnny C. told me she was
           in the hospital for a bit. I was
           gonna call, but then time went by.
           I don't know. I'm a piece of shit.
           I should have called.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's alright.
                         
                          FRANK
           No, Brendan. I'm sorry.
           34.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's all good. She's good now.
                         
          Frank looks at his old friend. Smiles warmly.
                         
                          FRANK
           It's great to see you, man. So
           everything's going good?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Yeah. Well, I've got a little
           problem. The guys at the bank want
           to take my house away. That's kind
           of why I came to see you, actually.
                         
          Frank considers what he's hearing.
                         
                          FRANK
           I've got most of my dough tied up
           in this joint, but how much do you
           need?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I didn't come here for a loan,
           Frank.
                          (BEAT)
           I was hoping you'd train me.
                         
                          FRANK
           Train you for what?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I want to get back in the cage.
                         
          Frank starts smiling. Leans back in his seat. Then he sees
          Brendan is not smiling with him.
                         
                          FRANK
           You're serious?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I just won an event the other
           night.
                         
                          FRANK
           Ah, you won an event.
           (off bruised face)
           That's what this is. Let me guess,
           it was in a parking lot. DJ from
           the local radio station. Couple of
           ring card girls you wouldn't bang
           on a dare. Am I right?
                         
          Brendan smiles.
           35.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Ish.
                         
                          FRANK
           Ish. Brendan. I love you. I do. But
           why would I train you? When you
           were in shape and on the right side
           of 30 you were barely a .500
           fighter. You never listened to me.
           You never listened to anyone. These
           guys are animals. I mean, you're a
           teacher, right? What're you gonna
           do? You're gonna come down here for
           a couple days a week after
           detention? You're gonna skip out of
           the girl's volleyball game early?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I've got loads of time. Time's not
           an issue. The parking lot thing
           kinda got me suspended. I need to
           keep working the smokers.
                         
                          FRANK
           Tess know about this?
           (off Brendan's nod)
           Yeah? `Cause the last time you
           fought, I got read the riot act
           sitting in a hospital waiting room.
           You remember that?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           No. I was unconscious.
                         
          The two friends share a laugh.
                         
                          FRANK
           She's not gonna come down here with
           the two puppies, screaming at
           Frank?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's not gonna happen. Come on.
           Whattya say, Frank?
                         
                          FRANK
           What do I say? What am I gonna say
           to you? No? I mean, all my time is
           wrapped up with Marco. You come
           down, I'll throw you in the
           rotation, you spar with these guys,
           no problem. But I can't promise you
           much more than that, Brendan.
           36.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's all I need.
                         
          Brendan stands up. Shakes Frank's hand.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           I appreciate it.
                         
                          FRANK
           Let me know when you're coming
           down.
                         
                          BRENDAN
                          (WALKING AWAY)
           Well, I'm just gonna go get my
           stuff from the car.
                         
                          FRANK
           Now?
                         
          Brendan puts his dukes up and smiles as Frank shakes his
          head.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Brendan pulls into the driveway of his modest home, gets out
          of his Camry, and looks to the street, where Paddy stands
          outside his Olds, leaning on the passenger door.
                         
          Brendan carries a gym bag and wears work out clothes. He's
          clearly not happy to see Paddy, who stands there,
          uncomfortable and heavy hearted in the light of the street
          lamp.
                         
                          PADDY
           Hey, Brendan. It's me, Pop.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           What're you doing here?
                         
                          PADDY
           I have some news for you.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Something wrong with your hands?
                         
          Paddy shakes his head, unsure what he means.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           If there's nothing wrong with your
           hands then there's no reason for
           you not to phone. That's the deal.
           37.
                         
                         
                          PADDY
           Yeah, I forgot--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.
                         
          Paddy holds his hands out, palms down.
                         
                          PADDY
           Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my
           hands so steady? Have you?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm going inside.
                         
                          PADDY
           I've got a thousand days. A
           thousand days sober today.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Well, that's great, Pop. But it
           doesn't change anything.
                         
                          PADDY
           What do you mean it doesn't change
           anything? Have a heart, Brendan.
                         
          Paddy's words set Brendan off. A side of him we haven't seen
          before emerges. He approaches his father fiercely.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You listen to me. You take your
           have-a-heart bullshit and you run
           it down the road. Run it out on
           someone who doesn't know you like I
           do.
                         
                          PADDY
           C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we
           could break bread. Open some lines
           of communication.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You got two lines of communication,
           the telephone and the post office.
           Just because you decide it's a
           special day, it doesn't make it one
           for me. I got a wife and kids
           inside and they're waiting for me,
           so I don't have time for whatever
           this is.
           38.
                         
                         
                          PADDY
           I know you got a wife and kids in
           there. I got a grand-daughter I
           haven't seen in three years and
           another I haven't even ever met.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do
           you remember having anything to do
           with that?
                         
          Paddy nods. Casts his eyes down in shame.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           That shit you pulled. Never again.
           And all the shit I saw growing up?
           That doesn't happen here.
                         
          Brendan looks at the reformed Paddy, a measure of sympathy on
          his face. Then he heads for the house.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Take care of yourself.
                         
          As he's halfway through the yard, Paddy calls out.
                         
                          PADDY
           Tommy's back.
                         
          Brendan stops in his tracks. He turns and looks at his Dad.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           He's in the `Burgh.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Tommy's in Pittsburgh?
                         
                          PADDY
           He came to see me.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           He came to see you?
                         
                          PADDY
           He's over at the house. We're doing
           a little training at Fitzy's.
           Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's
           anymore.
                         
          Brendan walks closer. Incredulous.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You and Tommy are training
           together?
           39.
                         
                         
          Paddy nods.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Tommy Conlon.
                         
                          PADDY
           Riordan. He's using your mother's
           maiden name now.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I know what her name is.
                         
                          PADDY
           I thought you'd want to know he's
           back. That's why I drove all the
           way over here.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I thought you came to break bread
           over a thousand days?
                         
                          PADDY
           That too.
                         
          Brendan looks at him. Considers.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Did he say if he wants to see me?
                         
                          PADDY
           He doesn't say much. He's just not
           that happy kid he was.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Wow, look at you. Mister inside
           man.
                         
          Paddy frowns.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           You and Tommy training together
           like nothing ever happened. This is
           unbelievable. Now I know what
           you're really doing here.
                         
                          PADDY
           What's that?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You came to gloat.
                         
                          PADDY
           I did not come to gloat. I came to
           get my son back.
           40.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Well, there you go. You got your
           son back.
                         
                          PADDY
           I'm talking about you, Bren--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You got your son back.
                         
          Brendan starts to walk away, then turns around again.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           You know, part of the reason I
           stuck around was `cause I thought
           I'd finally get you all to myself.
           But you didn't have any interest in
           training me. Tommy was the one.
                         
                          PADDY
           Ah, Brendan. I was a drunk. I mean,
           you know. I'm sorry.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Forget it. You were always a front
           runner. You never had any interest
           in underdogs. But I was your son.
                         
                          PADDY
           You are my son.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Am I?
                         
                          PADDY
           Yeah, you are. I'm just asking you
           to find just a little space in your
           heart to forgive me.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I
           do not trust you. Tell Tommy this
           is where I am if he wants to see
           me.
                         
                          PADDY
           Alright. But they're not different
           things. You've gotta trust to
                          FORGIVE--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Goodnight, Pop.
           41.
                         
                         
          Paddy looks toward the house, where Emily, Rosie, and Tess
          stand at the door. Paddy waves.
                         
                          PADDY
           My God, is that Emily? Boy, she's
           grown, Brendan. Is that Rosie?
                         
          Brendan keeps walking. Opens his door to step inside.
                         
                          ROSIE
           Daddy, who is that?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Just some nice old man.
                         
          Brendan closes the door, leaving the heartbroken Paddy alone
          in the yard.

           Huge news breaking here at ESPN.
           Koba is coming to America and will
           fight at Sparta. Universally
           considered to be the greatest pound
           for pound fighter that ever lived,
           the mighty, mythical Russian has
           never fought on U.S. soil in his
           legendary career...
                         
          Mad Dog Grimes trains furiously under the watchful eye of
          Colt Boyd. When Colt sees Tommy approaching, he turns his
          attention away from Mad Dog.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Tommy? Got some news for ya. I got
           you into Sparta. Took some doing,
           but I made it happen..
           (off no reaction from Tommy)
           Thank you and 10 percent is
           customary.

          Tommy heads up the stairs toward the locker room without
          acknowledging Colt, though he does allow a small smile to
          crease his lips.

          but tired Mexican girl, watches a grainy TV with a six-year-
          old BOY and a four-year-old GIRL as the phone RINGS. The
          table it sits on has a FRAMED PICTURE of Tommy and another
          MARINE on it, their arms around each other in the Iraqi
          desert.

           You know, Pilar, I haven't
           forgotten for one minute what I
           promised you. What I promised
           Manny. I've got an opportunity
           coming up to help you guys out. To
           take care of you guys.
                         
                          PILAR
           Whatever you can do, Tommy. I know
           Manny would really appreciate it.
           You worry too much. It's OK. We're

           J.J., we've never seen this kind of
           Grand Prix tournament in the
           country before. Tell us, why the
           unique format?
                         
           J.J. RILEY (ON SCREEN)
           Well, Jon, you know as well as
           anyone that in Mixed Martial Arts,
           anyone can beat anyone on a given
           night...

          Brendan takes steady blows from an OPPONENT in another
          smoker, then turns the tables, slams his man down, and chokes
          him out. His skills are improving.
                         
           J.J. RILEY (V.O.)
           ...but with this type of format,

          In an expansive and grim scrap yard along the river bank,
          Tommy somehow manages to lift and flip old long-haul rig
          tires. They're roughly the size of hot tubs. His strength is
          astonishing.

           and the hype continues for the War
           on the Shore. Fourth of July
           weekend in Atlantic City and you
           know what that means: the great
           Koba, bringing his act stateside.
           Let me ask you about the other
           guys. What are they thinking
           entering a winner take all
           tournament against a guy that
           seemingly can't be beat?
                         
           RASHOD EVANS (ON SCREEN)
           They're thinking five million
           dollars, and five million dollars
           is a lot of money, but they've
           gotta remember one thing: they're
           going against Koba. Mission
           impossible. Game over. Go home.
                         
          Tess comes back down the stairs and looks at the screen,
          concern on her face.
                         
          ON TV SCREEN: THE MIGHTY KOBA TATTOOS AN OPPONENT WITH A
          VICIOUS STRIKE TO THE HEAD. THE FIGHTER FALLS FLAT ON HIS
          BACK AND IS FINISHED OFF IN NO TIME. BRUTAL. "FROM RUSSIA
          WITH LOVE" APPEARS ON SCREEN.

          Frank lets himself into the gym at the crack of dawn. Finds
          Brendan already there, training alone with ferocity and
          listening to classical music.

          Tommy pounds on tires with a sledge hammer as Paddy exhorts
          him on. It's a brutal regimen.

           JON ANIK (ON SCREEN)
           The `Pittsburgh Beatdown' has
           become one of the most watched
           videos on YouTube this year. Now
           joining us via satellite is the
           victim of the infamous incident,
           Mad Dog Grimes. Mad Dog, what is
           your response to all the hoopla
           surrounding the video and Tommy
           Riordan?
                         
           MAD DOG (ON SCREEN)
           This guy's a nobody. It was just a
           sparring session. It is what it is,
           and he's gonna pay for it next
           month in Atlantic City.

          Brendan works over another FIGHTER in a smoker. He looks
          fantastic and submits the guy with slick Jiu Jitsu.

          struggling to catch up with him.

          Tommy and Mad Dog work out, each jumping rope at blinding
          speed. They eyeball each other, the hate increasing.

           With Sparta now only two short
           weeks away, J.J. Riley and the
           TapOut crew returned to the U.S.

           They stopped in Philadelphia today
           to check in on renowned trainer
           Frank Campana and top contender
           Marco Santos.

           FRANK (V.O.)
           You've gotta relax and stay calm in
           there. The cage is your home. You
           set the pace.

          Brendan and Marco grapple. They're evenly matched. Frank
          looks on, impressed by Brendan.
                         
           FRANK (V.O.)
           You set the rhythm. Feel the
           Beethoven. Be smarter than him.
           More patient. Wait for him to make
           a mistake. And when he does, that's
           your moment.
                         
          Brendan turns Marco and gets him in a knee bar. Marco has
          nowhere to go and is forced to TAP. Frank jumps in the ring,
          all smiles, and slaps Brendan on the chest.
                         
                          FRANK
           No he did not tap you! Physics
           teacher! That's the best in the
           world there, son.

          Tommy keeps pushing the giant tires until he finally reaches
          the end of the yard. He's ready.

          badly INJURED HIS KNEE.

          INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - LATER
                         
          A sorely dejected Frank walks through an underground parking
          garage with Brendan.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite?
                         
                          FRANK
           Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta
           call the boys and break the news.
           I'll call you tomorrow.
                         
          Frank heads off through the lot. Brendan reaches his car,
          stops, considers. Calls out to Frank while jogging toward
          him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a
           great time. And it's too bad about
           Marco. But what about me?
                         
          Brendan looks hopefully at Frank, who shakes his head as he
          begins to open the door of his `70 Ford Bronco.
                         
                          FRANK
           You talking about Sparta? Brendan,
           please. You got a better chance of
           starting a boy band. I'll talk to
           you tomorrow.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's a grand prix tournament. Which
           means anything can happen. You know
           that as well as I do.
                         
          Frank looks at him. Sees how serious Brendan is.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           They'll have to kill me to get me
           out of that cage.
                         
                          FRANK
           That's what I'm afraid of.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Frank, I need this. You're real
           tight with those guys. You call
           them, they'll listen to you.
           49.
                         
                         
                          FRANK
           You realize what you're asking me
           to do here, Brendan? We go down to
           AC and you get tapped out in five
           seconds, how does that benefit
           either one of us?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's not gonna happen.
                         
                          FRANK
           Not gonna happen. Wish I had a
           nickel for every time I heard that.
                         
                          BRENDAN
                          (SMILING)
           It's not gonna happen.
                         
          Frank breaks. Smiles. How can he say no?
                         
                          FRANK
           I'll make a call.
                         
          Brendan grins and walks back toward his car.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I love my coach!
                         
                         
          EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - MORNING
                         
          Brendan pulls a garbage bin down to the curb as Tess walks
          out of the house talking on a cordless PHONE.
                         
           TESS (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah, the girls are good. They're
           good. Yeah, you should. You've been
           spending so much time with Brendan
           these days it's like you're part of
           the family or something. Yeah, he's
           right here.
           (handing phone to Brendan)
           It's your boyfriend.
                         
           BRENDAN (INTO PHONE)
           Hey Frank.
                          (BEAT)
           That's unbelievable. I can't thank
           you enough. I don't know what to
           say. Alright, listen, I've gotta
           call you back. Alright, bye.
                         
          Brendan hangs up the phone. Looks at Tess.
           50.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           I'm in. I'm going.
                         
          A look of serious concern crosses Tess's face. She puts her
          hands on her hips.
                         
                          TESS
           Really? So that's your decision?
           You decided? `Cause I really
           enjoyed that conversation we just
           had about making that decision
           together.
                         
          Brendan doesn't say anything. Knows she's right. And that
          he's about to get laid into.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           You told me you were gonna fight
           guys that watched too much UFC. I
           saw that Koba dude on TV, and he's
           the guy they're watching.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's a lot of money, Tess.
                         
                          TESS
           I don't give a shit about the
           money, Brendan. I told you that.
           We're gonna end up cashing in your
           life insurance policy before we
           pick up that prize money.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You don't think I can do it.
                         
                          TESS
           I think you can get killed.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm not gonna get killed.
                         
                          TESS
           Fine, you're not going to get
           killed. But can you promise me
           you're not going to get hurt?
           You're not gonna end up in the
           hospital? You're not gonna end up
           paralyzed? We'll have no prize
           money. No house. Payments for
                          HOSPITAL BILLS--
           51.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Tess, I can promise you this: if I
           don't try, they're gonna take the
           house. How's that for a promise?
                         
          No response from Tess, who has tears in her eyes.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           So, I'm gonna go, OK? But I'd
           really love it if you'd be with me
           on this.
                         
          Tess looks at her husband. Wants to support him, but can't.
                         
                          TESS
           I'm not gonna watch you fight
           again. I'm not.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.
                         
          Tess starts walking back toward the house. She marches up the
          lawn without turning back, leaving Brendan, alone, in front
          of his house. He looks at the toys strewn across the yard.
          Surveys the neighborhood. He's going to Sparta.

          Sunlight pours down on the crowded beaches, hotels, and
          boardwalks of AC. Thousands of PEOPLE jam the outside of the
          majestic Boardwalk Hall. It seems as if everyone on earth is
          in town.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           ...but fight fans are already
           descending on Atlantic City for the
           Super Bowl of Mixed Martial Arts,
           Sparta.
                         
          BILLBOARDS heralding the arrival of the SPARTA tournament are
          everywhere. Ceremonial Fourth of July banners hang, cars jam
          Ocean Avenue, early FIREWORKS pop. The buzz is electric. The
          greatest show on earth has hit the shore.

          EXT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
                         
          LIMOUSINES pull up in front of the Boardwalk Hall rotunda as
          "Mad Dog" Grimes, Orlando "Midnight" Le, Karl "The Dane"
          Kruller, and other fighters make their way down a long red
          carpet swarming with FANS.
                         
          In the middle of it all is J.J. Riley, greeting press and
          guests and running the show as the Tapout crew, Colt Boyd,
          and others mill about and talk shop. Announcers BRYAN CALLEN
          (40s) and SAM SHERIDAN (30s) corral J.J. for an interview.
                         
                          CALLEN
           J.J., you've made a fortune with
           your hedge funds, yet you turned
           your back on Wall Street and
           dedicated your life to making
           Sparta happen. Tell us, why is this
           tournament so important to you?
                         
           J.J. RILEY
           Growing up, we all wanted to know
           who the toughest kid in the
           neighborhood was, right? I wanna
           know who the toughest man on the
           planet is. That's why I put this
           together, that's what all these
           people are here to see, and come
           Saturday night, that's what we're
           gonna find out.
                         
                          SHERIDAN
           Thank you, J.J. And here's
           something fans never thought they'd
           see: Koba is here! The legend
           arriving to fight on U.S. soil for
           the very first time...
                         
          The great and mighty KOBA emerges from a white stretch limo,
          trailed by his ENTOURAGE of tough-looking RUSSIANS.
          FLASHBULBS pop. REPORTERS swarm. It looks like a movie
          premiere out there and Koba's the star.
                         
                         
          INT. BOARDWALK HALL LOBBY - SAME
                         
          As WORKERS set up for the press conference and camera crews
          stake out their territory, Tommy and Paddy hug the corner of
          the room and wait. Not in their element at all. Moments
          later, Brendan comes walking through the doors.
                         
          As he moves through the crowded room, Brendan and Tommy make
          eye contact.
           53.
                         
                         
          They haven't seen each other in 14 years, and judging by the
          looks on their faces they certainly didn't expect to see each
          other today. Paddy is just as shocked.
                         
          Brendan begins to inch toward Tommy, but is intercepted by
          Frank, who was caught up in the media storm outside.
                         
                          FRANK
           Hey. Where'd you go? You can't
           leave me like that. They wanna talk
           to you, not me.
                         
          Brendan looks past Frank. Tommy has risen and headed toward
          the exit, trailed by Paddy, who calls after him.

          The sun descends over the boardwalks and hotels of Atlantic
          City, and sinks into the sea.
                         
                         
          INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME
                         
          Paddy sits on a couch thumbing through a Sparta program and
          looks proudly at a PICTURE of Brendan. He listen to "Moby
          Dick" on his headphones as a TV plays in the foreground.

          Paddy notices the picture of Tommy. Puts down the program and
          takes his headphones off.

           Recent revelations that Riordan
           was not only a United States Marine
           but a hero in the Iraq War, has
           cast an even brighter spotlight on
           a fighter who seems to have come
           out of nowhere.

          Paddy stares at the screen intently.

           ...the bridge just crumbled. The
           Amtrack was upside down. Water was
           coming in from everywhere. The
           water pressure was too much. We
           couldn't get the back hatch open.
                         
          ON TV SCREEN: BRADFORD HAS TO COMPOSE HIMSELF.

           We were all drowning, man. It was a
           death trap.
                         
          Tommy walks into the room from the door of an adjoining suite
          and stares at the TV.
                         
           BRADFORD (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D)
           I couldn't have had more than
           another minute. Suddenly the back
           ramp gets ripped off, and there he
           was. Before I could get out and
           thank him, he was gone. He just
           vanished like a ghost.
                         
          Paddy is dumbfounded and looks at Tommy, who glances at him
          and back at the TV before heading toward the door.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I'm takin' a walk.
                         
          ON TV SCREEN: THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ON BRADFORD'S FACE. HE
          SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO TOMMY.
                         
           BRADFORD (ON SCREEN)
           You saved my life, brother. Anybody

          EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
                         
          Brendan walks on the beach as the waves of the Atlantic Ocean
          lap at the shoreline. Boats bob on the water. Stray bottle
          rockets trace through the night sky.
                         
          In the distance, the NEON LIGHTS of an amusement park flash
          and zip. Behind Brendan, the big casinos loom, advertisements
          for Sparta filling their BILLBOARDS.
                         
          Brendan continues walking, then spots Tommy coming toward
          him. The brothers make eye contact. Stop. Then approach each
          other warily.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Been looking all over for you.
           How's it going?
                         
                          TOMMY
           It's going.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I was thinking maybe we could grab
           a coffee.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I don't drink coffee. Whattya want?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You don't want to go sit down
           somewhere?
                         
                          TOMMY
           I'm good right here.
           56.
                         
                         
          Brendan looks at Tommy. Sees how rigid he is. A long silence.
          Finally Brendan cuts right to it.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to
           know I was never gonna see you guys
           again?
                         
                          TOMMY
           You were briefed. You had the
           information. You chose the old man
           and the girl.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           She wasn't some girl. I married
           her. She's my wife.
                         
          Brendan reaches into his pocket and removes a recent
          Christmas PHOTO of Tess, Emily, and Rosie from his wallet.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           (handing Tommy the picture)
           That's Tess. And that's Emily and
           Rosie. They're your nieces, Tommy.
                         
          Tommy glances at the photo impasssively and hands it back.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Don't know `em.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I know you don't know them. Of
           course you don't know them.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Why am I looking at pictures of
           people I don't know?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Because that's my family.
                         
                          TOMMY
           And who are you exactly?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm your brother, man.
                         
                          TOMMY
           You were in the Corps?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           What?
           57.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
           I said I didn't know you were in
           the Corps.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I wasn't in the Corps.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Then you ain't no brother to me. My
           brother was in the Corps.
                         
          With that, Tommy walks briskly away from Brendan and up the
          beach. His brother runs after him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old
           kid. What the hell did I know?
                         
                          TOMMY
           I don't know what you know. Why
           don't you go ask your girlfriend
           about it?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it?
           I stay with Tess and I never get to
           see you guys again? Not a single
           phone call? Nothing?
                         
          No response from Tommy. He's a wall.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           God, man, I don't understand this.
           You won't forgive me, but you'll
           forgive Pop?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Shit. He's just some old vet I
           train with. He means nothing to me.
           From what I hear he means nothing
           to you, either, so you got balls
           talking about forgiveness.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's got nothing to do with
           forgiveness. I've got a family to
           protect. Everything I do is for
           them.
                         
          Tommy smirks. Walks away again.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           But I forgave Pop. Just like I
           forgave you and Mom.
           58.

                          (TURNING AROUND)
           You forgave us?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Yeah.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I'm not surprised you made the
           tournament, Brendan. You got some
           stones.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I fell in love, Tommy. What the
           hell was I supposed to do?
                         
                          TOMMY
           You were supposed to stick to the
           plan. You were supposed to come
           with us. Mom needed you. I needed
           you. You were my big brother and
           you bailed on me.
                         
          The words hit Brendan hard.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Hey, I'm glad you stayed and
           everything worked out for you,
           Brendan. See, you leave, you get
           the opposite. You leave, you get to
           bury people.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You're not the only one who
           suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know
           she was sick. I never even got the
           chance to say goodbye to my own
           mother. You had no right to keep
           that from me! That was not your
           decision to make!
                         
                          TOMMY
           You know what? You walk around with
           your pictures in your wallet and
           you're all, I forgive you, I
           forgive Pop. I forgive everyone.
           But you know what? You're full of
           shit.
                         
          Tommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces. Standing
          on the knife's edge of violence. They hold the stare down for
          a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war.
           59.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Are we done, Brendan? Are we
           finished?
                         
          Tommy and Brendan look at each other with burning intensity.
          Too much baggage and both too much and nothing left to say.
          Finally, Tommy turns and walks on down the beach.
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL HIGH, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
                         
          Sunny day. And a nearly abandoned school parking lot.
                         
                         
          INT. OUTER OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Nash, Tito, and KC wait outside the Principal's office. It's
          quiet and aside from one SECRETARY, there's no one around.
          After a moment, Stephon comes walking in, and they all stand
          up and head into the Principal's office.

                          JOE ZITO
           You realize you're supposed to seek
           my wise counsel when school's
           actually in session, right?
                         
          All four of them laugh nervously. Working their way up to
          something.
                         
                          STEPHON

                          JOE ZITO
           Let me get this straight. You want
           to use the auditorium to watch a
           suspended teacher engage in the
           activity he was suspended for? Am I
           hearing this correctly?
                          (BEAT)
           I gotta talk to your parents. You
           guys might need to be in summer
           school after all.

           The gym's the only place that's big
           enough.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           It's never gonna happen.
                         
                          STEPHON

           Yeah. We'll get the whole school to
           sign it.
                         
                          NASH
           The power of democracy!

           Look, I appreciate that you guys
           love your teacher. I really do. But
           there is nothing I can do for you.
                         
          Zito turns and heads back to his desk. The kids, dejected,
          leave the office and walk off down the hallway.

          The Goodyear BLIMP, "SPARTA IS HERE" blinking on it, floats
          over Atlantic City. FIREWORKS explode majestically above
          Boardwalk Hall and fall into the sea, where hundreds of boats
          bob, televisions tuned to Sparta visible from many of them.
                         
          THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE cram the beach and boardwalk, crane their
          necks toward the sky, and watch the stunning pyrotechnics. In
          the streets, limos line up on Ocean Avenue. Even from a
          distance, the excitement and energy are palpable.

          Enormous electronic BILLBOARDS flash outside of the giant

           Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen along

           Sheridan. Sam, when J.J. Riley
           conceived Sparta he wanted to
           create, quite simply, the biggest
           Mixed Martial Arts spectacle in
           history.
                         
                          SHERIDAN
           Five million dollars, Bryan. Five
           million dollars. J.J. Riley put his
           money where his mouth is and put up
           the biggest purse this sport has
           ever seen.
                         
                          CALLEN
           It's unprecedented, Sam. As is the
           hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan,
           the war hero who has become an

           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           It looks as though the moment of
           truth has arrived, because here
           comes Tommy Riordan.

          sweep over nearly 15,000 SCREAMING FANS, not one of them
          sitting.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Tommy Riordan's captured the
           media's attention, but the question
           still remains: who is this guy? And
           more importantly, can he compete in
           this talent pool? Can he win?
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           I wish I knew, Bryan. I wish I knew
           who he was, and I've gotta say the
           fact that I don't know is strange.
           In an internet age where there are
           no secrets, this guy is a complete
           mystery. I can't find out anything
           about him. Tommy Riordan is
           officially Google proof.
                         
          Tommy continues to storm toward the cage with a furious and
          focused look on his face. He seems to want nothing to do with
          Paddy. Training is over. It's time to fight.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           You gotta love this guy, Sam. No
           walk out music, no sponsors, no
           interviews. He skipped out on the
           press conference. Wouldn't have his
           picture take for the program. He's
           breaking every rule!

           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           The only reason that Tommy is even
           in this tournament is because of a
           video showing him beating up Mad
           Dog Grimes in the gym.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           But the reason a lot of his fans
           are in the stands is because of
           another video, which is even more
           stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes
           video. Let me describe it for you
           folks for the few who haven't seen
           it, and I don't know anyone who
           hasn't, but Tommy Riordan ripped
           the door off a tank in the heat of
           battle, saving lives in the
           process, and then walked away
           without claiming a medal. He ripped
           the door off a tank!
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Tommy Riordan is a genuine war
           hero, I'm not taking anything away
           from the guy. He's a very, very
           tough guy, Bryan, but the tank
           don't hit back. We've seen YouTube
           sensations fail on the big stage
           before.
                         
          Tommy stands outside the cage and has Vaseline applied to his
          face. He looks like he's ready to murder someone.

           Tommy Riordan definitely has his
           hands full in his first opponent,
           Francisco Barbosa. Barbosa is
           nothing to scoff at.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Yeah, he's the real deal. Very
           tough guy. Very high caliber
           fighter. Tommy Riordan came out of
           nowhere, and I imagine he's going
           to disappear just as quickly.

           Gentlemen, you've been given your
           instructions. I expect a clean
           fight. Obey my commands at all
           times. Defend yourselves at all
           times. Touch gloves, go back, let's
           do this.
                         
          In the crowd, two sections of MARINES in full dress uniforms
          wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible
          for Tommy, who returns to his corner. Paddy attempts to give
          him some advice, but Tommy is not listening.

           We're about to get the big answer
           to the big question: is Tommy
           Riordan for real? And here we go!
                         
          The bell rings. DING! And Tommy comes out fast and hard.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Barbosa's gonna be looking for a
           take down.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Definitely gonna be looking for a
           take down.
                         
          There will not be a take down. Tommy ducks a blow, then
          levels Barbosa with a massive and brutal LEFT HOOK. The
          Brazilian's head snaps sideways, his MOUTHPIECE goes flying,
          and he does a face plant on to the canvas. It's over.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Barbosa is down! Barbosa has been
           knocked out! Tommy Riordan is most
           definitely for real!
                         
          As the crowd erupts and Josh Rosenthal waves to Barbosa's
          corner to get a medic in there, Tommy marches out of the cage
          without waiting for an official announcement.
           65.
                         
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           And now he's walking out of the
           cage! He's leaving the cage! There
           goes another rule out the window!

          Fenroy and the boys fired up. They can't believe the
          ferocious knockout they've just witnessed.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Francisco Barbosa is out cold, and
           he is out of this tournament,
           Bryan.
                         
                         
          INT. BRENDAN'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME
                         
          The official pokes his head into the locker room where Frank
          and a nervous Brendan sit alone.
                         
                          OFFICIAL
           Show time.
                         
          On the TV monitor, Tommy's annihilating knockout of Francisco
          Barbosa plays. Then, in the distance, the strains of
          CLASSICAL MUSIC can be heard. Brendan looks at Frank, who
          smiles and puts his hands on Brendan's shoulders.
                         
                          FRANK
           You can do this.
                         
          He grabs the nervous Brendan's head between his hands.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I want to hear you say it.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I can do this.
                         
                          FRANK
           Then let's go do this.

          BUZZING in the crowd. Another fight close at hand.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           J.J. Riley had less than 48 hours
           to fill Marco Santos' spot, and he
           basically had to rely on the word
           of Frank Campana.
           66.
                         
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           And he chose Brendan Conlon, which
           quite frankly is something I just
           don't understand.
                         
          Brendan and Frank walk down the tunnel toward the arena,
          where Paddy is waiting, his All Access pass around his neck.
          Brendan notices the old man as he approaches.
                         
                          PADDY
           Go get `em, son.
                         
          Brendan barely acknowledges Paddy and keeps walking. Frank
          looks at Brendan with a "Who the hell is that?" expression.
          As they approach the dark lights of the arena, Beethoven
          continues to BOOM out over the loud speakers.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           I can understand coming out to no
           music, by why in the world would
           you choose classical music for your
           entrance?
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           This is Beethoven, Bryan. This is
           Ode to Joy.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           My apologies, Mr. Renaissance man.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           You want to talk about renaissance
           men, you gotta talk about Frank
           Campana. Very unorthodox trainer,
           and one of the best in the game.
           He's well known for using classical
           music to train his fighters to
           remain calm, to remain patient, and
           to remain composed under pressure.
                         
          Brendan and Frank make their way through the crowd and toward
          cageside, where Bryan Callen reaches beneath his seat.
                         
                          CALLEN
           Classical music is about as fitting
           to this setting as Brendan Conlon
           is to this tournament. In fact, let
           me show you something.
                         
          Callen holds up a plastic bag with water and a GOLDFISH
          inside.

           This is Brendan Conlon. He's a
           feeder fish, and he's about to get
           dropped into a shark tank.
                         
          Brendan gets greased up, then climbs into the cage.
                         
                          SHERIDAN
           C'mon, give the guy a break. At
           least we've seen him fight before.
           He was in the UFC. We remember him.
                         
                          CALLEN
           I remember him, too. I remember him
           being very unmemorable.

          A nervous Tess sits at the table, failing to concentrate on
          folding laundry. The TV in front of her is off, but she
          glances at it anyway. In front of her sits a CELL PHONE. She
          glances at it repeatedly.

          "MIDNIGHT" LE climbs in, shoulders bulging and abs shredded.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Midnight Le getting ready to climb
           into the cage and go to work.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           When the brackets were announced,
           Midnight thought he'd be going up
           against Marco Santos. He's gotta be
           thrilled to be seeing Brendan
           Conlon standing across from him.
                         
          Brendan stands in the corner and looks at the massive
          Midnight Le. Frank smiles at him.
                         
                          FRANK
           You asked for it.
                         
          Brendan grins and looks out at the rabid crowd.
           68.
                         
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Brendan retired from fighting some
           years ago, he's actually a high
           school Physics teacher now, and
           Midnight had some fun with that at
           the press conference.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           He said he was gonna give the
           teacher a serious lesson, and that
           getting killed was no way to spend
           a summer vacation.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal waves the two fighters into the center of the
          cage for instructions.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Alright, gentleman, you've been
           given your instructions, I expect a
           clean fight. Obey my commands at
           all times. Defend yourselves at all
           times. Touch gloves, go back, let's
           do this.
                         
          The fighters head to their corners and wait for the bell.
                         
                          FRANK
           Have some fun, baby.
                         
          At the sound of the bell, "Midnight" Le comes out hard and
          strong. He repeatedly KICKS Brendan in the leg and batters
          him with STRIKES. His power is overwhelming Brendan.

          but it's no use. It's an unholy beating going in the cage.

           CALLEN (V.O.)
           This can't last much longer. This
           won't last much longer. The teacher
           just has no answers.
                         
          Zito leans forward. He looks as if he's going to have a heart
          attack.
                         
                          ZITO

          Midnight Le takes Brendan to the ground. Brendan tries to
          escape, but turns his back, allowing Midnight to sink in a
          rear naked CHOKE. He puts the strangle hold on Brendan and
          squeezes his neck with his enormous biceps.
                         
                          FRANK

           question.

          Brendan, imploring him not to tap.

           10 seconds left, and Brendan's face

           world is about to go from day to
           night.
                         
          Brendan is on the verge of going unconscious, but he refuses
          to tap out. Then the HORN blows ending the round. The crowd
          can't believe Brendan hung in there, and neither can Midnight
          Le, who slams the canvas in frustration.
                         
          As Midnight walks back toward his angry TRAINER, who expected
          him to finish Brendan early, the teacher heads toward a
          smiling Frank.

          Brendan grins at Frank's positive spin on things, then looks
          across the cage at Midnight Le, who glares at Brendan.

          Midnight continues pounding on Brendan, but Brendan starts
          giving back, working a few leg kicks of his own. He seems to
          be gaining confidence. From cageside, Frank HOLLERS words of
          encouragement as the battle continues.
                         
          Back and forth they go. Midnight rocks Brendan with a right
          hand. Brendan recovers and fires back. Then Midnight shoots
          in for a take down, but Brendan dodges him, reverses
          position, and suddenly takes a shocked Midnight down to the
          ground. The crowd is on its collective feet.

          Brendan locks up Midnight's shoulder. Applies pressure. The
          bigger fighter struggles to get free, but he seems to be
          trapped. From cageside, Frank screams, instructing Brendan on
          how to finish the move.

          Tommy marches past Paddy again, then off through the crowd.

           Tommy Riordan marching through the
           crowd, and straight into the final
           four!
                         
          The arena is on its collective feet CHANTING "Tommy! Tommy!
          Tommy!" As Paddy looks on and Tommy disappears into the
          darkness of the tunnel, the sound of cheering fades.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAWN
                         
          Dawn breaks over Atlantic City.
                         
                         
          INT. CASINO FLOOR - SAME
                         
          A CLEANING WOMAN vacuums as an elevator door DINGS and opens.
          Out comes Paddy. The casino is nearly empty, the only sounds
          coming from the tinny RINGING of a handful of slot machines.
                         
          From a distance, Paddy spots Tommy sitting at the far end of
          a bank of Triple 7 American Glory slot machines, mechanically
          feeding the slot from a tray full of silver and pulling the
          lever with a thousand-yard stare. Paddy approaches Tommy, who
          doesn't acknowledge him.
                         
                          PADDY
           Can't sleep, huh?
                         
          Tommy feeds the machine and pulls. Says nothing. Paddy sits
          down in front of a slot machine next to Tommy.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           I know that other thing's bothering
           the hell out of you, but I'm proud
           of you. What you did for that kid
           in the tank? That was really
           something.
                         
                          TOMMY
           How about deserting my unit? Is
           that really something, too? Yeah. I
           was on my way outta country when I
           came across those guys. What was I
           supposed to do, let `em drown?
                         
                          PADDY
           No.
                          (BEAT)
           What'd you do?
                         
                          TOMMY
           What'd I do? I took off.
                         
          Paddy starts putting things together.
                         
                          PADDY
           That's why you go by Riordan.
           That's why the press can't find
           your service records.
                         
          Tommy doesn't respond.
           79.

           What the hell happened over there,
           Tommy?
                         
                          TOMMY
           That is none of your business.
                         
                          PADDY
           Come on, kiddo. I've been there.
           I've done it. I've seen it. You can
           trust me. I'll understand.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Spare me the compassionate father
           routine, Pop. The suit don't fit.
                         
                          PADDY
           I'm really trying here, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           You're trying? Now? Where were you
           when it mattered? I needed this guy
           back when I was a kid. I don't need
           you now. It's too late now.
           Everything's already happened. You
           and Brendan don't seem to
           understand that. Let me explain
           something to you: the only thing I
           have in common with Brendan Conlon
           is that we have absolutely no use
           for you.
                         
          Paddy's shaken. He can't fathom the anger in Tommy, yet he
          knows he's responsible. It's written all over him. Tears well
          up in his eyes. They seem to make Tommy madder.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Look at you. Yeah, I was right. I
           think I liked you better when you
           were a drunk. At least you had some
           balls then. Not like now. Tip
           toeing around like some beggar with
           your cup out. Take it somewhere
           else, old man.
                         
          Tommy reaches down and picks up a plastic CUP made for
          holding coins and dips it into his tray, filling it with
          QUARTERS.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           In fact, you know what? Here's a
           cup. Why don't you take this and go
           buy some more of your shitty tapes?

                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Go back to the room and listen to
           some more fish stories no one gives
           a shit about. Go on, get outta
           here.
                          (BEAT)
           Get the fuck outta here!
                         
          Tommy whips the bucket toward his father, splashing COINS
          into his face. A stunned Paddy, tears streaming down his
          face, walks off. A handful of late-night GAMBLERS look at
          Tommy, who stares angrily ahead and bounces a quarter off his
          slot machine as his destroyed father limps away.
                         
                         
          EXT. ATLANTIC CITY - DAY
                         
          Fourth of July weekend in full swing down the Shore.
                         
                         
          INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME
                         
          Paddy staggers about in pajama bottoms and a stained V-neck,
          clutching his Walkman and a bottle of WHISKEY. "Moby Dick"
          plays from ear phones that are half on his head and half off.
          LIQUOR BOTTLES are strewn everywhere. He has obviously fallen
          off the wagon. Hard.
                         
                          PADDY
           God pity `em! All shall perish
           except me! You bastards! Stop the
           ship, you bastards!
                         
          He staggers around the room, giving a fragmented soliloquy to
          no audience.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Ishmael! God pity `em! Stop the
           ship! Please stop the ship!
           Somebody help `em!
                         
          Suddenly the adjoining door swings open. Tommy, hair
          disheveled, looks in and sees Paddy's state. The old man
          thrusts his hand up in the air and screams at Tommy.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Ahab! You Godless sonofabitch!
                         
          Paddy staggers over and gets in Tommy's face, his own face
          blotched and contorted. The old Paddy Conlon revealed. The
          monster from the past.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           You stop the ship, you Godless
           sonofabitch!
           81.
                         
                         
          There's no anger in Tommy. He simply walks toward the old man
          and tries to pry the bottle out of his hand. As he struggles
          to take it, the Walkman falls to the ground. Faint dialogue
          is heard coming from the earphones.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Captain. Oh captain. Stop the ship.
           For the love of God. We're lost.
                         
          The old man is running out of steam. He begins WEEPING.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Please stop the ship.
                         
          Paddy wobbles, tears streaming down his face. Tommy looks at
          him. The first time we've seen anything resembling compassion
          on that relentless face of his. He HUGS his father and pries
          the whiskey bottle from his hand
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           We're lost. We're all lost, Tommy.
           We'll never make it back.
                         
          Tommy pulls his father back on to the bed. Puts his arms
          around his chest and tries to quiet the old man. It's a
          tender moment, and it seems as if Tommy is only able to
          relate to the brutal, former version of the father he knew.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
                          (MUMBLING)
           I always loved you. You know that,
           don't you Tommy? I always loved
           you. You and your brother. My two
           boys.
                         
          Tommy continues to hold his father as sunlight streams into
          the room. The end of a very long night.
                         
                         
          EXT. BOARDWALK HALL - NIGHT
                         
          A bigger, even more bombastic FIREWORKS display than before
          explodes over Atlantic City. If it's possible, the CROWDS on
          the beach and boardwalk have swelled. It seems as if the
          entire east coast has descended on AC.
                         
          Outside Boardwalk Hall, the giant electronic BILLBOARD has a
          new motif. Koba still swings mightily from the side of a
          ferris wheel, but now Tommy, in a camouflage superhero
          outfit, flies right toward him. On a collision course.
                         
          Mad Dog Grimes holds on to Tommy's cape, trying to slow him
          down, and below the three of them, in miniature, is Brendan
          holding a sling shot.

           84.
                         
                         
                          MAD DOG
           It's not gonna happen again.
                         
          Callen and Sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to
          their corners. The anticipation in the arena is incredible.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Mad Dog predicted an early
           knockout. Said he was gonna knock
           Tommy out with one punch.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Let's see what Tommy has to say
           about that.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal looks at Tommy and Mad Dog.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Gentlemen, you ready? You ready?
           Let's go to war!
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           And they are off!
                         
          Tommy goes after Mad Dog like it's the last night on earth.
          What Tommy did to him at Colt's Gym was an exercise in
          restraint compared to what's happening in that cage.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Tommy tackles him and he's on top!
           He's raining blows!
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Someone has to stop this.
                         
          Mad Dog is on his back and being pounded on. Tommy's rage is
          shocking, even by his own brutal standards. From cageside,
          Colt Boyd SCREAMS at Josh Rosenthal.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Stop it! Stop the fight!
                         
          It's such a savage beating, so malicious, that Rosenthal has
          to climb on Tommy's back to get him off of Mad Dog. If his
          mother is indeed in the crowd, she couldn't recognize him
          now. Beaten to an absolute pulp.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           That's the fastest knockout I think
           I've ever seen.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.
           He is not moving.
           85.
                         
                         
          Tommy marches out of the cage and past Colt Boyd, Punkass,
          and SkySkrape, who can't believe what they just witnessed.
          Neither can anyone else at Boardwalk Hall. In the cage, a
          MEDIC tends to Mad Dog.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           I'll tell you what: you do that to
           someone on the street and they'd
           lock you up and throw away the key!
           Break out the yellow tape, Sam.
           Tommy's walking away from the cage
           like he's leaving a crime scene.
                         
                         
          EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN, PHILADELPHIA - LATER
                         
          "ODE TO JOY" is heard coming from distant speakers as ROWS OF
          CARS line up at the entrance and pull into the lot.
                         
          Pull back to reveal an enormous, old drive-in movie theater
          packed with a RAUCOUS CROWD. On the gigantic MOVIE SCREEN,
          Brendan makes his way through the arena and into the cage. As
          he does, CHEERS erupt in the parking lot. Stephon, Nash, KC,
          Tito, and some of the other students from Brendan's class
          root him on. They came up with a pretty good Plan B.
                         
          As the kids get fired up for the fight, they're joined by a
          familiar face that emerges from the crowd. Joe Zito. Tito
          shakes his hand. Smacks Stephon. Look who's here.
                         
                         
          INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
                         
          Brendan climbs into the cage to a major OVATION from the
          crowd. They're completely on his side now.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Brendan Conlon came into this
           tournament as a 1000 to 1 underdog,
           and now here he is in the final
           four. The crowd's showing their
           appreciation. They're giving him
           quite the reception.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           He's getting a huge reception. I
           mean, this guy shocked everybody
           last night.
                         
          Brendan stands in the corner. Frank leans over the railing of
          the cage and smiles at him.
           86.
                         
                         
                          FRANK
           You've got a visitor. Second row,
           10 o'clock.
                         
          Buzzing in the arena. The lights about to go down for the
          entrance of Koba. Before they do, Brendan looks up to see a
          familiar face at cageside. Tess. He can't believe his eyes.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           You alright with that?
                         
          Brendan looks at his wife. She smiles broadly. Mouths the
          words "I love you." Brendan grins. Kisses his glove and
          presses it against the cage. As he does, the lights go out
          inside the arena and ominous RUSSIAN MUSIC BLARES.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           And here comes the great Russian
           Koba.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Koba is so intimidating. His
           reputation is larger than life.
                         
          The crowd strains to get a look at the legend as he makes his
          way toward the cage. Brendan watches. So does Frank. Tess
          takes a quick glance at Koba, then looks away. She can't bear
          it.
                         
                          FRANK
           I want you to look right at him
           when he comes in here. Don't take
           your eyes off him.
                         
          Brendan nods, then looks at Tess. Drawing strength. Frank
          leans over the railing and taps fists with his fighter.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I'm proud of you brother. This is
           your cage.
                         
          Finally, the creepy music subsides, and the great Russian
          climbs into the cage. He's massive, and the crowd stares at
          him like an exotic animal.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal calls Brendan and Koba to the center of the
          cage. The Russian looks at Brendan with the cold,
          dispassionate eyes of a killer. Brendan does his best to hold
          his gaze.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Alright, gentlemen, you've been
           given your instructions. I expect a
           clean fight.
                          (MORE)
           87.
                         
           JOSH ROSENTHAL (CONT'D)
           Obey my commands at all times.
           Defend yourselves at all times.
           Touch gloves, go back, let's do
           this.
                         
          Brendan retreats to his corner. Takes a deep breath.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Should I be nervous for Brendan?
           `Cause I am. I want to stop the
           fight before it even begins.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Gentlemen, you ready? You ready?
           Let's go to war!
                         
          Koba comes straight at Brendan. His speed and strength are
          astonishing.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Now the question is, how long can
           Brendan Conlon stay alive?
                         
          Franks screams at Brendan to keep his distance. Tess watches
          through her fingers. And Koba keeps coming, snapping
          Brendan's head back with a jab and bludgeoning him with an
          uppercut to the chin. The Russian is doing whatever he wants
          to Brendan. He slices him up with strikes. Bruises his legs
          with kicks. Works him against the fence. Power slams him.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Koba just pounding on Brendan
           Conlon! He's pounding on him like a
           side of beef!
                         
                         
          EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME
                         
          Thousands of people staring at the drive-in screen and you
          can hear a pin drop. They're aghast. Zito can hardly look. KC
          buries her head in Nash's chest.
                         
          ON MOVIE SCREEN: THE SLAUGHTER CONTINUES. HOW BRENDAN IS
          TAKING IT IS ANYONE'S GUESS.
                         
                         
          INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
                         
          Koba gets Brendan in a BEAR HUG, lifts him off the ground,
          carries him into the center of the ring like a sack of
          laundry, and body SLAMS him on his back.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Koba's got him in the air. Oh no!
           88.
                         
                         
          As Frank screams for Brendan to remain calm, a mortified Tess
          watches. Mercifully, the HORN sounds, and Brendan survives
          the round. He barely makes it back to his corner.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Frank Campana has to think
           seriously about stopping this.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Seriously, Sam. How much abuse can
           one man take?
                         
          The minutes passes in no time. It's time to go again.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Let's go to war!
                         
          Koba comes right after Brendan, and it's soon more of the
          same. Power slams. Brutal strikes. Brendan's face is carved
          up and battered. He tries to go for a take down, but Koba
          snuffs it, then lifts Brendan off the mat again and carries
          him through the air. Frank screams, but there's nothing he
          can do. Brendan is brutally SLAMMED into the ground.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Uh oh, Brendan's going for ride!
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           That one shook the entire building!
                         
          As Brendan writhes on the ground, Koba grabs him and slings
          him against the fence like it's nothing. Brendan flies
          through the air and RATTLES against the cage. Then Koba
          climbs on top of him and starts whaling away. Tess can't even
          watch it. Once again, just as Rosenthal is about to stop the
          fight, the HORN sounds.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Everyone has gotta be concerned
           about Brendan Conlon's bravery
           getting him into trouble here.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           His bravery can get him killed,
           Sam. He's got nothing more to
           prove. He's already lasted two
           rounds against Koba, which is more
           than anyone else can say. You
           wonder what's keeping this guy up.
                         
          Brendan drags himself off the ground and limps to his stool.
          Frank enters the cage. His usual positive attitude is gone.
          He comes at Brendan with aggression instead.
           89.
                         
                         
                          FRANK
           Sit down. Breathe.
           (grabbing Brendan's face)
           Look at me! Look at me! Why are we
           here, Brendan? Why are we here? Are
           we here to win this fight? You tell
           me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw
           in the towel right now. We'll get
           Tess and we will go home. You don't
           knock him out, you lose the fight.
           Understand me? You don't knock him
           out, you don't have a home.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank takes his cue to leave,
          but not before giving Brendan one last look. It's now or
          never. Brendan looks across the cage at Koba. Steels himself.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Let's go to war!
                         
          Brendan comes out and meets Koba in the center of the cage,
          but the Russian resumes his supremacy.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Conlon somehow answering the bell
           for round three, but Koba's all
           over him again.
                         
          Koba roughs the battered Brendan up some more, but then
          Brendan starts responding. Throws a couple effective leg
          kicks. A decent punch or two.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Brendan's giving back, Bryan. There
           are signs of life in Brendan
           Conlon. He's starting to mix it up!
                         
                         
          EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The parking lot is quiet and tense. Zito and the kids stare
          at the movie screen.
                         
          ON MOVIE SCREEN: KOBA PRESSES BRENDAN UP AGAINST THE CAGE AND
          TRIES TO CHOKE HIM OUT.
                         
                         
          INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME
                         
          The Russian SQUEEZES away.
           90.
                         
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Koba's got him caught in an iron
           vice, squeezing for all it's worth
           and trying to choke the teacher
           out.
                         
          Frank screams at Brendan to stay calm. To wait for his
          moment. Koba continues to squeeze. Brendan's face turns more
          and more red. Finally, he grabs Koba's shorts, musters up all
          the strength he has left, and TOSSES the Russian on his back,
          freeing himself from the choke in the process.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           He just launched Koba! Can you
           believe this? Conlon just shook off
           a guillotine!
                         
          Brendan jumps on Koba and attempts his own choke.

           Conlon's staying after him! He's
           squeezing him! The tables have
           turned, and the boy scout is
           squeezing the bear!
                         
          Koba shakes off Brendan's submission attempt and stands.
          Brendan stands with him and they exchange a vicious round of
          blows. Brendan's giving as good as he's getting.

           ourselves a fight!
                         
          Brendan snaps Koba's head back with a left, but the Russian
          responds with a combination. Brendan stumbles backwards, and
          Koba grabs him and tries to take him down. Brendan throws a
          left ELBOW that connects with Koba's temple. The Russian is
          momentarily STUNNED, long enough for Brendan to take him to
          the ground and wrap his arms around Koba's KNEE.

          The Russian tries to squirm away, but he can't. His face is
          contorted in PAIN. The cageside OFFICIAL indicates there's
          only 10 seconds left in the fight.

           A surprising turn in the story of
           Iraq War hero Tommy Riordan. CNN
           has learned that Riordan's true
           identity is that of Marine Staff
           Sergeant Thomas Conlon, who went
           AWOL from his unit earlier this
           year following the friendly fire
           death of his brother-in-arms,
           Sergeant Manny Fernandez.
           Fernandez' wife, Pilar Fernandez,
           spoke with me in an exclusive
           interview moments ago.

          screams at Brendan to stay calm, but Tommy is all over him,
          POUNDING on him with savage intensity. As bad as the other
          fights were for Brendan, this one is worse.

           C'mon, Josh!
                         
          Brendan lays on the ground as Josh Rosenthal pulls Tommy off
          him and admonishes him for the cheap shot. Tommy stares at
          Brendan. You want more?
                         
          Frank runs into the cage with the stool and Brendan limps
          over to him and sits down. Brendan stares at Tommy, who paces
          in his corner like a caged animal.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Sit down. Look at me. Look at me,
           Brendan! Let it go! Breathe.

           Beethoven. He's coming hard, just
           like we planned. I want you to
           angle out, hit, and move.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Angle out, hit, and move.
                         
                          FRANK
           Good. Breathe. Relax. He's not your
           brother, right? He's just a guy
           who's in the way.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. It's time. Frank glares at
          him as he picks up the stool.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I'm taking a little more time for
           the cheap shot! Do your job, Josh!
                         
          Tess sits uncomfortably in her chair. Her husband's face is a
          mess. In front of her, Callen and Sheridan commiserate. J.J.,
          the TapouT crew, and Colt Boyd look on. The electricity in
          the crowd is greater than ever. They want a champion.

          The Marines in the crowd are all on their feet, screaming for
          Tommy to end it. The chant starts up again. 15,000 strong.
          "Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!" Frank tries to instruct Brendan, but
          he can't hear him, and he's too overwhelmed.
                         
          Tommy presses Brendan against the cage and does the same
          thing Koba did. He lifts him off the ground, carries him on a
          dead run, and body SLAMS him so hard the cage shakes. Then
          Tommy mounts him and starts pounding away again.
                         
          The HORN sounds ending the round, but this time it's Brendan
          who pops up and pushes Tommy. Tommy shoves him back.
          Rosenthal has to separate them as the crowd roars its
          approval.

          INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME
                         
          Again, Tommy is on top of Brendan, trying to ground and pound
          him into submission. Frank, leaning on the apron nearby,
          screams at Brendan.
                         
                          FRANK
           Switch! Switch!
                         
          Tommy tries to pound Brendan out, but Brendan latches on to
          Tommy's arm, wraps his legs around him, and REVERSES
          position, just as he did with Midnight, the Dane, and Koba.
          Tommy is in deep trouble. Brendan pushes him face down on the
          canvas and cranks his shoulder. There's no escape.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Oh my God, that's a deep omoplata!
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           He's doing it again! Conlon's doing
           it again! This is going to be over!
                         
          Brendan applies intense pressure. Tommy's shoulder is
          contorted, WRENCHED backwards, and his face is a mask of
          pain. Tommy's in agony, but he won't give in.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Tap, Tommy!
                         
          Tommy SHRIEKS like an animal, but still won't quit. In fact,
          he elbows Brendan in the face in defiance. Brendan in turn
          cranks the shoulder even more. It's at the breaking point.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Tap!
                         
          The shoulder twists. Twists. And then, audible only to Tommy
          and Brendan, CRACK. Dislocated. Then the HORN ending the
          round.
           99.
                         
                         
          Brendan, worried he hurt his brother, leans over to see if
          Tommy's alright, but Tommy, like a wounded animal, leaps up
          and grabs Brendan around the throat with his one good arm. He
          shoves him all the way across the cage and into the fence,
          and it takes Rosenthal and Frank to separate them.

          The crowd fired up by Brendan's comeback, and mesmerized by
          what's taking place in the cage between the brothers. It's
          complete and utter chaos in there.

          INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME
                         
          Tommy, flap down, tears of pain pouring down his face, stands
          defiantly in his corner. In the other corner, Frank attends
          Brendan. In the crowd, Tess covers her mouth. She can't
          believe what Tommy allowed to happen to him.
                         
          Frank puts the stool down and gives Brendan some water.
          Brendan's face is wracked with guilt and concern over his
          brother.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I popped his shoulder.
                         
                          FRANK
           Relax, breathe.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I heard it tear.
                         
                          FRANK
           You popped his shoulder? Good. I
           want you to pop his other shoulder.
                         
          This is not what Brendan wants to hear. He looks over to Josh
          Rosenthal.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Josh!

          Frank snaps. Grabs Brendan by the face.
                         
                          FRANK
           Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You
           got two rounds left! You need both
           rounds! Go in there, kick him in
           the head, take him down, and finish
           him!
                         
          Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank exits the cage. The wounded
          Tommy stands in his corner, his ruined left arm hanging low.
          Brendan makes eye contact with him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Tommy! What are you doing?

           Let's go to war!
                         
          The BELL sounds. Round Four begins. Tommy throws useless
          right jabs. He's one handed and has no chance. Brendan stays
          away from him, not wanting to hurt his brother.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           What are you doing? It's over!
                         
          Frank screams at Brendan from cageside to take the wounded
          Tommy out, but Brendan is reluctant.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           It's over, Tommy. C'mon. We don't
           have to do this.
                         
          Tommy and Brendan circle each other. Tommy throwing rights
          and wincing in agony at any movement. Brendan stares at him.
          Everything about him says "Quit, Tommy." But Tommy won't.

          Brendan continues to circle and not engage. Frank is livid.
          He knows he'll lose the fight on the judges' scorecards if he
          doesn't do something.
                         
                          FRANK
           Finish him! You finish him!
                         
          Tommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at Brendan. Finally,
          with no choice, Brendan fires back. He batters the
          defenseless Tommy up against the cage and POUNDS away at him,
          blasting his left shoulder with punches that make Tommy wince
          in pain. It's anyone's guess how he can take it.
                         
          Brendan presses his brother up against the cage. Begging him
          to quit. But Tommy merely responds by elbowing Brendan in the
          face again. This sets the older brother off, and he resumes
          pounding on Tommy until the HORN sounds and Rosenthal pulls
          Brendan away.

          Brendan heads back to his stool as Tommy leans against the
          cage in agony. The Marines scream for him, but his eyes are
          glazed over. It's unthinkable that he hasn't broken yet.
                         
          From near cageside, Paddy looks to the corner and makes eye
          contact with Brendan. They exchange a small look of
          understanding. A NOD. They both know what needs to be done.

          In the crowd, the "Tommy" CHANT begins in earnest. In fact,
          it may be louder than ever. Having done the impossible and
          carried on with one arm, Tommy is more superhuman and heroic
          than ever before. But his face tells another story. Soaked in
          pain and anguish. All his stoic walls crumbling down.

          Brendan SLAMS Tommy to the ground. His face is contorted in
          merciless pain. Brendan slips his forearm under Tommy's neck
          and squeezes. Tommy struggles, but he's got one arm and
          there's NO ESCAPE. His face getting red from lack of oxygen.
                         
          As an anguished Tess and a shaken Paddy look on, Brendan
          CHOKES his brother. As he does, he pleads with him.
                         
                          BRENDAN

           Tap, Tommy! Tap!
                         
          Tears pour down Tommy's face. Brendan is crushing his wind
          pipe. Tommy's eyes bulge.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)

          Tommy, about to pass out, no more air to breathe, slowly
          opens his left hand, looks at Brendan, and TAPS his shoulder
          on the Conlon family crest. Finally submitting.

          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING

          CLOSE ON: A "Have A Nice Day" HAPPY FACE PIN. STEAM rises
          past the pin. We hear a KETTLE BOILING.
          We PULL BACK and find that the pin adorns the lapel of a ROBE
          worn by EDWARD BLAKE, 63, but amazingly not far from his
          physical prime--body chiseled, built like a truck. Handsome
          too, save the LONG SCAR running down the side of his face.
          Blake removes the kettle from the stove. He scoops some Asian
          tea leaves from a can, dumps them in a cup .

          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

          The apartment is expensive but not quite luxurious. Terrific
          New York view from the window. Blake lives well, if alone. He
          sits on the couch with his cup of, tea, puts his feet up. Hits
          the remote, turns the big screen TV on. The news:

          ANCHORWOMAN
          --addressing the United Nations today,
          the President expressed his concern over
          the increasingly intense territorial
          disputes in both Asia and the Middle
          East.
          CUT TO: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES--

          PRESIDENT
          The sound of a bullet at one end of the
          world echoes across the ocean to the
          other end. Armed conflict is not self
          contained in its respective region--the
          consequences reverberate through every
          nation across the world and therefore
          must be avoided at all costs.
          CUT BACK TO: The Anchorwoman--

          ANCHORWOMAN
          While the President's position was clear,
          he did not comment on whether or not he
          would order Dr. Manhattan into action
          should the situation continue to
          escalate.
          CUT TO: Stock footage of DR. MANHATTAN--a man, at least he
          appears to be, who has glowing blue skin. The stock footage
          shows Dr. Manhattan flying through the air as a MISSILE heads
          straight for him.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          2.

          CONTINUED:
          With a wave of his hand, Dr. Manhattan stops the missile in
          its flight--frozen in mid-air--inches from his face.
          With another wave, Dr. Manhattan DETONATES the missile. Dr.
          Manhattan disappears in the EXPLOSION . but once the
          smoke clears, we see he's still there. Unscathed--
          --Blake snorts at the stock footage, changes the channel--
          CRASH!--The FRONT DOOR EXPLODES, splintered by a KICK; Blake
          jumps up, immediately at the ready--
          --when we see the INTRUDER'S FEET entering. Slowly. Blake
          sees the Intruder's face, though we never do--we only see
          that he's dressed in ALL BLACK, including GLOVES and a KNIT
          HAT. A look of recognition comes over Blake.

          BLAKE
          Just a matter of time, I suppose.
          With sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from
          under his cup, sending it FLYING like a saw-blade. The
          Intruder BATS IT out of the air with even quicker reflexes,
          but the act buys Blake time to pull a PISTOL with a SILENCER
          from a hollowed out STEREO SPEAKER. He's a pro
          . but so is our Intruder. Before Blake can get a shot
          off, the Intruder is already upon him, SNATCHING the gun out
          of Blake's hand--
          --Blake PUNCHES the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder
          drops the gun. Blake fights. Not like an old man, but like
          the trained killer he is. But the Intruder is much, much
          faster. Younger. Deadlier. He SMASHES Blake with an elbow to
          the head.
          Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder picks Blake
          up off the ground. Brings him to the window with the great
          New York view. Thirty stories up. Blake looks the Intruder in
          the eye
          . and starts laughing. Hysterical.

          BLAKE (CONT'D)
          I always thought I knew the punchline.
          But I guess the joke's on me now.
          He laughs. The INTRUDER seems to regard Blake a moment--
          --then, with incredible strength, he LIFTS BLAKE OVER HIS
          HEAD AND THROWS BLAKE THROUGH THE WINDOW. Blake never makes a
          sound as he plummets to the sidewalk.

          

          

          

          

          3.

          EXT. STREET - EVENING

          CLOSE ON: Blake's dead body. His eyes are wide open, not in
          fear, but in resignation. As BLOOD starts to POOL behind his
          head, we move to the happy face pin Blake wore, now on the
          sidewalk by his neck. We slowly ZOOM IN on the pin as blood
          DRIPS on it
          . when the pin is WASHED AWAY.

          EXT. STREET - LATER (TIME CUT)

          A SHOPKEEPER has his HOSE out, spraying off the blood from
          the sidewalk. Blake's body is gone, a CHALK OUTLINE in its
          place. A COP comes running up to the Shopkeeper.

          COP 1
          Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene!

          SHOPKEEPER
          It's been over four hours, I got a
          business to run--
          As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as
          the water carries it to a DRAIN--
          --when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV
          as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it.
          We never see his face. We move from his POV--
          --to across the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at
          the news stand stare at. the crime scene. At the cop still
          arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow
          tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake's BODY BAG.
          Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse
          the magazines and periodicals, most of which have
          inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere
          currently in the world--a Newsweek headline reads "War?", The
          New York Times: "China Moves Battleships near Taiwanese
          Waters," The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President
          with Dr. Manhattan: "What Me Worry?"
          The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning at the papers.

          NEWS VENDOR
          I dunno, pal, like I said, it's late--
          We MOVE BACK ACROSS THE STREET, to Blake's apartment
          building, then MOVE UP the building, to the broken glass
          window Blake was thrown out of. We MOVE INTO THE WINDOW--

          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          --inside the apartment, where DET. GALLAGHER (older, jaded)
          and DET. FINE (street worn, but not quite cynical yet) walk
          through the crime scene. Fine studies the broken window.

          DET. FINE
          Edward Blake--63 years old, six-two, 225.
          A solid 225, guy was built like a
          linebacker. This is plate glass too,
          you'd have to step on the gas just to put
          a crack in this. Had to be a two man job.
          At least. You check the bedroom?

          DET. GALLAGHER
          Drawers were open, tossed through.
          Mattress flipped.

          DET. FINE
          Robbery?

          DET. GALLAGHER
          Or made to look like one.
          (tosses Fine an ID)
          Found that in the bedroom.
          Det. Fine studies it. It's Blake's UNITED NATIONS ID. It
          reads "Special Advisor, United States."

          DET. GALLAGHER (CONT'D)
          You see this?
          He picks up a PHOTO from the floor, hands it to Fine.

          DET. GALLAGHER (CONT'D)
          Shaking hands with the President.

          DET. FINE
          You're saying this guy was a spook? You
          think this might be a political murder?

          DET. GALLAGHER
          I think that this is way bigger
          than the both of us.
          He leaves Det. Fine to ponder this.

          EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          Outside Blake's apartment building. It's later now, the news
          stand is closed, businesses closed, people gone.
          We move into someone's POV. The person stares up at the
          broken window of Blake's apartment, now covered with PLASTIC

          SHEETING.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
          Rorschach's Journal, October 12th.
          Earlier today I came across what appeared
          to be a suicide. It was later learned to
          be a homicide. Someone's time was up.
          Still in POV, we see the person pull something from his
          pocket--the happy face pin. We realize that this was the
          person whose POV we were in earlier.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I discovered a clue. Something I
          recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly
          . I heard my own clock ticking.
          We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time--
          RORSCHACH (roar-shock)--a masked vigilante who wears a trench
          coat, fedora, and a silver-white MASK with oily BLACK SPOTS
          moving about, creating shifting, doubled PATTERNS like a
          Rorschach test. Scary looking.
          Rorschach draws a hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and
          FIRES the HOOK AND CABLE THIRTY STORIES UP where it latches
          itself through Blake's broken window. Pressing RETRACT,
          Rorschach FLIES UP THE WALL to the 30th floor.

          

          

          

          

          6.

          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

          With a grunt, Rorschach pulls himself past the plastic
          sheeting, through the window, and into Blake's apartment. He
          investigates, silent. He sees the same things that the cops
          saw . . but he notices the speakers by the TV. Notices one
          of the speaker covers is ever so slightly askew.
          Rorschach pulls the speaker cover off and discovers that the
          speaker was hollow. (The Intruder clearly took Blake's gun
          and put the cover back on when he left. Why?)

          INT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT

          Blake's clothing hangs in military rows. Rorschach runs his
          fingers along the wall-seams. He pauses, presses on the
          hanger BAR, which SLIDES BACK to reveal a RED BUTTON.
          Pressing it, the BACK WALL of the closet SLIDES OPEN,
          revealing a SECRET COMPARTMENT. On the wall is an old FRAMED
          PHOTO of EIGHT PEOPLE IN COSTUMES, from the 60s. Included in
          this photo is a young Edward Blake--Blake wasn't a spook--he
          was a superhero.
          WEAPONS of all kinds adorn the walls in here. TEAR-GAS,
          GRENADES, RIFLES, PISTOLS--if it can kill you Blake's got it.
          But that's not what draws Rorschach's attention.
          Hanging on the back wall, dead center, is a more current
          COSTUME. Black leather armor, gloves, boots. Hanging over it
          all like a vacant, grinning face--a black leather MASK.
          Rorschach stares. Framed nearby is the FRONT PAGE OF THE
          BOSTON GLOBE. The headline reads "The Comedian Gets Last
          Laugh On Moloch." Underneath is a photo of Blake dressed in
          the costume Rorschach was staring at--Blake was a superhero
          called the Comedian. In the photo, Blake holds a supervillian
          named MOLOCH prisoner. (We'll meet Moloch later.)
          On the same page is a smaller photo of a group of
          superheroes. Rorschach is in the photo, as is Dr. Manhattan,
          as is the Comedian. (As are DAN DREIBERG, ADRIAN VEIDT, and
          LAURIE JUPITER, all of whom we'll be meeting soon). The
          caption below reads: "The New Watchmen."
          Suddenly, Rorschach hears the front door open. He quickly
          closes the secret hatch.

          than be posted at a crime scene all
          night. Watch the door.
          Cop 1 pulls his gun, going through the motions rather than
          being concerned. He then enters the bedroom.
          Cop 2 stands guard, nervous From the bedroom:

          COP 1 (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Clear! I'm checking the other rooms.
          Cop 2 relaxes a bit, turns--
          --and comes face to "face" with Rorschach, standing inches
          away. The Cop's face goes slack with childish terror. He goes
          to yell but Rorschach raises two fingers, "Shhh"--
          The fingers JAB INTO THE COP'S WINDPIPE. The cop HISSES and
          falls silently as Rorschach brushes past him like a whisper.

          HOLLIS (O.S.)
          See, the Comedian thought he had it all
          worked out.

          INT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          CLOSE ON: A FRAMED PHOTO of the first Watchmen--identical to
          the old one in Blake's closet. Holding the photo is HOLLIS
          MASON. He puts the photo down, but we don't see his face yet.

          HOLLIS (O.S.)
          He was young and arrogant, but what he
          lacked in experience, he made up for in
          . tenacity.
          As he speaks, we PAN ACROSS various FRAMED MEMORABILIA: The

          costume. The plaque below reads: IN GRATITUDE, 1969. Another
          clipping: "Hero Retires, Reveals Identity In Tell All Book."
          Finally, we come to HOLLIS MASON (aka Nite Owl), 70s, though
          his eyes sparkle with strength and his face still shows the
          edges of a born hero. The TV is on in the background.

          HOLLIS (CONT'D)
          Superheroes, Supervillians--you know who
          I ran into the other day at the market?
          The Screaming Skull. We chatted for a
          while. Turns out he's a born again.

          DAN (V.0.)
          No way.
          We see who Hollis is speaking to--DAN DREIBERG (the second
          Nite Owl), late 30's, handsome, though he's let himself go
          the past few years--his edges have gone soft. He was in the
          photo of the new Watchmen in Blake's apartment.

          HOLLIS
          All the nuts that started popping up,
          I'll tell ya. Who was that midget you and
          your partner chased down years ago?
          What'd he call himself?

          DAN
          The Big Figure.

          HOLLIS
          Big Figure. A midget bad guy. Guess it
          doesn't get lower than that, does it?
          Hollis laughs at his own joke; Dan chuckles, polite.

          CONTINUED: (2)

          DAN
          (glances at his watch)
          Wow, it's really late.
          Dan stands, finishes his beer. Hollis sees him to the door.

          HOLLIS
          Well, even though I spent my time
          catching real bad guys, you were still a
          better Nite Owl than I ever was.

          DAN
          That's bullshit, Hollis, and you know it.
          They hug.

          HOLLIS
          With all this talk of war, all that's
          going on in the world, it's a shame the
          government forced all you guys out.
          Before Dan can answer he notices a breaking news report on
          the TV:

          ANCHORWOMAN
          This just in--masked vigilante Rorschach
          has assaulted a New York City police
          officer who was guarding a crime scene in
          the early morning hours. Rorschach is on
          the FBIs ten most wanted list for
          violation of the Keene Act, which banned
          masked heroes ten years ago.
          Dan and Hollis watch as an image of Rorschach flashes on
          screen.

          HOLLIS
          Well, forced all of you guys out except
          one.

          (BEAT)
          Next week?
          Dan nods, then leaves.

          EXT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          Dan descends the stairs. He pulls up his collar against the
          cold and walks down an alley. A SIGN below Hollis' apartment
          reads: "MASON AUTO REPAIRS--Obsolete models a specialty!"

          

          

          

          

          10.

          INT. SUBWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          Dan rides the subway, lost in thought, when a group of GANG
          MEMBERS, wearing yellow and black BANDANAS brush past him.
          ONE stops. Dan's leg is out, a couple inches too far.

          GANG LEADER
          Move your leg.

          DAN
          What?

          GANG LEADER
          I said move, dick.
          Dan finally realizes what he's talking about. Dan meets his
          eyes, for just a moment and draws back his leg. The
          Gang Members snicker at Dan as they pass.

          EXT. DAN DREIBERG'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          Dan walks down the empty street to his TOWNHOUSE, digging for
          his keys. Then he stops, suddenly alert.
          His front door hangs slightly OPEN--the LOCK'S been SMASHED.
          There's a LIGHT on inside. Cautious, Dan enters the house.

          INT. DAN DREIBERG'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Dan quietly approaches the light coming from his kitchen. He
          hears odd, metal scraping SOUNDS.

          INT. DAN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Dan enters the kitchen, stunned to find--

          DAN
          Rorschach.
          Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold CAN

          OF BEANS.

          RORSCHACH
          Hello Daniel. I helped myself to some
          beans. You don't mind?

          DAN
          No, of course not. You uh, want me to
          heat some up for you?

          RORSCHACH
          No need.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          11.

          CONTINUED:
          Rorschach finishes the can of beans, stands, pulls his mask
          back down. There's a strong familiarity between the two but
          at the same time, Dan is wary.

          DAN
          You were on the news. They say you
          attacked a cop.

          RORSCHACH
          Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization.

          DAN
          Other than that . How have you been
          keeping?

          RORSCHACH
          Out of prison. So far. Look at this.
          He tosses Blake's happy face pin onto the table. Dan picks it
          up, runs his fingers over the RED-BROWN SPLOTCH.

          DAN
          This little stain, is that bean juice or--

          RORSCHACH
          Human bean juice. It belonged to the
          Comedian. He's dead.

          DAN
          The Comedian?
          Nervous now, Dan glances out the window.
          DAN (cont'd)
          Let's talk downstairs.

          INT. DAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          Rorschach follows Dan to a CLOSET, at the end of the hall.
          Dan opens the closet, revealing an old BOOKSHELF. With some
          difficulty, Dan PULLS OPEN the HINGED BOOKSHELF with a RUSTY
          CREAK. STEEL STAIRS lead down into the dark.

          INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - NIGHT

          The two men descend into Dan's WORKSHOP--the dusty remnants
          of a hero's LAB; Old computers and an OWL-COSTUME, hanging in
          a locker. No-one has been down here for years. In the center
          of the space, an OVAL VEHICLE the size of a subway car is
          covered by a dusty TARP--the Owl-Ship.

          DAN
          How did it happen?

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          12

          CONTINUED:

          RORSCHACH
          Murder. Someone threw him out a window.

          DAN
          Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might
          not have known who Blake was.

          RORSCHACH
          An ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian?
          Ridiculous.

          DAN
          You're right. I heard he was working for
          the government. Maybe it was a political
          killing.

          RORSCHACH
          Maybe. Or maybe someone's decided to kill
          off costumed heroes.

          DAN
          You don't think that's . a little
          paranoid?

          RORSCHACH
          Is that what they're saying about me now?
          That I'm paranoid?

          DAN
          I-'m just saying the Comedian made a lot
          of enemies over the years, even amongst
          his friends, if he had any. The man
          wasn't exactly endearing. Just because
          something happened to him doesn't mean it
          involves us.

          RORSCHACH
          One of our own has been murdered. I
          thought you might be interested. An
          attack on one is an attack on all of us,
          right?
          Dan hesitates.

          DAN
          I'm out, Rorschach. I've been out, we've
          all been out. Except you. You know that.

          RORSCHACH
          Yes. I know that. Anyways, I thought I'd
          let you know. Just in case.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          13.

          CONTINUED: (2)

          DAN
          Yeah, thanks. You can take the tunnel out
          to the warehouse on Fleet street--
          Rorschach turns to walk off down a long, dark TUNNEL.

          RORSCHACH
          I remember. Used to come here a lot.
          Back when we were partners.

          DAN
          Yeah. Those were good times, Rorschach.
          Great times.
          (more to himself)
          What ever happened to them?

          RORSCHACH
          You quit.
          Rorschach disappears into the SUBWAY TUNNEL, leaving Dan to
          reminisce alone. Dan glances at his old costume hanging.

          INT. SLEAZY MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

          The kind of room you rent by the hour. Or the minute even. A
          cheap looking HOOKER enters with an ARMY OFFICER, giggling.
          She playfully pushes the Officer onto the bed.

          HOOKER
          So tell me what you wanna do. Sir.

          ARMY OFFICER
          Seeing that I don't have to be back to
          base till Friday--everything.
          He puts a stack of BILLS on the dresser. Then takes his
          UNIFORM off like he can't wait. The Hooker gets on top of him-
          --when the DOOR FLIES OFF THE HINGES. Rorschach steps in,
          yanks the Hooker off--
          --the officer gets to his feet, throws a punch, which
          Rorschach dodges. Rorschach GRABS the guy's arm, then KICKS
          the Officer on the side of his KNEE, tearing the joint to
          shreds. The Officer cries out in pain, falls to the floor--
          Rorschach nails him in the head with a BLACK JACK, knocking
          him out.
          The Hooker screams. Rorschach grabs her by the hair and SLAMS
          her face into the wall.

          RORSCHACH
          Quiet, whore.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          14.

          CONTINUED:
          Nose broken and bleeding, the Hooker quiets to a whimper.
          Rorschach takes the officer's uniform and ID. Then leaves.

          EXT. VEIDT ENTERPRISES - MORNING

          A mammoth, shining skyscraper. At the 50th-floor there is a
          HUGE V-SHAPED HOLE where WATER FALLS.

          INT. VEIDT ENTERPRISES - LOBBY - MORNING

          A mammoth lobby. The decor is Egyptian and marble. Dan
          approaches a beautiful ASSISTANT behind an imposing desk.

          DAN
          I'm here to see Adrian Veidt.

          ASSISTANT
          Do you have an appointment?

          DAN
          No, uh, just tell him Dan Dreiberg is
          here to see him.

          ASSISTANT
          I'm sorry, Mr. Veidt doesn't see anyone
          without an appointment.

          DAN
          I understand, but if you would just tell
          Adrian that Dan Dreiberg is here, I'm an
          old friend.

          ASSISTANT
          Well, Mr. Veidt is very busy at the

          MOMENT--

          DAN
          Just tell him I'm here. I assure you
          he'll see me.
          Dan glares at her. She glares right back. A game of chicken.
          She reluctantly gets up, goes inside the office.
          Once she's gone, Dan's glare disappears, replaced by
          nervousness. Because he's not sure if Adrian will see him--
          it's been a long time. He glances at the SECURITY GUARDS
          eyeing him. Finally, the Assistant returns.

          ASSISTANT
          Go on in, Mr. Dreiberg.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          INT. ADRIAN VEIDT'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Dan enters the enormous office--there are three TV feeds
          PROJECTED onto the walls, architectural models of real estate
          developments, poster size ad campaigns for "Nostalgia"
          perfume--all reflecting the financial empire of Veidt
          Enterprises owned by--
          --ADRIAN VEIDT, late 30s, movie star looks, is at the far end
          of the office, SPRINTING on a treadmill as journalist DOUG
          ROTH holds a tape recorder to him. Adrian sees Dan
          approaching, smiles wide. He holds up a finger, telling Dan
          to hold on a sec. Dan nods, takes a seat on the couch. Picks
          up a Fortune magazine with Adrian on the cover.

          DOUG ROTH
          Mr. Veidt, would you acknowledge that you
          are considered the world's smartest man?

          ADRIAN

          (LAUGHS)
          I think it's better to be the world's
          most modest man. You should ignore my PR
          people, they tend to be a little too
          enthusiastic.
          Though Adrian seems to be sprinting at top speed, he hardly
          seems out of breath as he answers questions.

          DOUG ROTH
          If we could move off the subject of
          business for a moment, I'm curious
          whether the world's smartest man thinks
          we're headed for our next World War.
          Adrian stops the treadmill, towels off as he heads to Dan.

          ADRIAN
          Predicting stock prices isn't the same as
          predicting world events. I hope there
          isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that
          matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has
          some exciting plans, plans that will,
          pardon the cliche, truly make this world
          a better place. My team of engineers and
          scientists have been working with Dr.
          Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new,
          cheap form of energy which will eliminate
          the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with
          no toxic emissions. This energy could
          power cars, aircrafts, stadiums--there
          are no limitations--

          --but I talk too much. Will you mind
          pausing the interview a moment, Doug? A
          good friend of mine is here.
          Doug Roth leaves. Adrian hugs Dan, despite the sweat.

          DAN
          You look good, Adrian.

          ADRIAN
          Dan--it's been far too long.

          INT. ADRIAN VEIDT'S OFFICE - LATER

          Dan and Adrian sit, talking over coffee. Dan examines an
          ACTION-FIGURE of Adrian as OZYMANDIAS (his superhero alias).

          ADRIAN
          Rorschach. He paid me a visit too.

          DAN
          He did? Must've been tough to get past
          your security, even for him. I thought
          your assistant was going to take me out.

          ADRIAN

          (LAUGHS)
          Sara can be tough. Is that why you came
          to see me? You're worried about this mask
          killer theory Rorschach's conjured up?

          DAN
          You're the world's smartest man, Adrian.
          You tell me.

          ADRIAN
          Rorschach's a sociopath suffering through
          nostalgia. I revealed my identity to the
          public as soon as the Keene Act was
          passed. If an old enemy wanted me dead it
          would have been done already.
          Adrian notices the news on one of his TV projectors.
          Something about Pakistan putting troops along the Indian
          border. Adrian turns up the volume, looking grim.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          No, there are other things in the world
          I'm far more concerned about.
          ON THE WALL: The TV projector shows an image of TWO PAKISTANI
          SOLDIERS on patrol.

          EXT. PAKISTAN/INDIA BORDER (KASHMIR) - SAME TIME

          We're now actually with the two Soldiers on patrol. One of
          the Soldiers takes out a pair of binoculars, looking into the
          mountains. (They speak in Baluchi)

          PAKISTANI SOLDIER
          We should attack the Indian bastards. I
          don't understand--
          CUT TO: POV--a SNIPER SCOPE, locked in on the Pakistani
          soldier.

          INDIAN SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
          --why I can't just pull this trigger.
          We see two Indian Soldiers, hidden in the mountains, one with
          his sniper rifle aimed. (They speak in Hindi)

          INDIAN SOLDIER #2
          Because then a battle begins. Then a war.

          And we don't want that. At the same time,
          we can't assume to know what's on the
          minds of our enemies.
          We're in Chinese waters, off the coast of Taiwan. The CHINESE
          CAPTAIN and his First Mate look out at the water. TAIWANESE
          GUNBOATS can be seen in the distance.

          INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - ISRAEL - SAME TIME

          We're in the control room as an ISRAELI OFFICER and his much
          younger AIDE watch SATELLITE IMAGES on the giant screen.
          Images of potential targets. (They speak in Hebrew)

          AIDE
          Is Dr. Manhattan even real?

          ISRAELI OFFICER
          Why don't you ask the Vietnamese. Or the
          Iraqis? Dr. Manhattan is real. Thank god
          for that.

          We move into Rorschach's POV as he approaches the gate. The
          guard has no reaction to Rorschach--
          --because Rorschach is in disguise, wearing the Army
          Officer's uniform he stole. Rorschach presents his ID. The
          Guard waves him through.

          INT. HALLWAY - DR. MANHATTAN'S COMPOUND - EVENING

          Rorschach ditches the uniform in the trash and puts his mask
          on. He quietly enters--

          INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

          --a huge room, which contains technologically advanced
          MILITARY DEVICES. Distorted in sections of GLASS, we see the
          REFLECTION of a HUGE MAN, GLOWING BRIGHT BLUE--

          DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)
          Good evening, Rorschach.
          --and we see DR. MANHATTAN (formerly Jon Osterman) for the
          very first time. He is SIXTY FEET TALL, BLUE LIGHT ripples
          from his skin, emanating pure power--he is God on earth. He
          works on a reactor--telekinetically moving parts in the air--
          not even looking at Rorschach. It's as if Dr. Manhattan
          already knew he was coming.

          RORSCHACH
          Dr. Manhattan.
          Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his
          girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in her prime,
          enters from the other end.

          LAURIE
          Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What
          are you doing here? You're a wanted man.

          RORSCHACH
          Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

          LAURIE
          Don't call me that. My mother made me
          take that name. I always hated it.

          19.

          CONTINUED:

          RORSCHACH
          Sorry, Miss Jupiter. I thought I should
          tell you the bad news--the Comedian has
          been murdered.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Yes, since he and I are the only two
          extranormal operatives currently employed
          by the government, I was informed. The
          CIA suspects one of the radical Islamic
          groups.
          Dr. Manhattan shrinks from sixty to six feet in size. He
          speaks in a cold, even, matter of fact manner.

          RORSCHACH
          I have my own theories. But neither of
          you seem too concerned.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          A live human body and a dead human body
          have the same number of particles.
          Structurally there's no difference.

          LAURIE
          Well, I might not be able to count
          molecules, but either way, Blake was a
          bastard. You know he tried to rape my
          mother?

          RORSCHACH
          Sounds like you may have had a score to
          settle. You or your mother.

          LAURIE
          What? Are you accusing--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Rorschach, please don't upset Laurie. I

          DON'T--
          He pauses as if he hears something.

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          Excuse me for a moment.
          Suddenly he disappears.

          EXT. PORT OF LONG BEACH - CONTINUOUS

          A group of suspicious looking MIDDLE EASTERN MEN watch as a
          CONTAINER is being loaded onto a TRUCK--

          from the light, then realize in awe and fear

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          (in Arabic)
          It's him He's, he's real. Allah
          help us, he's real!
          The men run for it but it's useless--Dr. Manhattan shoots
          BEAMS OF ENERGY at them, freezing all the men in mid motion--
          --when PORT SECURITY pulls up. They get out of their jeeps,
          in awe of Dr. Manhattan, still floating in mid-air.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          These men were transporting a shipment of
          enriched uranium--
          With a gesture, the container floats off the truck and
          separates into pieces . . revealing the URANIUM inside.
          Suddenly the uranium changes--

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          I've safely transformed the uranium into
          sand. I trust you can take things from
          here.
          And just like that he disappears--

          INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

          --and is back in the lab without missing a beat.

          RORSCHACH
          --I'm not here to judge the moral
          discrepancies of a man who died in
          service of his country.

          LAURIE
          You call rape a moral discrepancy?!

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Rorschach--you're upsetting Laurie. I
          think you ought to go.

          RORSCHACH
          I came here to warn you both, just like I
          warned Adrian and Dan. I believe someone
          may be targeting masked heroes--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I said you ought to go.

          It took a lot of effort to get in here.
          I'm not leaving before I've--
          With a look, Dr. Manhattan makes Rorschach disappear.

          EXT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - CONTINUOUS

          Rorschach materializes down the road from the base.

          RORSCHACH
          --had my say
          Rorschach realizes what just happened. Checks himself, his
          surroundings. Reorients himself. With nothing else he can do,
          he heads down the road.

          INT. LABORATORY - SAME TIME

          Dr. Manhattan resumes his work. He looks distracted.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          He's gone. Are you okay now?

          LAURIE

          YEAH
          (studies Dr. Manhattan)
          Are you okay, Jon?
          Dr. Manhattan pauses for a moment, thoughtful.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I'm having trouble with my vision. I
          can't see clearly what lies ahead.
          There's some static interference.

          LAURIE
          Interference? Caused by what?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I'm uncertain. A power surge of great
          magnitude? Perhaps a nuclear detonation.

          LAURIE
          More war talk. I can't deal with this. I
          don't want to think about the future
          right now.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          There's no such thing as the "future."
          I've explained to you on many occasions--

          CONTINUED:

          LAURIE
          --that time is simultaneous. There's no
          past to travel back to, no future to
          travel forward to, everything happens all
          at once, our actions affect the course of
          time instantly, yes I know.

          (BEAT)
          I'm sorry, it's just a little
          unnerving to be with someone who can see
          the future, or whatever you call it.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I understand your frustration, Laurie.
          The human mind for some reason is only
          capable of viewing time frame by frame.
          Perhaps you'd find it more comforting if
          you could perceive time as I do
          Dr. Manhattan touches her head--

          Laurie's childhood home. We're in Laurie's POV, as a little
          girl. There's arguing downstairs. Laurie goes down to
          investigate.
          She comes upon the kitchen door, ajar. She can see her
          PARENTS inside, arguing--

          LAURIE (V.0.)
          Jon, stop!

          INT. LABORATORY - EVENING

          Back in the present, Laurie pulls away from Dr. Manhattan's
          touch. That memory seems to be painful for her.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I didn't mean to upset you.

          LAURIE
          I know. I think I've been cooped up on
          this base for too long. Rorschach
          mentioned Dan Dreiberg--we haven't seen
          him in years. Maybe we can give him a
          call, see if he's available for dinner
          tonight.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          You go ahead, Laurie. I want to further
          investigate this interference with my
          vision. I find it troubling.

          INT. RECEPTION - DR. MANHATTAN'S COMPOUND - EVENING

          Laurie, dressed up and looking gorgeous, heads out when she's
          stopped by a SECRET SERVICE AGENT FORBES.

          AGENT FORBES
          Going somewhere, Miss Jupiter?

          LAURIE
          Out.

          AGENT FORBES
          I'll have a car brought around in a few
          minutes.

          LAURIE
          No, thank you. I called a cab already--
          it's waiting for me outside.
          She tries to walk past but Agent Forbes steps in front of
          her.

          AGENT FORBES
          You look quite nice. Who are you meeting?

          LAURIE
          An old friend of mine. And of Dr.
          Manhattan's. Now step out of my way.

          AGENT FORBES
          Please keep in mind, Ms. Jupiter, that
          your boyfriend is this country's most
          valuable asset. You need to keep him
          happy. And on our side.
          Laurie glares at him.

          LAURIE
          Yes, sir.
          She brushes past him as she leaves.

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          --of Dan and Laurie as they finish up their meal at this
          trendy restaurant.

          LAURIE
          You remember that crazy guy, what did he
          call himself . Captain Carnage!
          Pretended to be a supervillian just so he
          could get beat up all the time?

          DAN
          Yeah, he tried that with me once. I just
          walked away but he starts following me
          down the street in broad daylight
          yelling, "punish me! punish me!"

          LAURIE

          (LAUGHS)
          Whatever happened to him?

          DAN
          Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and
          Rorschach dropped him down an elevator
          shaft.
          They look at each other, serious, then explode in laughter.

          LAURIE
          Sorry, sorry, that's not funny. I can't
          remember the last time I laughed like
          this. It feels good.
          Dan looks at her as she finishes her coffee. We can see he's
          smitten with her and that he probably has been for years.
          Laurie seems oblivious.

          DAN
          It's great seeing you again, Laurie.

          LAURIE
          Yeah, this was fun.
          The WAITER arrives with the check; Laurie grabs it.

          DAN
          You sure I can't get that?

          LAURIE
          Let me put my expense account to use. You
          can thank Uncle Sam.

          SEDAN parked outside.

          DAN
          They've been watching the whole time?

          LAURIE
          Just making sure I'm not doing anything
          that might upset the country's most
          powerful weapon.

          DAN
          How is Jon, by the way?

          LAURIE
          I really don't know. It's been harder and
          harder to tell over the years. It's like
          his emotions are slowly eroding. To be
          honest, I can't tell if he even cares
          about me anymore.
          They're quiet a moment. Laurie glances at her watch.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          I should get back.

          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Dan and Laurie step outside.

          LAURIE
          Y1 know, when I think back, why did we do
          it? Why did we dress up like that? I
          think the Keene Act was the best thing to
          ever happen to us.

          DAN
          You're probably right.

          LAURIE
          I mean, you remember my costume? All that
          tight spandex? That was awful.

          DAN
          Uh, yeah. Awful.

          LAURIE
          And to think my own mother pushed me into
          that spandex. Pushed me into the whole
          costume thing in the first place. Wanted
          her little girl to be just like mommy and
          fight bad guys.

          We'll do this again.

          DAN
          Yeah. I'd really like that.
          Laurie crosses the street and gets into the sedan. As Dan
          watches the car drive off, TWO KIDS nearly bump into him,
          running around playing. The Kids make flying noises.

          KID 1
          I'm Dr. Manhattan, saving the Twin
          Towers!

          KID 2
          No, I wanna be Dr. Manhattan!

          You can take turns, okay?
          Dan watches the Kids for a moment, then walks away. The Twin
          Towers looming behind him.

          Days later. A few mourners gather in the rain for Edward
          Blake aka The Comedian's funeral. Mostly government types.
          Dan, Adrian and Dr. Manhattan line the edge of an open grave.

          Bright California sunshine gleams over this upscale condo
          facility. Laurie's mother, SALLY, 60s but looks in her 40s,
          reclines by the POOL. She hears someone VOMITING in her
          condo.

          that way by now.

          LAURIE
          Well, I'm not. I hate it when Jon
          teleports me.

          SALLY
          Margarita?

          LAURIE
          No.
          Sally pours herself a margarita from a pitcher on the
          counter. We see photos, remnants of Sally from her
          crimefighting days around the condo. Under the pitcher of
          margaritas is a days old LA Times with the headline: "Dr.
          Manhattan Intercepts Terrorists At Port."

          SALLY
          It's Eddie Blake's funeral today, isn't
          it?
          Laurie nods. (From here on, intercut between Blake's funeral
          and Sally's condo)
          FUNERAL: Blake's coffin is removed from the hearse.

          SALLY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Finally got his punchline, I guess. Poor
          Eddie.

          what he--

          Another lesson on time passing. Y'know,
          you and Jon should get together and write
          a book on the subject.
          Sally reaches into a drawer and pulls out the old photo of
          the Watchmen, the same one with Blake and Hollis Mason in it.

          FIREWORKS. Outside, a CROWD of Vietnamese people CHEER.

          BLAKE (O.S.)
          Fireworks.
          A young Blake sits in a derelict Saigon bar, mean drunk. His
          face is devoid of his trademark scar.

          BLAKE (CONT'D)
          You'd think this country'd had enough
          goddamn fireworks. If we'd've lost this
          war, I think it might have driven us
          crazy, y'know? As a country. But we
          didn't. Thanks to you.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          You sound bitter.

          BLAKE
          Me? I think it's hilarious.

           VIETNAMESE GIRL (O.S.)
          Mr. Eddie?
          They both turn. A pretty VIETNAMESE GIRL stands in the door.
          She's pregnant, just starting to show.

          BLAKE
          Fantastic. Just what I need.

          VIETNAMESE GIRL
          The war is over now. We must talk.
          (touching her abdomen)
          About this.

          Blake SLAMS his glass down. He glares at her, drunk and
          dangerous.

          BLAKE
          There's nothing to talk about cuz I'm
          leaving. I'm gonna forget you and your
          horrible, sweaty little country.
          He turns away. Her eyes blaze with betrayal and hatred.

          VIETNAMESE GIRL
          No. You will remember. You will remember
          me and my country forever.
          She SMASHES a bottle. Blake turns just as the broken SHARDS
          SLASH HIS FACE, slicing him his jagged scar

          BLAKE
          You bitch! My face!
          He PUSHES HER into the bar and DRAWS HIS PISTOL--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Blake . don't.
          BLAM! Blake shoots her; the Girl SLAMS against the far wall.
          She drops, dead.

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          Blake. She was pregnant. You gunned her
          down.
          Blake turns on him, spitting fury.

          BLAKE
          That's right! And you know what? You
          watched me! You could've changed the gun
          into steam or the bullets into mercury or
          the bottle into snowflakes, but you
          didn't, did you? You're drifting outta
          touch, Doc--I've seen it. Don't tell me
          the war got to you.
          Blake walks off shouting "Medic!" Dr. Manhattan turns to the
          girl's body and regards it, curious. MATCH CUT TO:

          INT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK 15 YEARS AGO)


          BLAKE (V.0.)
          This is all bullshit.
          Dan, fit and trim in full Nite Owl regalia, attends the
          meeting of the "new" Watchmen. Rorschach is there, as is a
          teenage Laurie, dressed in her tight spandex costume. Dr.
          Manhattan, his age unchanged, stands with his girlfriend
          JANEY SLATER, though he casts occasional glances at young
          Laurie . who definitely glances back. Dan also pays
          Laurie attention, but she is oblivious.
          A younger Adrian, dressed as Oxymandias, leads the meeting.

          ADRIAN
          What are you saying, Comedian?
          Blake, now in his forties, smokes a CIGAR, feet on the table,
          a FLASK in hand. The PAPER in his hand reads: "Arab Leaders
          Call Dr. Manhattan: 'America's Weapon of Satan."'

          BLAKE
          What I'm saying is this whole bringing
          back the Watchmen thing is bullshit. It
          didn't work twenty years ago, and it
          ain't gonna work just because you want to
          keep on playing Cowboys and Indians.

          DAN
          Maybe we should agree on no drinking at
          meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made
          real headway on the gang problem by
          pooling our efforts.
          Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp.

          RORSCHACH
          That's true. But something like this
          seems too big. Too bureaucratic.

          ADRIAN
          Bureaucracies can be effective with the
          right leadership--

          BLAKE
          And that would be you, right Veidt? I
          mean you're the "smartest guy in the
          world," right?

          ADRIAN
          It doesn't take a genius to see that the
          world has problems.

          BLAKE
          But it takes a roomful of morons to think
          they're small enough for you guys to
          handle. You people are a joke. You hear
          Moloch's back in town and get your
          panties in a bunch. You think that
          matters?

          RORSCHACH
          Of course it does. Justice matters.

          BLAKE
          Justice. Hilarious. There's no such thing
          as justice.
          He stands, moving to Adrian's DISPLAY which outlines the
          Watchmen's agenda: GANGS, RACKETEERING, DRUGS. Blake flicks
          his ZIPPO and the display GOES UP IN FLAMES.

          ADRIAN
          My display .

          BLAKE
          Justice doesn't matter, alright? Because
          twenty years from now we're all gonna be
          dust. Mankind's been trying to kill each
          other off since the beginning of time and
          now we finally got the power to finish
          the job. Ain't nothin' gonna matter when
          the nukes start flying, and I promise you
          they will. Then Ozymandias here is gonna
          be the smartest man on the cinder.
          He sneers and walks out. Silence. Uncomfortable in the wake
          of truth, the others pack up to go, muttering apologies to
          Adrian, but Adrian ignores them, staring at the flames
          flickering across his face. He seems more thoughtful than
          upset. MATCH CUT TO:

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK 10 YEARS AGO)

          A NEWSPAPER BOX. The headlines: "Cops Say: 'Let Them Do It',"
          "Senator Keene Proposes Emergency Bill Banning Vigilantism."
          PAN UP TO REVEAL: The streets JAMMED with ANGRY PROTESTORS,
          waving signs decrying vigilantes.
          ANGLE ON: AN OVAL AIRSHIP--the OWL SHIP--its forward windows
          sculpted like the eyes of a great owl.

          Dan, in costume, pilots the ship. The Comedian stands outside
          the ship, in one of the "owl eyes," wielding a MACHINE GUN.

          DAN
          (over loudspeakers)

          EVERYONE, PLEASE CLEAR THE STREETS. WE

          ARE TRYING TO RETAIN ORDER UNTIL THE

          POLICE STRIKE IS OVER.

          BLAKE
          Crawl back in yer holes before you get
          hurt! I got rubber bullets!

          MAN IN CROWD
          We want regular cops! No more vigilantes!

          WOMAN IN CROWD
          My son is a cop, asshole!
          The Comedian gets HIT IN THE HEAD by a flying SODA CAN.

          BLAKE
          Okay, that's how you wanna do it?!
          Smiling grimly, he FIRES TEAR GAS CANNISTERS INTO THE CROWD.

          DAN
          Oh God.
          (over speakers)

          LOOK, I'M SORRY. YOU'VE LEFT US NO

          CHOICE. PLEASE CLEAR THE STREETS!
          The Comedian DIVES into the crowd, knocking random people
          aside with his rifle butt, then starts firing rubber bullets
          into the crowd. The protestors scatter and retreat. Dan lands
          the Owl Ship, exits wearing a GAS MASK, hands one to Blake.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          Comedian, this is a nightmare! The whole
          city is erupting!

          BLAKE
          Hah! You seen this?
          The smoke clears enough for Dan to see a message SPRAY-
          PAINTED on a brick wall: "WHO WATCHES THE WATCHMEN?"

          DAN
          How long can we keep this up?

          BLAKE

          Protection from what?
          Blake laughs, exultant in the blowing smoke, the chaos.

          Lord have mercy upon us. Amen.
          Dan DROPS the pin into Blake's grave. The mourners linger a
          moment as dirt is shoveled onto Blake's casket, then start
          filing out. We follow one particular mourner all the way in
          the back--a LONE MAN, as he walks away.

          EXT. CEMETERY GATES - CONTINUOUS

          The Lone Man leaves quickly.

          INT. MOLOCH'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

          The Lone Man removes his hat and coat. He is old, withered.
          He is EDGAR JACOBI. In his younger days, he was a
          supervillain known as MOLOCH--we recognize him from the news
          clipping in Blake's closet.

          INT. MOLOCH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Moloch goes to the REFRIGERATOR, opens it. Then stops,
          staring. There is a scrawled NOTE inside. Moloch picks it up--
          in spiky handwriting it reads: "LOOK BEHIND YOU."
          Over Moloch's shoulder Rorschach's hat-brim TILTS UP. As
          Moloch turns, Rorschach lunges, PINS Moloch's ARM behind his
          back and SLAMS him to the floor.

          RORSCHACH
          Edgar William Jacobi. Also known as Edgar
          William Vaughn. Also known as William
          Edgar Bright. Also known as Moloch.

          MOLOCH

          Lie again, I'll break your arm.

          MOLOCH
          Oh God, please. I did my time. I'm not
          Moloch anymore. What do you want from me?
          Rorschach lets him go. Moloch's hollow eyes follow him.

          RORSCHACH
          You attended a funeral today. Why?

          MOLOCH
          The funeral? I don't know why I went. I
          just felt I should. I'd been thinking
          about the Comedian--
          Rorschach SLAMS Moloch against the wall.

          RORSCHACH
          How did you know Blake was the Comedian?

          MOLOCH
          He broke in here! A week ago! He, he had
          his mask off. He was drunk--

          RORSCHACH
          You were enemies for forty years. Why
          would he visit you?

          MOLOCH
          I don't know! I woke up in my bedroom and
          there he was! He was upset! Crying!

          RORSCHACH
          The Comedian? Crying?

          MOLOCH
          He, he was babbling, not making sense. I
          was pissing in my pants--I thought he was
          going to kill me!

          RORSCHACH
          What did he say?!

          MOLOCH
          He said he was wrong. About it all being
          a joke, that it wasn't funny anymore. He
          said he was scared--

          RORSCHACH
          Scared of what?!

          MOLOCH
          Something he saw, I think. He said
          something about wishing he never broke
          into that building. But that he had to
          keep his mouth shut. Then, then he left!
          Rorschach studies Moloch a moment, then releases him.

          RORSCHACH
          Hm. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable.
          Probably true.
          Rorschach glances around the kitchen. He opens some drawers,
          looking inside. He picks up a stack of MAIL, flips through
          it. One of the envelopes contains a PENSION CHECK from
          "Pyramid Industries."

          MOLOCH
          So that's it? I'm clean?

          RORSCHACH
          Clean? I searched your house. Found
          illegal drugs.

          MOLOCH
          Illegal--I don't use drugs.
          Rorschach pulls a PILL BOTTLE from his coat.

          RORSCHACH
          Laetril. Phony medication made from
          apricot pits. Illegal.

          MOLOCH
          oh c-come on. Look, please don't
          confiscate that. I'm trying anything
          . I have cancer.

          RORSCHACH
          What kind of cancer?

          MOLOCH
          The kind you don't get better from.

          RORSCHACH
          Fine. You're off the hook, for now. If
          you remember anything else, leave me a
          note in the trash can opposite the Gunga
          Diner at Fortieth and Seventh. Keep out
          of trouble, Moloch.

          Thought about Moloch's story on my way to

          for revenge planned during his years
          behind bars.

          Blake understood. Humans are violent in
          nature. No matter how much you try to
          dress it up, to disguise it.
          FLASHES OF: The group photo of the old Watchmen. Then the
          photo of the new Watchmen.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Blake saw the true face of human kind and
          chose to become a parody of it, treated

          Eyes still closed, she does not see a THIRD BLUE HAND trace a
          line down her cheek. She kisses it.

          LAURIE
          Hey, your finger, it's like licking a
          battery. It's all--
          She opens her eyes. They widen in shock and horror as she
          sees TWO DR. MANHATTANS in bed with her.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          Oh God! That's horrible! Stop it!
          Laurie jumps up. The two Dr. Manhattans stand, confused.

          DR. MANHATTAN 1 DR. MANHATTAN 2
          Please don't be upset. I thought you'd enjoy it.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I--You startled me, that's all

          DR. MANHATTAN 1
          I don't know what stimulates you anymore.
          Laurie backs into the hall, trying to get a grip.

          LAURIE
          Forget about it. I overreacted. It was
          just strange to see--
          Laurie can now see into the KITCHEN, where yet a THIRD DR.
          MANHATTAN is working on an experiment. Her eyes blaze.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          How long have you been working in here?

          DR. MANHATTAN 1
          Laurie, try to understand--

          LAURIE
          Understand!? You're working in here at
          the same time we're in bed!?

          DR. MANHATTAN 3
          My work with Adrian is at an important
          stage. It seemed unnecessary to--

          LAURIE
          Shut up! Just SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
          Laurie WHIPS a full BEAKER at 3's chest. It PASSES THROUGH
          HIM and SMASHES IN THE KITCHEN SINK. Laurie storms out.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          39.

          CONTINUED: (2)

          DR. MANHATTAN 3
          Laurie, please--If you think there's a
          problem with my attitude, I'm prepared to
          discuss it--
          As he speaks, the smashed BEAKER and its contents RISE INTO
          THE AIR, REASSEMBLING perfectly in the palm of 3's hand.
          IN THE HALL: Laurie nearly bumps into Dr. Manhattan 2.

          DR. MANHATTAN 2
          --but logically, not clouded with human
          emotion.

          LAURIE
          Human emotion? You were human once.
          That's the problem, Jon. You've forgotten
          that.

          DR. MANHATTAN 2
          Laurie, where are you--
          The door slams. Laurie's left. For good.
          Dr. Manhattan 2 stands there. He walks back to the BEDROOM
          where 1 is. Dr. Manhattan 1 holds an OLD PHOTO. In the photo
          is a COUPLE, smiling into the camera. We recognize the woman
          as Janey Slater, Dr. Manhattan's ex-girlfriend, who we saw in
          Adrian's flashback at Blake's funeral. We recognize the man
          in the photo as . Dr. Manhattan. When he was human.
          Dr. Manhattan stares at the photo. Perhaps feeling the tingle
          of human emotion again

          INT. DAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

          Dan heats up some leftover Chinese food in the microwave as
          the TV plays in the B/G:

          NEWS ANALYST (V.O.)
          --no one's fired their weapons yet, but
          no one's lowered them either. Maybe these
          other countries aren't so afraid of Dr.
          Manhattan, maybe they're calling the
          President's bluff. I'm very curious to
          see what Dr. Manhattan himself has to say
          in his live interview which should be in
          about an hour or so
          BOOM, BOOM! Dan looks up. Someone's banging on the door.
          Hard.

          

          

          

          

          40.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

          Dan approaches the door, cautious, mask killer on his mind?

          DAN
          Who is it?

          LAURIE (O.S.)
          It's Laurie.

          DAN
          Laurie?
          It takes a few moments for him to open the door.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          Sorry, I had a new lock installed, it's a
          little sticky--

          LAURIE
          I left Jon.

          INT. DAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Dan pours a teary eyed Laurie a glass of RED WINE.

          DAN
          Did, uh, the Secret Service follow you
          here?

          LAURIE
          I lost them in the subways. I think.

          DAN
          I'm really sorry, Laurie.

          LAURIE
          Living with him . Dan, you don't know
          what it's been like.
          INTERCUT TO: Dr. Manhattan, holding Laurie's BRA. Staring.

          LAURIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The way he looks at things, like he can't
          remember what they are, like he doesn't
          really care. This world, the real world
          to him it's like walking through
          mist, and all the people are just
          shadows. Shadows in the fog.
          Dr. Manhattan lowers his head. A SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. He
          looks up to see a THREE PIECE SUIT floating before him--
          waiting for its wearer.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Dan and Laurie walk the streets, getting some air.

          LAURIE
          I hope I didn't ruin your night.

          DAN
          Not at all. I was just going to see
          Hollis for our weekly beer session.
          You're more than welcome to join. In
          fact, I insist
          They pass the news stand from the opening scene. The Homeless
          Man is arguing with the News Vendor:

          NEWS VENDOR
          --I told you, this month's issue still
          hasn't arrived yet! Why do you care about
          that right wing rag so much? Cuz those
          bastards don't give a damn about you,
          pal! They--hold up, here it comes.
          They turn as SEYMOUR, a fat slob of a man, arrives with a
          BUNDLE of the latest issue of "The New Frontiersman."
          CUT TO: Dr. Manhattan stepping THROUGH and INTO the empty,
          floating suit. His TIE knots itself.
          Dr. Manhattan looks around the empty room . sad? Again,
          he looks at the photo of him and Janey Slater . . then

          DISAPPEARS IN A BURST OF PARTICLES.

          EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

          Dan and Laurie turn down a darker, less populated street.

          DAN
          Laurie, will you please stop apologizing?
          I'm here for you anytime.
          SHADOWS trail behind them, ominous. Someone's following.

          LAURIE
          I know. I just find it rude when people
          show up at your door--

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

          The main waiting area. People go about their jobs. The
          RECEPTIONIST hears a strange, electric CRACKLING

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          42.

          CONTINUED:

          LAURIE (V.0.)
          --completely out of the blue.
          Suddenly, Dr. Manhattan appears in a burst of energy. The
          receptionist SHRIEKS. The PRODUCER looks out his office.

          PRODUCER
          Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives and no
          one thinks to tell me?

          RECEPTIONIST
          He, he just--

          PRODUCER
          All geez. We don't have time for make-up.
          That blue is too light for television.
          The light from Dr. Manhattan's SKIN DARKENS to a DEEPER BLUE.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Is this dark enough?

          PRODUCER
          Uh, yeah

          EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME

          Dan and Laurie turn down an alley. We now see who's following
          them--a group of YOUNG THUGS.

          PRODUCER (V.0.)
          that's dark enough.

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - BACK STAGE - SAME TIME

          A White House PRESS AGENT escorts Dr. Manhattan to the set.

          PRESS AGENT
          Just another reminder that if the second
          Geneva Convention comes up, our official
          position is that talks will not resume
          until the Chinese agree to exclude you
          from the agenda. The President approved
          this interview because he wanted to
          strengthen morale at home and to gently
          remind the rest of the world who holds
          the cards. Please keep that in mind.
          Dr. Manhattan stands off stage, waiting. The LIGHTS come up
          and we're live with the glossy NEWS HOST.

          NEWS HOST
          He's been called many things; Hero,
          weapon, linchpin of our security--
          CUT TO: Dan and Laurie turning as the Young Thugs BLOCK THE
          ALLEYWAY. One of the Thugs pulls a KNIFE. Laurie and Dan
          exchange a look. Dan removes his glasses. CUT BACK TO:

          NEWS HOST (CONT'D)
          His given name is Jonathan Osterman--Dr.
          Jonathan Osterman--a renowned nuclear
          physicist who through a terrible accident
          became the man the world knows today as
          Dr. Manhattan.
          The audience APPLAUDS loudly as Dr. Manhattan takes his seat.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Thank you.

          NEWS HOST
          Thank you, Dr. Manhattan, and not simply
          for appearing on this program. I believe
          I speak for all of America when I thank
          you for thwarting the terrorist plot at
          the port of Long Beach over a week ago--
          Furious applause from the audience, which Dr. Manhattan
          regards curiously.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          It was my duty.
           CUT TO: Dan and Laurie surrounded by the Thugs . when
          suddenly they DIVE INTO the group, fighting like the heroes
          they once were.
          Dan grapples with one of the Thugs and knocks his knife away--
          --when another Thug nails him from behind with a BAT. Dan
          drops to the ground . BACK TO:

          NEWS HOST
          Before we start, I want to explain to our
          viewers the unconventional format for
          this interview. Our live audience is made
          up entirely of news media and Dr.
          Manhattan will be taking questions from
          the floor. This commercial free broadcast
          is presented to you by Veidt Enterprises.
          We see Adrian standing near the audience with the Press
          Agent, smiling for the camera.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          CUT TO: Laurie, driving a FIST into a Thug's NOSE, when
          another Thug GRABS HER HAIR.

          NEWS HOST (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          We will now take our first question--
          The Thug draws a PISTOL on her. Dan, still on the ground,
          sees the gun and his eyes narrow, harden. He pushes himself
          up off the ground.
          CUT BACK TO: The TV Studio AUDIENCE: where Doug Roth, the
          journalist who interviewed Adrian earlier, stands.

          DOUG ROTH
          Dr. Manhattan, Doug Roth, Nova Times. Do
          you remember a man named Wally Weaver?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Yes, he was a good friend of mine. When
          we were both physicists.

          DOUG ROTH
          He died of cancer.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I remember. I attended his funeral.

          DOUG ROTH
          How about Edgar Jacobi, also known as the
          supervillian Moloch? You had a lot of
          battles with him, didn't you? Did you
          know that he has cancer as-well?
          The News Host looks confused. Adrian turns to the Press
          Agent, growing concerned with where this is leading.
          CUT TO: Dan, snapping the GUNMAN'S wrist back and up--
          Barrel aimed at the Thug's CHIN. In the last fraction of a
          second, Dan SHIFTS the gun two inches left as it FIRES,
          deafening the Thug, but leaving him alive. BACK TO:

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I was not aware--

          DOUG ROTH
          And what about Jose Flores? He was the
          longtime janitor at the Watchmen
          Headquarters where you worked for many
          years. Cancer.

          CONTINUED: (3)

          DR. MANHATTAN
          By your line of questioning, you're
          suggesting that I was the cause of cancer
          in these individuals.

          DOUG ROTH
          You tell me, doc.
          Adrian turns to him.

          ADRIAN
          Doug, that `s enough.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          It is irrelevant whether I was the cause
          or not.

          DOUG ROTH
          Irrelevant?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          A live human body and a dead human body
          have the same number of particles.
          Structurally there's no difference.
          An appalled then angry buzz comes over the audience.

          DOUG ROTH
          What about Janey Slater? Do you think it
          makes a difference to her?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Janey Slater? Wh--

          DOUG ROTH
          Your ex-girlfriend, she was a physicist
          too. You were with her for ten years. Or
          does she have to remind you herself?
          Suddenly Janey Slater emerges from a door at the top of the
          stands. She is old now, frail, barely recognizable from the
          images we've see of her.

          DOUG ROTH (CONT'D)
          She has cancer as well. Doctors have
          given her six months. What do you have to
          say, Ms. Slater?
          He sticks the microphone in her face.

          JANEY SLATER
          D-damn you, Jon. God damn you

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (4)
          She leaves as fast as she came, bursting into tears. Dr.
          Manhattan stands, visibly shaken--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          No, Janey, wait!
          In the audience, Adrian turns to the Press Agent, frantic.

          ADRIAN
          We need to stop this now.
          Adrian and the Press Agent hurry on stage, SECURITY
          following.

          PRESS AGENT
          That's it! Interview's over!
          BACK TO: The alley, littered with the unconscious BODIES of
          the Thugs. Laurie and Dan lean back on the wall, gasping for
          air, horribly out of shape, but victorious.
          CUT TO: The TV studio, as Adrian and Security surround Dr.
          Manhattan, trying to escort him out. The audience spills out
          of the stands, RUSHING Dr. Manhattan with questions and,
          FLASHING cameras--it's madness. Adrian shoves a camera out of
          Dr. Manhattan's face.

          ADRIAN
          As the sponsor of this program I demand
          all cameras off!
          His plea is futile, of course. A REPORTER breaks through,
          gets in Dr. Manhattan's face.

          REPORTER 1
          Did you give Ms. Slater cancer by
          sleeping with her?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          No. Please let me through

          REPORTER 2
          Do you even care about human life?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Please. If everyone would just go away
          and leave me alone.
          Adrian hears the note of warning in his voice.

          Everyone back off! Don't you understand?
          He's the only thing preventing the world
          from chaos!

          DOUG ROTH
          How many other people did you do this to?
          Dr. Manhattan finally SNAPS--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I said LEAVE ME ALONE!
          Every last person BURSTS INTO PARTICLES and DISAPPEARS. Dr.
          Manhattan is suddenly alone. He looks stunned almost.

          EXT. ROOF - SAME TIME

          The TV audience materializes out on the roof

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          Dan and Laurie exit the quiet alley, trying to play it off.

          LAURIE
          I should find a hotel. God. Imagine, us
          getting mugged.

          DAN
          Why don't you come by Hollis' with me?
          Shake off the adrenaline.

          LAURIE
          No thanks, I've had enough hero stuff for
          one night.

          being accosted and then teleporting everyone to the roof.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.

          Laurie rides in back, staring out at the street, calming
          down. The cab stops at a red light; The CABBIE takes outa
          ZIPPO,lights a cigarette. Laurie stares at the FLAME

          INT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 15 YEARS AGO)

          like she stares at the flame here, as Adrian's display
          burns. Laurie glances around as everyone leaves, apologizing
          to Adrian.

          EXT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 15 YEARS AGO)

          Outside Watchmen HQ, Dan's Owl Ship rises out of view.
          Rorschach skulks off into the shadows. Dr. Manhattan and
          Janey Slater get into a Town Car as young Laurie watches from
          around the corner.

          BLAKE (O.S.)
          Laurel? Laurel Jane?
          Startled, Laurie turns. Blake steps out of the shadows.

          BLAKE (CONT'D)
          You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

          LAURIE
          You're the Comedian, right? You were
          pretty cool in there.
          Blake lights a smoke, looks her over.

          BLAKE
          You got your mom's eyes. Even that funny
          little mole.

          LAURIE
          Got another smoke?

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          49.

          CONTINUED:

          BLAKE
          She was one of the all-time champion
          beauties, your mom. She talk about me
          much?

          LAURIE
          No. Not really.
          As Blake gives her a light, Laurie touches his hand to cover
          the lighter from the wind. She looks up at him, sly.

          SALLY (O.S.)

          TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HER.
          Laurie nearly jumps out of her skin. A younger Sally marches
          toward them from a LIMO, waiting at the sidewalk.

          BLAKE
          Hey Doll. Long time no see.

          SALLY
          Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
          She eyes Laurie with cool death.

          SALLY (CONT'D)
          Put that out. Get in the car.
          INSIDE THE LIMO: Laurie cracks her window an inch. Her
          mother's harsh, low tone drifts clearly back.

          SALLY (CONT'D)
          Are there no depths you won't sink to?

          BLAKE
          Christ, we were just talking! Can't a guy
          talk to his, y'know, friend's daughter?
          What the hell do you think I am?

          SALLY
          I know what you are, Eddie. I've always
          known. Don't ever forget that.
          Driving off, Laurie watches Blake through the window--

          INT. CAB (STOPPED) - NIGHT

          --like she watches through the window in the present. The
          light turns green--
          --when a BLACK SUV pulls in front of the cab, BLOCKING its
          path.

          CONTINUED:
          The Cabbie honks his horn as a team of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
          get out of the SUV. Agent Forbes knocks on Laurie's window.

          AGENT FORBES
          Ms. Jupiter, you need to come with us now.

          INT. ROCKEFELLER BASE - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

          Agent Forbes escorts her into the room.

          LAURIE
          I don't understand, what do you mean,
          Jon's gone?

          AGENT FORBES
          I mean he snapped and disappeared during
          the interview. Now our trackers can't
          detect him anywhere on the planet. If we
          want to find him you're our only hope.
          A TECHNICIAN wires Laurie up; GRAPHS record Laurie's neural
          responses, MONITORS show satellite images.

          TECHNICIAN 1
          Miss Jupiter, we need you to visualize
          Dr. Manhattan. Do you need a prompt?

          LAURIE
          No.

          TECHNICIAN 2
          Neurotransmissions tracking.

          TECHNICIAN 3
          Transmitting on all frequencies.

          TECHNICIAN 1
          We're ready Miss Jupiter. We need you to
          try and talk to him.
          Laurie, wired like a porcupine, seems embarrassed.

          LAURIE
          Jon? Jon, can you hear me?
          The GRAPH-NEEDLES jump and tick, searching
          . when a high, clear TONE rings through the room.
          Needles fly. Technicians dash to lock it down. Agent Forbes
          hurries to the graph, looking over their shoulders.

          AGENT FORBES
          Have you got him?

          We've located his signal, yes.

          AGENT FORBES
          Well? Where the hell is he?
          The Technician looks up, not happy about the answer.

          TECHNICIAN 1
          He's on Mars.

          EXT. REMOTE SATELLITE STATION - NIGHT

          HUGE DISHES scan the skies. We hear the high, clear tone,
          above all the RADIO CHATTER, NEWS REPORTS and MILITARY
          FREQUENCIES, the endless, echoing chaff of the world...

          NEWS REPORTER 1 (V.0.)
          --massive mobilization of troops in

          KASHMIR--

          NEWS REPORTER 2 (V.0.)

          Security Advisors--

          LAURIE (V.0.)
          Jon. Can you hear me, Jon?
          But these VOICES get progressively QUIETER, as we--
          ZOOM BACK: Up, out of the atmosphere, at a blinding rate--

          EXT. MARS - NIGHT

          --landing on A VAST MARTIAN PLAIN, and the tiny BLUE FIGURE,
          walking across it, RED DUST BILLOWING behind him. The peace
          and quiet after the cacophony of Earth is soothing.
          Dr. Manhattan stops, looking over the landscape. He holds the
          photo of him and Janey Slater in his hand, when he was human.
          He stares at the photo a moment and closes his eyes--
          --and we FLASHBACK to the moment that photo was taken. He and
          Janey are at a CARNIVAL. After the flash, Janey turns to him.

          JANEY SLATER
          Aww, Jon, look--you've got cotton candy
          on the side of your mouth

          You do too. Here, let me get it for you.
          He pulls her close. They giggle like the young lovers they
          are and then kiss, passionate
          BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan walking on mars' surface. He
          approaches a LARGE ROCK FORMATION which blocks his path.
          He PARTS the rock formation telekinetically, like Moses
          parting the sea--
          --and we FLASHBACK, mirroring the parting of the rock
          formation to the parting of two SLIDING DOORS, in the LAB OF
          A NUCLEAR TESTING FACILITY, as Jon steps into the REACTOR

          CHAMBERÂ

          JON OSTERMAN (CONT'D)

          (YELLING)
          I'll catch up with you guys--I left my
          watch inside .
          Jon backs into the chamber without noticing the DIGITAL CLOCK
          above the doors counting down: 3 2 1--"TIME LOCK
          INITIATED"--the doors CLOSE .
          BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars as he stops to pick up a
          STRANGE ROCK. It's beautiful--the colors, the crystals--
          unlike anything we've ever seen--
          --and we FLASHBACK to Jon's lab COLLEAGUES watching in horror
          as Jon retrieves his WATCH, oblivious. They try to open the
          door, but it's no use--the time lock can't be overridden.
          Janey arrives, SCREAMS when she sees Jon inside. Jon turns,
          sees all the terrified faces staring at him.

          JON OSTERMAN (CONT'D)
          Janey? What's wrong?

          JANEY SLATER
          The time lock, Jon!
          As it dawns on Jon, he hears the hum of the REACTOR
          INITIATING, the big mechanical parts moving. Jon runs to the
          door, BANGS on it.

          JON OSTERMAN
          Janey: Oh my god!
          TEARS stream down Janey's face as she looks at him through
          the thick glass, helpless, hopeless. Inside, the chamber
          starts to GLOW .

          reactor initiates

          JON OSTERMAN

          JANEY!
          . and with a BLINDING FLASH--Jon and his watch are
          OBLITERATED to bits .
          BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars, as he obliterates the strange
          rock he was holding to bits
          and we FLASHBACK to the lab CAFETERIA. Janey sits at a
          table, crying softly, being consoled by her colleagues
          CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE NUCLEAR FACILITY, by the barbed wire
          fences, A DISEMBODIED BRAIN, A SET OF EYES, AND A SPINAL

          COLUMN MATERIALIZES .
          BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars, as he RISES into the air. At
          a thought, the RED SAND FUSES into a beautiful, PINK GLASS

          STRUCTURE--
          --and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria KITCHEN as a COOK SHRIEKS

          INTO COMPLEX GLASS PATTERNS, RISING FROM THE PLAIN at Dr.

          GLASS STRUCTURE, which begins to resemble parts of a WATCH--
          --and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria. Janey's still crying.
          One of her Colleagues reaches for her hand when STATIC SPARKS
          snap around them. All over the cafeteria, the METAL UTENSILS
          begin to SPARK. In the center of the room, GLOWING BLUE
          PARTICLES begin to collect, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER with
          amazing force
          and in a BLINDING FLASH, THE PARTICLES FORM DR.
          MANHATTAN, hovering over the room like a newborn god.
          Everyone in the cafeteria looks up in awe, in fear and--

          There must be some way to contact him.
          Laurie sits in the room, largely forgotten.

          Laurie heads to the bathroom, trailed by the Secret Service
          Agent. As she reaches the bathroom door--
          --she suddenly SPINS and ELBOWS the agent in the GROIN. The
          Agent buckles; Laurie grabs him by his coat, SHOVES his head
          through the bathroom door and SLAMS THE DOOR on his head.

          INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Laurie drags the groggy Agent into the bathroom. She takes

          SECRET SERVICE AGENT
          We're only detaining you for national

          Don't you understand that sitting there

          that's Jon. If he wants to find me, he's
          quite capable of doing so on his own.
          I've been a prisoner in my live long
          enough. You are taking me out of here
          because if you don't, and Jon does come
          back, I'm going to let him know who was
          naughty and who was nice. And he won't

          Adrian excuses himself from his Assistant.

          ADRIAN
          Jon's departure is terrible. Not only for
          what's happening in the world now, but
          for what could have happened. The energy
          project he and I were working on--it's
          dead now .

          PERSONAL ASSISTANT
          Sometimes I can't bear to watch the news.
          It makes it so hard to be
          optimistic Is that a gun?
          Dan sees what's happening--

          DAN
          Adrian!
          BANG! The man SHOOTS the Assistant in the gut; Adrian
          immediately springs into action--he moves with unbelievable
          speed and quickness, grabbing a velvet ROPE-STANCHION--
          --DEFLECTING A SECOND BULLET with it--
          --and SMASHING IT INTO THE FACE OF THE ASSASSIN, knocking him
          into a FOUNTAIN.
          SECURITY GUARDS run, guns drawn, toward the fountain where
          Adrian GRAPPLES with the dazed man.

          SECURITY GUARD
          Mr. Veidt! Let us handle it!

          ADRIAN
          Wait, he's got a poison capsule!
          He JAMS his fingers into the Assassin's mouth when Dan
          arrives.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          Don't bite down, you scum! I want to know
          who sent you!
          The Assassin's eyes BULGE

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          I want to know who's behind this!
          The Assassin CHOKES and dies. Adrian DROPS him,
          unanswered. He looks over at Dan, frustrated.

          INT. CAFE - AFTERNOON

          Dan and Laurie sit in the back of the cafe, making sure they
          have privacy.

          LAURIE
          Oh my god. Where's Adrian now?

          DAN
          Talking to the cops. Thank god he's still
          in great shape. You get so caught up with
          the whole smartest man in the world thing
          you forget what a physical specimen he is-
          -he's as fast as I've ever seen him

          (BEAT)
          What about you? What are you going to do?

          LAURIE
          I'm not sure. I can't go stay with my mom-
          -I'm sure that's the first place they'll
          look. But I need to get out of the city.
          It's only a matter of time before they
          find me.

          DAN
          Listen, why don't you . how about you
          stay at my place?

          LAURIE
          Oh, Dan, I couldn't impose--

          DAN
          It wouldn't be an imposition, I have an
          extra room. We're friends. And with
          everything that's been happening

          LAURIE
          You're buying into Rorschach's "mask
          killer" theory?

          DAN
          I don't know. But it can't hurt to be
          safe. Besides, I've already had one
          wanted person visit me, another one won't
          make a difference.
          They look at each other. Laurie smiles.

          LAURIE
          Okay.

          (BEAT)
          So this guy who tried to kill Adrian--who
          was he?

          Rorschach investigates the apartment of ROY CHESS, Adrian's
          would-be assassin. The place is decent but messy.
          Rorschach spots a PORNO MAG on the coffee table. On the couch
          nearby, a pair of PANTS. Rorschach picks them up, reaches
          into the pockets. He pulls out some cash, credit cards--
          --and an ID for Pyramid Industries. It says Chess was a
          security guard
          . and then Rorschach remembers the pension check he saw
          at Moloch's house. From Pyramid Industries.
          Rorschach sees a LAPTOP over on the kitchen table. The
          computer is on and shows the SERVER for Pyramid Industries.
          Rorschach navigates the server until he finds the EMPLOYEE

          DIRECTORY.
          Once in the directory he pauses for a second. Then he types
          in a name: "Jane Slater."
          A photo of Janey Slater pops up--"Status: RETIRED."
          Rorschach stares at the screen, excited at the connection.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          We're in Rorschach's POV as he walks down the street. From
          the non-reaction of passers by, he obviously doesn't have his
          mask on.

          RORSCHACH (V.O.)
          Rorschach's Journal, October 19th.
          Someone tried to kill Adrian Veidt.
          Proves mask killer theory--the murderer
          is closing in. Pyramid Industries is the
          key.
          Rorschach approaches a TRASH CAN. He rummages through it and
          finds an ENVELOPE. He opens it and finds a NOTE that reads:
          "Tonight 11:30, M."

           RORSCHACH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Checked mail drop, got a message from
          Moloch. Was just going to pay him a
          visit.
          Rorschach turns down an alley, approaches a DUMPSTER. He
          reaches behind the dumpster.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)

          Rorschach pulls his mask on, FILLING THE SCREEN

          INT. MOLOCH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S EYES staring fearfully out the rainy
          window. Rorschach APPEARS in the darkness behind him.

          RORSCHACH
          Somebody tried to shoot the world's
          smartest man today, Moloch.
          Moloch sits at the kitchen table. CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S HAND. An
          ignored CIGARETTE smolders. In his other hand, a NOTE.

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          The hitman worked for Pyramid Industries.
          So did Janey Slater and everyone else Dr.
          Manhattan allegedly gave cancer to. And
          last time I was here, I saw a pension
          check sent to you from the same company--
          obviously a front set up by whoever it is
          that killed the Comedian, that pushed Dr.
          Manhattan over the edge, that wants us
          masks dead. Is that why you left me a
          note in my mail drop? You have something
          to confess?
          Rorschach turns. A HOLE gapes between Moloch's staring eyes.
          A PISTOL lies on the table--Moloch's dead.
          Rorschach carefully pulls the NOTE from Moloch's hand. It's
          the note Rorschach had left in Moloch's refrigerator, the one
          that reads: "LOOK BEHIND YOU."
          Behind Rorschach, BLINDING LIGHT GLARES THROUGH THE WINDOW.

          Moloch's corpse stares at Rorschach. Rorschach TEARS OPEN the
          cupboards, pulling items off the shelves.

          RORSCHACH
          Framed. Set up. Walked right into it.

          SWAT Cop 1 moves down the hall, carelessly ahead of formation-

          IGNITES the AEROSOL CAN'S STREAM, SPRAYING THE COPS WITH
          FIRE. They fall back, screaming, shooting. SWAT Cop 1 catches
          the worst of it--he DROPS AND ROLLS on the floor, trying to
          extinguish the flames on him.
          Rorschach BOLTS upstairs, IGNITING the staircase behind him.
          Pandemonium.

          We've got him. There's no way out.
          From the second floor, Rorschach SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW,
          snarling like a rabid dog, landing hard on the concrete. His
          ankle TWISTS, dropping him to the ground.
          Rorschach struggles to get to his feet. When he looks up he
          finds TWENTY COPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE before him. A loaded,
          pregnant pause. The COPS RUSH FORWARD.

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          No pain. Must get up. Find who framed me--

          Rorschach is finally beaten, surrounded by cops, as Moloch's

          ANCHORWOMAN
          Today, police searched the apartment of
          Walter Kovacs, better known as the masked
          vigilante Rorschach. Kovacs was captured
          last night and charged with the murder of
          Edgar Jacobi, formerly known as the
          supervillain Moloch. Moloch was found
          shot in the head at point blank range.
          Both Dan and Laurie stop what they're doing, eyes fixed on
          the TV: They see Rorschach, unmasked, IN SHACKLES.

          ANCHORWOMAN (CONT'D)
          Inside the decrepit apartment, police
          discovered stacks of right-wing
          literature, including several years of
          back issues of the ultra-conservative
          publication, "The New Frontiersman." We
          asked "New Frontiersman" editor, Hector
          Godfrey, for comment.
          CUT TO: A clip of the EDITOR being interviewed. We see
          Seymour, who we met at the news stand, in the background.

          EDITOR
          Rorschach is an American patriot and we
          are proud that he reads this publication.

          ANCHORWOMAN
          During his capture, Kovacs assaulted and
          severely injured at least nine police
          officers, shooting one officer with a
          grappling gun. That officer is in serious
          but stable condition.

          ANCHORMAN
          Meanwhile, in Kashmir, fighting continues
          to intensify. Both India and Pakistan
          alluded that the use of nuclear weapons
          is not out of the question--
          Laurie shuts off the TV, not wanting to hear the war talk.

          LAURIE
          That mask's eaten Rorschach's brains
          away.

          DAN
          He wasn't always like that. We were a
          great team--tactically, he was brilliant.
          But I don't know, something about this
          murder charge I just can't see
          Rorschach shooting Moloch.

          him. But a regular gun just seems too
          . ordinary

          LAURIE
          And this war, god. Sometimes I wish I
          could just leave the planet. Like Jon.

          DAN
          Oh sure. The old Manhattan Transfer.

          LAURIE
          Now, that's funny. That's what you call
          Jon's teleportation?

          Well, not to his face.
          Laurie laughs.

          INT. PRISON HALLS - DAY

          Rorschach walks, led by TWO CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. From the
          cells, PRISONERS shout insults, death threats. Rorschach
          stares ahead. Silent. Calm.

          INT. PRISON PSYCH ROOM - DAY

          The PRISON PSYCHIATRIST, Black, amiable, a mite portly, sits
          across the table from Rorschach sans mask: Cold and
          frightening. The Psychiatrist reads his FILE.

          Walter Kovacs. Is that your name?
          Walter?

          RORSCHACH
          No.
          The Psychiatrist sits back, considering Rorschach carefully.

          PSYCHIATRIST
          Let me explain your situation here,
          Walter. If you cooperate with me, I may
          be able to convince them that you should
          to be treated medically, in a hospital,
          which I believe is best for you. But the
          authorities want to put you in General
          Population.

          The Psychiatrist holds up another blot-card.

          PSYCHIATRIST
          How about this one? What do you see here?
          FLASH OF: Rorschach, as a LITTLE BOY, watching his MOTHER,
          HALF NAKED, EMBRACE A MAN AS HE HANDS HER SOME MONEY. When
          she catches Rorschach interrupting, she SMACKS him in the
          face. Shuts the door on him.

          RORSCHACH
          Some nice flowers.
          The Psychiatrist eyes him, dubious. Holds up another card.
          FLASH OF: Rorschach as a little boy looking up at TWO OLDER
          BOYS, teasing him. Calling him "son of a whore." Rorschach
          just wants to be left alone when one of the Boys SPITS in his
          face. Suddenly, Rorschach's face changes. He attacks the Boy
          like a wild animal--biting, clawing .

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          Clouds.
          The Psychiatrist sighs, puts the cards down.

          PSYCHIATRIST
          Tell me about Rorschach. Will you do
          that?

          RORSCHACH
          Why are you here with me, doctor?

          RORSCHACH
          There's other men in here with behavior
          more extreme than mine. Of course,
          they're not famous. You want to know
          about Rorschach, doctor? I'll tell you
          about Rorschach

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

           Rorschach, walks through intermittent STREETLIGHTS. In his
           GLOVE, he holds a PHOTO of an angelic SIX YEAR OLD GIRL.

           RORSCHACH (V.0.)
           I was investigating a kidnap case. Blair
          Roche, 6 year old girl. I was young then.
          Too soft on criminals. I let them live.

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

          A creepy, deserted-looking house. Rorschach peers through a
          slatted fence at TWO GERMAN SHEPHERDS FIGHTING.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
          Broke a man's arm to get a tip. Led me to
          the missing girl's location.

          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

          CRACK! The front door is KICKED OPEN, smashing the lock.
          Rorschach moves between a line of headless MANNEQUINS. In one
          corner rests an old WOOD-BURNING STOVE. Rorschach peers
          inside, removes a BLACKENED scrap of UNDERWEAR. It's
          decorated with little hearts and bears.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
          I knew the girl was here. But when I
          searched the place I found nothing.

          INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

          Rorschach enters the kitchen. Out the window, the DOGS are
          fighting. Rorschach opens a cupboard, where a line of KNIVES,
          CLEAVERS and a HACKSAW hang on hooks. Outside, the snarling
          dogs get LOUDER.
          Slowly now, Rorschach's gaze moves from the knives . to
          the counter. He runs his gloved finger along RED STAINED,
          DEEP-CUT GROOVES in a THICK WOODEN CHOPPING BLOCK. Blood. His
          gaze continues out the window

          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
          And then I found her.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          69.

          CONTINUED:
          . to the dogs, still fighting over the BONE, which we now
          recognize as a small, HUMAN FEMUR--that of the little girl.
          Rorschach clenches his hands in fury, his fists tremble
          and suddenly, he relaxes. Calms.
          Rorschach slowly turns to the cupboard. He reaches for a
          large CLEAVER .

          EXT. HOUSE - LATER (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

          The CHILD MOLESTER, greasy and fat, walks past the now-silent
          fence.

           RORSCHACH (V.0.)
           It was dark when the murderer got back.
           As dark as it gets.

          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

           The Man flicks a LIGHT SWITCH. Nothing. He draws a GUN.

           INT. HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

          He tries the light in here. Nothing again. He turns away as
          the BODY of a DEAD GERMAN SHEPARD CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW!
          He SCRAMBLES through the warehouse, falling over mannequins.
          He FIRES madly into the dark. The SECOND DOG SMASHES INTO HIM
          FROM A SECOND WINDOW. His gun goes flying. He scrambles
          backward against the stove.
          FROM BEHIND, Rorschach CUFFS THE MAN'S WRIST TO THE STOVE.
          When the Child Molester sees that "face," he loses his
          bladder. Rorschach just stares, mask-blots shifting

          CHILD MOLESTER
          You think I had something to do with that
          girl? I didn't! Where's your evidence?
          Rorschach calmly points to body of the dog. (It is the
          same image Rorschach saw in the first blot-card.)

          CHILD MOLESTER (CONT'D)
          Okay, I confess! I kidnapped her! I
          killed her! Arrest me!

          RORSCHACH
          Men get arrested.
          Rorschach RAISES THE CLEAVER, high over his head

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          70.

          CONTINUED:
          RORSCHACH (cont'd)
          Dogs get put down.
          Rorschach SWINGS the cleaver DOWN. Blood SPATTERS his mask.

          INT. PRISON PSYCH ROOM - DAY

          The Psychiatrist listens, paralyzed. Horrified.

          RORSCHACH
          A tremor of impact shook my arm. Warm
          blood splashed my face. It was Walter
          Kovacs who screamed, who closed his eyes--
          it was Rorschach who opened them again.
          The silence reels out
          RORSCHACH (cont'd)
          You see, Doctor. God didn't kill that
          little girl, fate didn't butcher her and
          destiny didn't feed her to those dogs. If
          God saw what any of us did that night, he
          didn't seem to mind. From then on, I
          knew. God doesn't make the world this
          way. We do.
          The Psychiatrist rises shakily. He crosses to the GUARD.

          PSYCHIATRIST
          I can't help him.

          INT. PRISON COMMISSARY - EVENING

          The Mess hall is PACKED, hundreds of INMATES eat dinner.
          Rorschach enters. The place goes instantly, heavily SILENT.
          Suddenly someone yells:

          RANDOM VOICE
          Hey Rorschach, I heard your momma was a
          whore!
          A cruel RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER and the mass conversation begins
          again as Rorschach takes his place in the food line. A HUGE
          PRISONER moves in behind him. He whispers:

          PRISONER
          Hey, Rorschach. You're pretty famous,
          right? Y'know, I'm pretty famous too.
          Maybe I can give you my autograph.
          The Prisoner slides a SHIV from his sleeve

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          71.

          CONTINUED:
          Rorschach doesn't register this. He waits for the FRY-COOK
          behind the counter to turn away--
          --then casually reaches across and lifts the DEEP-FRYER
          BASKET from its mount--
          --the Prisoner JABS the shiv forward--Rorschach spins,
          GRIPPING the man's wrist and FLINGING the BOILING GREASE INTO
          THE MAN'S FACE. The man SHRIEKS like a FIRE WHISTLE and
          CRASHES TO THE GROUND. The Guards DESCEND on Rorschach.
          Rorschach is calm as he's dragged away. As the injured man's
          screams fall away to weak, bubbling hitches, the room once
          again goes silent. Rorschach eyes the fearful, hateful eyes
          of the room, marking each one. And in the silence he speaks,
          his icy voice carrying easily.

          RORSCHACH
          None of you understand. I'm not locked up
          in here with you.
          Rorschach is placidly dragged off INTO DARKNESS

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          You're locked up in here with me.

          INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER -.EVENING

          CLOSE ON: THE NITE-OWL UNIFORM, staring its blank, empty
          stare. Laurie stares back, alone down here, fascinated with
          the costume, the gadgets, the whole place. She wanders to the
          OWL-SHIP, whose tarp has been pulled back. She runs her
          finger through the DUST caked on the windshield.

          INT. OWL-SHIP - EVENING

          Inside the ship, Laurie pulls open a HATCH filled with
          ALTERNATE COSTUMES; designed for underwater work, cold
          conditions, heavy armor. She puts a cigarette in her mouth.

          LAURIE
          All these gadgets and there isn't even a
          dash lighter
          She hits a BUTTON--the lights inside go DIM. Creepy. She hits
          the button again to turn the lights back on but nothing

          HAPPENS

          INT. DAN'S KITCHEN - EVENING

          Dan returns home with some TAKE OUT FOOD . . when he hears
          Laurie SCREAM downstairs.

          DAN
          Laurie?!
          Dan BOLTS for the basement door, thoughts of the mask-killer
          on his mind.

          INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - EVENING

          Dan descends the stairs and sees FIRE.

          DAN

          LAURIE!
          Dan grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          Where are you?!
          Dan SPRAYS the fire. Laurie stumbles from the smoke, out of
          the Owl-Ship. Dan's got the fire under control now.

          LAURIE
          I'm so sorry--I hit the wrong button. I
          was looking for the lighter in.there.

          DAN
          I don't smoke. Are you hurt?

          LAURIE
          I'm fine, but your ship--

          DAN
          Ah, that's mostly just soot. Archie's
          pretty resilient.

          LAURIE
          Archie?

          DAN

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Short for Archimedes--Merlin's owl. I'm
          just glad you're okay. I heard you scream
          and well, you know, after the Comedian--

          LAURIE
          Still with the mask-killer theory?
          Rorschach is insane.

          DAN
          Maybe, but the Comedian murdered; Jon
          exiled; Someone tries to shoot Adrian;
          Rorschach gets arrested. It makes me
          uneasy.

          73.

          CONTINUED:
          Dan goes to a BANK OF SWITCHES on the wall. Flicking them,
          the Owl-Chamber LIGHTS UP. Hidden FANS dissipate the smoke.

          LAURIE
          How did you ever afford all this?

          DAN
          My Dad was in corporate banking. He left
          me quite a bit. Which always surprised
          me.

          LAURIE
          How did he die?

          DAN
          Mugging. He was shot.
          As Dan cleans up, Laurie watches him, like she's seeing him
          for the first time.

          LAURIE
          You really do worry about me, don't you?

          DAN
          Huh? Well, yeah, of course I worry about
          you, I mean, we're, y'know, friends--
          Laurie takes off his glasses . and KISSES him. It's what
          Dan's been wanting all this time . but he pulls away.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          Sorry, I

          LAURIE
          What's wrong?
          But Dan is already walking up the stairs, pathetic. Laurie's
          left there, alone. The Owl-Costume looming in the background.

          INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

          Rorschach sits in his cell, staring impassively at the wall.

          BIG FIGURE (O.S.)
          It's been a long time, Rorschach.
          Rorschach turns to see TWO THUGS standing side by side, one
          muscle bound, the other very fat, staring at him through the
          bars. PAN DOWN: To reveal a MIDGET between them--the
          supervillain known as the BIG FIGURE--his silver hair combed
          neatly back, a big CIGAR perched in his tiny mouth.

          RORSCHACH
          Big Figure. Small world.

          BIG FIGURE
          (chuckles through smoke)
          I like that. But you know, it is a small
          world in here. I've been in it for--how
          long now, Billy?

          DUMB THUG
          Twenty years, Mr. Figure.

          BIG FIGURE
          That's right. Twenty years since you and
          that owl fella put me away. Rorschach--
          that guy you burned is dying. Could go
          any minute now. And when he does, this
          place is gonna explode. Then you die by
          inches.

          RORSCHACH
          Tall order.

          FAT THUG
          (SLAMS into the bars)
          I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole!

          BIG FIGURE
          Relax, Lloyd. Soon.
          Chuckling, Big Figure walks off down the long, shadowed
          corridor. Rorschach continues staring, straight ahead.

          INT. DAN'S NIGHTMARE - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON: Dan, naked, on his knees in the center of an
          INFINITE FIELD OF BLACKNESS. No corners, no exits. In the
          DISTANCE, he sees a FEMALE FORM. Desperate, he runs to her.
          It's Laurie, waiting for him IN COSTUME. They kiss. She tears
          at him passionately. His SKIN suddenly TEARS AWAY like
          wrapping paper. Beneath the false skin, Dan wears his NITE-
          OWL COSTUME. Confident, he touches her face. She smiles with
          palpable heat. They kiss.
          In the background, a NUCLEAR BLAST ERUPTS. Still kissing, the

          BLAST BLOWS THEM INTO TWO EMBRACING SKELETONS.

          INT. DAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dan wakes with a jolt, sweat beaded on his forehead

          

          

          

          

          75.

          INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - NIGHT

          The DOOR opens. Laurie stands in the SHAFT OF LIGHT.

          LAURIE
          Dan? Is everything okay? I heard you
          coming down the stairs
          Descending the stairs, she finds Dan before his costume,
          naked. He fiddles with an OWL-WING THROWING WEAPON.

          DAN
          Mask killers. War. Nuclear annihilation.
          I feel so powerless, so I've been
          afraid of this damn costume. Afraid of
          how much I need it.
          He FLINGS the owl wing crescent, whizzing into the dark.

          LAURIE
          So. Let's take the ship out.

          DAN
          What?

          LAURIE
          Who's to know? I used to be a "masked
          avenger" too, remember? I'm used to
          getting up at three in the morning to do
          something stupid. Besides, I'm already a
          wanted lady, you're already in trouble
          for hiding me, how much more trouble can
          we be in? Just give me a second--can't go
          out like this.
          She jogs upstairs. Dan turns to the empty, waiting suit.

          INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - LATER

          PAN UP: DAN'S COSTUMED BODY. The Nite Owl suit is fantastic,
          intricate, but above the belly . it just barely fits, Dan
          managing to CLICK it closed.

          DAN
          I can't believe it still fits. Luckily I
          constructed it with material that was
          elastic and--
          Dan turns as Laurie appears at the door, decked in her BLACK
          SPANDEX. SILK SPECTRE, looking every bit as good as seventeen-

          Dan turns and sees his reflection in the owl-Ship's window.

          DAN
          Me too.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          Laurie holds on as the Owl-Ship's ENGINES ROAR to life. The
          ship RISES INTO THE AIR and slips easily into the TUNNEL.
          Laurie watches the LIGHTS of the tunnel whiz by. At the end,
          two big STEEL DOORS open, allowing a passage UP.

          DAN
          Let's have some cloud cover.

          INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          THICK FOG POURS FROM LOWER-DECK JETS as the ship RISES into
          an ABANDONED WAREHOUSE, whose steel roof ROLLS BACK.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          Laurie touches the window, the SPARKLING CITY laid out below.

          LAURIE
          It's so beautiful

          DAN
          Hang on.
          Dan BANKS, wheeling the ship toward the VELDT BUILDING.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          Got to clean her up a bit. I'm sure
          Adrian wouldn't want to impede the course
          of justice.
          Heading straight for the building, Dan JIGS at the last
          moment, flying the ship THROUGH THE V-SHAPED WATERFALL in the
          skyscraper's center. The water washes clean the years of
          dust. The Owl-Ship emerges, sparkling like new.

          LAURIE
          Look!
          Below, a TENEMENT BUILDING is ENGULFED IN FLAME. Dan's jaw
          sets. He wheels the ship around and down. As they zoom
          closer, they can see people SCREAMING from the windows.

          lower stories.

          PLEASE REMAIN CALM. WE ARE SLOWING THE

          FIRE DOWN FROM BELOW. CALMLY MAKE YOUR

          WAY TO THE ROOF AND I'LL EXTEND A RAMP TO

          YOU.
          (to Laurie)
          Can you escort the people over?
          She watches him move, quick, confident. She smiles.

          LAURIE
          I'm on it. Nite Owl.

          EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          The ship EXTENDS AN ESCAPE RAMP with Laurie on board. The
          residents forget their fear of fire for a moment as they soak
          in the spectacle of this sexy lady on this Owl-Ship.

          LAURIE
          Hi. If you could all form a line, we'll
          have you out of here in just a moment.
          ATOP THE SHIP: Dan latches the steering column into its roof
          socket. He stands; Takes a deep, chest-expanding breath. Who
          has he been kidding? This is who he is. Flicking a switch OLD
          JAZZ plays pleasantly.

          INT. OWL-SHIP - NIGHT

          Below, the residents file on board, in a daze at their
          surroundings. Laurie grins at the music.

          LAURIE
          Anybody want coffee?

          EXT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          FIRE rising behind, Dan wings the ship STRAIGHT INTO FRAME.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          The Owl-Ship RISES, leaving a grateful CROWD behind. In the
          background FIRE TRUCKS are just arriving. A FIREFIGHTER looks
          up in time to see the Owl-Ship disappear into the clouds.

          

          

          

          

          78.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          Dan skims the clouds like a man waking from a dream.

          LAURIE
          I can't believe we did that! That was
          actually fun

          DAN
          Yeah.
          He puts a hand on her shoulder. His eyes locked onto hers. He
          knows what he wants and this time he's not afraid of it
          He kisses her. Hard. Running her hands up his cheeks, they
          slide each other's masks off. Their mouths melt together.

          INT. OWL-SHIP - LATER

          Soft music plays. Dan and Laurie lie in a heap of discarded
          costumes.

          LAURIE
          It was good, wasn't it?

          DAN
          Yeah, saving those people from the fire.
          Taking Archie out
          Laurie swats him on the chest--that's not what she meant. Dan
          grins, having fun with her.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          It--you were unbelievable.
          They kiss.

          LAURIE
          So . what do we do next?
          Dan sits up, serious. Very serious.

          DAN
          I've been thinking about that. And I
          believe we have certain obligations to
          our fraternity.

          (BEAT)
          I think we should spring Rorschach.

          EXT. OWL-SHIP - CONTINUOUS

          Long beat. The ship hovers, silent in the clouds.

          What?

          INT. PRISON MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT

          The Prisoner Rorschach burned lies in bed, his face
          completely bandaged, hooked to an IV . . when he FLATLINES.

          INT. RORSCHACH'S PRISON CELL - NIGHT

          Down the dark corridors, a ROAR is building. ALARMS ring. Big
          Figure and his two Thugs appear at the door.

          BIG FIGURE
          He's dead, Rorschach--the riot's already
          begun. While everyone's distracted, we
          thought we'd bring you a housewarming
          gift. Something from the machine shop.
          The Fat Thug wheels an ELECTRICAL WELDER to the door.
          Rorschach sits, idly TEARING his PRISON SHIRT into STRIPS.

          FAT THUG
          Hey Boss, y'notice? None of that "small
          world, tall order" crap, cuz he knows
          once we slice open this lock, he's next
          on the block.

          RORSCHACH
          Fat chance.
          The Fat Thug reddens. He DIVES forward, HANDS SWIPING for
          Rorschach.

          FAT THUG
          You're dead, Rorschach! We got a prison
          full of killers out here! What've you
          got?
          Rorschach SPINS, WRAPPING A SHIRT-STRIP AROUND HIS WRISTS,
          trapping the Fat Thug's hands inside the cell.

          RORSCHACH
          Your hands. My pleasure.
          Rorschach SNAPS Fat Thug's pinky fingers. Fat Thug SHRIEKS.
          Rorschach roughly binds the fingers around the bars.
          Dumb Thug tries to reach the welder around Fat Thug's body.

          DUMB THUG
          I can't reach the lock. Should I cut the
          bars?

          (CONTINUED)

          This riot won't last. And I've been
          waiting twenty years for this
          Big Figure nods to the Dumb Thug, who then grabs Fat Thug's
          neck.

          DUMB THUG
          Nothing personal, big guy.

          FAT THUG
          Boss, you can't be serious! Wait--
          Dumb Thug SNAPS Fat Thug's neck. He then CUTS OFF Fat Thug's
          hands with the welder, pushes the corpse out of the way to
          reach the lock. Big Figure grins at Rorschach.

          BIG FIGURE
          Now you find out what the score is.

          RORSCHACH
          One-nothing. Come and get me.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          Dan and Laurie are back in costume.

          LAURIE
          Look, Dan, I'm glad you were able to
          rediscover your calling in life, but I
          think you're getting carried away. You're
          talking about springing a homicidal
          psychopath from prison.

          DAN
          Rorschach may be sick, but I think he's
          on to something--four heroes attacked in
          a week is not a coincidence. I mean, that
          whole cancer thing with ion, does that
          make sense to you? You didn't contract
          cancer from him.
          He says as Laurie's about to light a cigarette. She changes
          her mind.

          LAURIE
          Why would someone want to drive ion away?
          Look what's happening now. With Jon gone
          it looks like we're headed for another
          World War. Who would want that?

          HELIPAD. On the helipad is a HELICOPTER with the Veidt
          Enterprises LOGO.

          DAN
          I don't know. But I know someone who
          might be able to help.
          Dan lands the Owl-Ship on the roof.

          INT. ADRIAN'S MANSION - NIGHT

          Surprisingly, Adrian is awake, packing his things, hustling
          about his grand mansion as Dan and Laurie trail.

          DAN
          You're leaving town? So you do believe
          Rorschach's theory.

          ADRIAN
          Please. Right now, I'm not concerned with
          this so-called mask-killer, I'm concerned
          with the mass killer called war, or have
          you not heard.
          (calling out)
          On !
          A WALL SIZED MIRROR turns into a TV:

          CNN NEWSCASTER
          --US Aircraft Carriers have already moved
          into the Persian Gulf and US Battleships
          have left Japan en route to the Far East

          THEATRE--

          LAURIE
          It's happening
          Dan breaks away from the terrible news, follows Adrian.

          DAN
          All the more reason we need to get to the
          bottom of this. Maybe we can get Jon to
          come back in the process and stop all
          this madness.

          ADRIAN
          Nothing we do will bring Jon back!
          (glances at Laurie)
          But I think you know that already. And
          breaking Rorschach out of prison
          certainly isn't the answer.

          CONTINUED:

          DAN
          Rorschach's been the only one
          investigating this from the start.
          Without him, we're starting at the
          beginning and we don't have that kind of
          time. We need your help, Adrian.

          ADRIAN
          I'm leaving, Dan. And I suggest you both
          do the same.
          Adrian pulls on a thick WINTER COAT and heads upstairs.

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT

          Adrian walks briskly to his idling COPTER, propellers loudly
          cutting through the air. Dan gives one last effort, shouting.

          DAN
          Where are you going to go?

          ADRIAN
          Antarctica.
          It takes Dan a moment to realize Adrian is serious. By then,
          Adrian's halfway into the helicopter.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          Good luck, Dan.
          He says it sincerely. Dan watches the helicopter fly off.

          INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

          Dumb Thug WELDS, the lock GLOWS RED. Nearly through.
          Rorschach backs away from the door as Big Figure trembles in
          excitement.

          BIG FIGURE
          Hurry Lloyd! I wanna smell this
          sonofabitch cooking!
          The lock MELTS AWAY. Rorschach climbs onto his bunk as Dumb
          Thug enters, JABBING the electric welder at him menacingly.
          Rorschach drives his HEEL into the porcelain TOILET BOWL,
          SHATTERING IT. WATER SPILLS across the floor. Rorschach KICKS
          Dumb Thug in the stomach; Dumb Thug buckles, then SLIPS in
          the water--Dumb Thug falls, welder still in hand as he hits
          the water
          Dumb Thug's hand FUSES to the welder as ELECTRICITY SURGES
          THROUGH HIM. He collapses, smoking. Dead.

          Hmm. Never disposed of sewage with a
          toilet before. Obvious, really.
          Big Figure looks very small and alone now

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          Two-nothing. Your move.
          Panic stricken, Big Figure moves, or rather, runs. Rorschach
          calmly follows him out of the cell.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          The Owl-Ship tears through the sky, the prison ahead on the
          horizon. Dan has his game face on; Laurie's still unsure.

          DAN
          You don't have to do this. I know the
          whole crimefighting thing wasn't
          necessarily your choice in life.

          LAURIE
          No. But this is.
          She moves next to him.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          But I'm not doing it for Rorschach or
          even for Jon. And I'm sure as hell not
          doing if for the Comedian.
          They look at each other--Dan knows who she's doing it for.
          The Owl-Ship is upon the prison now

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          Look!
          They see a RIOT below--Inmates spilling out into the yard,
          overwhelming the Correctional Officers on the ground; TOWER
          GUARDS take shots at some of the Inmates; Broken glass,
          broken furniture parts scattered through the yard; SMOKE
          emits from inside the prison.

          DAN
          Hmm, Rorschach gets locked up in here and
          suddenly there's a riot. I wonder if
          that's a coincidence.
          They descend toward the hell of TEAR-GAS, FIRE and VIOLENCE.
          The Tower Guards, stunned at the sight of the Owl-Ship, begin
          SHOOTING at it. The bullets bounce right off.

          LAURIE
          How are we going to find Rorschach in all
          of this?

          DAN
          When he and I were partners, we each had
          tracking implants put under our skin so
          old Archie here could find us if either
          one of us were ever in trouble. Let's see
          if Rorschach kept his in.
          Dan turns on the GPS monitor. There's a BLIP on the screen.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          He's in that wing.
          Dan steers the ship toward the Maximum Security Wing. 9

          EXT. PRISON - MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - CONTINUOUS

          The Owl-Ship stops to a hover position. The LOWER HATCH OPENS
          and a LADDER extends
          As Laurie descends the ladder, Dan simply, joyously LEAPS
          OUT, his wings SNAP WIDE to GLIDE him through the air.

          INT. PRISON HALLS - NIGHT

          Fires burn in the cells. Shotguns and screams echo in the
          emergency lighting. Archie's Owl-Shriek is dulled here--it's
          quiet. Tense.
          Laurie and Dan turn the corner, searching. Laurie spots the
          BODY of a DEAD GUARD. She crouches to take his PISTOL, slips
          it into her waistband.

          LAURIE
          How do we know he's still alive?
          They come upon Rorschach's cell. Dan sees the SMOKING CORPSE
          of Dumb Thug. Sees the CUT OFF HANDS of Fat Thug, HANGING
          from the bars.

          Rorschach sees this and walks serenely after him . when
          Dan and Laurie enter the far hall.

          LAURIE
          Is that--

          DAN
          Rorschach? Rorschach!

          RORSCHACH
          Hello, Daniel, Ms. Jupiter. Excuse me, I
          just have to visit the men's room.
          He disappears into the dark bathroom. Laurie watches after
          him in stunned disbelief.

          LAURIE
          Oh, for Christ's sake.

          DAN
          Hey, it happens. I remember I lost a big
          arrest like that once. Had to redesign
          the costume after that--
          Rorschach exits the bathroom, wiping his hands.

          RORSCHACH
          We can leave now.
          He walks off.

          LAURIE
          Are you sure you're ready? We don't want
          to go diving head-first into things.

          RORSCHACH
          Good Advice. I'm sure there are many
          who'd agree with you.
          Behind them: BLOODY WATER FLOODS from the bathroom door as
          they go.

          LAURIE
          I'm not.

          RORSCHACH
          Of course you haven't been attacked yet.
          Funny, most everyone else has.

          What's that supposed to mean? We came

          Hey! Survive now! Argue later! I had to
          turn the screechers off, so we'll be

          The owl-Ship rises to the roof. They all jump in.

          Dan weaves and whips the ship into the sky, above the clouds.
          Satisfied that they've escaped, Dan allows himself a grin. He

          Rorschach, you remember how to handle
          Archie?

          RORSCHACH
          I believe so.
          Rorschach sits in the pilot's seat. Dan turns to Laurie, high

          It `s him.
          The ship COLLIDES with Dr. Manhattan, who PASSES THROUGH into

          Hello Laurie.

          LAURIE
          They said you were on Mars.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I am on Mars. You and I are about to have
          a conversation there.

          LAURIE
          Where? What are you talking about?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          You are going to try to convince me to
          save the world.

          I have to go, Dan. Jon and I, we're going

          EXT. NEW YORK AIRSPACE - NIGHT

          TWO NYPD HELICOPTERS appear behind the Owl-Ship
          INSIDE THE OWL SHIP: Dan takes the controls.

          DAN
          Let's try and lose them in the city.
          He hits the jets, heading for the New York SKYLINE.

          EXT. MARS - NIGHT

          A red vista. Dr. Manhattan and Laurie appear atop a rise.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          So. What do you think?

          LAURIE
          J--huc? Hhhhhhh--
          Laurie GRIPS her throat and TUMBLES down the hill. She rolls
          into Jon, waiting for her at the bottom. She CLAWS at him.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Oh. Forgive me. These things sometimes
          slip my mind.
          He TOUCHES her mouth, forming a small ATMOSPHERE around her.
          She HEAVES in air, retching and choking at the same time.

          LAURIE
          Jon, you stupid bastard! Listen, you
          better not forget this air supply or
          whatever it is

          . just clearing it. The Owl-Ship SKIMS the sides of the
          tunnel, SPARKS flying--
          --when a SUBWAY appears. They're heading straight for it.

          DAN
          oh no.

          RORSCHACH
          Tactical error, Daniel.

          DAN

          They head straight for the subway--

          The Owl-Ship emerges from the subway tunnel . when one of
          the NYPD copters cuts it off.

          DAN
          Shit.
          Dan accelerates, weaving Archie around the skyscrapers, the
          Empire State Building . but the copter's still there.
          Dan cuts around the UNITED NATIONS BUILDING. The copter
          follows the Owl-Ship around to the East River
          . but the Owl-Ship is nowhere to be found
          The copter hovers there. Baffled.

          Hollis sits up in bed, TV on: CNN; Grainy, shaky CLIPS of the
          Owl-Ship. He's on the phone, beaming.

          HOLLIS
          It's just like old times, Sal. Nite Owl
          and Silk Spectre back at it again.
          CUT TO: Sally Jupiter on the other end in California,
          watching the same footage.

          SALLY
          I always knew Laurie had it in her. Sorry
          for waking you, Hollis.

          HOLLIS
          I may be retired from the costume, but my
          sleeping habits have never changed.
          There's a KNOCK at Hollis's door.

          HOLLIS (CONT'D)
          Who--there's someone at the door. It
          might be Dan and Laurie--they may need
          help. I better go.
          Hollis hangs up, heads to the door, excited. He opens the

          DOOR--
          --and the Gang Members PILE INTO HIM. The picture SLOWS DOWN.
          Hollis turns, mouth bleeding. HOLLIS' POV IS SEPIA TONED. The
          gang appears as a COLLECTION of VILLAINS in COSTUMES.
          SLOW, SEPIA: A young Hollis is in his old COSTUME. The VOICES
          come from the present, while Hollis is lost in the past.

          in reality, he gets nailed. This intercutting continues until
          the Gang Leader picks up the GOLD STATUE of Hollis in costume
          whose base reads: IN GRATITUDE

          GANG MEMBER 1
          Hold on, Derf, are you sure this is the

          Then I'm probably doing him a favor.

          stay down here? Daniel!
          Dan says nothing. Rorschach puts on his costume.

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          You're letting fear paralyze you. And
          that woman--

          DAN
          Hey! We took enough unnecessary risks
          bringing Archie up so you could get your
          spare costume. We stay put until it cools
          down out there--they're looking for us.

          RORSCHACH
          Unnecessary? Cowering in the sludge, from
          the authorities, that's unnecessary.
          Rorschach pulls his mask on, turns.

          forgotten how we do things. You've been

          DAN
          Listen, I HAVE HAD IT! Who the hell do
          you think you are? You live off people
          while insulting them, and no one
          complains because they think you're a
          goddamn lunatic!
          Dan turns away, shaking. He leans against the console.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

          You are a good friend. I'm sorry
          that it is sometimes difficult with me.
          Touched, Dan shakes his hand. An awkward, lovely moment.

          DAN
          Hey forget it It's okay, man.
          Releasing his hand with some effort, Dan sits, invigorated.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Not yet. But in a few moments, you're

          LAURIE
          Jon, I'm having enough problems right now
          without getting into your predestination
          crap.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Why does my perception of time distress
          you so?

          LAURIE
          Because. If you already know the future,
          why were you surprised when I left you,
          or when that reporter ambushed you? Why
          even debate if you already know the
          outcome?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Because everything is pre-ordained. Even
          my responses.

          LAURIE
          Agh! This is so typical of you! Do you
          know what a relief it is to be with
          somebody human, like Dan?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          You mean you're sleeping with Dan
          Dreiberg?
          Contemplating this, he steps to the balcony's edge.

          LAURIE
          But you already know . You said--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I said, often, that you were my only
          remaining link with the world. Now that
          link is shattered. Don't you see the
          futility of asking me to save a world

          Not to me. My red world here means more
          to me than your blue one. I'll show you

          paper trail.
          Rorschach investigates ahead when Dan catches some MOVEMENT--

          No I didn't watch that interview.
          This was the guy who was doing a story on

          Hmm. Journalist set up Dr. Manhattan, was
          probably working to set up Veidt also.
          Dan stands there thinking. As if hit with an epiphany. He
          opens his mouth like he can't believe what he's going to say.

          On the surface it doesn't, but hear me
          out--Adrian's the only one who could've
          taken on the Comedian in hand to hand
          combat. He's the only one with the
          finances to create an entire company for
          the sole purpose of setting up Dr.
          Manhattan. And Adrian was directly
          involved in arranging that broadcast. He
          probably supplied this journalist with
          the whole cancer list.

          RORSCHACH
          That doesn't explain the attempt on
          Veidt's life.

          DAN
          If we say that Adrian set that up
          himself, he could've had the hitman shoot

          By all means, Eric.

          HEAD SCIENTIST
          I just would like to say that when I was
          first offered this position, I was

          our work is finished, and we finally get
          to go home, I can say that it was all
          worth it. Mr. Veidt, you are a genius.
          The world will be a better place because
          of you.

          I certainly hope so.

          Oh god damn. Hollis. God damn god damn
          god damn
          Dan begins to break up. Rorschach quietly pulls him away.

          RORSCHACH
          Not now, Daniel.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING

          The Owl-Ship slows to a hover besides an OLDER BUILDING.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
          Rorschach's Journal. Final entry?
          Dreiberg is convinced that Veidt is
          behind everything. Apparently, the Owl-
          Ship is capable of the trip to
          Antarctica, but are we? I cannot imagine
          a more dangerous opponent. Veldt is
          faster than Dreiberg and myself. He used
          to joke that he was fast enough to catch
          a bullet. I believe he could. He could
          kill us both, alone in' the snow. No one
          would know.
          Rorschach descends the ladder, goes to the door of the
          building. He places his JOURNAL in an ENVELOPE.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I have done my best to make this legible.
          Whether I am alive or dead upon this
          reading, know that whatever the nature of
          this conspiracy--Adrian Veldt is
          responsible.
          He drops the envelope into the MAIL SLOT, climbs back up the
          ladder.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I appreciate your recent support and hope
          the world survives long enough for this
          to reach you. For my own part, I regret
          nothing. I have lived my life free of
          compromise, and step now into the shadow
          without complaint. Rorschach. October
          21st.

          CONTINUED:
          Rorschach disappears into the dark hatch. The Owl-Ship blasts
          off . disappearing, just as Seymour arrives. Seymour
          picks up the mail and walks inside.

          INT. THE NEW FRONTIERSMAN - EARLY MORNING

          The Editor walks in as Seymour goes through the mail.

          EDITOR
          SEYMOUR! Is that Dulmage's editorial
          cartoon?

          SEYMOUR
          It's the mail. Hey cool, someone sent us
          their journal.

          (READING)
          "Earlier today I came across what
          appeared to be a suicide. It was later
          learned to be a homicide. Someone's time
          was up."

          EDITOR
          War's coming, Seymour--I don't wanna hear
          some knob's life story! Chuck it in the
          crank file!
          Seymour tosses Rorschach's journal into a PILE OF LETTERS.

          EXT. GLASS PALACE - MARS - NIGHT

          Laurie's hair blows in the cold wind. She lowers her head.
          Jon serves her some WATER.

          LAURIE
          Can't you just tell me how this all ends
          and save us the trouble?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          It ends with you in tears.

          LAURIE
          Tears. You mean I lose? You don't come
          back to Earth?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I return to Earth at some point. The
          streets are filled with death.

          LAURIE
          You mean there's going to be a war? An
          actual, nuclear war?

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          100.

          CONTINUED:

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I can't be sure. I'm still experiencing
          some static interference preventing any
          clear vision of what lies ahead.

          LAURIE
          Static?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Tachyon particles. Tachyons are a rare
          occurrence. The detonation of nuclear
          warheads could conceivably be the cause.

          LAURIE
          Jon, you've got to stop it! Everyone will
          die!

          DR. MANHATTAN
          And the universe will not even notice.
          See the dual moons. Aren't they
          breathtaking?
          Above, TWO MOONS cross overhead. One is HUGE, CRIMSON RED,
          the smaller is a delicate SHELL PINK. Spectacular.

          LAURIE
          You're right, Jon--what does human life
          matter next to a, a neutrino. Look, I'm
          not going to debate you when you clearly
          don't see anything terribly miraculous
          about life. I guess quantum physics
          doesn't allow for miracles.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          No, thermodynamic miracles are--

          LAURIE
          Oh God, Jon. Land this thing. Now.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          On the Argyre Planitia? As you wish.
          The structure descends. Laurie stomps down the stairs.

          LAURIE
          That's it then. You can send me back to
          Earth to fry with Dan and my Mom and all
          the other worthless humans. And look, you
          were wrong. You said this ended with me
          in tears and see? Not a damp eye in the
          house. Maybe you're wrong about
          everything.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          101.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          Jon is waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Laurie. You complain that I refuse to see
          life on life's terms. And yet you
          continuously refuse to see things from my
          perspective. If only you'd try to see the
          whole continuum, life's pattern, you'd
          understand. But you deliberately shut it
          out as if afraid to see.

          LAURIE
          I'm not afraid, okay? You want me to see
          things your way? Go ahead, do that thing
          you do.
          She stands there, arms folded, waiting. Then, just like
          earlier in the lab, Jon touches her head--

          INT. JUPITER HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 25 YEARS AGO)

          Same flashback as before, in Laurie's childhood home. We're
          in Laurie's POV, as a little girl. There's arguing
          downstairs. Laurie goes down to investigate.
          She comes upon the kitchen door, ajar. She can see her
          PARENTS inside, arguing .

          SALLY
          You wanted to hear it, so I'm telling
          you, okay?. Magic! Dreams! That's what I
          had before. I was a hero goddammit!

          LAURIE'S FATHER
          It's not my fault you got old! What do
          you have to complain about?! I'm putting
          food on the table for you and your child.
          Why don't you give your friend Eddie a
          call? Maybe he can give you a better
          life!

          SALLY
          It was a mistake--one time! Am I never--
          And then they notice Laurie looking at them.

          LAURIE
          Mommy?

          SALLY
          Oh. Oh, Laurie

          102.

          CONTINUED:
          Tears run down little Laurie's face. Her parents are

          HORRIFIED--

          INT. GLASS PALACE - MARS - NIGHT

          --Laurie breaks away from ion and drops down to her knees,
          tears flowing.

          LAURIE
          No. No, no, no, no not him

          DR. MANHATTAN
          The comedian was your father.

          LAURIE
          But he--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Attacked your mother. Yes.
          (searching in his mind)
          Two years later he came back to her, to
          make amends. And you were conceived on
          that day.

          LAURIE

          NO!!I
          Laurie WHIPS a BOTTLE at the palace--
          --and the huge glass construction CRUMBLES. Jon protects them
          with a FORCE FIELD as debris collapses around them. Laurie
          sobs in the echoing SILENCE.
          Jon's eyes SHUT. He seems to feel . empathy. A TEAR slips
          down his cheek. Laurie's realization is a revelation for ion.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          The comedian is my father. I guess my
          life is just one big joke.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I don't think your life is a joke.

          LAURIE
          Well, of course you're going to say that.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          But I've changed my mind. There are
          miracles in your world that are worth
          preserving.

          LAURIE
          What? But you were saying--

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          103.

          CONTINUED:

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I tried to explain. Thermodynamic
          miracles--events with odds against so
          astronomical, like oxygen turning into
          gold. I have longed to witness such a
          thing and yet I neglect that in human
          coupling, millions upon millions of cells
          compete to create life over generation
          after generation: Until finally, your
          mother loves a man--Edward Blake, the
          Comedian--a man she has every reason to
          hate. And out of that contradiction,
          against unfathomable odds, it was you,
          only you, that emerged. To distill so
          specific a form from all of that chaos;
          Your creation is like . turning air
          into gold. A miracle.

          LAURIE
          But if my birth is a miracle you, you
          could say that about anyone.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Yes, anyone in the world. But the world
          is so crowded with miracles that they
          become commonplace and we forget. I
          forget.
          They stand there in silence. Connected for the first time in
          years.

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          Now. Dry your eyes.
          FROM ABOVE: We see the full CRATER--the ARGYRE PLANITIA.
          Round, with two, eye-like BOULDERS set side by side, a RIDGE
          of land curling below . like a smiley-face.

          DR. MANHATTAN (V.0.)(CONT'D)
          And let's go home.

          EXT. ANTARCTICA - DAWN

          The owl-Ship sails through a TOWERING CLOUD BANK. The COAST
          approaches as SNOW starts to fall.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - DAWN

          Dan stares ahead, stoic. Thinking about Hollis, Laurie and
          Adrian. He glances at a MONITOR, tracking heat signatures.
          There's a LARGE SIGNAL ahead.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          104.

          CONTINUED:

          DAN
          I've got a large reading ahead. Anything
          that's emitting that much heat out here,
          must be a pretty big facility. Adrian.

          (BEAT)
          We're not going to make it, are we?
          Rorschach says nothing . when a halting WHINE sputters
          from the engines. A HUGE CLIFF APPEARS before them.

          RORSCHACH
          The engines--

          DAN
          They're icing up, hold on!
          Dan pulls the stick back. The ship SHUDDERS UPWARD.

          EXT. ANTARCTICA - DAWN

          The ship, tiny before the massive ice-wall, climbs slowly.
          It's going to be close. The wall is 100 yards away now, the
          top-most edge barely in view. 50 yards. 20 and then

          SILENCE--

          DAN
          We just lost the engines--find something
          to grab on to!
          The ship BARELY CLEARS THE CLIFF. BOUNCING hard, it SKIPS
          across the snow like a stone, finally CRASHING INTO A DRIFT.

          INT. OWL-SHIP - DAWN

          Dan opens the hatch. Shrieking WIND blows the snow in. Dan
          pulls on a white, FUR-LINED SNOW-OWL costume.

          DAN
          The engines are de-icing. You sure I
          can't fit you with something warmer?

          RORSCHACH
          Fine like this.

          EXT. OWL-SHIP - DAWN

          Rorschach pulls up his trench-collar against the bitter wind.
          Dan pulls two stand-up HOVER-SCOOTERS from an OUTSIDE HATCH.
          They exchange a look and ride the scooters off into the snow.

          

          

          

          

          105.

          INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - DAWN

          Adrian, dressed in his Ozymandias costume, sits alone in the
          massive hall, opposite a wall of giant PLASMA-SCREENS which
          show various television NEWS CHANNELS showing all the IMAGES

          OF WAR IN THE WORLD.
          Adrian sighs and hits the remote--the screens become ONE
          IMAGE--ALEXANDER THE GREAT slicing the Gordian Knot.
          By Adrian's feet is an exotic LYNX. Its unnatural beauty
          almost hides a feral danger in its eyes. Adrian pets the
          beast.

          ADRIAN
          See this painting? Alexander the Great.
          Before his conquest of Phoenicia, he
          struck North for Gordium, where the
          world's greatest puzzle waited. A great
          knot, impossible to untie. For a young
          man determined to rule the world, it was
          a challenge he couldn't resist. So he
          sliced it in two with his sword. Lateral
          thinking, you see.
          Suddenly the Lynx stands, GROWLS.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          What is it, girl?
          He hits the remote--the TV screens switch to MULTIPLE VIEWS
          OF Dan and Rorschach, heading toward Karnak.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          Ah. It's all right, girl. Everything's
          all right.

          EXT. ANTARCTICA - SNOWFIELDS - DAWN

          Flying on the scooter, Dan wipes frost and fog from his
          goggles. He then looks up and--
          --sees KARNAK, a GARGANTUAN GLASS PYRAMID, rising out of the
          snow, the Bio-Dome attached to it.

          INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - DAWN

          Adrian watches Dan and Rorschach reach the door on the
          monitors.

          CONTINUED:

          ADRIAN
          Really, getting even this far is an
          admirable effort, given their
          limitations. Of course the ice they're
          skating on is slippery and thinner than
          it looks. Let's hope they don't overstep
          themselves.
          On the monitors, Dan takes a LASER TORCH to the door.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          Let's hope they know when to stop.

          INT. KARNAK - DAWN

          Having burnt through the control panel, Dan pushes the huge
          door open. They enter the grand palace, dwarfed by its
          Macedonian massiveness.

          DAN

          JESUS

          (BEAT)
          I don't understand any of this. Adrian's
          a pacifist. He's never killed anyone in
          his life. He's a vegetarian for Christ's
          sake!

          RORSCHACH
          Hitler was a vegetarian. If you're
          squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get
          a second chance.

          INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - DAWN

          Dan and Rorschach pass the wall of plasma screens into--

          INT. DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS

          --the dining hall, where Adrian eats alone, at a long table.
          Though they're only a few yards away, Adrian doesn't appear
          to see them, hidden by some PILLARS.
          Dan and Rorschach signal to each other, quiet. Adrian eats--
          --and Rorschach RUSHES him from behind--
          --Adrian moves at the last second, grabs Rorschach's arm,
          ELBOWS him in the chest, spins and BACKHAND FISTS him,
          sending him flying back.

          ADRIAN
          Mind your manners.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          Dan draws his PEN-LASER.

          DAN
          Adrian, don't make me--
          Adrian picks up a GOLDEN SERVING TRAY off the table as Dan
          FIRES. Adrian DEFLECTS the laser with the tray--
          --then DISCUS-SLINGS the tray into Dan's NOSE. Blood SPRAYS,
          Dan drops to his knees. Adrian turns his back on them, calm.

          ADRIAN
          Now. What can I do for you?

          DAN
          You know! You killed the Comedian! You
          set up Rorschach! You created Pyramid
          Industries, hired all those people, gave
          them cancer and blamed it on Jon!

          ADRIAN
          Yes.

          DAN
          Dammit Adrian, what are you trying to do?

          ADRIAN
          What we always intended--to improve the
          world.
          As Adrian speaks, Rorschach sneaks up behind him, with a
          FORK. He tries to stab Adrian in the back, but Adrian
          effortlessly dodges the blow, GRABS Rorschach's mask, TWISTS
          it, then KNEES him in the gut. Rorschach drops to the floor.
          Adrian starts walking out of the hall. Dan helps Rorschach up
          and they follow.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          I never intended to kill the Comedian--
          that was an accident. Part of his duties
          as a government operative was to keep
          track of all former masked heroes, make
          sure there was no rocking of the boat. He
          must have liked Rorschach because he
          allowed him to continue to exist. I had
          thought that the Comedian might be
          incompetent, but he disproved that
          hypothesis when he discovered what was
          really going on. here in Karnak--no easy
          task. Even my staff was unaware--I made
          sure to keep each department separate.

          The Comedian was appalled by my plan, but
          still, he understood the scope of what I
          was trying to accomplish. Frankly, I
          never thought he'd actually talk. But by
          the time he visited poor Moloch, he was
          cracking badly. So I had to kill him.

          INT. CONTROL HALL - CONTINUOUS

          As they enter the control hall, Rorschach moves to attack
          Adrian again when he and Dan hear a growl . the Lynx
          steps in between, protecting its master.

          ADRIAN
          After Blake, I neutralized Jon--a plan
          nearly a decade in the works after
          analyzing confidential psychological
          profiles which predicted his withdrawal
          from human existence. By then,
          Rorschach's mask theory, 'though
          erroneous, needed to be addressed, so I
          faked my own assassination--

          DAN
          Why take that risk? What if the hitman
          shot you first instead of your assistant?

          ADRIAN
          I suppose I'd have to be fast enough to
          catch the bullet then, wouldn't I?
          Adrian smiles enigmatically.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          After apprehending my own assassin, I
          shoved a cyanide capsule in his mouth,
          disposing of him, and soon after that,
          the journalist Doug Roth, tying up all
          the loose ends if you will. Then I knew
          nothing stood in the way of my triumph.

          DAN
          Triumph? Adrian, what are you going to
          do?

          ADRIAN
          I'm firing a beam of concentrated energy,
          synthesized from Dr. Manhattan himself,
          into the hearts of nine key regions
          around the globe, crossing all
          traditional politics and ideologies;

          people.

          DAN
          Three million people? You're joking.

          RORSCHACH
          He's not. Listen to his voice.

          DAN
          Rorschach, he's making it up!

          ADRIAN
          I understand your disbelief, Dan. When I
          began the plan ten years ago, my moral
          safeguards gave me pause at the necessary
          sacrifice. See, the Comedian was correct.
          What we were doing with the Watchmen was
          pointless--the savage nature of humankind
          would inevitably lead to the end of the
          world. So in order to save the world, I
          had to trick it--to frighten the world
          towards salvation with history's greatest
          practical joke.

          DAN
          By killing millions of people? And when
          were you planning on doing this?

          ADRIAN
          When? Dan, my dear friend, I am the
          smartest man in the world--do you
          seriously think I'd explain my master
          stroke if there remained even the
          slightest chance of you affecting it's
          outcome?

          A BEAM of BLUE ENERGY SHOOTS INTO THE SKY from Karnak. The

          LIQUID FIRE, FLOODING THROUGH THE STREETS.

          The smoke-filled street is silent. Then GLOWING PARTICLES
          COALESCE, slamming together to form Jon and Laurie, but Jon's
          teleportation falters, shorting out. They FALL from the air.
          Laurie drops roughly to her knees.

          LAURIE
          God Jon, what was that?
          Jon looks around the street. Even he is awe-struck.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Interference. Cataclysmic interference.
          Laurie looks up and screams. THOUSANDS OF BLACK SILHOUETTES
          are IMPRINTED on the STREET and the WALLS. Everywhere. There
          is no rubble--some buildings have simply disintegrated.

          LAURIE
          Was it a war? It doesn't seem like--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Not a war. I .don't know what it was.
          Dr. Manhattan looks up into the sky, studying it.

          LAURIE
          Take me out of here, Jon. Please.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I'm sorry. This must be very upsetting
          for you. I have traced the source of the
          Tachyon particles to Antarctica. Shall

          CONTROL PANEL. He takes one last look at his Lynx.

          ADRIAN
          Forgive me, girl.
          Jon enters the corridor with the Lynx; Adrian flicks a
          SWITCH. The Lynx' FUR STANDS ON END as ENERGY CRACKLES

          LIGHT BLASTS through Jon and the Lynx--both are OBLITERATED.

          I AM DISAPPOINTED IN YOU ADRIAN. VERY

          DISAPPOINTED.
          Jon, now 100 FEET TALL, SMASHES THROUGH THE WALL. Adrian
          crawls desperately away, grasping for his remote on the
          floor. As Jon approaches him, Jon SHRINKS to six feet.

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          Restructuring myself was the first trick
          I learned! It didn't kill me before, did
          you seriously think it would kill me now?
          You are nothing but a man. And the
          world's smartest man means no more to me
          than its smartest termite!
          Out of tricks, out of traps, Adrian lifts the remote.

          What is that, Adrian? Some new, ultimate
          weapon?

          ADRIAN
          Yes. Yes, you could say that.
          Adrian goes back to his wall of screens, watching the news
          reports. We hear SOUND BITES and IMAGES: "India and Pakistan
          immediately call for truce," "China stands down," "US
          withdraws forces," "Israel agrees on cease fire."
          TEARS stand in Adrian's eyes. He raises his fists in triumph.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          I did it. I DID IT! I've saved Earth from
          Hell. Next, I will elevate her to the

          you're in checkmate, just like the
          Comedian was.
          Jon examines the many screens, taking it all in.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I'm afraid he's correct. Exposing Adrian
          would only doom the world to nuclear
          destruction again.

          DAN
          He's right. All we did was fail to stop
          him from saving Earth.

          ?

          Rorschach walks toward the exit.

          Rorschach, wait a second! Let's talk this
          out!

          RORSCHACH
          Never. Not even in the face of
          Armageddon. Never compromise.
          Adrian and Jon's eyes meet--an unspoken communication. Seeing
          this, Dan runs after Rorschach.

          Rorschach!
          Across the hall, ion materializes between Rorschach and the
          exit.

          removes his mask, tears stand in his eyes.

          RORSCHACH
          Suddenly you've rediscovered humanity? If
          you had cared from the start, none of
          this would be necessary. None of this
          would have happened. So what are you

          NO WAIT!

          RORSCHACH

          DO IT!!!!
          Jon WAVES HIS HAND and BLOWS RORSCHACH APART. Dan collapses
          to his knees, sobbing. Jon contemplates the BURN-MARK where
          Rorschach stood only seconds ago, then disappears--
          --reappearing across the hall where Laurie is. She is also in
          tears, watching all the horrible footage on the TV screens.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Laurie. I'm leaving this galaxy. For one
          a little less complicated.

          LAURIE
          Leaving? I, I thought you regained an
          interest in human life.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I have. I think maybe I'll create some.
          Goodbye, Laurie.
          He kisses her on the cheek--

          ADRIAN
          Jon, I'd hoped to talk to you. I've made
          myself feel every death, see every
          innocent face I've murdered to save
          humanity--you understand, don't you?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Without condoning or condemning, I

          Across the hall, Dan recovers from mourning Rorschach. He
          stands, gritting his teeth. Walks toward Adrian.

          ADRIAN
          What's on your mind, Dan?

          DAN
          Your death.

          ADRIAN
          Really. You want to kill me?

          DAN
          Yeah. You might have created peace, but
          not at the expense of justice. You need
          to pay for what you've done.

          ADRIAN
          That doesn't sound like you, Dan. That
          sounds more like Rorschach.

          DAN
          Exactly.
          Adrian readies himself. Laurie breaks away from the TV
          screens.

          ADRIAN
          Only you're not Rorschach, are you now?
          How do you expect to succeed where he
          failed?

          DAN
          Tell you the truth, Adrian. I don't.
          Dan FLIES at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life.
          His fighting style has changed. Dan's newfound brutality is
          informed by everything he's learned from Rorschach. About
          justice. About life.
          But Adrian is the best. He takes Dan's attacks apart with
          ease, delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so
          focused on his goal. In the end, he CATCHES Dan's final
          strike and TWISTS. Dan's arm SNAPS easily.

          LAURIE
          Dan!
          Laurie charges Adrian. With one hand, Adrian blocks her
          attack, grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her to floor,
          knocking her out.

          119.

          CONTINUED: (4)
          Dan falls to his knees, bloody and beaten. Out of tricks, out
          of time, he searches his belt for something, anything, and
          finds one last OWL-WING. The WINGS SNAP OUT. Desperate, he

          FLICKS IT AT ADRIAN--
          Who merely SNATCHES the owl-Wing out of the air. He laughs.
          Prepares to finish Dan off.

          ADRIAN
          I have to say, I've always thought your
          choice of an owl was quite juvenile.

          DAN
          Really? I've always liked owls
          Adrian sees that Dan has pulled one last item from his belt.
          Adrian STEPS on Dan's WRIST, bones crunching. Dan's HAND
          falls OPEN, revealing the OWL-SHIP REMOTE.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          because you can never hear them
          coming.
          BEHIND ADRIAN: FLOODLIGHTS BLAZE, targeting Adrian as the OWL-
          SHIP CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and into Adrian and Dan.
          Silence, but for the tinkling of GLASS falling to the floor.
          Dan tries to stand, but he falls, his left leg shattered.
          Most of Adrian has been CRUSHED under the ship. He coughs a
          fine blood spray. Adrian looks over to Dan, dying.

          ADRIAN
          I . don't regret my actions. I know
          in my heart . I did the right thing.

          DAN
          So do I.
          Adrian lays back, calm, accepting and dies.

          INT. OWL-SHIP - MORNING

          Dan sits painfully in the passenger seat, as Laurie tries to
          pilot the ship out of Adrian's bedroom.

          DAN
          That's it. Careful. Now, pull the stick
          to the left
          The ship RISES and TURNS awkwardly in the hall, smashing out
          more glass.

          Now, the thrusters . There.
          She HITS THE THRUSTERS. The ship FLIES from the control room.
          It's afterburners IGNITING the room, and Adrian's body.

          EXT. ANTARCTICA - MORNING

          The Owl-Ship RISES into the sky, the Pyramid of Karnak
          BLAZING from it's tip like a Roman candle. Dan watches out
          the window, until his eyes slip shut

          EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MORNING (SOME TIME LATER)

          Time has passed. The disintegrated buildings are being
          rebuilt. The shock of the attack is wearing off, and though
          the streets may not be as crowded as they once were, a sense
          of normalcy is returning.
          Sally Jupiter walks the sidewalk, looking for an address.

          INT. DAN AND LAURIE'S TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

          Sally mixes herself a tall drink at the bar. Sally calls out:

          SALLY
          You sure you don't want a drink?

          LAURIE (O.S.)
          I'm okay. Thanks.
          We finally see Laurie now--her hair dyed, appearance changed.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          Mom--I just want to get this out of the
          way . . I know Eddie Blake, the
          Comedian--I know he was my father.
          Sally freezes.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          I remember.
          Sally downs her drink, immediately starts making another.

          SALLY
          It, it was years later, he stopped by out
          of the blue, and, and apologized. I don't
          know, I just couldn't stay mad. It
          just happened--
          Laurie kisses her mother's teary cheek.

          CONTINUED:

          LAURIE
          Mom. People's lives take them strange
          places. You never did anything wrong by
          me.
          Sally jumps as a CLICK/WHIR SOUND comes from a BOOKCASE.

          SALLY
          What the hell is that?

          LAURIE
          Oh that's Dan. Home from "work."
          The bookcase SLIDES ASIDE and a blond DAN enters from the
          secret ELEVATOR. He is trim and confident, cheeks flushed
          with color. Buttoning up his shirt, he spots Sally.

          DAN
          Oh hi.

          SALLY
          Hello, Dan. Excuse me, I should clean up.
          Sally wipes her runny make-up, goes to the bathroom.
          Dan and Laurie embrace, kiss.

          LAURIE
          Any bad guys last night?

          DAN
          There are always bad guys. Even in
          today's world.
          Slow, Laurie turns to the window. Looks out at the New York
          skyline being rebuilt.

          LAURIE
          Dan.

          DAN
          Hmm?

          LAURIE
          Will it be alright? The world, I mean.
          He puts his arm around her shoulder.

          DAN
          As long as no-one ever finds out that
          Adrian was behind it all, the public will
          think ion is still up there, watching.

          The threat remains, and everything should

          LAURIE
          Yeah. Just fine

          INT. THE NEW FRONTIERSMAN - DAY

          CLOSE ON: A YELLOW HAPPY FACE--suddenly SPLOTCHED with RED--
          printed on A T-SHIRT now stained with ketchup.
          WE PULL BACK: And find Seymour wears the shirt, eating a
          burger when the Editor bursts in.

          EDITOR
          SEYMOUR! What the hell do you got for me?

          SEYMOUR

          UH

          EDITOR
          We got nothing to write about. Everyone
          in the country, every country in the
          world is holding hands now, singing songs
          about peace and love--it's like we're
          living in a goddamn global hippie
          commune !

          SEYMOUR
          Um, I guess I can look for stuff in the
          crank file.

          EDITOR
          Crank file? Whatever! Take some
          initiative! Run whatever you like--
          Seymour turns to the PILE of submissions known as the crank
          file, where RORSCHACH'S JOURNAL sits on top. Seymour reaches--

          EDITOR (CONT'D)
          --I leave it entirely in your hands.
          --and picks up Rorschach's Journal . Just as he's about
          to open it, we CUT TO BLACK.

          Forty-six countries have competing claims and maintain
          outposts. The Antarctic Treaty holds these claims in

          Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white
          wasteland. No buildings, no animals... nothing.
          
          CLOSER: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged
          peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist'
          of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting
          ice.
          
          STILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt
          crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat

          beauty, then...

          A FACE, hooded and goggled in ECW (extreme cold weather

          with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops
          out --
          
          -- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death.
          It's a man.
          
          Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have
          snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted
          -- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and
          spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with
          startling speed, it turns dark and freezes.
          
          We PULL BACK further and look down on the body, a bizarre
          shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE
          PULL BACK... further and further...until all is dazzling
          white.

          shadow of a palm tree cascading over top.
          
          Widen slightly -- a pair of feminine hands, donning an
          ANTIQUE SILVER ring on the left middle finger, are slowly
          applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm, athletic
          calves. Deep. Soothing. Then --

          Widen to meet CARRIE STETKO, late 20's. Cargo pants --
          rolled up, and an exercise top. She's kicking back, but
          she's not at the beach.
          
          In fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. A NEWLY
          OPEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub she's
          got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels
          above her, blasting her with warm wattage. A fake palm
          tree casts the shadow across her body. She's pulled the
          earplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world.
          
          The door opens. Leaning into the room is JAMIE CLARK
          (20's), African-American. She's dressed in a flannel
          shirt, jeans. Carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the
          intrusion.
          
                                     JAMIE

          Jamie leaves.
          
          As Carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her,

          unmarked. Last space reads: WINTER-OVER, and in the
          space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical
          beach.
          
          A dart board is next to it with A PHOTOGRAPH pulverized

          next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with

          He indicates with a nod to a bench covered with tall
          grass samples across the room. PROFESSOR SAPPERSTEIN,
          young, thin and bearded, is studying them.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       Okay, thanks.
          
          She crosses to him --

          He looks at her --
          
                                        SAPPERSTEIN
                       Yeah.

                       Wanted to see me?
          
          His face tenses -- this is serious.
          
                                        SAPPERSTEIN
                       -- Follow me.
          
          He leads her to a bench in the corner on which stands a
          GLASS HERBARIUM containing only STALKS and a few HEAT
          LAMPS. One of the GLASS PANELS has been smashed.

                    It was just budding, too.
          
          He sends an evil glare across the room to four glassy-
          eyed scientists sitting around a desk, munching on potato
          chips, candy bars, and drinking beer. Stifling laughter.

          Carrie looks back to him -- can barely stifle a laugh.

                    Professor Sapperstein, I'd like
                    you to read something for me.
          
          She pulls out a small LEATHER FOLD chained around her
          neck. Opens it up. Puts it in front of his face.

          He actually ponders the question for a moment. Carrie
          puts an arm around his bony shoulder and steers him away
          from the others.

          INT.   MARSHAL'S OFFICE - MCMURDO - DAY
          
          Carrie enters. Walks by a mirror. Takes a glance. Is
          about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection --
          what's the point? We notice a slight scar on her right
          temple.
          
          She steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is
          bare except for a thick BINDER labelled,`DAILY REPORTS'.
          
          She takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of
          empty pages reading "INCIDENT: None. ACTION TAKEN:
          None." On today's page she fills in the blanks with
          "Theft of botany sample." And "None."
          
          A pencil falls down onto the desk before her. Bounces.
          Then rolls off. She doesn't even flinch, or look up.
          Just stares unhappily at the binder.
          
          Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the
          cardboard tiles.
          
          She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a
          row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform
          graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. She and two other
          girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday
          cake in front of her. Carrie on a beach somewhere,
          sitting in a chair, feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm.

          She turns to see SAM MURPHY, base commander, the guy on
          the DART BOARD. There's an awkward beat.

          He sees the photo on the dart board -- saunters over to
          it.

                       out there? That's no man's land.
          
          He takes a closer look at the photo -- almost seems
          amused.
          
                                     MURPHY

          Ice as far as the eye can see. In the background is the
          base. It's much smaller than McMurdo - a few dozen
          specialist buildings surrounding four circular buildings
          raised on hydraulic stands, interconnected by tubular
          shaped walkways.
          
          Off in the distance -- A SNOWCAT mounted with a plow,
          pushes small drifts of snow off the runway onto a LARGE
          BERM. It's been busy -- SEVERAL OTHER BERMS flank both
          sides of the runway.
          
          Camera pans to Carrie with a gear bag in tow, as she
          deplanes a LC-130. A HALF-DOMED HANGAR rises up on the
          other side of the plane.
          
          The main ASB complex is before her.
          
          Across the top of the entrance is a huge poster: 3 DAYS
          TO WINTER-OVER EVAC. Piles of packed equipment are
          everywhere.
          
          Half a dozen NAKED MEN wearing only boots and face masks
          blow out the front door screaming and yelling, run around
          the South Pole, right past her, and back into ASB.

          Music cranks. Carrie knows her way. People come and go
          as she strides along a corridor decorated with PARTY
          BALLOONS and signs that read: `DON'T FORGET THE EVE OF
          EVAC PARTY' -- comes to an office door with a small
          plaque on it that reads: MARSHAL. Pushes it open.
          
          
          INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - ASB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie enters. It's smaller than her McMurdo office with
          a HOLDING ROOM that has a viewing window in the door. A
          fine layer of dust blankets a little desk with a computer
          and lamp on top.
          
          A map of Antarctica is spread across a wall with sub-
          station positions marked in block letters. A window
          gives view to the South Pole.
          
          
          INT. SMALL ROOM - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie opens the door. Single bed. Tiny dresser. No
          frills. She tosses her gear bag onto the bed. Closes
          the door.
          
          
          INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - ASB - DAY
          
          Carrie pokes her head in. An examination table, cabinets
          with drugs and first aid equipment. A couple of hospital
          beds. Moving boxes are packed up.

          Another door in the back of the room is open, but the

          outside, Aussie RUSSELL KELLER (late 20's) coming down
          the corridor. He's naked, except for a towel wrapped
          around his waste. Sports a goatee. Couple tats.
          Flashes a cocky smile.

          A large room by base standards. Several windows. A
          giant map of ANTARCTICA dominates one wall with the
          International stations and research outposts flagged with
          pins that have their countries flags on them.   A grid of
          EVAC TIMES of each STATION and OUTPOST is next to it. A
          Tech is changing a few.
          
          Another TECH sits as a console, lined with comm equipment

          Talking into a headset is the Station Manager, RHONDA

                    then clear the exterior storage

          The plane soars through a cloudless sky, the sun
          sparkling brilliantly on the endless ice sheet below.
          
          Carrie's in the copilot's seat, wrapped up tight in her
          ECW, just trying to stay warm. Delfy's at the controls.
          Doc's in the back.

                    I went to evac a camp. Had to fly
                    off route to get around a storm.
                    Got down low to avoid some
                    turbulence, and there it was.
          
          Carrie notices a picture of a young boy, around seven,
          wearing a Yankees cap dangling from the instrument panel.
          It's framed in popsicle sticks with I LOVE YOU DADDY
          written around the perimeter.

          Delfy tips the nose of the plane down. The ice below is
          broken by jagged hills and yawning crevasses.

          He spirals down among the icy hills, visibility is poor.
          Heavy turbulence suddenly jars the plane sideways --
          Delfy laughs at Doc's nervous reaction.

                       the radio going on and on about
                       the Serengeti heat and his wife,

          The CORPSE is just ahead -- a frozen display of death.
          
          They all stare at it - the body in unnatural angles, the
          spiderweb of frozen blood. Delfy looks nauseous.

          Just as they pass OPERATIONS, Rhonda steps out with the
          Brazilian and French Newbies at her side to see what's
          going on. Her eyes immediately go to Weiss, then shift
          to meet Carrie's. Before she can say anything --

                       Who manages the Post Stations?

                       Dinkle.   Howard Dinkle.
          
          Doc and Carrie keep moving. Everyone else just keeps
          silent and watching. Squeaky wheel fades.

          She moves over to a sink and gets a cup of steaming hot
          water from a tap.

          Carrie returns with the water.   Goes to pour it on the
          zipper, but Doc gently puts his hand on hers, stopping
          her.

          They share a moment, Carrie understanding, but --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Nobody wants to get out of here
                       more than I do, trust me, but
                       right now -- we're all this guy
                       has.
          
          She slides her hand away from his -- starts pouring the
          water on the zipper.

          Little by little, it starts to move -- then finally,
          ZIIIIIIIIIIP. The jacket opens up, barely -- like sliced
          skin.
          
          Doc watches as she tries to pry it open further, but
          can't.

                       Grab that side.
          
          She takes one half, he the other, and begin to pull. The
          jacket opens up, like bending metal -- slowly revealing a
          frozen, but extremely bloodsoaked chest area surrounding
          A DEEP PUNCTURE WOUND through the shirt.
          
          Doc's face sags.    Carrie stares at the wound.

          leaning against the wall, this whole thing wearing on her
          more than she's revealed. She tilts her head back. The
          second it hits the wall --

          O.C. MOANING and GROANING -- great sex. Carrie rolls her

          the Techs who is sitting before a computer screen
          displaying Satellite Weather Imagery -- think Doppler.
          His focus is on a VAST STORM SYSTEM that is heading
          toward ASB, which is marked in RED NEON. Other stations
          are marked as well.

          the door.
          
                                     DELFY
                       Gettin' worse. Minus eighty-one.
                       Wind at a hundred and ten knots.
          
          He takes a sip from his hot coffee.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Do you have to do that in front of
                       me?
          
          He sees that one of her leg straps on her harness needs
          to be fastened.
          
                                     DELFY
                       Give you a hand?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Sure.
          
          Sets down his coffee on a nearby shelf. As he fastens
          it, Carrie pulls on her goggles and a face mask. They
          finish at the same time.

                       Ever been on a rope-line in a
                       whiteout?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Nope. Thoughts?
          
                                     DELFY
                       Yeah, hold on tight.
          
          Delfy leaves as Carrie cranks the submarine-type wheel-
          lock in the center of the door.
          
          WHAM! The door is suddenly yanked from her grasp,
          slamming open against the building. Wind knocks her
          back.
          
          The storm sings in an even DULL ROAR. A solid white wall
          of wind-driven ice blows past. The light is oddly dim.
          
          CRACK! The coffee mug Delfy left on the shelf, breaks in
          half, exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee. It rolls
          across the shelf, falls, and shatters on the floor.
          
          Carrie struggles back to the door and clips a three-foot
          tether from her harnesses to a RED STORM LINE attached to
          the side of the building.
          
          She steps into the storm.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - THE LINE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie leans into the door, pushing it closed and locking
          the wheel.
          
          Two steps into the storm, the building behind her is
          gone. Step after step, there's nothing but the guide
          line and the ROAR of the storm.
          
          A gust of wind lifts her off the ground.     She's caught by
          her tether and smacked down on the ice.
          
          Slowly regaining her stance, she pushes onward. Finally
          Carrie runs into something. It takes her a moment to
          realize she's at a building.
          
          She grabs the wheel-lock and turns, breaking ice, opening
          the door.
          
                                                                  34.
          
          
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Unclipping from the line, she closes the door on the
          HOWLING behind her. Pulls off her mask. Teeth are
          chattering.
          
          She spins the wheel-lock of the door going out of the
          ready room into the building.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie hits the lights: nothing. No power. Just a
          sliver of light stabbing in through a window.
          
                                  CARRIE
                         (calling out)
                    Mooney? Hello?
          
          Only silence responds.
          
          The hallway is long and dark, leading away from her in
          both directions. She draws a flashlight from her pocket.
          Thumbs the switch, sending a beam out through the dark.
          
          Something doesn't feel right. Slides her baton out from
          her belt. She decides to go left.
          
          Walking the hall, she tries door after door.   Finally one
          gives.
          
                                   CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Mooney?
          
          She cautiously pushes it open: four stripped bunks in an
          empty room.
          
          Moves on down the corridor -- hears COUGHING, like
          someone trying to clear their throat.
          
          Looks ahead, and determines it's coming from behind a
          closed door at the end of the hall.
          
          It's confirmed when she hears it again.
          
          Stops at the door.
          
          She slowly opens it --
          
          Now she can hear HEAVY, LABORED BREATHING --
          
                                                           (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                35.
          CONTINUED:
          
          -- Sweeps the inside with her light. It's a large lounge
          type room: scattered chairs, tables, and an overturned
          sofa on the other side -- where the heavy breathing's
          coming from. Another cough.
          
          She enters the room.
          
          
          INSIDE THE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Inching forward, she gets to the sofa. Looks over it to
          see A BODY -- it's Mooney, lying in a pool of blood.
          Struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his
          esophagus.
          
                                    CARRIE
                       ...My God.
          
          She goes to him. As she kneels, he grabs her, GASPING
          for air, trying to tell her something.
          
          Carrie catches a REFLECTION OF MOMENT behind her in his
          eyes -- someone's coming at her.
          
          -- She instinctively rolls back over Mooney just as --
          WHAM! An ICE AXE swings down at her. Just misses her
          head by an inch, but the shaft nails her arm holding the
          baton that goes clattering across the floor.
          
          The killer, wearing ECW gear with hood and goggles, takes
          another swing. She lunges to the side. Axe misses her,
          but sinks into Mooney. Game over for him.
          
          Carrie slices the floor with her light, looking for the
          baton, but can't see it.
          
          The killer yanks his axe free of Mooney as Carrie bolts
          around the sofa, heading back out the door.
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie blows back into the hallway at a full tilt run,
          retracing her steps. Her light zigzags. The killer
          emerges a few beats later on a run. It's going to be
          close.
          
          Halfway down the hall, she hangs a hard right toward the
          Ready Room. Throws a glance over her shoulder -- he's
          right behind.
          
          She targets the ready room door -- the orb of her light
          getting smaller and smaller as she nears.
          
                                                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Gets there.   Doesn't even want to look back -- it's all
          or nothing.   She pulls open the door --
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- Leaping in, she spins the wheel-lock closed.
          
          SMACK!   The killer HITS THE DOOR from the other side.
          
          She SPINS OPEN the outside door wheel-lock, as the lock
          on the INNER DOOR behind her starts SPINNING OPEN at the
          same time. It's a race.
          
          CARRIE'S door slams open first and the wind hits her
          hard.
          
          She pulls on her mask and goggles just as the door behind
          her bursts open.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie jumps into the whiteout, catching the red storm
          line and clipping in as she staggers forward. Glancing
          back, she sees the killer in the doorway, then loses
          sight of him as she's swallowed in the whiteout.
          
          She struggles down the line, buffeted by the storm, but
          HER HAND ON THE LINE moves erratically -- He's on.
          
          She swivels a nervous whirl to see -- the Killer
          materializing out of the whiteout right behind her.    He's
          clipped into Carrie's line. He raises the axe.
          
          He swings. She jumps back, losing her footing. Hits the
          ice hard -- face first. The killer towers over her,
          raising the axe again. Carrie drives her heel into his
          knee, knocking him off balance. He drops next to her.
          
          He reaches for Carrie, grabbing her mask, pulling it off.
          She cries out as the FREEZING WIND catches her face.
          
          The killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib-cracking
          kick, flipping Carrie onto her back.
          
          SOUND FADES from Carrie's world.
          
          There is nothing but her strained BREATHING.   The killer
          draws back the axe, shiny with frozen blood.   He swings.
          
          Carrie UNCLIPS her harness from the tether. THE WIND
          grabs her, and Carrie SLIDES AWAY -- the killer
          disappearing from view behind the swirling wall of white.
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Sliding across the ice, Carrie SLAMS into a pole.   Grabs
          on.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - POLE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cinching her hood down, she searches the storm with no
          idea which way to go.
          
          Carrie glances up the post. Barely visible through the
          blowing ice are signs pointing different directions:
          "Moscow 17,030 Tokyo 13,329 Fiji 7,877 Los Angeles
          15,641"
          
          She pulls herself up and heads out, leaning into the
          wind. Carrie staggers blindly, trying to protect her
          face. Falling, she gets up, and struggles on.
          
          Her drunken gait increases as she continues to lose heat.
          A rope catches her in the neck. It's another storm line.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - SECOND LINE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie lurches forward, holding the line with one arm.
          
          Finally, she bumps into something. It moves. It turns
          to face her. IT'S THE KILLER AGAIN. He swings. She
          deflects the blow with her free arm, and manages to grab
          the axe head. The killer tears the axe free, taking
          Carrie's glove with it.
          
          He swings again, but Carrie pulls hard on the rope,
          throwing him off balance.
          
          The axe cuts through the line. The killer hits the
          ground, and is immediately ushered away in the wind, as
          Carrie, clinging to the rope, slides over the ice like a
          pendulum.
          
          The line goes tight; she's jerked to a stop. It takes
          everything she's got to get to her feet. She slowly
          struggles up the line.
          
          
          EXT/INT. STORAGE SHED - CONTINUOUS
          
          More dead than alive, Carrie stumbles against the door
          and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands.
          
          Unable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around
          the wheel, she struggles to turn it. Finally it gives.

          CONTINUED:
          
          The door swings wide and she stumbles in. But she's
          caught; her bare hand frozen to the metal.
          
          Ripping it free, her SCREAM is lost to the wind.
          
          Carrie falls, collapsing against the door.       Blackout
          
                                                            SMASH CUT TO
          
          
          INT. MOTEL 6 - BATHROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT)
          
          A single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto
          Carrie, who's leaning against a sink, staring at herself
          in a mirror. She looks stressed. Her Marshal's badge
          dangles around her neck.   Wears a shoulder harness. The
          bathroom door behind her is open.
          
          She catches a REFLECTION of a shadow moving across the
          room behind her. Body tenses.
          
          As she turns --
          
                                      CARRIE
                       Jack?
          
          No answer.
          
          She withdraws a 9mm from her harness -- eases toward the
          door.
          
          Gun ready, she rolls her back around the jam -- WHAM!
          Carrie's blindsided by a fist that drives her into the
          other door jam.
          
          Before she can recover -- a guy, dark eyes, unshaven,
          grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the
          bathroom mirror. SMASH. It's brutal. Shards fall into
          the sink, as Carrie's RIGHT TEMPLE goes bloody. She
          drops to the floor --
          
          CARRIE'S POV - A BLURRY FIGURE stands over top of her.
          She's still got some fight in her -- hands lash out in a
          frenzy, like a cat in water.

                       Wo wo wo.   It's okay, it's okay.
          
          The figure materializes around her.     It's Delfy, holding
          her down.

          INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - VOSTOK - LATER
          
          She's lying on a table, wrapped in blankets. An old,
          WRINKLED FACED RUSSIAN MAN slowly lowers her wounded hand
          -- pale white and missing some skin, back into a tray of
          water next to her. Her silver ring glistens under the
          florescent lights. A HUGE BRUISE runs across her arm.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       What happened?
          
                                       DELFY
                       When   you didn't come back -- we
                       went   looking for you. Found a
                       dead   guy in the other building --
                       that   Mooney?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Yeah. Someone got to him before I
                       did. Then went after me.
                            (BEAT)
                       How long was I out?
          
                                     DELFY
                       A couple hours.
          
          Carrie's eyes drift to the old man next to her.
          
                                     DELFY (cont'd)
                       He's been looking after you.
          
          He flashes a smile of crooked, yellow teeth.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       Thanks.
          
          As she starts to sit up, he protests, saying something in
          Russian. She ignores him. He walks away, mumbling
          something else.
          
          She sits up. Lifts her hand out of the water -- fingers
          are slow moving.
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       I need to get back in there.
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Delfy and Carrie, with her hand bandaged, both slice the
          dark with flashlights. She's starting to get her
          bearings back.
          
                                  DELFY
                    Whoever it was, could have flown
                    out after the storm broke.
          
          They walk a few silent beats, then --
          
                                     DELFY (cont'd)
                    Who's Jack?
          
          It's a moment before she responds --
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Let it go, Delfy.
          
          He lets it go.
          
          THEY ENTER THE LOUNGE
          
          Same as before. Carrie goes to the over-turned sofa.
          Moves her light around -- searching. Passes over the
          blood on the floor.
          
                                  DELFY
                    Until I met you, I hadn't seen any
                    dead people. Now I'm at two.
          
          Carrie gets on her knees -- looks under the sofa.
          Low angles her light. Something reflects.    Reaches in.
          Retrieves her baton --
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Just as Carrie and Delfy leave the lounge, her perifocal
          vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight, which
          bled out from a door's threshold halfway down the hall.
          
          Delfy's eyes go wide -- Carrie's finger goes to her mouth
          - Shhhhh.
          
          She instinctively pulls her baton with her left hand, but
          it hurts. She shifts it to the other.
          
          She turns off her light.    Delphy does the same.   Motions
          for him to stay put.

          CONTINUED:
          
          She heads to the source, keeping her baton ready and her
          back tight to the wall.
          
          Gets to the edge of the door.      It's open just slightly --
          looks in.
          
          Sees a man in an ECW jacket with his back to her, holding
          a flashlight in one hand and digging through a duffle bag
          with his other. Items are strewn. Another bag has been
          completely turned inside out.
          
          She enters.    Baton cocked.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Unless you want your head cracked,
                       I wouldn't move.
          
          His body tenses.
          
                                       MAN
                       Take it easy.

                       -- Let me see your hands.
          
          He slowly raises them.
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       Now turn around.
          
          He does. He's a guy in his 30's. Although he's clean
          shaven, there's a rugged edge about him.
          
                                       CARRIE (cont'd)
                       Who are you?
          Delfy comes up behind her.
          
                                     MAN
                       Robert Pryce. I'm a United
                       Nations observer for the Oceanic
                       and Antarctic section. If you
                       relax, I've got my ID.

                       Let's see it -- slowly.
          
          As he reaches into his liner --
          
                                     PRYCE
                       You must be Stetko --
          
          This throws her.

                       I was heading to ASB to talk to
                       you about Weiss when I was told
                       you had come up here.
          
          He holds out his ID for her.       As she reads --

                       FBI notified us. Your base

          Carrie lowers her baton.    He stands.

                       I thought I might find answers in

                       but clothes.

                                     PRYCE
                       I realize that, but considering
                       the time constraints we're up
                       against, let's be honest, taping
                       and bagging everything isn't going
                       to be an option.

                       if I find out anything.
          
          She starts to walk away -- he follows, he's not done at
          all. Delfy brings up the rear.

                    If they've been digging out there,
                    that's a direct violation of the
                    United Nations treaty. We think
                    they were digging. That makes it
                    my business.
          
          This stops her -- digging?

          She knows and her patience is running thin.

                    Fine. But this is my

          Carrie opens the door to the ready room to find Pryce

          Carrie, Pryce and Delfy climb out from the plane and make
          their way toward the tents. Place looks deserted.

          Pryce glances to a watch strapped to the outside of his
          jacket.

                       I'll take this one.
          
          She moves toward tent one, Pryce the other.
          
          
          EXT. FIRST TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie peers in. It's too dark to see anything. She
          goes to pull out her flashlight with her left hand --
          stops herself. Reaches in with her right, extracts it
          from her pocket. Turns it on.
          
          
          INT.   FIRST WORK TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM plays over a litter of personal
          effects, then picks up a TRAIL OF BLOOD leading to a cot
          between two others. Someone is huddled in a yellow
          sleeping bag on it. Her body tightens.
          
                                       CARRIE
                       Rubin?
          
          She steps into the tent. Moves to the cot. There's a
          pool of blood underneath. Her heart pounds. She uses
          her flashlight, touches the sleeping bag. It doesn't
          move. She pulls at it...
          
          ...and discovers A PAIR OF ECW PANTS -- the LEFT LEG is
          soaked in blood.   No corpse.
          
          She steadies her breathing.      She pulls out a small baggie
          from her pocket.

          CONTINUED:
          Uses the end of the flashlight to chip away a frozen
          blood sample from the pant leg. Puts it in the baggie.
          
          Takes out her camera next.       Starts snapping.   Flash goes
          off.
          
          
          INT.   SECOND WORK TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie enters with Delfy. Place is lit by a single dim
          bulb. This is a work space; two tables, instruments on
          top. Sample containers piled everywhere. Numerous
          photos of meteorites are stuck to a board.
          
          She finds Pryce reading the crew's DAILY LOG.

                       Someone's left leg took a hit,
                       lost a lot of blood. What do you
                       got?

          Delfy's drawn to a BIZARRE LOOKING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT;
          it's a red box on wheels with a handle like a lawn mower.
          A circular antennae sprouts from the front of the box.
          
                                     DELFY

          TOP. The ice field is marked off into sections.

          Carrie has Mooney's bodybag unzipped and is examining his
          left leg. No cuts. No blood. She thinks on this non-
          discovery for a moment, then zips it back up.

          Pryce is in the backseat, Delfy is driving. Carrie is

          FLASHING POLICE REDS reflect off the glass of the front
          doors of a hotel. Several squad cars are nosed up to the
          entrance.
          
          Patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations,
          watching as A HANDCUFFED Carrie is escorted outside by
          two uniformed officers. Her eyes are full of tears.
          
          She's put into the backseat of one of the cars. As the
          door closes, she stares out the window where Coroners are
          loading a body under a sheet into the back of their
          truck.

                    Maybe you wrote them down wrong.
          
          Carrie ignores him. Walks further away from the cat.
          Ice CRUNCHES UNDER HER FEET as she keeps looking -- then,
          she stops. Something's not right. Looks DOWN.
          
          Kneels to the ice. Scoops some up. Checks it out.
          Perplexed. Pryce approaches from behind.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    This is shaved ice.

          CONTINUED:
          
          She gets to her feet. Walks further -- her eyes now
          paying close attention to the texture of the ice. After
          a dozen steps, texture changes. Ice is now smooth --
          like it's supposed to be.
          
          She turns around.   Tries to get the bigger picture.
          Looks at the ground all around her. Realizes a large
          area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few
          inches thick --
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       They were digging, Pryce. And
                       they tries to spread the ice to
                       hide it.
          
          She heads back across the area.       Scans the horizon.
          Takes another step forward.
          
          WHOOSH! In an instant, Carrie's gone! DISAPPEARS below
          the ice. Only a four foot wide hole remains, that was
          covered up with a white, iced-over tarp.
          
          Pryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating
          slightly, unsure of their own footing.
          
          Pryce gets to the hole. Looks down. Carrie is
          precariously dangling in an ICE SHAFT that slopes at a
          slight angle. She's managed to grasp a protruding piece
          of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to
          hold on. It slips off. Below her -- nothing but
          darkness.

                       Grab me!
          
          Pryce lays flat. Reaches his hand down -- six inches too
          short. Delfy appears from behind.
          
                                       PRYCE

                       Hold my legs!
          
          Delfy does.    Pryce inches closer.
          
                                       CARRIE
                       I'm slipping!

          He gets closer.   Closer.    Moves to within an inch from
          hers --
          
          -- She SLIPS.    Falls away.   Things become silent.

          Delfy peers over Pryce's shoulder into the abyss.

                    Saw a rope in the Cat.
          
          Delfy springs to his feet.
          
          
          INT. ICE SHAFT - SAME
          
          Darkness. A flashlight clicks on. Reflects off a wall
          of ice with a frozen blood trail leading up. Carrie gets
          to her feet. Sees that she's in a small dug out area.
          
          As she slowly turns to get her bearings, her light falls
          on an ESCAPE HATCH of some kind, maybe three feet high.
          
          Carrie shines the light to her feet.        The ground beneath
          her is metal.
          
          
          INT. ICE SHAFT - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Pryce, with a flashlight in hand, lowers himself down a
          rope to the bottom of the shaft where Carrie waits.
          Delfy follows. Both take in the discovery.
          
          Carrie moves over to the hatch. Pulls on it. Opens
          easily. She and Pryce hit the interior with their
          lights. Find themselves staring into...AN AIRPLANE!
          
          
          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Off their lights -- every surface scintillates with ice
          crystals from the frozen atmosphere, undisturbed except
          for recent tracks of footprints filing in and out -- they
          go forward and aft, disappearing into darkness. Place is
          tomb silent.

          CONTINUED:
          Twisted, and strewn with large containers scattered at
          odd angles -- victims of an intense IMPACT. The plane is
          pitched up at the nose, making their footing precarious.

                       It's an Antanov-74. Russian made -
                       - late fifties. No one's put
                       these in the air for forty years.
          
          Carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness,
          heading for the cockpit.
          
          Something BRUSHES her leg. She spins. Shines her light -
          - which illuminates a HAND, fingers in a clawed position -
          - as if in excruciating pain. She whips her light past
          the hand, up the arm -- captures the FACE of a man
          staring at her! It takes a moment to realize -- he's
          dead, pinned between two large metal crates.
          
          Delfy stands still. Staring.           Carrie throws a look back
          over her shoulder --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Guess that makes three.
          
          She continues on with Delfy staying close.         Her light
          targets the cockpit door. It's closed.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie pushes the door open.
          
          The beam of her light reveals frozen blood SPLATTERED
          across a SHATTERED WINDSHIELD -- chunks of ice protruding
          through it.
          
          Continues over three dead men in flight suits still
          strapped into seats, their broken bodies and ghastly
          expressions perfectly preserved. Each have a sidearm
          holstered around their waist.

                       This isn't funny --
          
          She looks back to Delfy -- gets confused.

          Trailing her beam of light, Carrie and Delfy climb
          through a thick wall of nylon webbing. Enter a cluttered
          cargo area.
          
          Ransacked Antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle
          of ropes and crampons, old ECW gear, and boxes of
          supplies.
          
          Dipping into a case of bottles, Delfy pulls one free,
          sniffs, and drinks.
          
                                    CARRIE

                    Vodka.
          
          Carrie continues through the hold. Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM
          flickers over more chaos of the crash. HUGE STEEL TANKS
          TAKE UP MOST OF THE MID-SECTION.

                    Find what you're looking for?
          
          Her light hits Pryce, who is focused on a HEAVY STEEL
          CAGE WELDED INTO THE AIRFRAME. Incredibly strong. And
          inside it is a STEEL SAFE. Door is open.
          
          Pryce takes a beat -- turns to she and Delfy.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Just answers.

                    And by the looks of that safe,
                    must've been transporting
                    something pretty important.
          
          Carrie moves in closer.   Sees that the cage has been
          breached.

          CONTINUED:
          Part of it has been damaged by the crash and this
          weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous
          intruders until they forced an opening. Discarded tools
          litter the floor.

                       this.
          
          There's a pool of frozen blood near the opening -- where
          one of the torn, jagged bars of the steel cage is covered
          in blood --

                       over the tunnel.
          
          She uses her light to examine the interior of the safe
          more closely -- the frost on the shelves exposes SIX
          ROUND RUST RINGS where containers have been removed.
          Each one roughly measuring a foot tall, four inches wide.

          They scramble back through the darkness, the flashlight
          beams swinging wildly about the hold.
          
          MORE ICE FALLS. It's getting louder as they're getting
          closer to the source.
          
          Carrie targets ahead with her light -- illuminates the
          hatch as A LOAD OF ICE DROPS IN covering it completely.
          Light fades.

          Things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped
          up on a crate, illuminates Carrie, Delfy and Pryce hard
          at it -- frantically chopping away at the ice filled

          The light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade.
          Carrie goes over to the crate, slaps it against her leg,
          trying to get more juice going. Still fading. Light
          goes out --
          
          -- Screen goes black. Can't see a thing. A second
          later, ANOTHER LIGHT KICKS ON -- Pryce is holding it.
          Hands it over to Carrie --

                       And when that one goes -- we're
                       screwed.
          
          Carries mind whirls with her lack of options, then --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       What about the Vodka -- we could
                       make some torches, maybe melt the
                       ice?

                       Fire will burn the O2 quicker.

                       What choice do we have?
          
          Pryce knows she's right.
          
          Delfy looks to them both.    Desperate.
          
                                     DELFY
                       Don't need my vote.
          
          Pryce heads to the back, his body becoming barely visible
          in the dissipating range of light.
          
          Carrie takes a six-inch, pearl handled Buck knife from a
          pocket, unfolds it-- starts cutting the liner of her
          coat.
          
          Delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate. Goes to lift it,
          but it's frozen to the floor. Stomps on it. It breaks.
          Pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks.
          
          Pryce comes back with a couple bottles.       Stops dead in
          his tracks.
          
          Carrie looks over to see him staring at two LIFE JACKETS
          attached to the wall near the hatch. He's thinking.
          
          He moves to Carrie --
          
                                     PRYCE
                       Hold these.
          
          He exchanges the bottles for her flashlight.
          
          He shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the
          back, leaving Carrie and Delfy getting swallowed in the
          dark.
          
                                     CARRIE

                                  CARRIE
                    We came in through it.
          
          Pryce goes back into the cargo area.
          
                                  PRYCE (O.C.)
                    Has to be more than one.
          
                                  DELFY
                    It'd be on the ceiling in case of
                    an ocean landing.
          
          Carrie watches Pryce's flashlight moving about in the
          cargo area of the aircraft.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Found it!
          
          Carrie and Delfy get to Pryce. They follow his beam
          straight up to expose an ESCAPE HATCH in the roof of the
          fuselage.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    With the angle of the plane, I
                    don't think we're that far from
                    the surface. Give me a hand.
          
          Pryce moves to a large crate -- starts to push it over.
          They join, sliding it over below the hatch.
          
          He jumps up onto it -- examines the hatch area.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    These are explosive bolts. If we
                    blow the hatch, maybe it'll smash
                    a hole up through the ice.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Or, if the ice is too thick the
                    blast will come right back at us.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    We can be blown up, suffocate or
                    freeze to death. Take your pick.
          
          Pryce hands Carrie the flashlight. She targets the hatch
          area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a
          crisscrossing maze of wires.

          As he reaches up to examine the wiring, Carrie catches a
          GLIMPSE of a SHOULDER HARNESS under his liner.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    This could work -- give me the
                    battery from your phone.
          
          As he looks down, Carrie masks her discovery.   Hands over
          her phone. He extracts the BATTERY.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    When I connect these two wires,
                    hopefully there's going to be a
                    big bang. May want to take some
                    cover.
          
          Pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire
          onto the battery, and prepares for another.
          
          He looks to Carrie and Pryce who have backed up against
          the fuselage.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    You guys ready?
          
          Delfy nods.
          
          Carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her
          head.
          
          Pryce touches the last wire to the battery.   Nothing
          happens. Hope freezes.
          
          Pryce tries again --
          
          -- KA-BOOM! The hatch EXPLODES INWARD, ricocheting
          around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet
          coming in and out of their light.
          
          SLAM, SLAM, SLAM, until...WHAM, it buries itself edge-on,
          halfway into the fuselage, missing Carrie by a hair's
          width.
          
          They stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of
          ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a
          THIN SHAFT OF LIGHT DROPS into the cargo bay like a gift
          from God.
          
                                    DELFY
                    Hallelujah --
          
          Pryce drops down.   Moves to another crate.

                    need to get up higher.
          
          Delfy moves forward to help. The two of them push it
          over. It's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the
          other.
          
          Just as they finish, Pryce turns to find himself facing
          Carrie holding one of the RUSSIAN'S GUNS TO HIS FACE.
          
                                     CARRIE

                    What's going on?

                    he is.
          
          She reaches into Pryce's liner, pulls out his sidearm
          from the shoulder holster.
          
          Switches it with the one in her hand.    Puts the Russian
          gun in her coat pocket.

                    someone down here and Tahir
                    Soufian, a black market trader in
                    New York. It was all about
                    setting up a buy for cannisters
                    found in an old Russian transport
                    buried in the ice.

                    There's been rumors for years that
                    the Russians had a second base --
                    a secret weapons research facility
                    under the ice that supposedly blew
                    up in the late sixties -- nothing
                    was ever confirmed.

                    The fact is, before the treaty in
                    `72 they were strip mining all
                    over the place down here -- we
                    believe for uranium and other
                    specialized minerals for weapon's
                    use. It was the Cold War. No one
                    knows half the things the
                    Russian's were up to. This plane
                    could be the link between rumor
                    and truth. And if it is true,
                    what's in those cannisters could

          towards the open safe, the blood staining the airplane
          floor. Makes a decision.

          Delfy wriggles out from the hole. He reaches back.
          Helps Carrie to the surface. Pryce follows.
          
          They look around. The weather has deteriorated - the sky
          is dark with fast moving clouds. The wind is HOWLING.
          The Snowcat is parked over the hole, blade lowered.
          
          Delfy runs over, jumps onto the CAT.   Looks inside the
          cab.

          Carrie notices a single set of an airplane's ski tracks
          in the distance.

                       Rubin could just disappear in the

          Delfy starts up the Cat.
          
          Carrie pulls out her Nextel as Pryce takes out his PDA.
          She depresses the walkie button -- makes her way to the

          out front -- it's tail section open like the mouth of a
          massive beast. Move past several people, balloons and
          `Eve of Evac' signs.

          Pryce takes it all in.   Not the story he expected.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Marshall service cleared me --
                    ruled it self-defense, but I had a
                    real hard time getting over the
                    betrayal -- how little my life
                    meant to a guy I was willing to
                    take a bullet for.
          
          Carrie shifts in her chair.   Leans forward.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Know what the kicker is -- Jack
                    thought I was close to figuring
                    him out. Thought this hotel room
                    was the best place to get rid of
                    me -- make it look like a bust
                    gone bad. Truth is, I had no
                    idea.
                    (ANGRY)
                    God, I was young and stupid, and
                    in way over my head.
          
          She stands.   Pryce joins her.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    You asked me why I smell like
                    suntan lotion -- Jack wore Aramis,
                    this cheap after-shave his wife
                    gave him. Some of the guys down
                    here wear it -- suntan lotion is
                    the only thing that keeps me from
                    smelling it.

          She notices the papers he's holding; faxed photos of
          THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANNISTERS WITH RUSSIAN WRITING
          ON THEM.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    What do ya got there?
          
          He shows them to her.   One-by-one.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    It's what the Russians used to
                    transport weapons grade materials
                    in. They match the dimensions
                    inside the safe. We're looking
                    for six of these.
          
          As Carrie studies them --

                    Langley's thinking it might be
                    Hexafluoride, which is a
                    derivative of Uranium. It's a
                    component for nuclear detonation.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    These beakers where really in over
                    their heads.
          
          The RADIO on Pryce's hip -- crackles...
          
                                  RHONDA (V.O.)
                    Dinkle, it's Rhonda --
          
          Pryce smirks.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    I better get this back to him.
                    And we have to find Rubin.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Think you can you help me with
                    these buttons, first?
          
                                   PRYCE
                    Sure.
          
          He moves closer.   Starts to button her up.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    For what it's worth -- I think
                    you're pretty tough, Marshall.

          INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - ASB - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie enters. Light streaming in through the window
          hits her tired face. She reaches for the light switch on
          the nearby wall --
          
          -- A HAND GRABS HERS --
          
          -- AGGRESSIVELY YANKS her away from the open door. It's
          kicked closed as she's drawn backwards into a man's
          embrace. A knife's brought to her neck.
          
                                      MAN
                            (raspy, deep)
                       ...You Stetko?
          
          Carrie nods -- slides her hand toward her pocket...
          
                                        MAN (cont'd)
                       Don't...
          
          She stops.

                       Who are you?
          
          He slowly turns her around to face him.
          
          -- it's Rubin, but he looks beat to shit. Deep cracks
          slice across his bloody, chapped lips. Peeling skin
          flakes on his face. Desperate, despondent eyes. Shaky,
          frostbitten fingers. He's having a hard time holding it
          together as he can barely get the words out...
          
                                     RUBIN
                       -- Did Mooney talk to you? I
                       didn't hear from him -- he was
                       supposed to call me after you
                       talked.
          
          Carrie's confused.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       Mooney's dead.
          
          His eyes well.
          
                                        RUBIN
                       No...
          
                                     CARRIE
                       And so's Weiss.

                       And I'm next, I know it.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       It's okay, you're safe, just put
                       the knife down.
          
          His shaking hands slowly lowers it -- she breathes a
          little easier. He sets it down on an empty book shelf
          next to him.

          He stares off blankly --
          
                                     RUBIN
                       Weiss didn't want to go through
                       with it. Oh God. How did we let
                       this happen?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Rubin -- I need you to focus for
                       me.
          
          He tries. Looks at her through tired, pinched eyes --
          he's trying.
          
          O.C. KNOCK. KNOCK on her door.
          
          Rubin is spooked.    Glares at her -- scared.   Like a caged
          animal.
          
                                     DOC (O.C.)
                       Carrie, it's Doc -- got those
                       painkillers.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       It's okay, he's a doctor, he can
                       help you.
          
          It falls on deaf ears -- he goes for the knife.    She
          tries to stop him.
          
          Rubin shoves her aside, throwing her against a chair.
          She topples backwards.
          
          He whips open the door, driving an unexpected shoulder
          into Doc, who gets nailed so hard, he goes stumbling back
          up against the wall behind him. Takes the wind right out
          of him. Pills all over the floor.

          disappearing down a set of side stairs.

          She takes two at a time -- keys the two-way...

          BOTTOM OF STAIRS - LEVEL ONE
          
          As Carrie comes off the stairs -- looks left -- there's
          three guys carrying boxes out of a room. Snaps a look to
          the right --
          
          -- Rubin's at the far end, slipping through a doorway
          that leads into an INTERCONNECTING TUNNEL to another part
          of ASB.

          empty bookcases.

          INT. SCIENCE BUILDING - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie enters through the connecting tunnel's doorway.
          Not a lot of light. Slows her pace. It's quiet.
          Dormant. Vacant lab stations. Room's been shut down for
          the winter. Eyes scan. Fall upon --
          
          -- A DOOR ACROSS THE ROOM.   A sign above reads: READY
          ROOM.
          
          She takes off again, slaloming her way around the lab
          stations to get to the door.
          
          
          OTHER SIDE OF ROOM
          
          Carrie gets to the door. Pulls on the handle. Won't
          open. Rattles. Looks in through a viewing window --
          sees --
          
          -- a panicked Rubin inside, grabbing ECW gear off a rack
          mounted to the wall.
          
          A DIGITAL READOUT ABOVE THE EXIT DOOR READS: -60.
          
          He and Carrie exchange glances.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Rubin -- I can help you!
          
          He shakes his head.
          
          She tugs harder on the doors. Stuck. Looks through the
          window to see he's tied them together with some climbing
          rope.
          
          In that same instant a shaft of brilliant daylight floods
          half the room as the outside door is whipped open.
          
          A MAN in full ECW - stands in the doorway. He's wearing
          a FACE MASK and GOGGLES. Holds an ICE AXE poised, ready
          to strike -- it's the same guy who attacked her.

          Rubin bolts back toward the door separating he and
          Carrie, but --
          
          -- SWOOOSH! THE ICE AXE is buried into his shoulder,
          gaffing him like a fish. The pain's excruciating for
          Rubin, who spins on his attacker like a wild man.
          BULLDOZES into him, driving him back out the door.
          
          Both TUMBLE down a steep set of stairs -- the exposed end
          of the ice axe gets stuck in a step's steel meshing on
          the way down -- rips out of Rubin's shoulder.
          
          
          EXT. READY ROOM - BASE OF STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
          
          Rubin eats the pain as he gets to his feet. Takes off.
          Runs blindly with panting intensity verging on hysteria.
          Disappears around the contour of ASB before the other guy
          can get to his feet.
          
          His assailant rises. Goes back up a couple steps to
          retrieve his embedded ice axe, but finds it wedged so
          tight, it won't budge. Abandons it.
          
          
          INT. SCIENCE BUILDING - SAME
          
          Carrie shoulders the door, but still doesn't budge.
          Hears FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HER. Turns to see it's Pryce.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Door's jammed --
          
          Pryce latches on to a heavy SUPPLY CART filled with
          beakers, micro-scopes and other gear, that's tucked
          against one of the lab stations.
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       Pryce, it's not Rubin --
          
          Off his confused look --
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       Someone's trying to kill him.
          
          Pryce picks up speed as he targets the door. Hits it
          like a freight train, busting it open! Cart goes
          crashing. Contents scatter like buckshot.
          
          
          INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          The two of them are hit with icy cold coming in through
          the open exit door.
                                                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Carrie throws a look outside -- bottom of stairs are
          vacant. Ice axe is still there.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Shit, Rubin doesn't have any gear
                       on.
          
          Carrie immediately closes the outside door. Pryce goes
          for the ECW wear. Scrambles to get a coat on. Carrie
          joins. Same thing.
          
                                     PRYCE
                       How long's he been out there?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Thirty seconds.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Rubin staggers as he follows a line of storage bins
          tucked against the base of the main building. The blood
          from his wound already frozen on his shirt.
          
          The cold -- it's killing him. Body's shaking.    The sun's
          reflection off the ice is blinding.
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          
          RUBIN'S POV -
          
          -- His vision begins to cloud as the corneas are
          literally being burned by the intense light. He tries to
          shield them -- has little effect.
          
          He looks over his shoulder -- gets a BLURRED IMAGE of his
          attacker not far behind.
          
          Rubin trips. Hands go to the icy ground to protect his
          fall. Still hits hard. Starts to get up, but his palms
          are frozen to the surface. Doesn't have time to care --
          pulls hard, tearing the skin right off. Stands. Spins
          around in a panicked whirl -- he's lost ground.
          
          Continues to the end of the storage bins. Moves under
          ASB, using the enormous HYDRAULIC LIFT COLUMNS to conceal
          his movement.
          
                                                                   81.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Up ahead -- forty yards away -- hope. He continues
          toward some storage containers and the SNOW MELTER on the
          other side, where TWO PEOPLE, CLAD IN ECW are finishing
          filling an insulated container with water from an
          insulated hose mounted to the Melter.   A snowmobile is
          parked next to them.
          
          He tries to scream, but only a dull, raspy, muffled voice
          escapes...
          
                                   RUBIN
                    ...Help me.
          
          The guys -- oblivious.
          
          
          EXT. READY ROOM - STAIRS - DAY
          
          Carrie and Pryce, now bundled up in ECW, exit the room
          and head down the stairs. Split up -- go opposite
          directions around the complex.
          
          
          EXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - SAME
          
          Rubin's pace is slowing -- he's exerting himself to get
          to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the
          container.   Frostbite is chewing up his lungs. He's too
          slow, they take off. He coughs up blood.
          
                                   RUBIN
                    W..wa..wait.
          
          He turns around to check on his pursuer.   Twenty feet
          away and closing.
          
          Rubin's eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon --
          anything. Sees the insulated hose on the SNOW MELTER.
          Heads for it.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - OTHER SIDE - SAME
          
          Carrie passes a gap between storage containers where
          several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow --
          through their vertical slats, SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF
          RUBIN at the Snow Melter across on the other side of the
          main building. Sees the ECW guy closing in.
          
                                                                   82.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. ASB - UNDERNEATH - SAME
          
          Pryce is moving under ASB. Passes a hydraulic support
          leg. Spots Carrie on the other side moving toward Rubin.
          Also sees the ECW guy in pursuit. Heads toward them.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME
          
          Rubin's frostbitten hand reaches for the hose. Grabs it,
          but he doesn't have the strength to turn it on. Throws a
          defeated glance over his shoulder to see --
          
          -- THE VILLAIN in ECW gear right on him! Shoves Rubin
          against the tank. Grabs the hose from him. Turns it on -
          - SPRAYING him head to toe.
          
          Rubin's clothes turn to ice. One eye freezes shut. Lips
          go cobalt blue. He tries to escape, but several stiff
          steps away, he slows and finally stops: a prisoner in his
          ice-locked clothing.
          
          The man moves to Rubin.   Grabs his head, and - SNAP -
          breaks his neck.
          
          Rubin's body topples stiffly to the ground.
          
          
          INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - ASB - SAME
          
          Rhonda crosses the busy room. Reaches for a clipboard
          hanging next to the window. Something outside catches
          her attention.
          
                                    RHONDA
                    Sam!
          
          She looks to Murphy, who is on the phone.
          
          Murphy and the others join her at the window. They see
          Rubin on the ground, but the Snow Melter blocks any view
          of the killer.
          
                                                        SMASH CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME
          
          The Killer turns to leave the crime scene and --
          
          -- WHACK! He's blindsided by a SHOVEL to his head.
          Goggles shatter.

          CONTINUED:
          
          He drops.
          
          Carrie pulls his parka hood away from his head -- snaps
          the goggle from his face.
          
          It's KELLER!
          
          Blood trickles from the fresh wound to his head.
          
          The shovel's courtesy of Carrie, who stands over top of
          him. Holds the shovel to his neck like a guillotine
          blade.
          
          Pryce approaches. Glances to Rubin's frozen body -- neck
          askew. Carrie is wound up. Keller's still recovering
          from the impact --
          
                                     KELLER
                       I sh... sh... shoulda killed you
                       at Vostok.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Where are the cannisters?
          
                                       KELLER
                       Go to hell.
          
                                       PRYCE
                       Wrong answer.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Help me drag him over here.
          
          They each take his jacket by the shoulder -- pull him
          back over to the Snow Melter.
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       Keep him still.
          
          She hands the shovel to Pryce, who puts it to Keller's
          neck.
          
          Carrie pulls her Buck knife from her back pocket, then
          whips off Keller's gloves. Tosses them aside. The cold
          makes him more coherent. Sees Pryce at this throat.
          
                                     PRYCE
                       Who's Tahir selling it to --
                       what's the intended target?
          
          Keller shifts his attention to Carrie, who's using her
          knife to SLICE open his ECW jacket and pants, exposing
          bare arms and legs.

                    What're you doing, you crazy
                    bitch?
          
          Keller instantly starts to shake.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Why did you kill those scientists,
                    Keller? Was a four-way split too
                    much for you?
          
                                    KELLER
                    Fuck you.
          
          Carrie grabs the hose from the Snow Melter.
          
          She brutally stomps on Keller's exposed arm, douses him
          with water from the hose, welding his arm to the ground
          as it freezes instantly.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Where is the uranium?
          
                                  KELLER
                         (almost smug)
                    You have no idea what's going on
                    here, do you?
          
          Keller begins to shiver violently.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Hit the sonofabitch again!
          
          Carrie releases more water, freezing more of the arm.        He
          screams. Pain is too much. He caves.
          
                                  KELLER
                    The plane, they're in the fucking
                    plane.
          
          Carrie's suddenly grabbed from behind.     It's Murphy.
          Furious. Two other guys at his side.
          
                                  MURPHY
                    Have you completely lost your

                    Let go of me.
          
          She twists free of his grasp.      Gets in Keller's face.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)

                    What the hell's going on?
          
          She glares at him.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    The cannisters are on the plane.
          
          She looks to the guys that came out with Murphy.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Throw him in the holding cell.
          
          The two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the
          ground. Carrie kicks it free. It's painful. Keller
          screams.
          
          The guys lift him to his feet.     Haul him away.
          
          Murphy looks to Pryce --
          
                                  MURPHY
                    Who the hell are you?
          
          Carrie looks at Pryce.
          
                                     PRYCE
                    Name's Pryce.
          
          Pryce looks at Carrie.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    He's with the UN. We have to
                    search that plane now!
          
          Murphy looks to Carrie with an intense glare --
          
                                  MURPHY
                    We don't have time. We'll just
                    search it in Christchurch when it
                    lands.
          
          Pryce steps in --

                    It's a twelve hour flight to
                    Christchurch. Anything can happen
                    in that time. Keller is here, so
                    we know it's still on the ground.

                       Once that plane is in the air,
                       we've as good as lost it. Just
                       give us 10 minutes.
          
          Murphy looks to Carrie, softens slightly --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Sam, do what is right here.    Come

                       I'll send what I can.

          INT. LC-130 - DAY
          
          Carrie is near the cockpit, searching under a row of
          seats. Pryce approaches. A handful of ASB employees
          tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo.
          
                                     PRYCE
                       It's clean.
          
          Carrie gets to her feet.    Pissed off.
          
                                     PRYCE (cont'd)
                       You check the cockpit?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Nothing. That bastard.
                       What the hell are you up to,
                       Keller?
          
                                     PRYCE
                       I don't get it, why lie to us --
                       we have him either way. He's
                       stuck here.
          
          Carrie's suddenly chilled with the ominous reality that --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       He's buying time.
          
          Carrie races off the plane.    Pryce tries to keep pace.
          
                                                               87.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CORRIDOR - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie is slaloming her way through the corridor, which
          is packed with ASB employees carrying their bags for the
          evac. Pryce is close behind.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Out of the way!
          
          
          INT. ASB - MARSHAL'S OFFICE - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie enters. Pryce at her side. Her face goes white.
          The door to the holding room is wide open. Keller's
          GONE.
          
                                    CARRIE
                    Shit!
          
                                  PRYCE
                    He's got nowhere to go, nowhere to
                    hide.
          
          Then it hits her --
          
                                    CARRIE
                    He won't try.    He's a goddamn
                    pilot.
          
          As the two of them take off for the door --
          
          
          INT. ASB - HANGAR - DAY
          
          Delfy walks across the floor. Hangar is minimally lit.
          Still. Silent. Void of personnel. The Otters are lined
          up. The Snowcats and snowmobiles on the other side. He
          heads toward an Otter.
          
          
          INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGAR - DAY
          
          Delfy reaches in and gets his son's picture, which is
          still hanging on the console. Then, something catches
          his attention through the windshield of his plane. He
          sees a FUEL HOSE running to another plane -- and it's
          pumping.
          
          Curious, he gets out of the Otter. Eyes dart about the
          hangar. Doesn't see anyone. Heads to the other plane.
          Discovers that a door is open on the other side. Takes a
          another look around. Doesn't see anyone. Moves closer.
          
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Gets to the plane.   Takes a look inside, and --
          
          THUD!   He's nailed with a giant Crescent wrench to the
          head.   Stumbles back.
          
          Keller leaps out, grabbing hold of a staggering Delfy.
          
          Ruthlessly runs him head first into a standing tool
          chest. Delfy collapses to the ground in a heap.
          Unconscious.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - HEADING TOWARD THE HANGAR - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie and Pryce, dressed in ECW are making their way
          toward the hangar.
          
          
          INT. LC-130 - SAME
          
          Employees are trudging up through the back entrance into
          the plane. Get checked off a list by the LOAD MASTER.
          Toss their gear into a netted cargo area. Find a seat.
          Plane is nearly full.
          
          
          INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGER
          
          Keller has the engine going. It's loud. Preps the
          console for flight, flipping switches -- suddenly sees
          Carrie and Pryce enter the hangar. Guns drawn.
          
          
          CARRIE AND PRYCE
          
          Shift their attention to the plane.    Blades turning. They
          stalk forward. Slowly. Carefully.      Eyeing for any
          betrayal of movement.
          
          Then, with a nod from Carrie, they move in. Fast.
          Ready. Look into the plane. It's empty, except for a
          duffle bag in the back. Carrie nods to Pryce. Motions
          for him to go one way, she'll go another.
          
          INTERCUT CARRIE AND PRYCE
          Carrie eyeballs a Snowcat. It's door is slightly open.
          She heads for it. Gun poised.
          
          Pryce moves to check the next plane.    Eyes dart to every
          dark corner.
          
          Carrie gets to the Cat.    Springs toward the door.
          Inside's empty.
                                                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Pryce walks under THE WING of the next plane. Spots
          Delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest. Looks
          like he's stirring into consciousness. Then --
          
          SWOOSH!! An ICE AXE swings down from above, embedding in
          his Pryce's chest. Deep. It sticks. Gun goes flying.
          Keller drops down from the wing above. Pryce staggers.
          Keller kicks him hard.
          
          Pryce goes down.   Keller grabs the gun.
          
          Points it right at Pryce -- before he can shoot --
          
          BANG!BANG! Bullets zip by Keller, who rolls for cover
          behind SOME EQUIPMENT. Another rips into his shoulder.
          
          Keller spots Carrie over by the Cat. She fires
          continually, forcing him to stay behind cover. The shots
          go wide -- she's not yet used to firing with the right
          hand.
          
          Keller blindly reaches his gun around the chest -- shoots
          back, which --
          
          -- Gives Pryce enough time to painfully crawl for cover
          beneath the plane. He's losing blood quick.
          
          Carrie keeps shooting. Bullets PING OFF THE TOOL CHEST.
          They stop. Carrie has to reload.
          
          Keller makes his move. Fires at Carrie and sprints for
          his plane. Runs right by pole with a large red button
          attached to it. Slams it.
          
          HANGAR DOORS BEGIN TO RUMBLE OPEN
          
          The TEMPERATURE immediately begins to PLUMMET as winter
          is let inside.
          
          Keller keeps shooting.   Runs out of bullets.   Leaps into
          the idling Otter.
          
          Carrie makes her move.   Dashes toward him, firing away.
          
          Bullets PLANT in the WINDSHIELD, but can't penetrate --
          glass is too thick -- protection from the cold.
          
          Keller throttles. Begins to move the Otter forward
          toward the opening doors.
          
          Carrie dashes to Pryce. Sees Delfy get to his feet.
          Face bloody. He moves to Pryce.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          She gets over to the guys quickly, giving Delfy a visual
          once over. He'll be fine, but things look bad for Pryce.
          He's bleeding profusely.
          
          She kneels beside him -- pulls the tip of the axe out of
          his chest.
          
          Delfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    ...I didn't see him.
          
          His eyes flutter shut.   Carrie slaps his face --
          
                                    CARRIE
                    No!    You stay awake!
          
          Puts her hand directly on the wound.   Applies pressure.
          Blood continues to ooze.
          
          She looks over to Keller just as his plane exits the
          hangar.
          
          Looks back to Pryce's wound -- won't stop bleeding.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Damn it!
                         (to Delfy)
                    Come on. We're getting him up.
          
          They lift him to his feet. Haul ass to the front of the
          hangar the best they can. Go outside.
          
          
          EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The two of them place the now unconscious Pryce to the
          ground.
          
          Carrie grabs Delfy's hands. Puts them directly on the
          bloody wound. Surprisingly, he stays focused.
          
                                    CARRIE
                    Press here.    Hard. Hard or he
                    will die!
          
                                     DELFY
                    It won't stop!
          
          Looks Delfy right in the eye.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    He's not going to be number four!

          Carrie rips open Pryce's jacket and liner.
          
          Scoops up an armful of wind-blown ice. Starts packing it
          around him. Keeps repeating the motion.
          
          She keeps shooting looks to Keller's departing plane
          moving toward the runway.
          
          The cold hits Pryce, shocking him awake.

          draw. Keys it.

                    Don't let him die.
          
          Carrie stands.   Determined.   Sprints back into the
          hangar.
          
          
          INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          On a full sprint, Carrie dashes over to the Snowmobiles.
          Coughs. Spits blood. Doesn't stop her. She jumps on
          one. Fires it up. Uses her left palm to steer -- blood
          starts to seep through the gauze. She quickly bundles
          up, then guns it.
          
          Rubber treads grip. Smoke rises. She races it across
          the cement floor and out the hangar.
          
          
          EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Off in the distance, Keller's heading for the front of
          the runway -- has to turn around to take off into the
          wind.
          
          Carrie veers off, targeting the tunnel to ASB.    Hits her
          light as she races in.
          
          
          INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie's light silhouettes Murphy and a couple of his
          guys as they head toward her. She doesn't even slow down
          as she blows right by them.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          Desperation clings to his face as he turns the plane onto
          the runway. His wound oozes blood -- eats the pain as he
          gives it full throttle. Starts to pick up speed. Heads
          down his strip of freedom.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. SIDE OF RUNWAY - OPPOSITE END - SAME
          
          A funnel of bumpy light spreads across the ice before
          Carrie on the snowmobile.

          CONTINUED:
          
          She holds tight as she burns a big U-TURN around one of
          the berms and onto the runway.   Heads straight for the
          lights of Keller's plane.
          
          
          INSIDE KELLER'S PLANE
          
          He sees Carrie.
          
                                      KELLER
                       Crazy bitch.
          
          INTERCUT:
          
          She targets him like a Japanese zero.       Hundred yards and
          closing.
          
          He's pushing to get airborne.        Seventy-five yards between
          them.
          
          Gap narrows fast.    Fifty yards.
          
          Stay on Carrie. Looks like suicide. She suddenly
          swerves a hard left, disappearing behind a berm --
          
          INSIDE WITH KELLER
          
          He bears a momentary sense of triumph, starts to get
          airborne -- until -- LAUNCHING UP OFF THE BERM is
          Carrie's snowmobile! She bails, letting it continue
          right toward him like a heat seeking missile as she
          tumbles down the berm.
          
          Keller's pov - a THOUSAND POUNDS of snowmobile comes at
          him fast -- obliterates the cockpit.
          
                                                             SMASH CUT TO
          
          
          CARRIE'S POV - AS THE IMPACT
          
          Cripples the plane, pitching it sideways. A wing catches
          the runway, CATAPULTING the entire plane into a cartwheel
          of disaster as it veers off the runway and --
          
          -- EXPLODES INTO A FIERY ERUPTION OF FLAME AND DEBRIS!
          
          Resume -
          
          Carrie slowly gets to her feet. The flames reflecting
          off her goggles. She heads to the wreckage. The cold
          and blowing snow extinguishing the flames quickly.
          
          AT THE WRECKAGE

          CONTINUED:
          
          Carrie approaches. Only a sputtering of flame remains on
          the front of the twisted remnants of the Otter's cockpit.
          The aft seems relatively intact. Carrie looks in.
          
          Sees the charred and already frozen remains of Keller.
          In the back -- the charred duffle bag. She moves closer.
          
          Reaches in through a broken window.       Pulls it out to the
          runway.
          
          Unzips it.    Is confused.    No cannisters.   Only survival
          gear.

          Delfy, along with Murphy and his two guys, carry Pryce
          in. Doc's in the back room with two others, loading the
          BODYBAGS onto a cart.

                       Doc!
          
          Doc quickly moves into the front room.      The other two
          follow. Curious.
          
          Doc springs into action, pulling on gloves.       Pryce's
          face, ashen.
          
                                     DOC
                       Get him on the table!
          
          They usher him onto one. He looks to Delfy who still has
          his hand on Pryce's wound.
          
                                     DOC (cont'd)

          Doc shifts his attention to one of Murphy's guys --

                       You, four units O-pos in the

          The guy heads for it.
          
          Carrie enters. She's still in her ECW gear.        Heart sinks
          when she sees Pryce.

          The wind   is hurricane fierce as Murphy and his two men

          skier.
          
          Camera stays on the fast moving storm, the plane, nowhere

          The LC-130 finally pushes out the front of it --
          AIRBORNE. Takes off into the horizon, where we see that

          Carrie is standing next to Pryce on the examination
          table. He's been bandaged up. Eyes closed. Looks
          thrashed. An IV drip hangs from a stand on wheels.
          
          She's looking at him with soft, caring eyes -- been
          through a lot. He slowly opens his. Tries to smile, not
          easy.

                    Nope.
          
          They both think on it for a moment.

                    What did we miss? Think Keller
                    cut and run without the stuff?
          
                                  CARRIE
                    After all this, no way. Keller
                    didn't have it on the plane
                    because he's got it hidden
                    somewhere.
                     (BEAT)
                    Where would he hide something for
                    six months. Somewhere he could be
                    sure no one would ever look.

                    have been crazy enough to come

          A SQUEAKY NOISE in the back of the room draws their
          attention. It's Doc coming through with the cart -- a
          bodybag on top.

          She sees it's Weiss' name on the tag, but something
          disturbing catches Carrie's eye -- it's Weiss' LEFT LEG
          pressing against the bag. Although the plastic is
          clouded, she'd swear his LEFT CALF has a LONG LINE OF
          STITCHES running down the side.

          Carrie slips in. We've been here before -- this is where
          she chased Rubin.
          
          Darkness creeps in, phantom like, as the remaining
          daylight FADES OUT through the row of windows that run
          along the side. Carrie's plunged into inky black.
          WINTER HAS SET IN.
          
          She HEARS the Science Lab door open before her -- peers
          through the dark blanket to see Doc walking toward her.
          
          Carrie slips in between two bookcases, trying to stay
          tight against the wall. Doc walks right by and out the
          door.
          
          She rises to her feet. Hurries down to the end.
          Disappears into the science building.

          Carrie enters. Turns on the light. Illuminates the lab
          stations, and the busted open doors of the Ready Room.
          Heads for the freezer.

          Storage racks of frozen science samples line the three
          walls. Lying on the floor are the bodies of Mooney,
          Rubin, Weiss and Keller.
          
          Carry goes to Weiss' body. Kneels next to him. Goes to
          unzip the bodybag, but sees that it's been locked with a
          plastic cinch.
          
          Pulls out her knife. Holds the light steady in her mouth
          as she cuts the cinch. Unzips the bag.
          
          Her light travels down his body to his left leg. She
          rolls it slightly for a better look. The truth hits her
          like a sledge hammer. There it is, like standing center
          stage in her light, the ROW OF STITCHES holding a deep
          gash tight together.
          
          She's about to stand and walk out, but she stops herself.
          Thinks about that leg, those stitches. The fact that Doc
          lied to her. Pans her light over at the other bodies on
          the floor. Her light pans back, explores the rest of
          Weiss' upper body -- sees a dried river of blood that's
          run out from under his armpit.

                       to look.
          
          She raises Weiss' arm.    More stitches.
          
          She cuts through them. Skin splits to reveal the BOTTOM
          OF A CANNISTER that's been stuffed inside his chest. She
          reaches in and pulls it out. Even has rust on the
          bottom. Carrie's confused -- IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THE
          CANNISTERS PRYCE SHOWED HER PHOTOS OF. It look more like
          THE ICE CORE CONTAINER SHE SAW AT MCMURDO.
          
          She contemplates opening it for a moment, then places her
          hand on the top. Begins to twist. It loosens easily.
          Pulls the lid off. Looks at it. Whatever it is, it's
          frozen. Tilts the can slightly, and out slides a FOOT
          LONG ICE CORE SAMPLE. Can't quite figure it out, until
          she shines her light on it --
          
          The freezer DANCES WITH GLISTENING LIGHT. The core
          sample is PACKED FULL OF DIAMONDS. She looks to the
          other two bodies.
          
          She opens Mooney's bag. Sees his chest is uneven -- more
          cylinders inside. Repeats the action with Rubin. Same
          thing.
          
          Carrie slowly stands -- the betrayal almost too much.

          OPEN, filling the space between Carrie and Doc with
          violent winds and blowing snow.
          
          Doc's throws one last look to Carrie, then takes two
          steps out the door.
          
          Disappears into the blanket of white.
          
          Wind and cold storm into the room against Carrie, who
          remains standing still like a statue. Emotionally
          drained. Numb. Freezing to death -- tears frozen to her
          cheeks.
          
          A shadow passes by her -- it's Pryce. He's hunkered over
          in pain, but forcing himself against the driving force of
          the wind into the Ready Room.
          
          Latches onto the door. It takes everything he's got, but
          he manages to get it closed. Instant silence.
          
          Cold to the bone, he grabs a jacket off the racket.
          Approaches Carrie, who remains staring at the closed
          door. The effects of the chill and Doc's decision
          apparent.
          
          Pryce wraps the coat around her shoulders.   Gently leads
          her away.
          
                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

          Slowly widen -- to see Carrie and Pryce, kicking back on
          lawn chairs, side-by-side. Two heat lamps pouring out
          bright, warm light. A cut out piece of paper in the
          shape of a palm leaf is taped to one of the lamps --
          throwing the shadow.
          
          Pryce has a small bandage over his shoulder.

                        WHO SHOT ROGER RABBIT?

     This movie starts the way all movies should... with a
     cartoon.  It's not a Disney or a Warner's.  It's not a
     Fleischer, an MGM, or a Lanz.  This is a lesser known
     studio.


     FADE IN:

     ON A "MAROON CARTOON"

     Accompanied by zany CARTOON MUSIC, the TITLE CARD reads:

                   MAROON CARTOONS PRESENT
                BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT
                           IN
                      "THE BUNNYSITTER"

     Below are two cameos of the cartoon's stars.  One picture is
     of a cherubic baby in a bonnet innocently posed with his
     thumb in his mouth.  The other is of a paunchy rabbit with a
     gap between his front teeth.  He has a loveable, if slightly
     shell-shocked look.  The cartoon begins...


     BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT

     are in a playpen when TWO FEMALE LEGS in high heels walk INTO
     FRAME.  The VOICE belonging to the legs talks down to Baby
     Herman in a maternal coo.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Mommy's going to the beauty parlor,
               darling.  But I'm leaving you with your
               favorite friend, Roger.  He's going to
               take very, very good care of you...
                      (voice turns
                       ominous)
               ... cause if he doesn't, he's going
               back to the science lab!

     Roger gulps as he watches the legs disappear.  We HEAR
     FOOTSTEPS recede and a DOOR SLAM.  Roger turns confidently
     back to his charge.  But the little tyke is already squeezing
     through the playpen bars.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Baby bye-bye...

     Roger makes a dive for him, misses, and gets his head stuck
     between the bars.  He pleads with the Baby in a voice that
     resonates of Huntz Hall in "The Bowery Boys".

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, come back!  You heard what your
               mother said!


     BABY HERMAN

     ignores Roger.  We FOLLOW HIM as he crawls into the kitchen.
     He stops to regard something that has caught his attention...
     a cookie jar.  It's sitting on top of the refrigerator.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Coo-kie.


     ROGER

     wearing the playpen like a pillory, comes running toward the
     kitchen.  But the playpen is too wide to clear the door.  The
     impact SHATTERING the playpen and sends Roger sprawling
     across the kitchen floor.  When he looks up...


     BABY HERMAN

     is swinging precariously on the door of the freeer.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hang on, Baby.  I'll save you!

     Roger makes a desperate leap across the kitchen for the kid.
     But Baby Herman swings the door to the freezer open and Roger
     disappears inside.  Baby Herman grabs a cookie and swings
     back, shutting the door.  He climbs down and crawls out of
     the kitchen.  After a beat, the freezer door opens.


     ROGER

     now shaped like a block of ice, falls out and hits the floor.
     The block SHATTERS into ice cubes.  Roger looks around,
     dazed.


     BABY HERMAN

     has taken this opportunity to crawl out the window.  Roger
     races to the window.  His eyes pop out of his head at what he
     sees.


     ROGER'S POV

     Baby Herman is crawling along the sidewalk under the shadow
     of a safe being hoisted into a second floor window by the
     Acme Safe Moving Company.  The rope holding the safe is
     fraying down to a slender thread.


     ROGER

     gasps and rockets out the window toward Baby Herman.  The
     rope snaps.  The safe falls.  Roger arrives just in time to
     pluck the Baby out of harm's way.  But not in time to save
     himself.  The safe CRUNCHES down on his head, burying Roger
     into the sidewalk.  After a beat, Roger's hand appears and
     spins the tumbler.  The safe door opens.  Inside, we see the
     dazed rabbit with little TWEETING BIRDS circling his head.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Cut, cut, cut!

     The cartoon action stops abruptly, but the goofy CARTOON
     MUSIC PLAYS ON.  We begin a slow PULL BACK TO REVEAL that
     this cartoon is being filmed LIVE ON A SOUND STAGE.  The
     title card sits on an easle.  The female legs are paper
     mache' props manipulated by two HUMAN CREW MEMBERS.  Wearily,
     they lean the legs up against the stage wall.  A human
     DIRECTOR, wearing a tweed jacket and baggy pleated pants,
     steps onto the set.  From the equipment and the dress of the
     crew, we can tell it's the 1940's.  Baby Herman throws his
     cookie down in disgust.  He talks in a gravelly voice an
     octave lower than Wallace Beery's.

                               BABY HERMAN
               What the hell was wrong with that
               take??

                               DIRECTOR
               Nothin' with you, Baby Herman.  It's on
               Roger... again!
                      (over shoulder)
               Hey!  Could we lose the playback?

     The MUSIC suddenly STOPS as, off to the side, the SOUNDMAN
     lifts the needle off a phonograph record.  The Director leans
     over Roger and angrily plucks one of the birds circling his
     head.

                               DIRECTOR
                      (continuing)
               What's this, Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               A tweeting bird?

                               DIRECTOR
               That's right, a tweeting bird.  But
               what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets
               conked.  Rabbit sees stars!'  Not
               birds, stars!

                               BABY HERMAN
               Aw, for cryin' out loud, Roger!  I'll
               be in my trailer... takin' a nap!

     Baby Herman pulls himself up to his full height of two feet
     and walks off the set.  He chooses a route that takes him
     under the dress of the SCRIPT GIRL.  She jumps as if goosed.
     Now two CREW MEMBERS lift the safe off Roger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars,
               I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my
               head one more time.

                               DIRECTOR
               I've already dropped it on you
               twenty-three times.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry about me.  I can take it.

                               DIRECTOR
               I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried
               about the safe.

     CONTINUED PULLBACK.

     What we've been seeing has been from the POV of a MAN in a
     shiny brown suit standing unobtrusively at the back of the
     sound stage.  Under a beat-up fedora is a craggy face that's
     seen a lot in its life... but apparently didn't think much of
     it was funny.  EDDIE VALIANT takes a jolt from a pint of
     whiskey, evidently in reaction to what he's seen.  He opens
     his coat and returns the pint bottle to a shoulder holster
     which had formerly held a .38.  Nerves steadied, he walks out
     the stage door.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - DAY

     Valiant emerges from the stage onto a bustling Hollywood
     studio lot where CARTOON CHARACTERS (TOONS) and humans are
     comingling as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
     Valiant stops by an Acme Novelty truck which is unloading
     Toon props.  There are bombs, rockets, flattened pocket
     watches, anvils, giant slingshots, etcetera.  The license
     plate is California 1946.  He fishes out a pack of
     Chesterfields and taps out a half a butt that had been
     stubbed out.  As he lights it, Valiant regards a chubby,
     balding man wearing a three-piece suit and a worried
     expression coming towards him.  He is R.K. MAROON, studio
     boss.  Maroon is leading an entourage of ASSISTANTS trying to
     keep up.

                               MAROON
               Starting tomorrow there'll be no more
               roast beef lunches.  What happened to
               cheese sandwiches?  I was raised on
               cheese sandwiches.

     As the Assistants dutifully record his thoughts, Maroon sees
     a GUY taking a nap in the shade of a palm tree.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               And tell that guy sleepin' over there
               he's fired!
 
                               ASSISTANT
               It's your wife's brother, R.K.

                               MAROON
                      (reconsiders)
               Oh... tell him he's promoted.  But get
               him out of my sight.

     As the Assistants disperse, Maroon approaches Valiant.

                               MAROON
               Valiant, did you see the rabbit?

                               VALIANT
               He was blowin' his lines, all right.
               So what?

                               MAROON
               So what?  He's already put me three
               weeks behind on the shooting schedule!

     Now an EDITH HEAD-TYPE hustles up to show Maroon several
     costume designs.

                               COSTUMER
               Your reaction, R.K.?

     Maroon quickly checks out the drawing.

                               MAROON
               No!  That's not funny.
 
     She flips another drawing.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               That's funny.  Put a homburg on him
               it'll even be funnier.  Huh, Valiant?

     He grabs the pad and shows Valiant.  The rendering is of a
     hippo in a pink polka-dot tu-tu.

                               VALIANT
                      (deadpan)
               Yeah, that'd be a riot.

     Maroon responds to Valiant's sarcasm with raised eyebrows.

                               MAROON
               Boy, I hope what you have ain't
               contagious or I'll be out of business.

     He hands the pad back to the designer, who departs.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               How much do you know about show
               business, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Only there's no business like it, no
               business I know.

     Valiant watches an ALLIGATOR in a rebel uniform dragging a
     brace of cannons and several TOADSTOOLS parade by.

                               MAROON
               Yeah, and there's no business as
               expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over
               budget on the latest Bunnysitter
               cartoon and it's all because that
               rabbit can't keep his mind on his work.
               And you know why?

                               VALIANT
               One too many safes dropped on his head?

                               MAROON
               Nah, that goes with the territory.
               He's a stunt bunny.

     Maroon takes a copy of the "Hollywood Tattler" out of his
     pocket.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Here's the problem...
                      (reads)
               "Seen cooing over calamari with
               notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica
               Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".
                      (looks up)
               His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's
               Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him
               up.

                               VALIANT
               So what do you want me to do?

                               MAROON
               Get me a couple juicy pictures.
               Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up
               with.

                               VALIANT
               I don't work in Toontown.

                               MAROON
               You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife
               sings at an underground Toon revue
               joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You
               can catch her in action there.

                               VALIANT
               The job's gonna cost you a hundred
               bucks.

                               MAROON
               A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.

                               VALIANT
               So's the job.

     Valiant starts to walk away.

                               MAROON
               All right, all right... You got your
               hundred bucks.

     Maroon turns, snaps his fingers.  His Assistant appears out
     of nowhere with Maroon's checkbook and a pen.  The Assistant
     turns and stoops so that Maroon can write the check on his
     back.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the
               pictures.

     Maroon tears the check off and hands it to Valiant.  Suddenly
     Valiant ducks in reflex to a large shadow that passes
     overhead.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing;
                       chuckles)
               Kinda jumpy aren't you, Valiant?  It's
               just Dumbo.


     ABOVE THEIR HEADS - DUMBO

     swoops back and forth, then hovers, ears flapping like a
     hummingbird.

                               MAROON
               I got him on loan from Disney.

                               VALIANT
               Aren't you the lucky one...

     Valiant grabs the check from Maroon and starts for the gate.

                               MAROON
               When will I hear from you?

                               VALIANT
               As soon as is humanly possible.

     We FOLLOW Valiant out the gate under a wrought iron sign that
     reads "Maroon Cartoon Studios".  As he starts across the road
     he's almost run over by a Toon roadster that ROARS out of the
     gates.  When it BLASTS ITS HORN, it's the FIRST FIVE NOTES
     from the WOODY WOODPECKER SONG:  "HA-HA-HA-HA-HA".  Valiant
     jumps back as the roadster passes.  WOODY THE WOODPECKER'S
     behind the wheel with a self-important smile on his face.
     Valiant angrily waves the cloud of Toon dust away.

                               VALIANT
                      (coughs)
               Damn Toons.


     ACROSS THE STREET - A TROLLEY CAR

     is slowing to a stop in front of the studio.  It's a Pacific
     and Electric "Red Car", part of a vast system of electric
     trollies that once criss-crossed the L.A. Basin.  Valiant
     steps onto the "Red Car".  He reaches into his pocket to give
     the CONDUCTOR his nickel fare.  But he comes up with a
     handful of lint.  He holds out the check.

                               CONDUCTOR
               What do I look like, a bank?

     The Conductor jerks his thumb toward the door.  Valiant
     suffers the public humiliation,of having to step down past
     the rest of the boarding passengers.  He walks around to the
     back of the Red Car where a gang of TEN-YEAR-OLDS are
     loitering.  When the BELL SOUNDS and the Red Car starts to
     pull away, the Kids make a dash for a place on the cow
     catcher.  Valiant joins them.  We HOLD as the Red Car moves
     away and the street urchins regard their older partner in
     crime with curiosity.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     A BILLBOARD SIGN

     It reads:  "L.A.'s Pacific and Electric Red Car -- America's
     Finest Public Transportation System".  PAN DOWN to see that
     the sign is on the roof of the trolley terminal.  Red Cars
     are going in and out of the shed.  MOVE IN on one car
     approaching the terminal from down the street.  As it passes
     by...


     VALIANT

     hops off his freeloader's seat on the back,

                               KID
               So long, mister.

     Valiant waves laconically.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the cigarettes.

     We FOLLOW Valiant as he crosses the street to a seedy
     bungalow.  A note is push-pinned to the door.


     CLOSE - NOTE

     It says:  "Tomorrow's Friday... Well?  Dolores".


     VALIANT

     takes the note and walks back across the street toward the
     terminal.  He climbs up a flight of stairs, heading for a bar
     on the mezzanine.  The bar sports a red neon sign that used
     to blink, "The Terminal Station Bar".  But now it just says,
     "Terminal".


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     The place must have been pretty swanky at the turn of the
     century when it was built in the first burst of enthusiasm
     over the new public transportation system.  It's in the motif
     of a trolley car.  There's a large map on the wail above the
     bar showing all the different lines.  Behind the bar is
     DOLORES.  If you scraped off all the makeup, you'd find an
     attractive woman in her late thirties.  She ministers to a
     rag-tag assortment of Hollywood low-lifes -- who are truly at
     the end of the line.


     VALIANT

     enters this den, lets his eyes adjust for a moment, then
     bellies up to the bar.  He finds a spot between a ONE-ARMED
     BLACK SOLDIER and a MIDGET stretched out on the bar passed
     out.  Now a TROLLEY RUMBLES underneath them.  The bar starts
     to shake like an earthquake, the lights flicker.  All the
     drinkers, observing a time honored ritual, lift their glasses
     simultaneously to avoid spilling any drops.  Even the Midget
     lifts his head until the trolley has passed.  Valiant reaches
     over the bar and blind-grabs a bottle of rye he obviously
     knows is there.  He pours himself a shot.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, fellas, what's the good word?

                               SOLDIER
               Lost my job.

     An ARTHRITIC COWBOY pipes up.

                               COWBOY
               Mule died.

     A DEAF-MUTE scribbles a note on a pad hanging around his
     neck.  He hands the note to Valiant.  It says "My girl dumped
     me".  Valiant pats him on the back, consoling.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you know what they say about
               dames, Augie...

     Then Valiant mouths the rest of it for Augie's benefit only.
     Augie reads his lips, then starts to roar silently, slapping
     his thigh.  Now Dolores makes her way down the bar.  She
     grabs the Midget by the suspenders and slides him out of the
     way.

                               DOLORES
               So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie?
               Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a
               dame who took a hundred bucks out of
               the till so your landlord would't
               throw you out of your dump.  And it was
               a dame who trusted you for the money
               when no one else in town would.  And
               it's a dame who's tired of waitin' for
               you to straighten yourself out and get
               a job!

                               VALIANT
               Would this be the same dame who's going
               to feel awfully foolish when she finds
               out I've got her money.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.  Dolores studies it.
     She calms down a little.

                               DOLORES
               This is fifty bucks.  I need
               seventy-five before they check the
               books tomorrow.

                               VALIANT
               You'll have it in the morning.  Now be
               a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to
               put in my pocket.

                               DOLORES
               Is this paper even good?

                               VALIANT
               Check the scrawl.

                               DOLORES
                      (reads)
               R.K. Maroon.

     Now ANGELO, a Neanderthal sitting a few stools down, is
     tapping the shell of a hardboiled egg.

                               ANGELO
               Maroon?  Valiant, don't tell me you're
               workin' for a Toon?  Who's your client?
               Chilly Willy or Screwy Squirrel?

     Angelo chuckles at his own joke and goes to eat his egg.
     Suddenly Valiant darkens.  He grabs Angelo by the shirt and
     pulls him up to his face.

                               VALIANT
               Get this straight, greaseball.  I'm not
               workin' for a Toon!  I'd never work for
               a Toon!  Got that?

     Valiant jams the whole egg into Angelo's mouth, turns and
     storms out the door.  Angelo sputters and spits out the egg.

                               ANGELO
               What's his problem?

                               DOLORES
               Toon killed his brother.


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - NIGHT

     Valiant knocks on the door of, a non-descript building in a
     run-down factory area.  A speakeasy style peephole slides
     open REVEALING the face of a TOON GORILLA.  Valiant offers
     the password.

                               VALIANT
               Walt sent me.

     The peephole slides closed and after a beat the door swings
     open.


     INT. CLUB

     The Gorilla, dressed in a tux, gives Valiant the once over.
     Valiant resents the assessment.

                               VALIANT
               Like your monkey suit.

                               GORILLA
               Wise ass...

     We FOLLOW Valiant down the hall toward the main room.  We can
     HEAR LAUGHTER and ZANY MUSIC from within.


     INT. MAIN ROOM

     When Valiant steps through the doorway, we see the place is
     no dive.  It's a white tablecloth nightclub on a par with the
     El Morroco or the Garden of Allah.  Behind the bar A
     CATERPILLAR BARTENDER is using his many arms to shake and
     pour several drinks at once.  Meanwhile a dozen PENGUIN
     WAITERS are gliding back and forth along the tables serving
     drinks to the well-heeled crowd.


     ON STAGE

     DONALD DUCK and DAFFY DUCK are seated opposite each other at
     matching grand pianos.  What begins as a decorous Duck duet
     on a Tchaikovsky piece (complete with knuckle-cracking,
     seat-spinning preparations) quickly accelerates to a loony
     game of one-upsmanship between these two irascible Ducks.
     There is keyboard stomping, lid-banging, piano wire plucking
     zaniness.


     THE AUDIENCE

     is HOWLING.  People are wiping the tears from their eyes
     they're laughing so hard.  All except...


     VALIANT

     He lights a cigarette impassively, not humored by the Toon
     hijinx.  He spots an empty table off to the side and makes
     his way towards it.  A SILLY GEEZER in a loud suit is at the
     next table.  The Geezer nods to him soberly as Valiant pulls
     Out the chair and sits down.  A LOUD FLATULENCE SOUND erupts
     from under Valiant.  The Geezer slaps his thigh with the
     hilarity of it all.

                               GEEZER
               Will you listen to that?  It's a pip!
               I'm thinking of callin' it a Whoopee
               Cushion.

     Valiant reaches under himself and comes up holding a deflated
     rubber bladder.  The Geezer retrieves it from him.

                               GEEZER
                       (continuing)
                No hard feelings, I hope.  Put 'er
                there...

     The Geezer grabs Valiant's hand before he can say no.  We
     HEAR A BUZZ.  Valiant retracts his hand as if shocked.  The
     Geezer howls with laughter and turns his palm to Eddie.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               Hand buzzer... real gasser.

     Valiant rolls his eyes and grabs a Penguin as it glides by.

                               VALIANT
               Scotch.

                               PENGUIN
               There's a two drink minimum.

                               VALIANT
               Just as long as there's no maximum.

                               GEEZER
               Waiter, I'll sign my check now.

     The Penguin puts a bill down on the Geezer's table and zips
     off.  The Geezer takes a fountain pen out of his jacket and
     writes on the bill.  But there doesn't seem to be any ink
     coming out.  He shakes and shakes the pen to get it flowing.
     It flows all right.  Ink splatters all over Valiant's shirt
     and pants.  Valiant looks down at the stain, doing a slow
     burn.  The Geezer starts laughing.  Valiant jumps up and
     grabs him by the lapels.

                               VALIANT
               That's it for you, pops!

                               GEEZER
                      (freaked)
               Calm down, son.  Look, the ink is gone.

     Valiant looks down at his shirt.  The stain is gone.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               See?  It disappears.

                               VALIANT
               Well, why don't you make like the ink?

     Valiant drops him into his chair and returns to his seat.
     The Penguin glides up with his drinks.  Valiant swallows the
     first one with one quick jerk of the head.


     ON STAGE

     Donald and Daffy's PIANO COMPETITION has reached a CRESCENDO
     of mayhem.  They've got the axes out, and in time with the
     MUSIC they reduce their pianos to matchsticks.  At the
     completion of the piece, they step to the front of the stage
     and with great decorum, arms around each other, they take
     their bows.  The curtain comes down to GREAT APPLAUSE.  We
     HEAR SFX of CRASHING AND BASHING backstage.  Now from behind
     Valiant, we HEAR a familiar high-pitched VOICE.

                               CIGARETTE GIRL
               Cigars... cigarettes... Eddie?

     Valiant turns to see BETTY BOOP standing with a box of
     tobacco wares strapped around her neck.  In contrast to all
     the other Toons, Betty's in black and white.

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (continuing)
               Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We
               miss you in Toontown.

                               VALIANT
               Wish I could say the same.  What're you
               doin' here, Betty?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Work's been slow for me since the
               cartoons went to color.  But I still
               got it, Eddie...
                      (sings)
               'Boop boop be-doop'.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, you still got it, Betty.
                      (indicates
                       Geezer)
               Who's Mr. Jocularity?

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (leans in)
               That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.

                               VALIANT
               Shoulda guessed.

                               BETTY BOOP
               He comes here every night to see
               Jessica Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               Big on the musical comedy, huh?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Sounds like you ve never seen her,
               Eddie.

     Now the lights dim and Betty moves on.


     ON STAGE

     the dour DROOPY walks out with the spotlight following him.
     He's the evening's emcee.

                               DROOPY
                      (deadpan)
               Hello, everybody.  I hope you're all
               having as much fun as I am.  I have a
               small announcement to make.  Jessica
               Rabbit will not be able to sing
               tonight.

     There's a ROAR OF DISAPPROVAL from the men in the crowd.
     They shower him with debris.

                               DROOPY
                      (continuing;
                       deadpan)
               I was merely jesting.  Without further
               ado... here's woman times two,
               Toontown's own chanteuse par
               excellance... Jessica Rabbit!

     There is excited APPLAUSE as the lights dim. A TOON COMBO
     made up of CROWS in shades STRIKES UP the intro to the smokey
     song, "Why Don't You Do Right".  A spotlight hits the
     curtain. Now a curvaceous leg pokes out, teasingly.  The
     crowd goes wild as the rest of the body belonging to the leg
     emerges.  JESSICA RABBIT is a generously endowed red-headed
     bombshell.  She's a humanoid Toon... in her case, more
     beautiful than human.  Her figure is testimony to what a guy
     can do with a pencil and a fertile imagination,


     REACTION - VALIANT

     This is not quite the bunny he expected Roger to be married
     to.  His jaw drops.  And his reaction is mirrored all around
     the room.  The men are panting so hard you couldn't keep a
     match lit.


     CLOSEUP - JESSICA

     as she steps to the mike.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (sings)
               'You had plenty of money back
                  in '22
               You let other woman make a fool
                  of you
               Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...
               Get out of here and
               Get me the money too...'

     Jessica takes the mike and comes off the stage.  Slinkily.
     she wanders among the tables, teasing the men as she goes.

     Now there's a HOWL from behind Valiant.  A Tex Avery type
     TOON WOLF, who came masquerading as a human, couldn't help
     but show his true colors at the sight of Jessica.  He HOWLS
     as if it were a full moon.  His tongue rolls out of his head
     and piles up on the floor like so much clothesline.  His
     eyeballs telescope out of his head.  And finally, the Wolf
     levitates and snaps rigid like an open jacknife.  As the Wolf
     makes a rush for the stage, the Gorilla Bouncer grabs him by
     the suspenders.  The Wolf, legs spinning madly, practically
     knocks Valiant's table over as he grabs at Jessica.  But the
     Wolf has come to the end of his suspenders.  He snaps back
     toward the Gorilla who is holding an anvil in front of the
     suspenders.  CLANG!  The Wolf hits the anvil and slides to
     the floor.  The Gorilla calmly whisks him into a dustpan and
     carries him out.


     JESSICA

     like all good saloon singers, has continued her act
     undaunted.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (singing)
               'Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...'

     She sashays over to the Geezer's table.  Teasingly, she
     swirls the whisps of white hair onto his head into a Dairy
     Queen.  He giggles gleefully and makes a grab at Jessica.
     But she slips out of his grasp like mercury.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'You ain't got no money
               Ain't got no use for you...'

     Now Jessica works her way over to Eddie.  She stops at his
     table and sings tauntingly.  Then with a flourish, she throws
     herself in his lap, and belts out the finale.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'So get out of here...
               And get me the money toooo!'

     There is RAUCOUS APPLAUSE when she finishes.  Jessica looks
     deep into Eddie's eyes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Thanks for your lap.

     Before Eddie can reply, she jumps off, and slinks offstage,
     leaving Eddie a pile of human wreckage.  Valiant slugs the
     rest of his drink down to put out the fire in his libido.

     When the lights come up, Valiant looks over to where Acme is
     slicking down his eyebrows and patting his hair down.  He
     stands, picks up a bouquet of roses from the chair beside
     him, and as he passes Valiant's table, gives him a big wink.
     Valiant watches Acme disappear backstage.  He stands, drops
     a couple bucks on the table, and follows after him.


     BACKSTAGE

     Valiant steps past the curtain, keeping a discreet distance.
     He follows Marvin Acme down a corridor and around the corner.
     Acme stops and knocks on a dressing room door.  After a
     moment, it opens and Acme goes inside.  Valiant checks over
     his shoulder, but the backstage area is empty.  He eases over
     to the door and puts his eye to the keyhole.


     POV THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Jessica is seated at her dressing table.  Acme is on his
     knees next to her, kissing his way up her gloved hand, eyes
     closed in ecstasy.  Jessica takes her hand out of the glove
     and starts combing her hair, leaving Marvin kissing a
     suspended Toon glove.


     ANGLE ON VALIANT

     while he continues his peeping.  The Gorilla bouncer sneaks
     up behind him.

                               GORILLA
               Hey, whaddaya think you're doin',
               chump?

                               VALIANT
               Who're you callin' chump, chimp?

     The Gorilla smiles sadistically when he recognizes Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               Oh, it's da comedian...

     The Gorilla grabs Valiant by the belt and lifts him off the
     ground.  He opens the fire door and heaves Valiant out.


     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

     Valiant comes flying out the door and CRASHES into a bunch of
     garbage cans in the alley.  The Gorilla stands in the doorvay
     regarding the dazed Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               And don't lemme catch your peepin' face
               around here again.  Got it?

                               VALIANT
               Ooga-booga.

     The Gorilla slams the door.  Valiant picks himself up out of
     the garbage.  He brushes himself off, then starts down the
     alley toward the rear of the building.  We FOLLOW him around
     the corner where he stops under Jessica's dressing room
     window.  He drags over a milk crate to stand on, takes a
     small camera out of his pocket and opens the bellows.  He
     stands on the crate and aims the camera through the corner of
     the window, as we HEAR the MUFFLED CONVERSATION from within.

                               ACME (O.S.)
               Are we going to play pattycake tonight?

                               JESSICA RABBIT (0.5.)
               Marvin, I have a headache...

                               ACME (O.S.)
                      (hurt)
               But you promised...

                               JESSICA RABBIT (O.S.)
               Oh, all right.  But this time take that
               hand buzzer off...

     Valiant's eyes widen in disgust.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus Christ...

     As he starts CLICKING pictures...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

     There's one light on in the Administration building.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     It's a large art deco office with walls covered with photos
     of Maroon and various celebrities, human and Toon.  R.K.
     Maroon is seated behind his desk.  Standing nearby is
     Valiant.  They are both regarding a hysterical Roger Rabbit,
     who's holding a set of 8 x lO glossies.  He's WAILING and
     CRYING, Toon tears flooding off him in a torrent.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Pattycake!  Pattycake!

                               VALIANT
               Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a
               good pair of shoes over it.

     ANGLE ON RUG

     Roger's tears have formed a puddle around the desk.  Valiant
     lifts a well-worn oxford and shakes the water off it.


     MAROON

     hands Roger his handkerchief.  Roger AAH-OO-GA'S his nose.

                               MAROON
               Take comfort, son, you're not the first
               man whose wife played pattycake on him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I don't believe it.  I won't believe
               it.

                               MAROON
               The pictures don't lie.  Mr. Valiant
               here took them himself.

     Roger takes another look at the pictures.


     CLOSE - PHOTOS

     They're shots of Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme seated knee
     to knee, caught in the act of slapping palms... really
     playing pattycake.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Maroon gets up and crosses to a bar table set up by the
     window.  He pours a drink from a crystal decanter as Roger
     starts sobbing again.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But Jessy... she's the light of my
               life, the apple of my eye, the cream in
               my coffee...

     Valiant eyes the booze longingly as he mutters to himself.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you better start thinkin' about
               drinkin' it black.

                               MAROON
               Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's
               been my friend and neighbor for thirty
               years.

     Maroon gestures out the window.  We see a blinking neon sign
     on the roof of the building across the street -- "Acme - If
     It's Acme - It's A Gasser!"

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Who would have thought he was the Sugar
               Daddy?

     Maroon turns and carries the drink to Roger.  Meanwhile,
     Valiant sidles over to the bar to help himself.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Well, the important thing now Roger, is
               to put all this behind you.
                      (hands him
                       drink)
               Drink this, son, you'll feel better.

     Roger takes the glass and shoots it down in one gulp.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               I know this all seems painful now, but
               you'll find someone new.  Won't he, Mr,
               Valiant?

     Eddie has just picked up the decanter to pour one for
     himself.

                               VALIANT
                      (over shoulder)
               Oh, yeah.  Good lookin' guy like him.
               Dames'll be breakin' his door down.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     The booze is taking its effect.  There's a RUMBLE like a
     volcano about to erupt.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     Toon steam whistle SHRIEKING.  The HIGH PITCH causes glass
     objects in the room to SHATTER... including the crystal
     decanter that Valiant's holding in his hand.  It EXPLODES,
     soaking his suit with booze.  Valiant looks down at the
     damage, completely exasperated.

                               VALIANT
               Son-of-a-bitch...
                      (turns)
               Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now,
               so about the rest of my fee...

                               MAROON
               Sure, Valiant, sure...

     Maroon sits at the desk and writes a check.

                               MAROON
               Being experienced in these matrimonial
               matters, you have any advice for our
               friend here?

     Valiant crosses to the desk and takes the check.

                               VALIANT
               My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get
               yourself a quickie divorce.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Divorce?  Never!

     Suddenly Roger jumps onto Maroon's desk and grabs Valiant by
     the lapels.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Marriage is a two-way street and we're
               just experiencing a detour!  Jessica
               and I are going to get back together.
               We're going to be happy!   H-A-P-P-I!

     Roger zips off the desk and CRASHES out the window, leaving a
     rabbit outline in the glass... backlit by the blinking Acme
     sign.  Maroon and Valiant walk to the window and look out the
     rabbit-shaped hole in the window.

                               VALIANT
               At least he took it well.


     INT. VALIANT'S BUNGALOW - CLOSE - EMPTY BOOZE BOTTLE - EARLY
     MORNING

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL the bottle's on the floor next to the
     couch Valiant's passed out on.  He's still dressed in his
     clothes.  PAN the small studio apartment.  In the
     kitchen/alcove, Valiant has created a makeshift darkroom.  We
     see a curtain on a clothesline.  Various trays, and some
     pictures clipped up on clothespins.  The pictures depict
     Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme in various states of
     pattycake.  Now there is LOUD POUNDING on the door.  But it
     doesn't break through VaLiant's subconscious for several
     seconds.  Finally, he rouses, gets up and walks a crooked
     line to the door.  Valiant opens it and squints into the
     excruciating sunlight.  When his eyes focus, REVEAL a
     hang-dog POLICE DETECTIVE holding Eddie's morning paper.

                               VALIANT
               Lieutenant Santino... how ya doin'?

     Santino ignores the question and regards Valiant with a
     mixture of disgust and pity.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for
               a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               That's what you woke me up for?

     Santino flops open the morning paper.  Valiant's eyes narrow
     as he reads it.  The headline screams:  "TOON KILLS MAN!" And
     underneath:  "Marvin Acme Murdered at the Hands of Jealous
     Rabbit".  Santino throws the paper on the sofa.

                               LT. SANTINO
               You got trouble, Eddie.

     EXT. ACME FACTORY - DAY

     An L.A. police car turns into the yard of the Acme factory
     and pulls up in front of the old factory building.  There's
     all kinds of official activity in the yard... cop cars, a
     Coroner's truck, etcetera.

     Valiant and Santino get out of the police car.  Santino
     starts into the factory.  But he realizes Valiant's not
     following him.  He turns to see Valiant looking over the wall
     behind the factory, transfixed.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Now what?

                               VALIANT
               Just haven't been this close to
               Toontown for awhile.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The sky above the wall is a different color, a little bit
     more vibrant, a "Toon Blue", you might call it.


     SANTINO

     walks back and takes Valiant's arm.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Let's go, somebody wants to see you.

     Santino leads Valiant into the factory.


     INT. FACTORY - DAY

     It's a large warehouse filled with stacks of Toon gags,..
     boxes of dynamite, giant slingshots, boulders, everything
     you've ever seen in a Roadrunner cartoon.  Santino stops
     where a large black safe is imbedded at a cockeyed angle in
     the floor.  A FORENSIC TEAM is at work around the safe.
     They're chalking the outline around a body half obscured by
     the safe.

                               LT. SANTINO
               They say the rabbit got the safe idea
               from a cartoon he was makin' the other
               day.

                               VALIANT
               What a gasser.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Wait here...

     Santino walks to Acme's glassed office where a sobbing
     Jessica Rabbit is being interrogated.  We can only see her,
     not the person doing the interrogating.  Valiant sidles over
     to where the Forensic Guys are dusting the photographs he had
     taken for prints.  One of the Forensic Guys looks up from his
     work.

                               FORENSIC #1
               Say, didn't you used to be Eddie
               Valiant?

     Valiant ignores the slings and arrows and surveys the scene
     of the crime.  The door of the safe is ajar.  Valiant tries
     to look inside.  Forensic #2 closes the door with his knee.

     Now we HEAR the VOICE of Jessica Rabbit from behind them.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Mr. Valiant?

     Valiant turns to the voice.  WHAP!  Jessica slaps him hard
     enough across the face to make his head turn.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               I hope you're proud of yourself.

     She turns on her heel and storms off, sobbing into a
     handkerchief.  Valiant, rubbing his jaw, looks after her.  So
     do the Forensic Guys.

                               FORENSIC #1
               She likes you, Valiant.

                               FORENSIC #2
                      (low wolf
                       whistle)
               When they drew her, they broke the
               pencil.

     Now two WHITE-JACKETS from the Coroner's office start to
     carry Acme out on a stretcher.  As they pass Valiant, a hand
     still wearing a Hand Buzzer flops out.  Valiant grabs it --
     stopping the stretcher.

                               VALIANT
               Makes you wonder what in the world she
               was doin' with a guy who didn't clean
               his fingernails.


     CLOSE - HAND

     Imbedded under the fingernails is a reddish-brown substance.

                               FORENSIC #1
               So... it's blood.


     VALIANT

     peels a piece of it off... it chips and falls to the ground.
     He squats to examine it.

                               VALIANT
               It's not blood, it's paint.

     Suddenly the end of a cane comes down on Valiant's hand,
     pinning it to the floor.  Valiant follows the cane UP to it's
     gavel-shaped head -- past black pants, a black robe, to a
     cadaver-like complected face, and a large hooked proboscis.
     The head is shaved.  Rimless tinted glasses obscure the eyes.
     Although he's human, the total appearance is frighteningly
     vulture-like.  JUDGE DOOM is accompanied by Santino.

                               DOOM
               Is this man removing evidence from the
               scene of a crime?

                               LT. SANTINO
                      (deferential)
               Uh... no, Judge Doom.  Valiant here was
               just about to hand it over, weren't
               you, Valiant?

                               DOOM
               I'll take that.

     Doom takes his cane off Eddie's hand and reaches out for the
     paint chip.  Valiant palms a piece and drops a smaller piece
     into Doom's hand.  Doom examines it.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Looks like the deceased grabbed a
               handful of your client's pantaloons,
               Mr. Valiant.

     Valiant stands to face the Judge, who towers over him.

                               VALIANT
               He's not my client.  I was workin' for
               R.K. Maroon.

                               DOOM
               Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told
               us the rabbit became quite agitated
               when you showed him the pictures, and
               said nothing would stand in the way of
               him getting his wife back.  Is that
               true?

                               VALIANT
               Hey, pal, do I look like a
               stenographer?

                               LT. SANTINO
               Watch your mouth, Eddie, he's a judge.

     Doom smiles thinly at Valiant, tarns and walks with purpose
     towards the door.  Santino and Valiant follow.

                               DOOM
               The rabbit's movements are fairly clear
               after leaving the Maroon Studios.  He
               ran across the street, jimmied this
               door open, hoisted the safe on a block
               and tackle...


     EXT. ACME FACTORY

     Doom leads them outside and indicates a window.

                               DOOM
               ... then stood out here waiting for his
               prey.  After he cold-bloodedly
               accomplished his task, he went home.
               He was almost apprehended there by my
               men.

     Doom nods his head toward a group of sinister WEASLES (a la
     Disney's "Wind In The Willows").  They're loitering by a
     dogcatcher's wagon with "Toontown Control" on the side,
     cleaning their fingernails with switchblades and polishing
     Toon revolvers.
         
                               VALIANT
               Men?  They look more like weasles to
               me.

                               DOOM
               Yes, I find that weasles have a special
               gift for the work.
                      (turns back to
                       Valiant)
               The rabbit didn't contact you by any
               chance, did he?

                               VALIANT
               Why would he contact me?  I just took
               some lousy pictures.

                               DOOM
               So you wouldn't have any idea where he
               might be?

                               VALIANT
               Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's
               very nice this time of year.

     Doom steps into Valiant's face.

                               DOOM
               I'm surprised you aren't more
               cooperative, Mr. Valiant.  A human has
               been murdered by a Toon.  Don't you
               appreciate the magnitude of that?  My
               goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to
               rein in the insanity.  To bring a
               semblance of law and order to a place
               where no civilized person has ever been
               able to step foot.
               The only way to do that is to make the
               Toons respect the law.

     Suddenly a "YA-HA-HOOEY" interrupts his pontification, as a
     scruffy little TOON GOPHER comes hurtling over the wall from
     the Toontown side.  He's holding his blackened rear end...
     apparently the result of a run-in with a stick of dynamite.
     BONK!  The Gopher hits Doom in the back of the head, sending
     them both sprawling.  The Gopher picks himself up and shakes
     off the effects of the concusion.  When he sees who he's
     knocked down, he panics.

                               GOPHER
                      (petrified)
               Judge Doom!  Here, let me get that for
               ya.

     He whips a clothes brush out of his back pocket and furiously
     tries to clean the Judge's cloak.  Doom picks up the Gopher
     by the scruff of the neck and gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               Why, you filthy little vagrant, you've
               soiled my robe!

                               GOPHER
               It's cleanin' up real good. Judge.

                               DOOM
               You've defiled a symbol of justice.

     As Doom carries the Gopher to the "Toontown Control" wagon,
     Valiant shoots a look to Santino.

                               VALIANT
                      (aside)
               Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?

                               LT. SANTINO
               No one knows.  He bought the election
               a few years back.  He's been rulin'
               Toontown ever since.

     When Doom gets to the wagon, the Weasles open up the back.
     In place of steel bars is a stream of fluid.  A Weasle turns
     a key and the flow of liquid stops.  The Gopher starts
     kicking furiously, trying to avoid the lock-up.

                                       GOPHER
                Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme
                go.  I think I hear my mother callin'
                me.

     Finally, the Gopher breaks free and makes a desperate dash
     for the wall.  Doom watches him run and calmly turns to where
     his car is parked.  It's a black Lincoln touring car with an
     ugly bird-like hood ornament.

                               DOOM
               Voltaire... the Gopher!

     Suddenly. the hood ornament SQUAWKS to life.  It's a hideous
     TOON VULTURE.  The Vulture flaps into flight.

     Just as the Gopher is about to make it over the top of the
     wall the Vulture's talons sink into his rear end and lift him
     airborne.  The Vulture drops the Gopher off with the Weasles.
     They pin him down.

                               GOPHER
               Hey, don't I have any rights?

                               DOOM
               Yes, you do... to a swift and speedy
               trial.

     One of the Weasles retrieves a briefcase from the sedan, puts
     it on the hood and snaps it open.  Twelve TOON KANGAROOS pop
     up, arranged in a jury box.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Court is now in session.

     He raps the Gopher on the head with the gavel end of his
     cane.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               The defendant is charged with vagrancy,
               assault and resisting arrest.  How do
               you find him?

     The Kangaroo court delivers the verdict instantly. Twelve
     LITTLE KANGAROOS pop up out of their Momma's pouches, holding
     up small cards, each with a letter spelling Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  He turns his attention back
     to the Gopher.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I hereby sentence you to the dip!

                               GOPHER
               Oh no, not the dip!  Anything but the
               dip!  I'm too young to die...

     As the Judge pulls on a black rubber glove, the Weasles take
     out a stainless steel tub WHEEZING with sadistic glee.  They
     fill it from a spigot on the truck.

                               VALIANT
               What's with the dip?

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's how he gets rid of the
               troublemakers.  It's a combination of
               acetone, turpentine and paint remover.
               He calls it the...  Final Solution.


     THE GOPHER

     is wriggling and SCREAMING bloody murder as Doom lifts him up
     and holds him over the tub.  Then, as he's lowered into the
     solution, he starts to disappear. His pathetic SCREAMS are
     snuffed MID-YELP.

                               GOPHER
               Help!  Help!  He...

     The Gopher's gone.  All that's left of him is a paint slick
     on the surface of the liquid.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus.

     Doom pulls off the black rubber gloves finger by finger and
     hands them to a Weasle.  He turns to Valiant.

                               DOOM
                They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
                but that's how we handle things in
                Toontown.  I would think you'd
                appreciate that.

     He gets into his car, he pauses and looks back at Valiant.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               After all, didn't a Toon kill your
               brother?


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Dolores is behind the bar cutting lemon peels and preparing
     for the day's bartending.  There's one early customer, a
     grey-haired TROLLEYMAN in his Red Car uniform.  His hat's on
     the stool next to him and he's already drunk.  The door
     opens.  It's Valiant.  He walks over to the bar, reaches for
     a bottle and a shot glass and helps himself.  Dolores picks
     up a copy of the morning paper.

                               DOLORES
               Hey, Eddie, looks like you really
               stepped in it this time.

                               VALIANT
               What are you complaining about?  Here's
               your fifty bucks.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (mumbling to
                       himself)
               Thirty-five years and all I got to show
               for it is a ticket punch.

                               VALIANT
               What's with Earl?

                               DOLORES
               A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some
               big company called Cloverleaf
               Industries.

                               VALIANT
               No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?

                               DOLORES
               Bastards put him on notice.

     Valiant picks up his glass. lifts it in toast to the
     Trolleyman.

                               VALIANT
               Here's to the pencil pushers.  May they
               all get lead poisoning.

     Now the Trolleyman unsteadily climbs up on his stool to get
     close to the Holy Grail... the Red Car route map over the
     bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (wistfully)
               The old Number Six Line... who'da
               thought they'd close that one down?

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, get him down from there.  He's
               gonna break his neck.

     Eddie grabs Earl around the legs and throws him over his
     shoulder like a sack of potatoes.  He carries him over to a
     booth and puts him down carefully, covering him with a
     tablecloth.

                               TROLLEYMAN
               Took you right to Toontown, it did.

                               VALIANT
               I know, I know... poor S.O.B.

     Valiant walks back to his drink at the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Do you think the rabbit did it?

                               VALIANT
               I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Make that a round.

     Valiant and Dolores look down the bar, but there's no one
     there.  Finally the familiar cowlick of Baby Herman rises to
     the top of the bar as he clambers up a barstool.

                               DOLORES
               We don't serve formula. Snookums.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You serve martinis, doncha?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah...

    Baby Herman slides his baby bottle down the bar to Dolores.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be
               wet.
                      (to Valiant)
               You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby
               Herman.

                               VALIANT
               I know who you are.  Kinda out of your
               neighborhood, aren't you?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a
               friend of mine's bein' framed.

                               VALIANT
               You mean the rabbit?  They got him
               cold.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You don't believe that.  I mean. the
               guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete
               fool...  but he'd never kill anyone.
               I know the guy.

     Dolores brings Baby Herman his baby bottle cocktail.

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (continuing)
               Thanks, doll.

     When Dolores turns around, Baby Herman pats her on the
     bottom.

                               DOLORES
                      (over her
                       shoulder)
               Oh, a ladies man, huh?

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (sotto voce; to
                       Valiant)
               My problem is I got a fifty-year-old
               lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

                               VALIANT
               My problem is I come here to drink in
               peace.  So if you don't mind...

                               BABY HERMAN
               C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole
               thing smell a bit funny to you?  I
               mean, no offense, but how did a
               mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in
               the first place?

                               DOLORES
                      (chiming in)
               Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an
               ad in the Yellow Pages.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.

                               BABY HERMAN
               And another thing, the paper said no
               will was found.  But every Toon knows
               Acme had a will and, in it he promised
               to leave Toontown to the Toons.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it then?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Somebody took it from him.  That's what
               this whole thing's about.

                               DOLORES
               The papers said the safe door was
               opened, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya,
               Dolores?

                               BABY HERMAN
               My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always
               was after Acme's property.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket and dangles it
     in front of Baby Herman.

                               BABY HERMAN
               No.  But neither does Roger.  That's
               Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise
               Orange.

                               DOLORES
               Well, I'll be...

                               BABY HERMAN
               So what's your next move, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               My next move?  That's easy.  I'm
               gettin' up, and I'm walkin' out the
               door, and I'm goin' home to bed.

     Valiant stands.

                               DOLORES
               So you're not even gonna bother to find
               out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?

                               VALIANT
               He's a Toon... who cares?

     Baby Herman shakes his head sorrowfully.  As Valiant heads
     for the door, Dolores whaps her towel down on the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Well, you used to care, Eddie.  And it
               didn t matter if a client's skin was
               black, white, or painted!

     Valiant ignores her and walks out the door.


     INT. VALIANT'S HOUSE - DAY

     Eddie comes in the door with his coat over his shoulder.  He
     tosses the jacket over the chair and walks to the Murphy bed.
     He grabs the strap, and loosening his tie, walks away from
     the wall, pulling the bed down.  What he doesn't see is...


     ROGER RABBIT

     asleep in the bed.


     VALIANT

     still with his back to Roger, sits down exhaustedly on the
     bed and kicks off his shoes.  He lies back and pulls the
     covers over him.  He closes his eyes, rolls over to get
     comfortable.  Now he and Roger are nose-to-nose.  They both
     open their eyes at the same time.  They freak.

                               VALIANT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

     They both jump out of the bed.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I needed a place to hide.  I'm in
               trouble, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could
               get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm
               here.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my
               house?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, I asked the newsboy on the
               corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked
               a janitor, the fireman and finally the
               green grocer down the way.  He was very
               helpful.

                               VALIANT
               In other words, the whole goddamn world
               knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!

     Eddie tries to open the door, but Roger blocks it
     spider-like, arms and legs extended.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Eddie, don't put me out.  I
               didn't do it, I swear.

     Valiant gives up trying to open the door and grabs Roger.  He
     pulls and he pulls.  Finally Roger snaps off like a broken
     rubber band.  The two of them go tumbling backward.  Valiant
     makes a grab for Roger but he slips out of his grasp like
     quicksilver.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Sure I wanted to win Jessy back, but
               not that way.

     Valiant lunges again.  Roger dodges.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               After I left you, I went to see her at
               the Ink & Paint Club.

     Valiant picks himself up and tries to catch his breath.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               She was on stage, so I found a piece of
               paper and wrote her a love letter.

     Roger pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and starts
     reading.

                                ROGER RABBIT
                       (continuing)
               'Dear Jessy.  How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the ways.  1-1000, 2-1000,
               3-1000...

     Valiant leaps for Roger and gets bim by the throat.  He rips
     the paper out of Roger's hand and crumples it up and throws
     it down.  He opens the door, throws Roger outside and quickly
     slams the door shut.  He leans against it, breathing hard.
     Suddenly, Roger comes through the mail slot like a limbo
     dancer.  Valiant, too tired to chase him, just watches him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, that wasn't very nice.

     He retrieves the love letter, straightens it and puts it back
     in his pocket.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               It took me almost an hour to compose
               that.  But I decided not to leave it
               anyway.  I'd read it in person, that
               was my plan.

     Valiant crosses to the kitchen area where the dark room is
     still set up.  He opens the cabinet under the sink and comes
     out with a bottle of Scotch.  He takes a shot glass and pours
     himself one.

                               VALIANT
               Look, pal, if you're still here when I
               finish this drink, I'm callin' the
               police.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya.
               The police'll just dip me.  They were
               waitin' for me when I got home last
               night.  I ran.

                               VALIANT
               If you're so innocent, why'd you run?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always
               run.

     Valiant shoots the drink down and holds up the empty glass.
         
                               VALIANT
               That's it.

     He crosses to the phone on the counter.  He lifts the
     receiver and starts to dial.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, this is the moment of truth!  And
               I've spoken the truth, but you won't
               believe the truth.  So I guess the
               truth is my goose is cooked, my hash is
               slung. my fait is accompli.

     As Valiant finishes dialing, he idly puts the empty shot
     glass down on a photograph on the counter.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Won't anything change your mind?

     Valiant turns from the pleading rabbit.  Now something he
     sees on the counter gets his attention.


     POV THROUGH SHOT GLASS

     The shot glass is resting on one of the reject pictures of
     Acme and Jessica.  The bottom of the glass is magnifying the
     back of the exuberant Marvin Acme.  Sticking out of his back
     pocket is a legal folder headed "Last Will and Testament".


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He looks as if the truth has just hit him in the face.

                               VALIANT
               The goddamn will.

                               VOICE
                      (on phone)
               L.A.P.D.?

     Valiant slowly returns the phone to the cradle,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You mean you believe me?

     Now outside we HEAR TIRES SCREECHING to a stop.  Roger runs
     to the window and pulls back the drapes.  His eyes bug out of
     his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's Toon Control!

     Valiant comes to the window and looks out, too.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The Toon Control wagon has stopped in front of the house.
     The Weasles pile out.  One of them takes what looks like a
     butterfly net out of the back.  Several others grab violin
     cases.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     Valiant jerks Roger back behind the curtain.

                               VALIANT
               Get away from that window.

     Roger, elated, jumps into Valiant's arms.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You're gonna help me?  How can I ever
               thank you?

     He plants a big wet Toon kiss on Valiant's lips.

                               VALIANT
               For starters... don't ever kiss me.


     EXT. BUNGALOW

     The Weasles are filing up the walk to the front door.  The
     leader pounds on the front door.

                               WEASLE
               Police...


     INT. BUNGALOW

     Valiant puts Roger down.

                               VALIANT
               I'll talk to 'em.  Find a place to
               hide.

     Roger zips to the closet door and goes inside.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Not in there.  That's the first place
               they'll look.

     Valiant goes to the closet and opens the door.  REVEAL Roger
     is now dressed in Eddie's trenchcoat and hat.  Playfully,
     Roger snaps one of the handcuffs onto Eddie's wrist.  He's
     got the Other attached to one of his wrists.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest!
               Just kidding...

                               VALIANT
               You idiot.  I lost the key for those
               cuffs.

     BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The KNOCKING is more impatient.  Valiant
     looks to the door.

                               WEASLE (O.S.)
               Open up!


     EXT. VALIANT'S DOOR

     The Weasles open the violin cases and take out real tommy guns
     and shoulder them in teams of two.  Suddenly they unleash a
     torrent of MACHINE GUN FIRE, making the outline of a weasle
     in the door with BULLETS.  The leader blows on the cut-out
     and it falls in.  The Weasles file through one by one.


     INT. APARTMENT

     The Weasles don't bother to look around.  They all just start
     BLASTING.  Bullets fly every which way.  The barrage destroys
     Valiant's apartment in a matter of seconds.  When the
     shooting stops and the smoke clears, the Weasles look around.
     The head Weasle spots blood all over the kitchen floor.

                                WEASLE #1
               We got him.

     But when he looks behind the counter, it's only a shattered
     ketchup bottle.


     EXT. REAR OF APARTMENT

     Eddie and Roger, handcuffed together, are beating it down the
     alley.  Roger, being a rabbit, is beating it a lot faster.
     He's kicking up dust, his legs are blur.  Valiant stumbles
     trying to keep up.  When they round the corner, Roger slams
     on the brakes, Toon style.  Valiant goes skidding past him and
     is jerked to a stop like a dog on a short leash.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a
               Toon.

                               VALIANT
               Don't ever forget that.


     EXT. BUNGALOW - BACK WINDOW - THE WEASLES

     come piling out the window.  They start sniffing the ground.
     Suddenly one of them freezes on point, like a dog.  Another
     blows a HUNTER'S HORN and they're off on the trail.


     EXT. STREET - EDDIE AND ROGER

     emerge from the alley.  They pause momentarily to
     reconnoiter.  Eddie decides to go left, Roger right.  When
     they get to the end of the cuffs, they snap back into a pile.
     Valiant gets back to his feet and hauls Roger up angrily.

                               VALIANT
               This way, goof...

     They start across the street.  But Roger goes on one side of
     the Street sign, Eddie the other.  Roger coils around it like
     a tether ball.  Valiant yanks Roger off the sign and they
     duck across the street just as a trolley car passes.


     THE WEASLES

     come bloodhounding around the corner.  They search the street
     for signs of the fugitive.  But when they get to the trolley
     tracks, they stop, bewildered.

                               WEASLE #1
               Scent's cold.

                               WEASLE #2
               Pssst.

     He points toward the trolley car pulling into the Terminal
     Station.  They fall all over themselves scurrying over to the
     trolley.  They surround it and jump aboard, tommy-gun at the
     ready.


     INT. RED CAR

     The CONDUCTOR raises his hands like it was a hold-up.  A
     couple PASSENGERS scream as the Weasles search the car.  But
     no Roger or Eddie.  As quickly as they got on, they get off.


     EXT. RED CAR

     as it pulls away.  The Weasles look around perplexed.

                               WEASLE #1
               Funny... I could swear I smelled
               rabbit.


     ANGLE FROM ABOVE

     Eddie and Roger are balanced on the trolley wire above the
     Weasles' heads.  As the Weasles sniff around the barn, Eddie
     and Roger ease along the wire, using the wall of the Terminal
     Bar to lean on.


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - KITCHEN

     Dolores is preparing corned beef and cabbage.  The RADIO is
     PLAYING "MARES EAT OATS".  A NEWSCASTER breaks into the
     music.

                               NEWSCASTER
               News flash... Hollywood.  Citywide
               Toonhunt for Roger Rabbit, suspect in
               Acme slaying.  Police describe him as
               short, cuddly...  and psychotic.

     Dolores turns just as Roger's grinning face appears in the
     window.

                               DOLORES
                      (startled)
               Mother Mary...

     Now Eddie's face comes into view.  He motions for her to open
     the window.


     OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

     Roger and Eddie watch another trolley approach.  The contact
     arm sparks its way along the wire as it rolls along towards
     them.  Valiant watches as Dolores struggles to get the window
     open.

                               VALIANT
               Hurry, hurry...

     At the last second, the window opens.  Eddie jumps for the
     sill, Roger dangling from the cuffs as the trolley passes.


     INT. KITCHEN

     Dolores helps pull Valiant through the window.  Then he drags
     Roger inside.

                               DOLORES
               Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it
               is?

                               VALIANT
               Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

     Roger bows at the waist, takes her hand and kisses it like
     Charles Boyer

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Charmed, enchanted, pleasure's all
               mined.

                               DOLORES
               Where'd you find him?

                               VALIANT
               The Toon Fairy left him under my
               pillow.

     Now Roger spots a plate of freshly shucked corn.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               May I?

     Before she can answer, he grabs an ear, presses it to his
     lips and applies the typewriter method to it.  When he gets
     to the end of a row, we even HEAR the BING!

                               DOLORES
               He's a riot.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed
               to him.
                      (holds up
                       cuffs)
               Anybody in the back room?

                               DOLORES
               It's all yours.

     We FOLLOW Dolores as she leads Valiant and Roger across the
     hall.  She stops at a door, unlocks it, and leads them in.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     It's a tiny storage room/office with an institutional metal
     desk, a cot, and assorted janitorial supplies stacked around.
     Dolores shuts and locks the door behind her.  Valiant goes to
     a metal locker and digs through some tools, coming out with a
     hacksaw.  He sits on the cot and starts working on the cuffs.

                               DOLORES
               So you decided to help him after all?

                               VALIANT
               I oughta have my head examined.
                      (to Roger)
               Will you hold still?

     Roger quiets like a child for a moment as Valiant saws
     feverishly.  Then Roger slips his hand out of the cuff and
     holds his side while Eddie keeps sawing.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Does this help?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, that's better.

     Valiant saws a couple more strokes before the realization of
     what Roger's done hits him.  His face darkens.  Roger sees
     the look and sheepishly tries to recover by sticking his hand
     back in the cuff.

                               VALIANT
               You mean to tell me you coulda taken
               your hand outta that cuff at any time?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, no, not any time.  Only when it
               was funny.

     Valiant looks at Roger like he's about to brain him.  Roger
     pulls his hand free again, and cowers out of range.  Valiant
     just rubs his forehead.

                               VALIANT
               Are you always this funny, or only on
               days when you're wanted for murder?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My philosophy is if you don't have a
               sense of humor, you're better off dead.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah... well you just might get your
               wish.

                               DOLORES
               Can you get him out of it, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               If I can find whoever wanted to kill
               Acme bad enough to get this.

     Valiant throws the pattycake picture down on the table.
     Dolores and Roger both examine it closely.

                               DOLORES
               Acme's will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               So that's what this little drama is all
               about.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of
               the sound mind, your wife the sound
               body.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I resent that innuendo!  My wife is
               completely innocent.

                               VALIANT
               Your wife may be a lot of things, pal,
               but innocent isn't one of them.

                               DOLORES
               So what's the scam, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody
               wants Acme's property.  Cack the old
               man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the
               will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               The habeus corpus is thickening.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't
               think they got the will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               How do you know that?

                               VALIANT
               Well, Acme had the will in his pocket
               that night at the club.  It was gone in
               the morning when the cops found the
               body.

                               DOLORES
               Maybe they just took it out of his
               pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Then why'd they bother to crack the
               safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from
               Mount Baldy and it won't open.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your
               logic is specious.  What prevented Mr.
               Acme from putting the will back in the
               safe before they killed him?

                               VALIANT
               Because he's not forty feet tall.  The
               safe was up on the ceiling, remember?

     Dolores whistles over his deductions.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow
               maybe I'll go down to probate court and
               see who's sniffin' around Acme's
               estate?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle
               Maroon's cage.

     Valiant finishes sawing the cuffs.  He stands and throws the
     cuffs aside.  Valiant and Dolores go to the door.  Roger
     follows them eagerly.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               What should I do?  Who should I see?
               Where should I go?

     Valiant turns.

                               VALIANT
               Nothin', no one, nowhere,

     He slams the door.


     INT. POLO LOUNGE - CLOSE - MAROON

     He's in a booth in the middle of a business lunch.

                               MAROON
               Maybe money grows on trees in Toontown,
               but not at the Maroon Studio.

     WIDEN THE SHOT to REVEAL that Maroon's sharing a booth with
     BUGS BUNNY and his AGENT.  Bugs is chewing on a carrot.

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Look, Doc, fiduciary considerations
               aside, Roger Rabbit may have been
               willing to play second banana to an
               ankle-biter, but I ain't.


     ACROSS THE ROOM

     A MAITRE D' is leading Valiant and Augie, the deaf-mute to a
     table by the door.

                               VALIANT
               This'll be fine, huh, Augie?

      Augie nods his head.  They sit and pick up the menus.  Augie
      takes one peek and looks at Valiant, alarmed.  He scribbles a
      note.  Valiant reads it.

                               VALIANT
               Forget about the prices, pal.  If you
               want the shrimp cocktail, you have a
               shrimp cocktail.
                      (puts menu
                       down)
               Excuse me, Augie, I've got a little
               table-hopping to do.

      Valiant gets up from the table and starts across the room.


      AT MAROON'S BOOTH

                               AGENT
               I think you should know, R.K., we're in
               negotiations for Bugs to star in his
               own series at Warner Brothers.

                               MAROON
               Trying to scare up a bidding war
               between me and Jack Warner, eh?  Well,
               it won't work.  I'll call William
               Morris and I'll have 'em put out a
               rabbit call the likes of which this
               town's never seen!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               It's your dime, Doc.

                               MAROON
               And stop callin' me Doc!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Eh, sure, Doc.

     Now Valiant arrives, pulls up a chair from next table and
     sits down.

                               VALIANT
               Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?

                               MAROON
               Valiant?  What're you doin' here?

                               VALIANT
               I Just thought I'd drop by and show you
               a photograph.

                               MAROON
               I've already seen your photographs.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought
               you might be interested.

     Valiant takes an enlargement of the pattycake shot and puts
     it on the table in front of Maroon.  We can clearly see the
     will sticking out of Acme's pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Anyway... enjoy your lunch.

     Valiant stands and departs.  But his visit has done it's
     trick.  Maroon looks l'ike he's seen a ghost.  We FOLLOW
     Valiant across the room to his table where Augie is
     blissfully attacking a shrimp cocktail.

                               VALIANT
               How is that, Augie, pretty good?

     Augie nods enthusiastically.  Valiant keeps an eye on
     Maroon's booth.  Now he nudges Augie as Maroon excuses
     himself and goes into the phone booth just outside the door.
     Augie puts his shrimp fork down and picks up his pencil.


     AUGIE'S POV

     We see Maroon talk on the phone MOS.  As his lips move,
     Valiant supplies his words.

                               VALIANT (V.O.)
               It's me.  Valiant says there's a will.
               I don't know what he's trying to
               pull...


     BACK TO SCENE

     Valiant is reading of Augie's pad as Augie reads Maroon's
     lips, and scribbles down what he says.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               Somebody's gonna have to take care of
               him.

     Augie looks up from his scribbling to exchange an eyebrow
     raising glance with Valiant.  Then he turns back to Maroon
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               The old man had it at the club that
               night.  That's right.  Yeah, I'm sure.
               I'll be there.

     Augie stops writing as Maroon hangs up the phone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing; to
                       Augie)
               Where?

     Augie shrugs his shoulders.  Disappointed, Valiant lights a
     cigarette.  Now Augie elbows him and gestures across at
     Maroon, who's making another call.  Augie starts writing
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       reading)
               Iris... cancel my appointments this
               afternoon.  I'll be at Forest Lawn.

     Maroon hangs up the phone and comes out of the phone booth.
     He hustles out of the room.  Valiant stands.

                               VALIANT
               You did great, Augie.  Have another
               shrimp cocktail.

     Valiant drops a twenty on the table and pats Augie on the
     back.


     EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

     A CARHOP wheels a yellow Packard up in front.  Maroon climbs
     in and ROARS off.  Valiant ENTERS THE FRAME.  He looks after
     Maroon, then calmly starts walking down the driveway.


     EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - RED CAR STOP - DAY

     A Red Car pulls up.  Valiant climbs off.  He calmly crosses
     the street and ducks behind the cemetery entranceway as
     Maroon's Packard ROARS through.

                               VALIANT
                      (impressed)
               Love that Red Car.

     As Valiant starts to walk up the hill...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE ACME FUNERAL SITE - LONG SHOT - DAY

     A hearse, and a line of black limos are parked in the lane.
     Nearby, Marvin Acme's funeral is in progress.  Clustered
     around a gravesite are the mourners... TOONS of every stripe.
     There's MICKEY MOUSE comforting MINNIE.  TOM AND JERRY.
     HECKLE AND JECKLE.  CHIP 'N DALE.  Everyone from the famous
     to the not so famous is in attendance.  The eulogy is being
     delivered in a familiar blustery Southern VOICE.  It's
     FOGHORN LEGHORN.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Today we commit the body of brother
               Acme to the cold, I say cold, cold
               ground.  We shed no tears for we know
               that Marvin is going to a better place.
               That high, high, I say that
               high-larious place up in the sky.

     Foghorn Leghorn dramatically points skyward.

                               TOONS
                      (in unison)
               A-men!


     NEW ANGLE - VALIANT

     is leaning up against a palm tree on the hill.  We have been
     watching the proceedings from his POV.  Now he sees Maroon's
     car pull up.  He moves around to the other side of the tree
     as Maroon passes and starts wending his way through the
     crowd.


     AT THE GRAVESITE

     Foghorn Leghorn nods to the funeral DIRECTOR, a pasty-faced
     human in a black mourning coat.  The Director starts to turn
     the crank lowering the coffin into the grave.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Give us a sign, brother Herman, that
               you've arrived...

     Much to the funeral Director's amazement, the crank starts
     PLINKING Out the tune to "POP GOES THE WEASLE".  Now the Toon
     mourners pick up on it and join in.

                               TOONS
                      (singing)
               Round and round the mullberry bush, The
               monkey chased the weasle...

     The crank and SONG start going FASTER AND FASTER.

                               TOONS
                      (continuing;
                       singing)
               The monkey raid it all was in fun.  POP!
               Goes the weasle.

     Suddenly half of the lid to Acme's coffin flies open and a
     harlequin CLOWN BOI-YOI-YOINGS out.  The funeral Director
     faints dead away as the Toon SOBS turn to LAUGHTER.  The
     Toons turn and head away from the grave comforted by a
     funeral befitting a gag king.  They climb into their cars and
     SCREECH off like the start of the Indy 500.  One mourner is
     left at the gravesite.  Sitting in a chair dabbing at her
     eyes with a handkerchief is Jessica Rabbit.  Maroon walks up
     behind her.

                               MAROON
               So... trying to pull a fast one on me,
               huh?

     Jessica turns, startled.  She stands and faces Maroon.


     VALIANT

     smiles and leans in.  This is the moment he's been waiting
     for.  Now just as the conversation begins, it is drowned out
     by the NOISE from a LAWN MOWER.  Valiant turns to see a
     GARDENER riding around on a small tractor cutting the grass.
     Valiant tries to flag him down as he watches Maroon and
     Jessica having an arguement.  There's accusatory finger
     pointing.  In pantomime, Maroon gestures into his pocket as
     if describing the position of Acme's will.

     Jessica tries to leave.  He grabs her arm.  They're screaming
     at each other but we don't hear a word.  Valiant waves
     frantically for the Gardener to cut the machine.  But the
     Gardener misconstrues it as a friendly greeting and waves
     back.  Valiant turns in time to see Jessica kick Maroon in
     the groin and stomp off to a red Auburn Speedster.  She jumps
     in and speeds away as Maroon staggers back to his car.  The
     Gardener stops the tractor next to Valiant.  He SHUTS OFF THE
     ENGINE.  The cemetery is completely still again.

                               GARDENER
               Somethin' you want, mister?

                               VALIANT
               Not anymore...


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT

     A Steinway piano truck is parked next to the stage door.  TWO
     husky PIANO MOVERS are rolling a baby grand up the ramp to
     the stage door.  They knock on the door.  The Gorilla opens
     it and they muscle the piano inside.  After a moment, they
     reemerge.  We FOLLOW them back to the truck where a second
     baby grand stands ready to be moved.

                               MOVER #1
               I don't know about you, but it makes me
               sick to think of these beautiful pianos
               gettin' chopped into match sticks every
               night by those screwy ducks.

     Struggling, they push this second piano into the club.


     INT. CLUB - BACKSTAGE

     They roll the piano over to the wall and park it next to the
     first.

                               MOVER #2
                      (shakes head)
               And they call it entertainment.

     As they go out the stage door, MOVE IN on the baby grand.


     INSIDE THE PIANO - VALIANT

     is lying prone -- using the Steinway as his own Trojan Horse.
     He lifts the piano lid to climb out, but then HEARS FOOTSTEPS
     approaching.  He lowers the lid again.  Now someone starts
     testing the keys.  We see the hammers strike the strings,
     RUNNING UP THE SCALES until they reach the one under
     Valiant's nose.  The hammer whacks Valiant's nose on the
     backswing and strikes the string making a terrible SOUR NOTE.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
                      (exasperated
                       QUACK)
               Phooey!  Out of tune again!

                               DAFFY DUCK (V.O.)
               Not to worry, Donald.  We can fix that
               with my sledgehammer.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
               Never mind, Daffy.  I've got an axe in
               my dressing room.

     Valiant's eyes widen.


     ANGLE ON PIANO

     as the VOICES of Daffy and Donald recede, Valiant raises the
     lid and quickly climbs out.  He eases over to Jessica's
     dressing room.  As he starts to open the door, he HEARS
     SCUFFLING from inside.  Valiant puts his ear to the door.
     More SCUFFLING.  Valiant straightens, then suddenly whips the
     door open and flicks on the light.


     INT. DRESSING ROOM

     Nobody's there.  Perplexed, Valiant closes the door behind
     him and checks behind the dressing screen.  In the closet.
     No one.  He shrugs and starts to search the room.  He goes to
     Jessica's dressing table and rifles the drawers.  In her
     purse he discovers a Toon revolver.  He examines it.

                               VALIANT
               Girl's gotta protect herself.

     Valiant puts the gun back in the purse and closes the drawer.
     As he stands, he pauses to consider a Hurrel-like
     black-and-white photo of Roger Rabbit in a silver deco frame.
     He's dramatically posed with a cigarette like he was Tyrone
     Power.

     Valiant shakes his head and turns from the table.  Something
     catches his eye.


     ANGLE ON FLOOR

     Behind the dressing table, the corner of a piece of blue
     paper peeks out.  Valiant stoops down and fishes it out.
     It's a cover for a legal document -- "Last Will and Testament
     -- Marvin Acme".


     VALIANT

     stands, pleased.  He opens the blue folder.  But it's empty.
     Valiant puts it in his inside pocket and turns to go when
     suddenly an unseen hand flicks the lights off.

                               VALIANT
               Son of a bitch...

     We can't see anything in the darkness.  But we hear the SOUND
     of A FISTFIGHT.  There's the CRASHING of lamps and furniture
     breaking.  Now the door opens for a second as the assailant
     escapes.  Light floods in the room, illuminating Valiant on
     the floor with a curtain wrapped around his head.  As he
     struggles free the door closes.  The room is dark again.
     Valiant scrambles to the door.  When he whips it open, REVEAL
     the Gorilla framed in the doorway.  Valiant is frozen.  The
     Gorilla flicks on the light.  He smiles wickedly.

                               GORILLA
               And here I tought we had mice.

     Valiant tries to make a break for it.  WHAM!  The Gorilla
     lays him out cold with a right cross.

                                              BLACKOUT.


     FADE IN:

     VALIANT'S POV FROM FLOOR

     As his vision comes INTO FOCUS, Valiant sees the Gorilla,
     Jessica Rabbit, the Weasles and Judge Doom are standing over
     him.

                               GORILLA
               ... I caught him rummagin' around in
               here.  Then I called you, Judge, on a
               counta you be da one we pay juice to.

                               DOOM
                      (clears throat)
               You did the right thing, Bongo.


     THE WEASLES

     pull a groggy Valiant upright and plop him in a chair in
     front of Doom.

                               DOOM
               Being caught breaking and entering is
               not very good advertising for a
               detective.  What were you looking for,
               Mr. Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Ask her...

     Valiant nods toward Jessica, who stands coolly smoking a
     cigarette.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Last week some heavy breather wanted
               one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe
               that's what he was after?

                               VALIANT
               Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I
               woulda broken into Frederick's of
               Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin
               Acme's will.

                               DOOM
               Marvin Acme had no will.  I should
               know, the probate is in my court.

                               VALIANT
               He had a will, all right.  She took it
               off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon
               knocked him off.  Then she set up her
               loving husband to take the fall.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You, Mr. Valiant, are either drunk or
               punch drunk.  Probably both.

                               DOOM
               These are bold accusations, Mr.
               Valiant.  I hope you have some proof?

                               VALIANT
               I found the cover the will came in
               behind the dressing table.

     Valiant reaches into his pocket.  But the blue envelope is
     gone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               They must've taken it off me.

                               DOOM
               They?

                               VALIANT
               The other people who were in here
               lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught
               'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted
               me.

     The Gorilla makes a move for Valiant.  Doom stops him.

                               DOOM
               Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr.
               Valiant our own way... downtown.

                               VALIANT
               Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of
               Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk
               to him.

                               DOOM
               Oh, not that downtown.  Toontown.

     The mention of Toontown has a visible impact on Valiant.

                               VALIANT
                      (nervous)
               You're not takin' me to downtown
               Toontown?

                               DOOM
               Indeed we are.  We'll continue the
               interrogation there.

                               VALIANT
                      (very agitated)
               I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me
               Santino.

                               DOOM
               You're a very stubborn man, Mr.
               Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show
               Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed
               men at the Toontown station...

     As the Weasles drag Valiant out of the room...

                               VALIANT
                      (screaming)
               No... you bastards!  Leggo of me!


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The Toon Control Wagon streaks along with the cat SIREN
     WAILING.  It flashes by then slams on the brakes at the
     entrance to an eerie tunnel.  A sign next to the tunnel says:
     "Toontown".


     INT. WAGON

     The Weasles look over at the bound and gagged Valiant.  One
     of them turns Valiant's head to look at the Toontown sign.

                               WEASLE #1
               What're you shakin' for?  Didn't you
               have a good time last time you were
               here?

     With a wicked WHEEZE, the driver floors it.


     EXT. TUNNEL

     The wagon disappears into the murky darkness.  PAN UP to the
     night sky.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     THE SKY - MORNING

     PAN DOWN to the tunnel.  We can't see into the darkness but
     we HEAR HOOTING and HOLLERING from within.  GUNS going off,
     FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING, WHIPS CRACKING, all accompanied by
     the WHEEZING LAUGHTER of the Weasles.

                               WEASLE #1 (O.S.)
               Soo-eey!  Soo-eey!

                               WEASLE #2 (O.S.)
               Let him go, boys.  I think he's got the
               message.

     After a beat, Valiant comes staggering out of the tunnel.
     He's got a burlap sack over his head tied around his waist.
     Behind him, the Weasles emerge holding paint cans and
     brushes.  They watch as he trips and falls by the side of the
     road.  The Weasles GIGGLE victoriously and head back inside.
     Valiant lies there for a moment, catching his breath.  Then
     he struggles to free his hands.  Finally he rips the sack off
     his head and sits up.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     We see he's got a huge Toon pig with a goofy grin painted
     over his head.  Valiant pulls and tugs on it, but this is a
     costume that won't come off.  Valiant curses, gets to his
     feet and stumbles down the road.


     EXT. RED CAR STOP

     Valiant gets in the back of the line of PASSENGERS boarding
     the Red Car.


     INT. RED CAR - VALIANT

     steps aboard.  The Trolleyman, who we recognize as Earl from
     the Terminal bar, does a double-take when he sees the
     ridiculously silly looking man/Toon.

                               EARL
               Here's one for the books... a Toon
               wearin' human clothes.

                               VALIANT
               Earl... it's me, Valiant.

                               EARL
               Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?

                               VALIANT
               Toon cops worked me over.

                               EARL
               Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real
               Toon-a-Roo.

                               VALIANT
                      (apprehensively)
               What am I, Earl?

     Earl breaks the news to Valiant soberly.

                               EARL
               You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

                               VALIANT
               No...

                               EARL
               Does it hurt?

                               VALIANT
               Not much.  It's hard to talk.

                               EARL
               Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you
               sit in the back so you won't cause as
               much of a commotion.

     Valiant tries to pull the brim of his hat down.  But it's
     comically small on the huge head.  He makes his way down the
     aisle past a veritable gauntlet of RAZZING, poking, tripping
     PASSENGERS.  Finally he finds an empty seat in the back as
     the Red Car starts up.


     A LITTLE KID

     wearing a baseball cap is sitting a few seats away with his
     MOTHER.  The Kid looks back at Eddie and laughs.  He leans
     over and whispers something to his Mom.

                               KID
               Can I, Mom?

                               MOMMY
               Go ahead, darling.  Take your bat.

     The Kid takes his baseball bat and approaches Valiant
     innocently.

                               KID
               Hi, Mr. Pig.  If I hit you on the head,
               will you make me a cuckoo bird?

     The Kid starts to take a swing with the bat.

                               VALIANT
               Kid, if you hit me on the head, I'm
               gonna throw you out this window.

     The Kid's eyes widen in terror.  This is not a typical Toon
     response.

                               KID
                      (crying)
                Mommy!


     INT. VALIANT'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

     We hear the SOUND of the SHOWER.  Valiant's hand reaches out
     past the shower curtain and grabs for a bottle.  But it's not
     shampoo.  It's turpentine.

                               VALIANT (O.S.)
               Dammit!

     CLOSE - TUB DRAIN

     The water swirling down the drain is tinged with paint of
     different colors.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He scrubs manically until the last of the pig head is gone.
     He rinses off and he feels around his face.  The absence of
     the Toon mask seems to bring him some relief.  He shuts off
     the shower and slides the shower curtain back.


     VALIANT'S POV - JESSICA RABBIT

     is leaning up against the doorjamb, dressed as usual, in a
     black cocktail dress with elbow length gloves and pearls.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the
               doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear
               it.

                               VALIANT
               That's because I don't have a doorbell.

     Jessica, caught in her lie, flutters her eyelids nervously.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.

                               VALIANT
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a
               towel.

     As she hands him a towel, she stares down at his anatomy.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               What's that thing?

     Valiant looks down at what she's referring to.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a
               mole before?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Toons aren't given imperfections.

                               VALIANT
               No?  I guess we're not counting lying,
               stealing and murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You've got the wrong idea about me.
               I'a a pawn in this just like poor
               Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll
               pay you anything.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta
               have the rabbit to make the scam work.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               No, no, no... I love my husband.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, sure.  I can just feature you
               standin' outside your little hutch,
               holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby
               to come home.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr,
               Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is
               being a woman looking the way I do.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it
               is bein' a man looking at a woman
               looking the way you do.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.

                               VALIANT
               I'm not complainin'.  But give me
               credit.  I'm the guy who took the
               pictures of you and Acme playin'
               pattycake, remember?

     Jessica takes a cigarette out of her purse.  She lights it
     and blows a cloud of Toon smoke.  It forms a recreation of
     what she describes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Maroon came to me.  He told me he'd
               fire Roger if I didn't do it.  I went
               along with him for Roger's sake.  It
               was only pattycake, after all.

     Valiant waves at the smoke scene, dispelling it.

                               VALIANT
               So altruistic.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It's the truth.  Why won't you believe
               it?

                               VALIANT
               Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I
               don't know what you're up to, lady, but
               I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               If I'm as bad as you think, what's
               stopping me from just killing you right
               now?

     Valiant reaches behind him and picks up a small cup on the
     sink.

                               VALIANT
               This cup of turpentine right here.  Go
               for that gun in your purse and I'm
               gonna let you have it.

     Jessica breaks down and starts sobbing.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, Mr, Valiant, please... you're my
               only hope.

     She comes to Eddie and hugs him, burying her head in his
     shoulder.

                                JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm weak... you're strong.  Can't you
               find a place somewhere in your heart to
               help me?

     Valiant looks down at the luscious creature in his arms,
     considering the request.  The moment is interrupted by the
     CLEARING of a VOICE.

                               DOLORES (O.C.)
               Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?

     Valiant, still in just a towel, sheepishly turns to face
     Dolores, who's standing in the doorway.

                               VALIANT
               Dolores...

     Dolores regards Jessica with undisguised contempt.

                               DOLORES
               Lemme guess... your cousin from Des
               Moines?

     Jessica straightens her dress.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Perhaps I should go.

                               DOLORES
               Must you?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Goodbye, Eddie... don't hate me.

     Jessica blows Eddie a TOON KISS which flies across the room,
     landing on Eddie's cheek.  She saunters past the smoldering
     Dolores and out the door.  Dolores walks to Eddie and peels
     the kiss off his cheek.  She crumples it up and throws it
     down in the wastebasket.

                               DOLORES
               What was that?

                               VALIANT
               That was the rabbit's wife.

                               DOLORES
               The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what
               she was doin' with her arms around you?

                               VALIANT
               Probably lookin' for a good place to
               stick a knife.

                               DOLORES
               I just stopped by to tell you that I
               checked out the Acme probate.

                               VALIANT
               Maroon, right?

                               DOLORES
               Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit
               again.

                               VALIANT
                      (startled)
               What the hell would they want with a
               gag factory?

                               DOLORES
               Got me.  But unless the will shows up
               by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

     As Valiant considers this new development, he cocks an ear.
     In the distance, we HEAR FAINT SINGING.

                               VALIANT
               What's that comin' from the bar?

                               DOLORES
                      (listens)
               Sounds like singin'.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, no...

     As Valiant grabs his pants...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Roger's out all right.  In fact, he's using the bar as a
     stage for a song and dance number.  The tune is extremely
     familiar.  In fact, it's the one that opens every Warner
     Brothers cartoon...  The Looney Tune Anthem.  But we've never
     heard words to go with it.

                               ROGER RAB3IT
               'The merry-go-round broke down
               But you don't see me frown...'

     Roger grabs Augie's pad and pencil, scribbles some drawings
     lightning fast.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'Things turned out fine
               And now she's mine...'

     Roger flips through the pad which in crude animation, shows
     the story of Roger and Jessica getting back together,
     culminating in them kissing in a heart.  Augie's delighted.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... Cause the merry-go-round
               Went round...
               Hoo-hoo, Hoo-hoo...'

     Roger does backflips and acts like an escapee from the acute
     ward.


     THE DOOR OPENS

     Eddie and Dolores enter.  Valiant stops in his tracks at the
     sight of Roger's performance... and the smiles on the faces
     of the sourpusses.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     doesn't see Eddie.  He moves into the next verse.  He twirls
     around on the post.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               'My name is Roger Rabbit
               I've got a crazy habit
               I like to sing and dance and yuk...'

     Roger goes to Angelo, lifts off his cap, and whacks his
     toupee, making it spin like a top.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... So brighten up and smile
               You schmuck'.

     All the regulars in the bar have a good laugh at that one.
     Now as Roger twirls around on the post, he smashes into a bar
     tray held by Eddie.  Valiant carries him toward the back
     room, but the irrepressable entertainer gets on his knees Al
     Jolson style and blows kisses to his audience.  The regulars
     are HOWLING as Roger is carried out.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Valiant flings Roger into the room and slams the door behind
     him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, don't I get an encore?

                               VALIANT
               Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out
               there riskin' my neck for you.   I come
               back here and you're singin' and
               dancin'.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But that's my calling, my purpose, my
               raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to
               make people laugh... and believe me,
               those people needed a laugh.

                               VALIANT
               And when they're done laughin' , they're
               gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo
               would rat on you for a nickel!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...

                               VALIANT
               An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He
               just got outta prison.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well... I still don't think he'd turn
               me in.

                               VALIANT
               Just because you got 'em to laugh?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie.
               Sometimes it's the only weapon we have
               in life.

                               VALIANT
               I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson
               variety.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I've met some cynical and miserable
               humans in my time.  But you, Edward
               Valiant, are positively funereal!

                               VALIANT
               Well, right now it's gonna be your
               funereal.

     Valiant takes his fist back to belt Roger.  Roger stands
     stoicly, jaw thrust forward, eyes closed.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead and throw that punch.
                      (opens one eye)
               But you'd be more successful with a
               punch line.

     Valiant drops his fist and rubs his temples with frustration.

                               VALIANT
               You're driving me crazy, you know that?
               Let's go... you ruined this as a hiding
               place.

     Valiant grabs Roger by the scruff of the neck and opens the
     door.  But he ducks back in quickly.


     VALIANT'S POW - THROUGH DOOR - JUDGE DOOM

     has entered the bar.  He stands FRAMED in the doorway,
     Voltaire perched on his shoulder.  The red light of the neon
     sign flashes on his glasses making him look like he's got
     burning coals for eyes.  With the Weasles at the door backing
     him up, the satanic Doom walks to the bar, his FOOTSTEPS
     CREAKING along the wooden floor.  He surveys the scene, leans
     over the bar for a glass.  Doom holds the glass up to the
     light and looks at it disgustedly.  He picks up a bottle of
     scotch and carries it down to where the one-armed Soldier is
     sitting.  Doom stares at him, then pulls the empty sleeve out
     of the amputee's pocket.  He uses it to wipe the inside of
     the glass.

                               DOOM
               I'm looking for a rabbit.  He was last
               seen in this neighborhood.

     The barflies avoid Doom's stare and shoot covered glances to
     one another.  But nobody says a word.  Doom pours a drink
     into his newly cleaned glass... then gently pours it down
     Voltaire's gullet.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               You couldn't miss him.  Buck teeth.
               Orange pants.  About yea big.

     Doom squashes the Midget's head down to approximate the size.

                               DOLORES
               There's no rabbit here, so don't harass
               my customers.

     Doom turns to Dolores.

                               DOOM
               I didn't come here to harass.  I came
               here to reward.

     Doom walks around Dolores toward the back.  But Doom stops
     next to the blackboard.  On it is written:  "Today's Special
     - French Dip - $ .50".  Doom erases the "French" and the
     decimal point in front of the "50".  Then he picks up the
     chalk and starts to write.  The CHALK SQUEAKS excruciatingly
     on the blackboard.  Everyone winces but watches anyway, as
     Doom writes "Rabbit" where the "French" was, and adds the
     zeroes to the "50".  It now reads:  "Rabbit Dip - $5000".


     AT THE BAR - ALL EYES

     are fixed on the figure on the blackboard.  Angelo licks his
     lips.

                               ANGELO
               Hey, I seen a rabbit...

     Angelo looks defensively at all his cronies and back to Doom.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               He's right here in the bar.

     But instead of pointing to the back of the bar, he talks to
     the empty barstool beside him.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               Say 'ello, Harvey.

     The tension is broken.  Everybody at the bar starts HOWLING.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Roger turns to Eddie victoriously.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My pal.


     IN THE BAR

     Doom stares down the regulars until the laughter stops.
     Meanwhile, a Weasle has started sniffing around the bar where
     Roger was dancing.  As Doom turns to leave, the Weasle
     whispers in his ear as he points to the back.  Doom smiles
     and pats the Weasle on the head.  He turns to Angelo and the
     others.

                                        DOOM
                Now we'll see who laughs best...

     The Weasle bloodhounds through the bar with Doom striding
     after him.  We FOLLOW them to the door to the back room.
     Doom rips the door open.


     INT. BACK ROON

     It's dark.  Doom flicks on the light.  REVEAL Valiant on the
     cot, his pint bottle cradled in his arm.  He blinks as if
     awakened from a drunken slumber.

                               DOOM
               Valiant?  Why is it that whenever my
               men smell a rabbit, you're there?

     Valiant plumps the pillow behind his head.

                               VALIANT
               Must be my cologne... Eau Dc Carrot.

                               WEASLE #1
                      (sniffs)
               He's in here all right, boss.

     Suddenly the Weasle grabs the pillow from under Valiant's
     head and carves it to shreds with a switchblade.  Feathers
     fly.  But no rabbit fur.

                               WEASLE #2
               Youse want we should take the place
               apart?

     The rest of the Weasles are arrayed behind Doom with Toon
     crowbars, picks, and a jackhammer.

                               DOOM
               No, Sergeant.  That won't be necessary.

     Doom walks over to the locker.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I know a trick that no Toon can resist.

     Doom raps on the locker with his knuckles.  Da-da-da-da-da...
     It's a familiar pattern that demands a Da-da response.  Doom
     moves to the desk and tries it again.  Da-da-da-da-da...


     INSIDE A MAXWELL HOUSE COFFEE CAN

     Roger is hiding while sweating out the urge to finish the
     familiar coda.  We HEAR the RAPPING again, closer.
     Da-da-da-da-da...  Roger's biting his nails.


     DOOM

     moves to the milk crate the coffee can is on.  Valiant gets
     up off the cot.

                               VALIANT
               You know, Doom, I don't know who's
               Toonier, you or the rabbit.

     Doom just smiles and knocks the pattern out on the crate.

                               DOOM
               Shave... and... a haircut...

     Roger bursts out of the can with the lid on his head.  He
     responds con brio.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Two... bits!
                      (looks around)
               Uh... oh...

     PSSSHEW!  Roger flies out the door.


     INT. THE BAR

     He streaks across the bar and out the front door.   After a
     beat, two Weasles step into the bar holding the butterfly net
     they had stretched across the door.  They WHEEZE with glee at
     the struggling Roger trapped inside.  A third Weasle carries
     the Judge's briefcase.

     Doom strides confidently into the bar.

                               WEASLE
               Oyez... oyez... oyez... court is now in
               session.

     Valiant and Dolores are led out by a couple Weasles holding
     guns on them.  As Doom snaps the briefcase open on the bar,
     the twelve Kangaroos pop up in their jury box.  Doom raps on
     the bar with his gavel-headed cane.  The regulars watch the
     bizarre scene in stunned silence.

                               DOOM
               Roger Rabbit is charged with the cold
               blooded murder of a human... Marvin
               Acme.  The jury will direct their
               attention to exhibits A, B, and C.

     The Weasles display photographs of Jessica and Acme playing
     pattycake, a blow-up of his fingerprints spelling
     RogerRabbitRogerRabbit in the whorls on the photographs, and
     a picture of Acme lying under the safe.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Motive, evidence, modus operandi.  How
               do you find the defendant?

     Once again the Kangaroo court wastes no time delivering the
     verdict.  The Baby Kangaroos pop up with their Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y signs.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  Now two Weasles wheel the
     stainless steel tub filled with dip into the bar.  Another
     hands Doom his black rubber gloves.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               For this heinous crime, I sentence you
               to the dip!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               No, no. not the dip!  Eddie, tell him
               I didn't do it!

                               VALIANT
               I don't think it's gonna matter.
               Sorry, pal, I tried.

                               DOOM
               Yes, and for that you're charged with
               aiding and abetting.  But we'll let
               Santino handle that.

     Doom pulls on the rubber gloves.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last
               request?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs?
               Just kidding.

                               VALIANT
               I think you want a drink.
                      (to Doom)
               How about it, Judge?

                               DOOM
               Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous
               tonight.  The successful conclusion of
               this case draws the curtain on my
               career as a jurist. I'm retiring to
               take a new role in the private sector.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to
               give you a gold watch.

     Valiant pours a glass of whiskey filling it all the way to
     the rim.  He holds it out to Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper
               for me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But, Eddie, you know what happens
               when...

                               VALIANT
               Drink it, jerk.  All of it.

     He grabs Roger's hand and forces the drink into it.  Roger
     shrugs his shoulders and shoots the drink down.  We've seen
     the reaction before.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     STEAM WHISTLE emitting such a PIERCING BLAST that is sends
     everyone into ear-grabbing agony.  Glasses, bottles, mirrors,
     even Doom's glasses SHATTER.  Valiant uses the distraction to
     punch the Weasles holding Roger.  He grabs the rabbit by the
     scruff of the neck. He gets as assist from Augie, who
     couldn't hear the noise.  Unfazed, Augie whacks a Weasle on
     the head with a barstool.  The Midget crawls behind Doom,
     who's been momentarily blinded.  The one-armed Soldier pushes
     him over.  Angelo is turning one Weasle's head around and
     around like a cruller.  Finally, Doom gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               After them you fools...

     As the Weasles regroup, Valiant tips the stainless steel tub
     over sending the dip spilling toward them.  The Weasles
     recoil from the liquid.  Even Doom takes a step backward.


     EXT. TERMINAL BAR

     Eddie and Roger race down the stairs and toward the Toon
     Control Wagon which is parked in front of Doom's Lincoln,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'.
               Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the
               noodle, the grey matter...

                               VALIANT
               If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin'
               from the law with a Toon?

     Valiant opens the door of the Toon Control wagon, and flings
     Roger inside roughly.


     INT. CAB

     Eddie goes to start the vehicle but the key is gone.   Now
     from behind them comes a DEEP RUMBLING VOICE somewhere
     between Lord Buckley and Barry White.

                               VOICE
               Excuse me, gentlemen...

     Eddie and Roger turn.  A snazzy TOON ROADSTER whose grill
     functions as it's mouth is talking from behind the liquid
     bars.

                               ROADSTER
                   If you effect my extrication, I
                   could offer you some carburetion.

     Valiant sighs with resignation and slides out of the cab,
     Roger in tow.


     EXT. REAR OF WAGON

     Eddie and Roger come racing around the side of the wagon.
     Valiant searches the back of the truck for the on/off switch.
     He finds it and turns off the flow of acetone.  The Roadster
     zips out of the truck and lands on the pavement, already
     flexing and limbering.   Behind him, a comical number of other
     TOON DETAINEES hop out like midgets out of a Volkswagon.

     They all head for the hills.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... what're we waitin' for, the
               William Tell Overture?


     ANGLE ON TERMINAL BAR - THE WEASLES

     come piling out.  They stack up like an Indian totem pole
     searching every direction.  One of them spots Eddie and
     Roger.  The Weasles stumble all over themselves in a mad
     scramble down the stairs.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     hop into the sleek two-seater.   Valiant looks at the myriad
     of goofy cartoon gauges and switches on the Roadster's
     dashboard.

                               VALIANT
               What do I do?

                               ROADSTER
               You don't have to do nothin'...

     With a ferocious RUBBER BURNING SQUEAL, the Roadster ROARS
     off in "no frames".  The exit is so fast that Eddie and Roger
     are left behind, hanging mid-air.  But before they hit the
     ground, the Roadster zips back INTO FRAME.  Eddie and Roger
     fall back into their seats.  The Roadster bends around so his
     grill is facing them.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Uh... except hang onto your hat.

     The Roadster ROARS off again in a cloud of Toon dust.


     INT. SANTINO'S COP CAR

     coming the other way.  It's followed by another squad car,
     both with SIRENS BLARING.  When the red blur streaks by, Lt.
     Santino turns to his PARTNER.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell was that?

                               PARTNER
               Speeding rabbit, Lieutenant.

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's what I was afraid of.


     EXT. STREET

     Santino's car does a 180 degree spin, and goes after the
     Roadster.  The second squad car follows.  The Weasles pile
     into the Toon Control wagon and join the chase.


     INT. THE ROADSTER

     rockets down the street, then takes a turn so wide that it
     drives up the front of the corner building, then back down on
     the sidewalk, just avoiding a newsstand.  The squad car
     following is not so dexterous.   It CRASHES into the stand,
     sending newspapers flying.


     THE ROADSTER

     looks back over it's shoulder, admiring his handiwork.

                               ROADSTER
               Read all about it, Benny's back in
               town!

     Up ahead, an egg delivery truck is double-parked in their
     lane.  Benny snaps around just as they're about to crash into
     the back of the truck.  There's nowhere to go.   But Benny's
     cool.

                               ROADSTER
               Going up...

     Suddenly, just before impact, the Toon suspension on the car
     accordions up, giving it a clearance of about fifteen feet...
     just enough to get over the truck.


     THE TOON CONTROL WAGON

     doesn't come with this unique feature.  It tries to avoid the
     truck but SMASHES into the back, splattering hundreds of eggs
     and sending the Weasles flying.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     look down from their suspended position at the chaos behind.

                               ROADSTER
               Next floor, sundries, knick knacks,
               escaped convicts.  Watch your step.

     The Roadster accordions back down to it's original height and
     speeds past TWO MOTORCYCLE COPS.  The motorcycles ROAR after
     them.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, Benny, what were you in for?

                               ROADSTER
               Reckless driving.  Do you believe that?

                               VALIANT
               Hard to imagine.

     Benny zig-zags through traffic, scooting between cars, but
     the Motorcycle Cops manage to stay on his tail.  Up ahead,
     traffic is stopped in his lane.  With nowhere to go, Benny
     passes a trolley car moving down the center of the street.
     Suddenly, he swerves in front of the trolley to elude the
     Cops... only to see another Red Car coming the other way.

                               ROADSTER
               Hold your breath, babies...

     Benny sucks in his girth and gets on his tip-toes as the
     trollies pass on either side of them.


     WIDE SHOT

     When the trollies clear, Benny staggers out from between them
     still on tip-toes.  Benny plops down, squashes, then pops up
     to his old self again.


     BEHIND THEM

     The crippled Toon Control wagon is struggling to keep up.
     Voltaire circles above the truck and picks two Weasles up off
     the roof.  They're each carrying several sticks of dynamite.


     FROM THE AIR

     We see Voltaire flying after the Roadster, which is speeding
     along the palm-lined Elysian Park Drive.  The Weasles light
     the dynamite sticks and with WHEEZING delight, bombard the
     car below.


     BENNY

     swerves right and left dodging the EXPLOSIONS.  Now a stick
     of dynamite falls into the back seat, fuse burning.  Benny
     looks back.

                               ROADSTER
               Hate to sound like Chicken Little, but
               is the sky falling or what?

     Eddie and Roger turn to see the dynamite, fuse burning low.
     Valiant makes a desperate grab for it.  But it rolls under
     the front seat.  Roger jumps in Eddie's lap.


     ABOVE - VOLTAIRE AND THE WEASLES

     satisfied that they've hit their target, swoop back to the
     Toon Control wagon.


     IN THE ROADSTER

     Valiant tries to untangle himself from Roger.

                               VALIANT
               Grab it, you idiot!

     Finally, at the last second, Roger reaches down and picks the
     dynamite up like a hot potato.  He flips it out of the
     Roadster.


     THE DYNAMITE

     spins through the air, finally landing on the roof just as
     Voltaire and the Weasles arrive.  BOOM!  The Toon Control
     wagon is demolished.  When the smoke clears we see the
     Weasles and Voltaire scattered roadside, faces blackened,
     feathers smoking.


     EXT. ECHO PARK STREET

     Benny is leading a merry chase up and down the hills.  Beside
     the two Motorcycles, there are half a dozen squad cars.  But
     as Benny comes over the last rise, we see the road deadends
     at Echo Park Lake.  The police have blocked off the
     perpendicular streets with squad cars.  Eddie and Roger see
     the deadend fast approaching.  Roger covers his eyes with his
     ears.  Valiant braces himself.

                               VALIANT
               The brakes!  The brakes!

     Benny hits the brakes.  Smoke pours out as they burn up and
     the momentum is barely broken.

                               ROADSTER
               Forget the brakes, who brought the
               water wings?

     The Roadster SMASHES through the wooden guard rail and sails
     out over the water.  KERPLOP!  It splashes down in the lake.


     THE POLICE CARS

     SCREECH to a stop at the edge of the lake.  Santino jumps out
     and regards the floating Roadster.  He turns to the other
     cops with a smirk.  When he turns back again, the smirk
     disappears from his face.


     ANGLE ON LAKE

     Benny is calmly swimming away using his fenders to do the
     crawl.  Now they pass a spooning COUPLE in a rowboat.  The
     couple regard them open-mouthed.


     THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

     Benny nears the shoreline, touches bottom and wades out.
     When they hit dry land, Benny shakes off like a dog.  He REVS
     HIS ENGINE.

                               ROADSTER
               Maybe it's my imagination, but I always
               seem to run better after I've had a
               wash.
                     (turns)
               Now where can I drop you cats?

     As Benny ROARS off...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Benny peeks around the corner, then tip-toes into view. down
     the alley until he stops in front of a back door.  Eddie and
     Roger climb out.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks, Benny.

                               ROADSTER
               If you ever need me, just stick out
               your thumb.

     WHOOSH!  Benny is gone.  Valiant goes to the door and unlocks
     it.  As he and Roger head up the back stairs...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. BUILDING - CLOSE - DOORWAY

     A hand painted design on the rippled glass shows a knight on
     a white charger.  On the shield in bold letters it says,
     "Veritas".  And lettered around it -- "Valiant and Valiant -
     Private Investigation".


     VALIANT

     sticks his key in the door and unlocks it.  Roger studies the
     banner.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other
                Valiant?

                               VALIANT
                My brother.  Get inside.

     He pushes Roger into the office.


     INT. OFFICE

     It's a typical detective office -- a couch, a sink, a window
     -- except for the partner's desk in the middle of the room.
     There's a chair on each side.  Valiant closes the door and
     locks it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                So what's our plan, our scenario, our
                modus operandi?

                               VALIANT
                We can't do anything till it's dark.

     Valiant picks up some yellowed newspapers off the couch and
     dumps them on the floor.  They leave a clean spot on the
     couch.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Guess you haven't been here in a while.
                     (reads
                      headline)
                'Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor'.

     Roger walks over to the wall.  He takes a framed picture off
     the wall which shows two guys clowning with Mickey Mouse.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Say, who's this guy laughin'?

                               VALIANT
                Me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've
                never seen you laugh before.  That your
                brother makin' the rabbit ears?

                               VALIANT
                What is this, Twenty Questions?

     Valiant grabs the picture from Roger and re-hangs it.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
                I'm gonna get some sleep.  I suggest
                you do the same.
         
     Valiant stretches out on the couch.  Roger nudges him to move
     over so he can lie down.  Grudgingly, Valiant slides over a
     fraction giving Roger a tiny piece of the couch.  They lie
     head to foot.


     CLOSEUP - VALIANT

     The problems of the day are knitting his brow.  Finally his
     eyes close.  After a beat, we HEAR Roger SNORING.  It's LOUD.
     Valiant's eyes pop open.  He rolls over.  WIDEN THE SHOT to
     see what he sees.


     ABOVE ROGER'S HEAD - A TOON DREAM BUBBLE

     has appeared.  Inside the bubble is a saw sawing back and
     forth through a log.  It is SYNCHRONIZED to the SOUND of
     Roger's SNORE.  Valiant kicks Roger, trying to stop the
     infernal SOUND.

     Roger sits up.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Huh?

     In the dream bubble, the saw cuts through the log.  One end
     of the log falls out of the bubble and BONKS Roger on the
     head, knocking him unconscious.  Valiant shakes his head and
     closes his eyes again.  We PAN UP off his face and PAST the
     window where the sun is setting.  As the CAMERA MOVES ALONG
     THE WALL, we see a gallery of framed newspaper clippings.
     "Valiant and Valiant Crack Popeye Kidnapping - Return Sweepea
     to Loving Arms of Parents".  And... "Brothers Find Brothers:
     Heckle and Jeckle Rescued From Redwood Forest!"  And...
     "Goofy Cleared of Atomic Spying Charges".  The PAN CONTINUES
     until we get to the window again.  Now it's dark outside.
     MOVE DOWN to Valiant's sleeping face.  He stirs. then opens
     one eye.  Now they both pop open at what he sees.


     VALIANT'S POV

     Roger has a magnifying glass an inch in front of his face
     that distorts his grinning face hideously.


     VALIANT

     startled from his sleep, reflexively shoves Roger away from
     him.  He flies into a swivel chair and goes spinning around.

                               VALIANT
                You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked
                you for the patsy.  Always gotta play
                the fool.  You make me sick!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience,
                but what happened to you that was so
                dark, lurid, embittering?

                               VALIANT
                You wanna know?  Well, since you're so
                goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of
                you Toons killed my brother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                A Toon?  Noooo.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who
                killed Bambi's mother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous,
                despicable... a smear on the drafting
                board.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and
                Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All
                Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em.
                And when this guy was accused of
                knockin' over the First National Bank
                of Toontown, we took his case.  But
                when we looked into it, we found out he
                did do it after all.  We went to his
                house to take him in.  But he was wise.
                He got the drop on us... literally.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (wincing)
                Safe?
         
                               VALIANT
                Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into
                Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.

     Now the PHONE on the desk RINGS.  Roger makes a move to it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                I'll get it.

                               VALIANT
                Get away from there.

     The PHONE RINGS TWO MORE TIMES and stops.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Wrong number?

                               VALIANT
                No, it's not.

     Valiant goes to the phone anticipating a RING which comes
     after a moment.  Valiant picks up the receiver.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Dolores?
         
                                              INTERCUT:


     DOLORES

     on the phone in the Terminal Bar.

                               DOLORES
               I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's
               called here about four times.  He says
               he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He
               says he can help you.

                               VALIANT
               I'll bet.

                               DOLORES
               Are you gonna call him, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               What've I got to lose?  You okay,
               Dolores?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah... they closed me down for a
               coupla weeks.

                               VALIANT
               That'll work out just fine.  When this
               thing is over, I'll take you to
               Catalina.  How does that sound?

                               DOLORES
               Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.

     Dolores hangs up the phone.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     VALIANT

     He CLICKS the switchhook and dials.
         
                               VALIANT
               Maroon?  Whaddaya want?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Have you got the will?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe.  Why?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock.
               If you've got the will maybe we can
               stop this thing.

                               VALIANT
               Stop what?

     CLICK.  Maroon has hung up.  Valiant hangs up the phone and
     goes to a wall safe.  He spins the combination.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are
               ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine
               o'clock.

                               VALIANT
               That's why I'll be there at 8:45.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I tell you what, maybe I better come
               with you.

                               VALIANT
               Forget it.

     Valiant reaches into the safe for a .38 revolver.  He checks
     the cylinder. Then he takes out a wooden box about 8" X 12".
     He closes the safe, picks up a black doctor's bag and puts
     the box and the revolver into it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a
               chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you
               think.

                               VALIANT
               How much is a shave and a haircut,
               Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               Two bits.

                               VALIANT
               I rest my case.

     Valiant goes to the door, pauses.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               If I don't make it back here by ten...

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               ... I'd head for Cucamonga.

     Valiant closes the door, leaving Roger alone.  Roger paces
     back and forth manically.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Cucamonga?  I don't know anybody in
               Cucamonga.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - NIGHT

     The lot is dark and deserted.  Now headlights cut through the
     darkness as Maroon's Packard pulls up in front of the
     Administration building.


     INT. CAR - MAROON

     reaches over and opens the glove compartment.  He takes out a
     small automatic.  But his hands are so slippery with
     perspiration, it falls to the floor.  Cursing, he takes out
     a handkerchief, wipes his hands and his face and picks up the
     gun again.  As he gets out of the car, we see the clock says
     8:55.


     INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - NIGHT

     Maroon hustles up to his office door.  He looks nervously
     over his shoulder, then goes inside.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE

     Maroon switches on the lights.  He goes to his desk.  He
     takes out the gun and puts it in the left hand drawer.  Then
     he takes it out and puts it in the right hand drawer.  Then
     back to the original drawer.  Finally satisfied, he goes to
     the bar to calm his obviously shattered nerves.  As his
     shakey hand starts to pour from the decanter, another hand
     comes INTO FRAME.

                               VALIANT
               Steady, R.K., that stuff's eighteen
               years old.

     Maroon jumps back as Valiant steps from behind the curtain,
     holding his black bag.

                               MAROON
               Valiant!  You surprised me.

                               VALIANT
               That was the idea.

     Valiant takes over the pouring duties.  He turns and carries
     Maroon's drink to him.  Maroon goes and sits down in his
     chair.  He looks to the pistol hiding place.  Valiant
     casually sits on the desk, putting his legs over the drawer.

                               VALIANT
               You're not too good at this, are you,
               R.K.?

                               MAROON
               No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker,
               not a murderer.

                               VALIANT
               Well, everybody needs a hobby.

                               MAROON
               No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I
               had nothin' to do with Acme gettin'
               killed.  I just wanted to sell my
               studio.  But they wouldn't buy my
               property unless Acme would sell his.
               And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna
               blackmail Acme with pictures of him and
               the rabbit's wife.

     Maroon gets up from his chair, highly agitated.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               But then it all went to hell.  I been
               around Toons all my life.  I can't sit
               around and see them all destroyed.

     Maroon eyes Valiant's black bag.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               You got the will in there, don't ya?

                               VALIANT
               No, I don't.

                               MAROON
               You tricked me, damn you!

                               VALIANT
               Take it easy.

                               MAROON
               There's no time to take it easy!  You
               don't realize the diabolical mind we're
               dealing with!


     ANGLE ON WINDOW

     A gun pokes through the open window past the curtain.  It's a
     Colt .45 Buntline -- an unmistakeable gun with an extra long
     barrel.

                               MAROON
               If I don't get that will by midnight
               tonight, Toontown's just gonna be land
               for the free...


     VALIANT

     sees a reflection of the gun on the glass on a movie poster
     on the wall.  He turns.  But it's too late.  BANG!  BANG!
     BANG!  Maroon crumples, caught mid-sentence.  Valiant dives
     behind the desk and draws his gun.  He looks over at Maroon's
     dead body on the floor.

                               VALIANT
               And the home of the brave?

     Valiant crawls to the window where the shots came from.  He
     looks out.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The comely silhouette of Jessica Rabbit runs to her car,
     jumps in and ROARS out the the studio gates.


     VALIANT

     grabs his black bag, climbs out of the office window and
     jumps off the fire escape to the lot below.


     EXT. STUDIO LOT

     Valiant hops into Maroon's Packard.  He hits the starter
     button and takes off after Jessica.


     NEW ANGLE

     as the car pulls away, the trunk lid lifts.  Roger Rabbit
     peers out, disoriented.  Then closes it.


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jessica's car speeds along.  Valiant is in close pursuit in
     the Packard.  He's about to catch up on the straightaway when
     Jessica's car disappears into a tunnel.


     VALIANT

     slams on his brakes.  The Packard goes fishtailing, finally
     spinning to a stop at the foot of the "Toontown" sign.

     Valiant gets out of the car.  He looks down the tunnel.  He's
     sweating.  He loosens his necktie.  He paces back and forth
     at the tunnel mouth.  He looks up at the Toontown sign and
     suddenly smashes it with his fist.  It spins around like a
     weathervane.

     Valiant walks to the Packard with purpose.  He grabs the
     black bag and puts it on the hood.  He opens it and takes out
     the wooden box.


     CLOSE - BOX

     as the clasp is popped and the box opened, REVEAL a stunning
     presentation model TOON .38 resting on crushed velvet.  It's
     everything a real gun could be... and more.  Each feature is
     exaggerated... the barrel, the cylinder, the ivory grips are
     all Toon-sized.


     VALIANT

     picks the gun up and hefts it respectfully.  Then he opens an
     ammo section in the wooden box. SIX TOON .38 DUM-DUM BULLETS
     are in velvet creases.  The Toon Bullets blink to life as if
     awakening from a long sleep.

                               DUM-DUM #l
                      (rubbing eyes)
               Eddie... is that really you?

                               VALIANT
               Uh-huh.

                               DUM-DUM #2
               What year is it?

                               VALIANT
               '46.

                               DUM-DUM #3
               Who won the war?

                               DUM-DUM #4
               Who do you think, dummy?

                               DUM-DUM #5
               Welcome back, Eddie.

                               DUM-DUM #6
               Where you been the last five years?

                               VALIANT
               Drunk.

     He opens the cylinder.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Feelin' frisky tonight, boys?

                               DUM-DUMS
               Yeah!

     The Bullets eagerly dive into their respective chambers.  He
     snaps the cylinder closed, reaches into his shoulder holster
     and takes out the pint bottle.  He unscrews the cap and pours
     the rest of the booze onto the ground.  When it's drained, he
     flings the bottle in the air and FIRES the Toon .38.  KA-POW!
     It makes a SOUND like a CANNON.


     THE TOON BULLET

     climbs like a rocket into the dark sky.  It SCREECHES up to
     the bottle, puts on the brakes.  The Bullet puts on a
     jeweler's eyepiece, then it whips out a little hammer and
     chisel acd delivers one delicate tap.


     VALIANT

     watches as a cut glass chandelier falls out of the sky and
     CRASHES at his feet.  Valiant holsters his weapon and climbs
     into the Packard.  He puts it in gear and pulls into the
     tunnel.


     IN THE TUNNEL - DRIVING

     As Valiant heads toward the proverbial light at the end of
     the tunnel, suddenly the CAR RADIO COMES ON.

                               RADIO ANNOUNCER
               ... From the tippy tip top of
               Toontown's Tip Top Club, this is Mellow
               Melody Matinee.  Here's our favorite
               cricket, Jimmy, with 'Give A Little
               Whistle'.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (on radio)
               'When you get in trouble, and you don't
               know right from wrong...'

     Valiant turns the on/off switch, then punches all the buttons
     but to no avail.  The SONG PLAYS ON anyway.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (continuing)
               '... Give a little whistle
               Give a little whistle...'

                               VALIANT
               I hate Toontown...

     As Jimmy croons on, Valiant emerges from the tunnel.


     VALIANT'S FOV

     Through the windshield we see we have arrived in Toontown,
     where it's a beautiful sunny day.  Eddie is now driving down
     a phantasmagorical boulevard in a completely animated world.
     It's a Max Fleischer version of a city neighborhood.  The
     trees and buildings are swaying in time with the MUSIC.
     Eddie looks to his left and sees a huge Aphrodite-like hood
     ornament on the front of a TOON CAR.  Then as the car starts
     to pass him he sees hood... hood... hood... more hood then a
     CHAUFFEUR, then more car, and finally the Wolf we remember
     from the Ink & Paint Club.  He's in top hat and tails, a TOON
     LAMB in the passenger seat.  He tips his hat.

                               WOLF
               Helloooo, cousin.

     Now he drives past a Toon building under construction.  Like
     everything else in Toontown. the construction company sports
     the name "Acme".  The sign out frontsays:  WATCH OUR
     PROGRESS.  Eddie looks up, and before he can drive by, the
     building gets built floor by floor with accompanying SFX in
     about two seconds.

     Up ahead, the street is clear for blocks.  Then suddenly cars
     pour out of all side streets at once, clogging the boulevard
     like arteriosclerosis.  There is mad HONKING in this cartoon
     traffic jam.  Eddie shakes his head.  He pulls over, parks
     and gets out.

     Valiant pulls out his Toon .38.  Suddenly, the street empties
     in the blink of an eye.  Shutters close, and the sidewalk
     rolls up like window shades.  It's so quiet you could hear a
     pin drop.  In fact, a PIN DROPS from a second story window,
     landing with the CLANG! of a manhole cover.  All is quiet
     again.  Valiant starts across the street -- there is a CREAK
     behind him.  Valiant whirls around, levelling his pistol at
     the sound.


     ANGLE ON PACKARD - ROGER

     peeks out of the trunk of Maroon's car.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't shoot, Eddie.  It's me.

     Valiant lowers the gun as Roger emerges.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin' in there?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I followed you to the Maroon Studios.
               When I heard those shots, I thought I'd
               help you and investigate the inside of
               this trunk.

     Valiant reaches into the black bag in the car.  He comes out
     with a pair of TOON HANDCUFFS.  He slaps one on Roger's
     wrist.

                               ROGER RA13BIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, what're you doin'?

     Valiant drags Roger to the steering wheel.

                               VALIANT
               I'm making sure you don't help me
               anymore.

     He locks the cuff to it, and heads across the street.


     AROUND THE CORNER - VALIANT

     stops at a street sign.  The post is bristling with fingers
     pointing in different directions; i.e., Poughkeepsie,
     Transylvania, Walla Walla, South Pole (the finger points down
     of course), and finally a finger which says:  The Dame.
     Eddie follows the finger down the side street to a high rise
     building.

     He catches a glimpse of Jessica darting into the elevators.
     Valiant hustles inside after her.

     Valiant goes to the elevators, and watches the floor
     indicator spinning round and Round, finally stopping with a
     BING at the 125th floor.  The elevator doors open and Valiant
     steps on.


     IN THE ELEVATOR

     Valiant punches 125.  Suddenly the elevator takes out with
     such velocity that Valiant is thrown to the floor.  After a
     moment, it stops so fast that he hits the ceiling.  Then
     bounces back to the floor as the doors open.  He picks
     himself up and steps off the elevator.

     He's in a foyer with four doors.  Valiant opens the first and
     steps inside.  He disappears.


     NEW ANGLE

     Valiant is on the outside of the building hanging onto a
     flagpole for dear life.  He looks down at the street which
     looks miles below.  Valiant inches back along the flagpole to
     the door and pulls himself to safety.


     INSIDE - VALIANT

     tries the next door.  This time more carefully.  A SPEEDING
     TRAIN is coming right at him.  He slams the door.  He tries
     the next one.  A homely OLD TOON LADY is in a bathtub.  She
     lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.  Valiant closes that door
     quickly, and turns to the last.  When he opens this one, we
     HEAR FOREBODING MUSIC.  We see...


     A DARK ALLEY

     Warily, Valiant walks into the alley, gun drawn.  There's a
     NOISE behind the garbage cans.  Valiant turns as a DEAD BODY
     with a knife in his back falls out of the shadows at
     Valiant's feet.  A SQUEAKY VOICE comes from behind Valiant.

                               VOICE
               I guess they didn't clean up after the
               last moider.

     Valiant whips around to see a TOON RAT perched on a skull
     picking his teeth.  Valiant kicks the skull.  The rat
     scrambles for cover.

     As Valiant continues on, we see...


     JESSICA RABBIT

     Steps out of the shadows behind him and aim the gun at his
     back.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't move, Valiant.

     Valiant turns slowly to see Jessica's got a bead on him with
     her revolver.

                               VALIANT
               Well... I always figured I'd get it in
               Toontown.

     BLAM!  She fires.  But Valiant's still standing.  We HEAR a
     CRASH behind Eddie as a figure falls into some boxes from a
     fire escape above.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I think I got him.

     Jessica runs past Valiant to the figure.  He follows,
     bewildered.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     We can see two rabbit ears sticking out from behind a box

                               VALIANT
               You shot Roger.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's
               men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.

     Jessica moves the box aside and tugs on the rabbit ears.  The
     rabbit head pops off.  Underneath is a Weasle.  In his hand
     is the Colt .45 Buntline.

                               VALIANT
               Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't worry, you're not the first.  We
               better get out of here.

     As they run down the alley...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE PACKARD - ROGER

     is behind the wheel making ENGINE NOISES like a little kid.
     He pushes all the buttons, windshield wipers, convertible
     top, etcetera, until he accidentally hits the starter button.
     VROOM!  The Packard fires to life.  Roger's startled for a
     moment, but quickly regains his composure.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hmmm... What would be the harm if I
               took her for a spin?

     He throws it into gear.  The Packard bucks into the car in
     front of it.  Then Roger shifts again.  The same process is
     repeated in reverse.  He SMASHES back and forth.  BANG!
     BANG!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
                Ah... the open road.


     AROUND THE CORNER - EDDIE AND JESSICA

     come racing down the street.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?

                               VALIANT
               Why didn't you tell me?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I didn't know who I could trust.

                               VALIANT
               We're even.  By the way, I did find
               your husband.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (excited)
               Where is he?

                               VALIANT
               He's right here in the...

     Valiant rounds the corner and points toward the spot where
     the car used to be.  But all that remains is a crumpled
     bumper.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               ... car.

     He shakes his head and looks around for signs of Roger.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     THE PACKARD

     is careening down Toon streets totally out of control.
     Panicked, Roger is spinning the wheel as if it were a
     motorboat.  He drives in one side of Mother Goose's Shoe and
     out the other, diapers all over the windshield.  Unable to
     see, Roger steers right off the road.  The car hurtles
     through space.  As it starts to fall, we see it's Toon
     Monument Valley.  The Packard passes a promontory on which
     WILE E. COYOTE is perched.  As Roger passes, he waves to the
     Coyote.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hi, Roger Rabbit.  Love your work.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     EDDIE AND JESSICA

     who are now facing a squad of TEN Toon Control Weasles.  They
     unleash a fusilade of bullets.

     Valiant knocks Jessica to the ground.  The bullets pass
     harmlessly overhead going into the window of the Acme Cheese
     Shop, riddling a round of cheese.  The CHEESEMAKER'S hand
     comes INTO FRAME changing the sign that says "Gouda" to
     "Swiss".

     Valiant rolls and FIRES his Toon .38 Special.  The Toon
     Bullet turns into a cannonball, which rolls down the street
     busting up the Weasle squad like a bowling ball through ten
     pins.

     As Eddie pulls Jessica to her feet, two more Weasles descend
     on them.  They fling Toon knives, which pin Eddie to a wooden
     fence.  Valiant rips one hand free, and BLASTS two shots at
     them.

     The Toon Bullets get to the Weasles, and open their nose
     cones.  Two frying pans emerge and BONK the Weasles on the
     head.

     Jessica starts to pull the knives out, releasing Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               How did you get onto Doom?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Marvin told me.  Doom was after his
               land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he
               brought me his will.

     Valiant sees a Weasle skulking at them with a tommygun.
     BLAM!  Valiant fires at him.  The Weasle ducks back around
     the corner.  But Valiant's Dum-Dum SCREECHES to a stop and
     goes around the corner, too.  We HEAR an EXPLOSION.  The
     Weasle come staggering out and falls in the street.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               When I opened up the blue envelope, all
               that was inside was a blank piece of
               paper.

                               VALIANT
               A joker to the end.

     Now Weasles are coming at them from every direction.  Valiant
     aims the Toon .38 at a Toon tank rolling their way.  But when
     he pulls the trigger, the gun just CLICKS.  Empty.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Looks like our goose is cooked, our
               hash is slung, our fait is accompli...

                               VALIANT
               Lemme guess where you got that from.
               Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see
               in that guy anyway?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He made me laugh.

     Valiant shakes his head.  Now they are completely surrounded
     by Weasles.  The situation looks bleak.

                               VALIANT
               Well, do you prefer to die this way or
               that way?

     Valiant jerks his thumb indicating the direction behind him.
     Suddenly, there's a rubber-burning SCREECH as Benny the
     Roadster arrives next to Valiant's hitchhiker-posed thumb.

                               ROADSTER
               Need a lift?

     Valiant does a take.

                               VALIANT
               Benny.

     The Roadster looks back approvingly as Jessica climbs in with
     Eddie.

                               ROADSTER
               Mr. Valiant, you've made a vast
               improvement in the company you keep.

     Benny blasts through a couple of Weasles.  They swing back
     and forth like tavern doors, then topple.

     He takes a hard right into the next block which is the Toon
     Arctic.  His tires turn into skis.  He slaloms back and forth
     between trees.  The Weasles pursue on dogsled.

     Benny grabs a striped barber's pole -- the North Pole -- and
     slides down it.  They land in the Toon Sahara.  Benny crawls
     up a large sand dune, his tongue hanging out of his radiator.
     He glances back at the Weasles who are mounted on camels,
     waving scimitars.  When they reach the top of the sand dune,
     we see they're on the precipice of a bottomless chasm.

                               ROADSTER
               Look, the drawbridge -- we're gonna
               make it.

                               VALIANT
               I don't see any bridge.

                               ROADSTER
               That's because you gotta draw it first.

     Benny takes a pencil hanging from a post lettered "Draw
     Bridge".  He wets the pencil point and in a flash draws a
     bridge.  It's a rickety rope bridge.  Using the pencil as a
     balancing pole, Benny starts to tiptoe across.

     The Weasles jump off t'heir camels and start filing onto the
     bridge after them.

     When Benny finally reaches the other side, Valiant grabs the
     pencil from him and gets out of the car.

                               VALIANT
               Hold on a second.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Eddie, come on.

     But Valiant stands facing the Weasles, who are charging at
     him, swords raised.  With a sly smile, Valiant holds up the
     eraser end of the pencil.  This freezes the Weasles.  But as
     Valiant starts to erase a rope support, the eraser breaks off
     the pencil and falls down into the chasm.  The Weasles WHEEZE
     with relief and advance for the kill.  At the last second,
     Valiant takes the business end of the pencil and scribbles a
     handsaw.  He grabs it by the handle and saws the rope.  The
     bridge swings away, smacking the Weasles into the opposite
     canyon wall.  One by one, they slide off and disappear into
     the abyss.


     VALIANT

     climbs back into Benny.  The Roadster takes off again, making
     a skidding left turn onto the main drag.  As they make their
     break into the Toontown tunnel...


     EXT. TOONTOWN TUNNEL - L.A. SIDE - NIGHT

     A ten gallon drum is sitting by the side of the road under
     the Toontown sign.  From in the tunnel we hear the SOUND of
     Benny's ENGINE coming closer.  Now a foot comes out of the
     shadows and rests on the ten gallon drum.  As the SOUND of
     the ROADSTER gets VERY LOUD, the foot kicks the drum over,
     spilling a clear liquid across the road.


     NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT

     belongs to Judge Doom.  Doom smiles sadistically as the
     Roadster with Eddie and Jessica aboard comes shooting out of
     the tunnel.  When Benny hits the liquid, he starts to skid.

                               ROADSTER
               Uh-oh... whoaaa...!  Look out!

     His tires smoke, then disappear. It's a dip slick.  Without
     tires, Benny spins out of control, finally ending up in the
     bushes roadside.

     Before Eddie and Jessica can make a move, they are surrounded
     by a horde of Weasles pointing what looks like a hundred guns
     at them.

                               DOOM
               Are you two all right?

     Doom opens one of the Roadster's doors and helps Jessica out.
     Valiant climbs out after her.  The Weasles quickly relieve
     him of his Toon pistol.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               These roads can be very treacherous at
               night, especially in a maniacal Toon
               vehicle.

                               VALIANT
               The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.

                               DOOM
               I've had enough of your insolence!
                      (to Weasles)
               Put him in my car.  I think they'll
               enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at
               the Acme factory.

     The Weasles prod Valiant and Jessica into Doom's Lincoln.  A
     Weasle refers to Benny WHIMPERING in the bushes.

                               WEASLE
               What about him?

                               DOOM
               He's not going anywhere.  We'll send
               the mobile unit after him.

     Doom climbs into the car and it zooms off, Weasles jumping
     onto the running boards.


     BENNY

     crawls out of the bushes on his axles.

                               ROADSTER
               The boinin', the boinin'...

     He makes it down into the drainage ditch, dipping his
     tootsies one by one.  There's a HISS as they hit the water
     and the chemicals from the dip are extinguished.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Oh, yeah... that's better.

     Now Benny hears the SOUND of another VEHICLE COMING out of
     the Toontown Tunnel.  He ducks down and peeks over the ditch
     to see...


     ROGER IN THE PACKARD

     come SCREAMING out of the tunnel backwards.  Maroon's Packard
     looks like the winner of a demolition derby.

     Benny stands and waves to him.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger!

     Roger sees him and slams on the brakes, skidding the Packard
     into the Toontown sign.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Benny?

     Benny hobbles over to the Packard.  He pops his trunk and
     rummages around.  He comes out with Toon boltcutters.  He
     clips Roger's cuffs off.

                               ROADSTER
               Doom's got your wife and Valiant.  He
               took them to the Acme factory,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Let's go!

     Benny nudges Roger to the passenger side.

                               ROADSTER
               Slide over, son.  It looks like you've
               done enough drivin' for tonight.

     Now the Toon Roadster gingerly gets behind the wheel of the
     Packard.  He hits the gas and the Packard lurches down the
     road.


     INT. ACME FACTORY - NIGHT

     Doom's car is parked inside.  There are several other
     vehicles as well.  There's a steamroller, a road grader, and
     a huge modified tanker truck.  It's mounted with a thousand
     gallon vat, the contents of which are being stirred by a
     motorized unit.  All the vehicles are marked with a large
     green four-leaf clover logo.


     VALIANT AND JESSICA

     are held at gunpoint by a couple of Weasles, while several
     others are busy JACKHAMMERING the brick wall at the far end
     of the factory.  Doom pulls on his rubber gloves, turns to
     the Weasles.

                               DOOM
               Frisk them.  See if they have the will.

     Several Weasles rush for the opportunity to frisk Jessica.
     The head Weasle slaps the others away.  Then WHEEZING
     laciviously, he turns to the task.  He starts to move his
     hands over her body when Jessica stomps her heel on his feet.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Get your hands off me, you little
               rodent!

     The Weasle hops away angrily and quickly frisks Valiant.  He
     turns to Doom and shakes his head.

                               DOOM
               No matter.
                      (checks watch)
               I don't expect the will to show up in
               the next fifteen minutes.  By then
               Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite
               legally.

                               VALIANT
               So you're Cloverleaf?

                               DOOM
               No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a
               vast company with diverse interests...
               gasoline, tires, automobiles.


     AT THE BRICK WALL

     The jackhammering has stopped.  A Weasle plucks one brick out
     of the wall.  Toon light beams through.  He reaches into the
     hole in the wall and comes out holding a bunch of Toon
     bananas.  WHEEZING wickedly, he passes them out to his
     compatriots.  They devour the bananas, throwing the peels
     helter-skelter.


     VALIANT

     turns his attention from the brick wall back to Doom.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, Doom.  What would a company
               like that want with Toontown?

                               DOOM
               It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was
               my idea of how to put the land to
               better use.

     Doom goes to the truck and starts turning on valves and
     starting compressors.
                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               In fact, they thought my concept so
               brilliant, that they offered me the
               Directorship of Transportation.  I've
               accepted.
                      (to Weasle)
               Bring me Mr. Valiant's gun.

     The Weasle trots over and delivers Valiant's Toon .38.  Doom
     inspects it.  He reads an engraving on the frame.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               'Thanks for getting me out of the
               hoosegow.  Yosemite Sam'.
                      (looks up)
               How sweet.

     Doom throws the gun on the ground.  He pushes back a long
     lever on the truck, letting loose a tiny spurt of fluid from
     the discharge valve.  The gun disappears.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Dip?

                               DOOM
               That's right.  Enough to dip Toontown
               off the face of the earth.


     EXT. ACME FACTORY - ROGER AND BENNY

     have been watching the proceedings through a window.  They
     turn to each other stunned.

                               BENNY/ROGER RABBIT
               Dip Toontown?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               We gotta do something!

     Roger scurries back to the Packard hidden outside the gates.
     He opens Valiant's black bag and comes out holding Eddie's
     real pistol.  Benny comes tenderfooting up.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger, what're you gonna do with that
               gun?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I'm gonna save them, of course.  You go
               for help.  Find Dolores at the Terminal
               Bar.  She'll know what to do.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... all right...

     Reluctantly, Benny gets behind the wheel of the Packard.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               But you be careful now with that gun.
               This ain't no cartoon.

     Benny pulls away.  Roger turns with determination and zips
     back to the window


     INT. FACTORY

     Doom pulls the tarp off the top of the truck, revealing a
     modified water cannon.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You're sick, Doom.  Where do people
               like you come from?

                               DOOM
               Never mind where I come from.  Just
               watch where I'm going.

                               VALIANT
               Don't you think anyone's gonna notice
               that Toontown's gone?

                               DOOM
               They won't care.  Who's going to miss
               some ridiculous talking mice when they
               can have the future?


     EXT. BACK OF FACTORY - ROGER

     is trying to jimmy open a window using his whole body for
     leverage.  He finally pops the window open.  Gun drawn, he
     climbs over the sill.  And falls head first.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Roger splashes into the toilet bowl in the Acme washroom.  He
     bobs up.  He drains the water out of the pistol barrel and
     peeks over the bowl.  He gets a determined look in his eye.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's time to make my move.

     Roger starts to climb out of the toilet.  He reaches for
     something to grab onto.  Unwittingly, he gets the toilet
     chain hanging from the tank above.  As he pulls himself out,
     the toilet flushes.   Roger has only a moment to register a
     dumbfounded expression before he is sucked down the john.


     IN THE FACTORY - DOOM

     continues expansively.

                               DOOM
               Right here where we're standing, will
               be the cornerstone of my idea... the
               cloverleaf -- an elegant cement
               structure that intertwines freeways.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell's a freeway?

                               DOOM
               A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes
               of asphalt running uninterrupted from
               L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to
               Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica.
               Someday everyone will be in cars
               driving happily, non-stop from one end
               of the L.A. Basin to another.

                               VALIANT
               That's what this is all about?  Tell
               me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway?
               We got the Red Cars, the best public
               transportation in the country.

                               DOOM
               Not for long.  We're retiring the Red
               Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant,
               because they'll have to.  And when they
               drive, they'll have to buy our cars,
               our tires, our gasoline.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Why'd you bother to call it a freeway?

     Doom steps up into their faces.  Behind him, several Weasles
     are fashioning a noose.

                               DOOM
               Has a nice ring.  Too bad you two won't
               be around to enjoy it.

     Suddenly Roger EXPLODES out of the drainage grate in the
     floor.  His entrance sends the Weasles flying.  Roger lands
     on his feet, James Cagney-like, levelling his gun on Judge
     Doom.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Get 'em up.  All of you!  Or I let the
               Judge have it!

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, darling!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, it's me, my dearest.  I'd embrace
               you but first I have to take care of
               some unfinished business.

                               DOOM
               Put that gun down, you buck-toothed
               fool.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead.  Give me an excuse to fill
               you full of holes, pump you full of
               lead.
                      (over shoulder)
               How'm I doin', Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Real good, Rog... but maybe you better
               let me take over.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Not before I satisfy my sense of moral
               outrage.

     Milking the moment, he shifts the gun from one hand to
     another.  He circles Doom, poking and prodding him with the
     gun.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               You think you could get away with this?
               Hah!  We Toons may be idiotic, but
               we're not stupid!


     POV OVERHEAD

     We LOOK DOWN on the proceedings from high in the rafters.
     PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're watching from the POV of Voltaire,
     who's perched on the top inventory rack.  Voltaire cleans his
     fingernails, casually.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, justice, Judge Doom.  The real
               meaning of the word probably hits you
               like a ton of bricks!

     Voltaire calmly nudges an Acme Ton-Of-Bricks off the shelf.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     He never sees it coming.  SMASH!  The bricks land on his head
     and bury him.  The only thing we can see of Roger is his hand
     with the gun in it.

                               DOOM
               Well, this is turning out better than
               I thought.

     Doom picks the gun up.  The Weasles drag Roger out from under
     the bricks.  Big bright stars are circling his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (delirious)
               Look, stars!  Ready when you are,
               Raoul.

     Valiant shakes his head, but Jessica starts to laugh.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I have missed you, Roger.

                               DOOM
               Tie the lovebirds together.

     The Weasles twirl Toon rope around Roger and Jessica like a
     cocoon.  They hook them on a power winch.  Then hit a button
     and raise Roger and Jessica until they're suspended fifteen
     feet above the floor... right in the path of the Dipmobile.

     Doom hands Valiant's gun to the head Weasle.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Let him watch his Toon friends get
               dipped...  then shoot him.

     Doom turns and starts to walk away.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     He steps on a Toon banana peel and goes flat on his keester.


     THE WEASLES

     always quick with a laugh, BREAK UP at their boss'
     misfortune.  The one guarding Eddie is so overcome with
     LAUGHTER that he's slapping his thigh with his gun hand.
     Valiant sees his opportunity.  He starts to make a move
     toward the distracted Weasle and almost gets his hands on the
     gun when:

                               DOOM
               Watch out, you idiot... he's going for
               the gun!

     The Weasle turns at the last second, sticking the barrel up
     against Valiant's nose.  Doom gets to his feet.  He glowers
     at the Weasle and knocks him on the head with the gavel head
     of his cane.  Doom stalks out of the room.

     The Weasles scramble to positions on the Dipmobile.  One
     FIRES UP the ENGINE.

     The streetcleaner brushes start to turn.  The vehicle starts
     to creep forward.

     Another Weasle climbs into the turret.  He puts Roger and
     Jessica in the crosshairs of the cannon.

     Beads of sweat break out on Valiant's face.

     The Weasle, WHEEZING with evil glee, starts to press his
     finger to the trigger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You guys think this is real funny,
               doncha?
                      (to Valiant)
               Eddie, do somethin'!

     At the last second, Eddie shouts at the Weasle.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!

     The Weasle turns to him.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Before you pull the trigger, I want you
               to know somethin' about the guy you're
               about to dip.

     Suddenly, Eddie breaks into the "Looney Tooney Song".  The
     song Roger had sung in the bar.  The silly voice that comes
     out of his mouth surprises everybody, especially Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'His name is Roger Rabbit
               He's got a crazy habit...'

     Valiant starts skulking across the floor.  It's a cross
     between Groucho Marx and a Chuck Berry Duck Walk.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'He likes to sing and dance and yuk
               So brighten up and smile you
                  schmuck...'

     Valiant starts "hoo-hooing", slapping himself in the
     forehead.  Now the Weasles start GIGGLING.  They've never
     seen a human do this before.

                               VALIANT
               'Now my name's Eddie V
               I'm looney too you'll see'

     Valiant flips into a handstand and starts walking on his
     hands.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I walk with my hands
               And I shake with my feet...'

     He offers his foot to a Weasle who shakes it.  The others
     HOWL.  Eddie flips upright and grabs a stick of Acme
     dynamite.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I think dynamite
               Is swell to eat'.

     Eddie takes a bite out of the Toon dynamite and acts like
     he's savoring it.  The spectacle of this human doing this is
     too much to bear.  Now the Weasles are rolling on the ground,
     holding their sides.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He's lost his mind!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah, isn't it great?  Keep it up,
               Eddie... you're killing 'em, you're
               slayin' 'em, you're knockin' 'em dead.

     Roger means it.  The Weasles are laughing so hard they're
     giving themselves heart attacks.  Valiant spins around on the
     floor like a clock dial gone berserk.

                               VALIANT
               Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...

     One by one, the Weasles keel over... dead.  Opaque WEASLE
     SPIRITS leave their bodies with wings and harps, and float
     heavenward, still laughing.


     VOLTAIRE

     alarmed at the scene below, grabs a brick and flaps toward
     the ceiling.  He throws the brick through the skylight and
     flies out.

                               VOLTAIRE
               Doom!  Doom!


     ON THE DIPMOBILE

     The Weasle on the turret collapses onto the trigger.  The
     unmanned dip cannon starts spraying, as the arm sweeps
     slowly back and forth like an, automatic lawn sprinkler.


     VALIANT

     hitches a ride on the last ascending Weasle Spirit, letting
     it hoist him to the top of the truck.  As he moves the Weasle
     body off the trigger...


     VOLTAIRE

     CRASHES back through the skylight and swoops down on Eddie.
     He sinks his talons into Eddie's back and lifts him into the
     air.

     As Valiant is being pulled skyward he reaches for something
     along the wall of inventory.  He grabs a handful of Acme
     Small Pills and jams a couple dowm the buzzard's mouth.
     Instantly, Voltaire starts to shrink.  As he gets smaller, he
     can no longer hold Eddie up.  They both descend as Voltaire
     shrinks to the size of a chick.

     The sprayer is swinging back towards Roger and Jessica.  At
     the last second, Valiant reaches up and blocks it.  It swings
     back the other way.

     As Valiant scrambles up on the vehicle to turn it off,
     Voltaire has found a box of Acme Big Pills.  He pecks into
     it... and after a beat, EXPLODES out of the box.  He's now
     three times the size he was before.  Voltaire flaps in for
     the kill.

     Valiant reaches the turret just in time to swing the cannon
     around.  The spray of dip blasts one of Voltaire's wings off.
     He spins earthward like a flaming Messerschmidt, finally
     landing in the dip vat and dissolving into a black pool.

     Doom arrives just in time to see his pet bird dissolved.
     Angrily, he steps onto a giant Acme Mousetrap.  He uses a
     piece of Acme cheese to spring it, catapulting him through
     the air.

     Just as Valiant is about to turn off the dip cannon, Doom
     lands on the truck.  He knocks Eddie off the turret with a
     flying tackle.  They both hit the floor.

     Doom gets up, leaving Eddie stunned.  He sprints to where the
     Weasle had dropped Eddie's pistol.  Finally Eddie shakes it
     off.  He sees Doom about to reach the gun.  He straps on a
     pair of Acme Rocket Skates, fires them up and shoots across
     the floor.  He knocks Doom into a stack of Acme boxes,
     toppling the whole shelf down on top of him.

     As the sprayer swings back toward Roger and Jessica, they
     have their last moment together.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, I want you to know I love you.
               I loved you more than any woman has
               ever loved a rabbit.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Be comforted in the knowledge that as
               we face the Grim Dipper, our paint will
               be comingled for eternity.

     They both close their eyes, waiting for the end.  But it
     never cames.  The truck runs up on some boxes and the sprayer
     arm swings back the other way.

     Doom grabs an Acme slingshot, loads an Acme boulder and fires
     it at Valiant.  BLAM!  It whacks Valiant on the head, laying
     him out cold in front of the Cloverleaf steamroller,

     Doom climbs into the steamroller and starts it up.  He puts
     it into gear and starts it rolling toward Valiant.

     Valiant comes around to see the huge roller bearing down on
     him.  At the last second, Valiant rolls out of the way and
     grabs an Acme boxing glove.  It accordians out and smashes
     Doom in the face.  He goes flying out of the driver's seat,
     turning the wheel as he falls.  The steamroller starts to
     turn in circles.

     Valiant jumps Doom.  But Doom is stronger.  He throws Valiant
     off and starts whacking him with his fist.  He pummels
     Valiant backward toward the drum of the steamroller.  Valiant
     grabs the nearest thing for defense.  It's a can of Acme
     Stay-Put Adhesive.  He whips it up in front of his face.
     Doom puts his fist right through it, covering his hand with
     glue.  He smiles at Valiant and hauls off again.  Valiant
     ducks.  Doom's fist strikes the top of the drum of the
     steamroller.  Frantically he tries to pull it off.  But it
     "Stays-Put".  The roller starts to suck his fist down and
     under.

                               DOOM
               Nooooo!

     Jessica and Roger avert their eyes as the steamroller crushes
     Doom.

     Valiant breathes a sigh of relief.  He starts for the dip
     truck as the cannon swings back toward Roger and Jessica.
     But neither of them are watching the cannon.  Their eyes are
     fixed on the ground behind the steamroller.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     There isn't the messy pile of blood and guts you'd expect to
     see if a human got run over.  Instead, we see that Judge
     Doom's remains have rolled out like a flat black pancake.
     After a beat, an edge curls up with a CREAK.  Now the whole
     shape peels off the floor and wobbles to it's feet. REVEALING
     DOOM IS A TOON.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie, look out!


     VALIANT

     turns to see Doom stick his flattened thumb in his mouth.  He
     blows, re-inflating himself.  His glasses CRACK and fall off.
     Then his prosthetic eyeballs pop out.  His teeth shatter and
     fall out of his mouth like china.  Underneath his latex mask
     we can see his Toon mouth and evil red Toon eyes.

                               VALIANT
               Holy shit, he's a Toon!

                               DOOM
               Surprised?

                               VALIANT
               Not really.  Only a Toon could think of
               something as goofy as that freeway
               idea.

     Doom takes the black rubber gloves off, REVEALING red hands
     with long fingernails.  He makes his fist into an anvil and
     advances on Valiant.

                               DOOM
               Is that so?  Well, we'll see who's the
               goofy one.

     BLAM!  From ten feet away, he smashes Valiant with a
     bone-crushing punch.  Valiant staggers backwards.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               By the way, when I killed your brother,
               Teddy, I used to talk just like this.

     Doom spesks in a Toony high-pitched squeak.  Valiant
     recognizes him now.

                               VALIANT
               You?

                               DOOM
               That's right, me.

     BLAM!  Doom hammers Valiant again.  He's defenseless against
     Doom's super human strength.  BLAM!  Valiant goes
     sprawling to the ground.  Now Doom's hand turns into a
     buzzsaw.  He goes to administer the coup de grace.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Now Eddie's gonna be deady, just like
               Teddy.

     With his last ounce of strength, Valiant grabs the Acme
     Boxing Glove.  He pops it.  The glove extends across the
     room, punching the release lever on the dip truck.


     CLOSE - VALVE

     A flood of dip gushes out of the valve and rolls toward Doom
     like a wave.


     DOOM

     SCREAMS as the torrent hits him with a CRASH.  But there's no
     escape for him this time.  The flood of liquid envelopes him
     at the ankles.  He dissolves into it like a melting candle.


     THE DIPMOBILE

     continues forward inexorably.  The arm is swinging towards
     Roger and Jessica.  It gets closer and closer...

     Valiant tries to get to the truck, but it's too late.  The
     cannon has reached them.


     CLOSE - ROGER AND JESSICA

     They close their eyes, preparing to meet their Maker.  But
     nothing happens.

     The spray of the cannon suddenly peters out.  It dries up in
     a harmless drip as the tank has completely emptied.

     Valiant gets to the controls of the power winch.  He hoists
     Roger and Jessica up out of the way.  The Dipmobile passes
     harmlessly underneath them and SMASHES through the brick
     wall.


     TOONTOWN

     is REVEALED in all its splendor.  It's a bucolic setting.  A
     rainbow shares the blue sky with a smiling sun.  Fawns and
     butterflies, chipmunks and flowers watch curiously as the dip
     truck rolls past.  Suddenly it's lifted off the ground.  We
     see it's resting on the top of a TOON GIANT's head.  This
     Giant plucks the truck off his head, regards it, then pops it
     in his mouth.


     VALIANT

     lowers Roger and Jessica to the ground.  We HEAR POLICE
     SIRENS approach.  When Valiant unties them, Jessica turns and
     exclaims...

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               My hero!

     Then she hugs Roger passionately.  Valiant can only shrug.


     THROUGH THE WALL - TOONS

     start coming in.  They look around at the scene, bewildered,
     then gather around Doom's robe, mask and shoes lying in the
     puddle of dip.  There's a reddish slick floating on top.
     Valiant wanders over and joins them.

                               VALIANT
               Hi-ho, the Doom is dead.


     ANGLE ON DOOR

     Dolores, Lt. Santino, and several other COPS rush in, guns
     drawn.  Dolores runs to Eddie and puts her arms around him.
     Santino looks down at the remains on the floor.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell is that?

                               VALIANT
               Doom.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Jesus Christ... that was the Judge?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket.  He puts it
     up against the red slime on the robe.  It's a match.

                               VALIANT
               That was the murderer of Herman Acme,
               Maroon... and my brother.

     Dolores looks down at the front of Valiant's shirt.  A dark
     stain is appearing.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, we better get you to hospital.
               You're bleedin'.

     Valiant looks down at the stain.

                               VALIANT
               That's not blood.  That's ink.  That
               goof Acme squirted me with some the
               other day.  Why it's comin' 'through
               now, I don't know.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's because it's
               Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up
               three days later.  Gives you enough
               time to get away from the victim so he
               doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great
               gag.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah...

                               DOLORES
               I'll treat you to a new shirt.  After
               all, you did save Toontown.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Problem is without Marvin's will, the
               land still goes to Cloverleaf.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's right.  If only we knew what
               happened to that will...

     Valiant looks up from his shirt.

                               VALIANT
               Say Roger, remember that love letter
               you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint
               Club?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               I think you oughta read it to her.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Good idea.

     He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the paper and clears his
     throat.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing;
                       reads)
               Dear Jessy... How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the... I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body... Hey?


     CLOSE - PAPER

     The Disappearing-Reappearing Ink is coming up over Roger's
     scribbling.

                               VALIANT
               Keep reading...

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (reads)
               Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,
               do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the
               property known as Toontown to those
               loveable characters...

     PAN the Toon crowd, who are listening to the reading of the
     will.  It is a gallery of recognizable faces.  Everyone from
     Mickey to Bugs, Yakky Doodle to Yosemite Sam, Dumbo to Dopey,
     Bambi to Droopy, Tweety Bird to Tinkerbell.  They're all
     there.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               ... who have given me and the rest of
               humanity so much mirth and merriment...
               the Toons.

     The Toon crowd erupts with a CHEER!  Hats go in the air and
     they descend on Roger, slapping his back.  Roger breaks away
     from the crowd and joins Eddie.


     TWO SHOT - EDDIE AND ROGER

     They stand side by side, looking out over Toontown.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Eddie, you still think I'm a
               patsy, a simp, a chump?

     Eddie wipes the spit off his face.

                               VALIANT
               No, kid, you're a real hero.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I guess I am at that.  Cigar?

     Roger holds out a large stogie.

                               VALIANT
               Why not?

     Roger lights Eddie's and one for himself.

                               VALIANT
                       (continuing)
               By the way, Roger, you were right about
               your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm
               glad you got her back.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               And I'm glad you got your sense of
               humor back.  Think you'll keep it?

                               VALIANT
               Only time will tell.

     Valiant puffs on the cigar.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               From this box here...

     Valiant glances down.  The box says, "Acme Exploding Cigars".
     He looks to Roger, but it's too late.  KABOOM!  KABOOM!
     Their cigars blow up in classic Toon tradition, blackening
     both their faces.  Roger starts laughing.  Eddie stares at
     Roger for a moment, then he starts laughing too.  They throw
     their heads back in a HOWL.  The other Toons join in.  Pretty
     soon the whole factory is shaking with LAUGHTER.


     A TOON COP

     dressed in blue uniform and hat with his back to us tries to
     restore order in the Acme factory.  As soon as he talks, we
     recognize the stutter.  It's PORKY PIG.

                               PORKY PIG
               O-k-k-k, mmmove along.  There's
               nnnothin' else to see.  T-t-that's it.
               T-t-that's all, folks.
                      (turns to
                       CAMERA)
               Hmm, I l-l-like the sound of that.

     Then, savoring the phrase, Porky stutters out the famous
     sign-off.

                               PORKY PIG
                      (continuing)
                Eee-ba-da, eee-ba-da... t-t-that's all,
                folks!

     CARTOON MUSIC UP.

                                                THIRD DRAFT

                                                September 2, 1986









                        WHO SHOT ROGER RABBIT?

     This movie starts the way all movies should... with a
     cartoon.  It's not a Disney or a Warner's.  It's not a
     Fleischer, an MGM, or a Lanz.  This is a lesser known
     studio.


     FADE IN:

     ON A "MAROON CARTOON"

     Accompanied by zany CARTOON MUSIC, the TITLE CARD reads:

                   MAROON CARTOONS PRESENT
                BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT
                           IN
                      "THE BUNNYSITTER"

     Below are two cameos of the cartoon's stars.  One picture is
     of a cherubic baby in a bonnet innocently posed with his
     thumb in his mouth.  The other is of a paunchy rabbit with a
     gap between his front teeth.  He has a loveable, if slightly
     shell-shocked look.  The cartoon begins...


     BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT

     are in a playpen when TWO FEMALE LEGS in high heels walk INTO
     FRAME.  The VOICE belonging to the legs talks down to Baby
     Herman in a maternal coo.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Mommy's going to the beauty parlor,
               darling.  But I'm leaving you with your
               favorite friend, Roger.  He's going to
               take very, very good care of you...
                      (voice turns
                       ominous)
               ... cause if he doesn't, he's going
               back to the science lab!

     Roger gulps as he watches the legs disappear.  We HEAR
     FOOTSTEPS recede and a DOOR SLAM.  Roger turns confidently
     back to his charge.  But the little tyke is already squeezing
     through the playpen bars.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Baby bye-bye...

     Roger makes a dive for him, misses, and gets his head stuck
     between the bars.  He pleads with the Baby in a voice that
     resonates of Huntz Hall in "The Bowery Boys".

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, come back!  You heard what your
               mother said!


     BABY HERMAN

     ignores Roger.  We FOLLOW HIM as he crawls into the kitchen.
     He stops to regard something that has caught his attention...
     a cookie jar.  It's sitting on top of the refrigerator.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Coo-kie.


     ROGER

     wearing the playpen like a pillory, comes running toward the
     kitchen.  But the playpen is too wide to clear the door.  The
     impact SHATTERING the playpen and sends Roger sprawling
     across the kitchen floor.  When he looks up...


     BABY HERMAN

     is swinging precariously on the door of the freeer.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hang on, Baby.  I'll save you!

     Roger makes a desperate leap across the kitchen for the kid.
     But Baby Herman swings the door to the freezer open and Roger
     disappears inside.  Baby Herman grabs a cookie and swings
     back, shutting the door.  He climbs down and crawls out of
     the kitchen.  After a beat, the freezer door opens.


     ROGER

     now shaped like a block of ice, falls out and hits the floor.
     The block SHATTERS into ice cubes.  Roger looks around,
     dazed.


     BABY HERMAN

     has taken this opportunity to crawl out the window.  Roger
     races to the window.  His eyes pop out of his head at what he
     sees.


     ROGER'S POV

     Baby Herman is crawling along the sidewalk under the shadow
     of a safe being hoisted into a second floor window by the
     Acme Safe Moving Company.  The rope holding the safe is
     fraying down to a slender thread.


     ROGER

     gasps and rockets out the window toward Baby Herman.  The
     rope snaps.  The safe falls.  Roger arrives just in time to
     pluck the Baby out of harm's way.  But not in time to save
     himself.  The safe CRUNCHES down on his head, burying Roger
     into the sidewalk.  After a beat, Roger's hand appears and
     spins the tumbler.  The safe door opens.  Inside, we see the
     dazed rabbit with little TWEETING BIRDS circling his head.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Cut, cut, cut!

     The cartoon action stops abruptly, but the goofy CARTOON
     MUSIC PLAYS ON.  We begin a slow PULL BACK TO REVEAL that
     this cartoon is being filmed LIVE ON A SOUND STAGE.  The
     title card sits on an easle.  The female legs are paper
     mache' props manipulated by two HUMAN CREW MEMBERS.  Wearily,
     they lean the legs up against the stage wall.  A human
     DIRECTOR, wearing a tweed jacket and baggy pleated pants,
     steps onto the set.  From the equipment and the dress of the
     crew, we can tell it's the 1940's.  Baby Herman throws his
     cookie down in disgust.  He talks in a gravelly voice an
     octave lower than Wallace Beery's.

                               BABY HERMAN
               What the hell was wrong with that
               take??

                               DIRECTOR
               Nothin' with you, Baby Herman.  It's on
               Roger... again!
                      (over shoulder)
               Hey!  Could we lose the playback?

     The MUSIC suddenly STOPS as, off to the side, the SOUNDMAN
     lifts the needle off a phonograph record.  The Director leans
     over Roger and angrily plucks one of the birds circling his
     head.

                               DIRECTOR
                      (continuing)
               What's this, Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               A tweeting bird?

                               DIRECTOR
               That's right, a tweeting bird.  But
               what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets
               conked.  Rabbit sees stars!'  Not
               birds, stars!

                               BABY HERMAN
               Aw, for cryin' out loud, Roger!  I'll
               be in my trailer... takin' a nap!

     Baby Herman pulls himself up to his full height of two feet
     and walks off the set.  He chooses a route that takes him
     under the dress of the SCRIPT GIRL.  She jumps as if goosed.
     Now two CREW MEMBERS lift the safe off Roger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars,
               I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my
               head one more time.

                               DIRECTOR
               I've already dropped it on you
               twenty-three times.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry about me.  I can take it.

                               DIRECTOR
               I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried
               about the safe.

     CONTINUED PULLBACK.

     What we've been seeing has been from the POV of a MAN in a
     shiny brown suit standing unobtrusively at the back of the
     sound stage.  Under a beat-up fedora is a craggy face that's
     seen a lot in its life... but apparently didn't think much of
     it was funny.  EDDIE VALIANT takes a jolt from a pint of
     whiskey, evidently in reaction to what he's seen.  He opens
     his coat and returns the pint bottle to a shoulder holster
     which had formerly held a .38.  Nerves steadied, he walks out
     the stage door.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - DAY

     Valiant emerges from the stage onto a bustling Hollywood
     studio lot where CARTOON CHARACTERS (TOONS) and humans are
     comingling as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
     Valiant stops by an Acme Novelty truck which is unloading
     Toon props.  There are bombs, rockets, flattened pocket
     watches, anvils, giant slingshots, etcetera.  The license
     plate is California 1946.  He fishes out a pack of
     Chesterfields and taps out a half a butt that had been
     stubbed out.  As he lights it, Valiant regards a chubby,
     balding man wearing a three-piece suit and a worried
     expression coming towards him.  He is R.K. MAROON, studio
     boss.  Maroon is leading an entourage of ASSISTANTS trying to
     keep up.

                               MAROON
               Starting tomorrow there'll be no more
               roast beef lunches.  What happened to
               cheese sandwiches?  I was raised on
               cheese sandwiches.

     As the Assistants dutifully record his thoughts, Maroon sees
     a GUY taking a nap in the shade of a palm tree.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               And tell that guy sleepin' over there
               he's fired!
 
                               ASSISTANT
               It's your wife's brother, R.K.

                               MAROON
                      (reconsiders)
               Oh... tell him he's promoted.  But get
               him out of my sight.

     As the Assistants disperse, Maroon approaches Valiant.

                               MAROON
               Valiant, did you see the rabbit?

                               VALIANT
               He was blowin' his lines, all right.
               So what?

                               MAROON
               So what?  He's already put me three
               weeks behind on the shooting schedule!

     Now an EDITH HEAD-TYPE hustles up to show Maroon several
     costume designs.

                               COSTUMER
               Your reaction, R.K.?

     Maroon quickly checks out the drawing.

                               MAROON
               No!  That's not funny.
 
     She flips another drawing.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               That's funny.  Put a homburg on him
               it'll even be funnier.  Huh, Valiant?

     He grabs the pad and shows Valiant.  The rendering is of a
     hippo in a pink polka-dot tu-tu.

                               VALIANT
                      (deadpan)
               Yeah, that'd be a riot.

     Maroon responds to Valiant's sarcasm with raised eyebrows.

                               MAROON
               Boy, I hope what you have ain't
               contagious or I'll be out of business.

     He hands the pad back to the designer, who departs.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               How much do you know about show
               business, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Only there's no business like it, no
               business I know.

     Valiant watches an ALLIGATOR in a rebel uniform dragging a
     brace of cannons and several TOADSTOOLS parade by.

                               MAROON
               Yeah, and there's no business as
               expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over
               budget on the latest Bunnysitter
               cartoon and it's all because that
               rabbit can't keep his mind on his work.
               And you know why?

                               VALIANT
               One too many safes dropped on his head?

                               MAROON
               Nah, that goes with the territory.
               He's a stunt bunny.

     Maroon takes a copy of the "Hollywood Tattler" out of his
     pocket.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Here's the problem...
                      (reads)
               "Seen cooing over calamari with
               notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica
               Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".
                      (looks up)
               His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's
               Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him
               up.

                               VALIANT
               So what do you want me to do?

                               MAROON
               Get me a couple juicy pictures.
               Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up
               with.

                               VALIANT
               I don't work in Toontown.

                               MAROON
               You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife
               sings at an underground Toon revue
               joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You
               can catch her in action there.

                               VALIANT
               The job's gonna cost you a hundred
               bucks.

                               MAROON
               A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.

                               VALIANT
               So's the job.

     Valiant starts to walk away.

                               MAROON
               All right, all right... You got your
               hundred bucks.

     Maroon turns, snaps his fingers.  His Assistant appears out
     of nowhere with Maroon's checkbook and a pen.  The Assistant
     turns and stoops so that Maroon can write the check on his
     back.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the
               pictures.

     Maroon tears the check off and hands it to Valiant.  Suddenly
     Valiant ducks in reflex to a large shadow that passes
     overhead.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing;
                       chuckles)
               Kinda jumpy aren't you, Valiant?  It's
               just Dumbo.


     ABOVE THEIR HEADS - DUMBO

     swoops back and forth, then hovers, ears flapping like a
     hummingbird.

                               MAROON
               I got him on loan from Disney.

                               VALIANT
               Aren't you the lucky one...

     Valiant grabs the check from Maroon and starts for the gate.

                               MAROON
               When will I hear from you?

                               VALIANT
               As soon as is humanly possible.

     We FOLLOW Valiant out the gate under a wrought iron sign that
     reads "Maroon Cartoon Studios".  As he starts across the road
     he's almost run over by a Toon roadster that ROARS out of the
     gates.  When it BLASTS ITS HORN, it's the FIRST FIVE NOTES
     from the WOODY WOODPECKER SONG:  "HA-HA-HA-HA-HA".  Valiant
     jumps back as the roadster passes.  WOODY THE WOODPECKER'S
     behind the wheel with a self-important smile on his face.
     Valiant angrily waves the cloud of Toon dust away.

                               VALIANT
                      (coughs)
               Damn Toons.


     ACROSS THE STREET - A TROLLEY CAR

     is slowing to a stop in front of the studio.  It's a Pacific
     and Electric "Red Car", part of a vast system of electric
     trollies that once criss-crossed the L.A. Basin.  Valiant
     steps onto the "Red Car".  He reaches into his pocket to give
     the CONDUCTOR his nickel fare.  But he comes up with a
     handful of lint.  He holds out the check.

                               CONDUCTOR
               What do I look like, a bank?

     The Conductor jerks his thumb toward the door.  Valiant
     suffers the public humiliation,of having to step down past
     the rest of the boarding passengers.  He walks around to the
     back of the Red Car where a gang of TEN-YEAR-OLDS are
     loitering.  When the BELL SOUNDS and the Red Car starts to
     pull away, the Kids make a dash for a place on the cow
     catcher.  Valiant joins them.  We HOLD as the Red Car moves
     away and the street urchins regard their older partner in
     crime with curiosity.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     A BILLBOARD SIGN

     It reads:  "L.A.'s Pacific and Electric Red Car -- America's
     Finest Public Transportation System".  PAN DOWN to see that
     the sign is on the roof of the trolley terminal.  Red Cars
     are going in and out of the shed.  MOVE IN on one car
     approaching the terminal from down the street.  As it passes
     by...


     VALIANT

     hops off his freeloader's seat on the back,

                               KID
               So long, mister.

     Valiant waves laconically.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the cigarettes.

     We FOLLOW Valiant as he crosses the street to a seedy
     bungalow.  A note is push-pinned to the door.


     CLOSE - NOTE

     It says:  "Tomorrow's Friday... Well?  Dolores".


     VALIANT

     takes the note and walks back across the street toward the
     terminal.  He climbs up a flight of stairs, heading for a bar
     on the mezzanine.  The bar sports a red neon sign that used
     to blink, "The Terminal Station Bar".  But now it just says,
     "Terminal".


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     The place must have been pretty swanky at the turn of the
     century when it was built in the first burst of enthusiasm
     over the new public transportation system.  It's in the motif
     of a trolley car.  There's a large map on the wail above the
     bar showing all the different lines.  Behind the bar is
     DOLORES.  If you scraped off all the makeup, you'd find an
     attractive woman in her late thirties.  She ministers to a
     rag-tag assortment of Hollywood low-lifes -- who are truly at
     the end of the line.


     VALIANT

     enters this den, lets his eyes adjust for a moment, then
     bellies up to the bar.  He finds a spot between a ONE-ARMED
     BLACK SOLDIER and a MIDGET stretched out on the bar passed
     out.  Now a TROLLEY RUMBLES underneath them.  The bar starts
     to shake like an earthquake, the lights flicker.  All the
     drinkers, observing a time honored ritual, lift their glasses
     simultaneously to avoid spilling any drops.  Even the Midget
     lifts his head until the trolley has passed.  Valiant reaches
     over the bar and blind-grabs a bottle of rye he obviously
     knows is there.  He pours himself a shot.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, fellas, what's the good word?

                               SOLDIER
               Lost my job.

     An ARTHRITIC COWBOY pipes up.

                               COWBOY
               Mule died.

     A DEAF-MUTE scribbles a note on a pad hanging around his
     neck.  He hands the note to Valiant.  It says "My girl dumped
     me".  Valiant pats him on the back, consoling.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you know what they say about
               dames, Augie...

     Then Valiant mouths the rest of it for Augie's benefit only.
     Augie reads his lips, then starts to roar silently, slapping
     his thigh.  Now Dolores makes her way down the bar.  She
     grabs the Midget by the suspenders and slides him out of the
     way.

                               DOLORES
               So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie?
               Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a
               dame who took a hundred bucks out of
               the till so your landlord would't
               throw you out of your dump.  And it was
               a dame who trusted you for the money
               when no one else in town would.  And
               it's a dame who's tired of waitin' for
               you to straighten yourself out and get
               a job!

                               VALIANT
               Would this be the same dame who's going
               to feel awfully foolish when she finds
               out I've got her money.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.  Dolores studies it.
     She calms down a little.

                               DOLORES
               This is fifty bucks.  I need
               seventy-five before they check the
               books tomorrow.

                               VALIANT
               You'll have it in the morning.  Now be
               a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to
               put in my pocket.

                               DOLORES
               Is this paper even good?

     Now ANGELO, a Neanderthal sitting a few stools down, is
     tapping the shell of a hardboiled egg.

                               ANGELO
               Maroon?  Valiant, don't tell me you're
               workin' for a Toon?  Who's your client?
               Chilly Willy or Screwy Squirrel?

     Angelo chuckles at his own joke and goes to eat his egg.
     Suddenly Valiant darkens.  He grabs Angelo by the shirt and
     pulls him up to his face.

                               VALIANT
               Get this straight, greaseball.  I'm not
               workin' for a Toon!  I'd never work for
               a Toon!  Got that?

     Valiant jams the whole egg into Angelo's mouth, turns and
     storms out the door.  Angelo sputters and spits out the egg.

                               ANGELO
               What's his problem?

                               DOLORES
               Toon killed his brother.


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - NIGHT

     Valiant knocks on the door of, a non-descript building in a
     run-down factory area.  A speakeasy style peephole slides
     open REVEALING the face of a TOON GORILLA.  Valiant offers
     the password.

                               VALIANT
               Walt sent me.

     The peephole slides closed and after a beat the door swings
     open.


     INT. CLUB

     The Gorilla, dressed in a tux, gives Valiant the once over.
     Valiant resents the assessment.

                               VALIANT
               Like your monkey suit.

                               GORILLA
               Wise ass...

     We FOLLOW Valiant down the hall toward the main room.  We can
     HEAR LAUGHTER and ZANY MUSIC from within.


     INT. MAIN ROOM

     When Valiant steps through the doorway, we see the place is
     no dive.  It's a white tablecloth nightclub on a par with the
     El Morroco or the Garden of Allah.  Behind the bar A
     CATERPILLAR BARTENDER is using his many arms to shake and
     pour several drinks at once.  Meanwhile a dozen PENGUIN
     WAITERS are gliding back and forth along the tables serving
     drinks to the well-heeled crowd.


     ON STAGE

     DONALD DUCK and DAFFY DUCK are seated opposite each other at
     matching grand pianos.  What begins as a decorous Duck duet
     on a Tchaikovsky piece (complete with knuckle-cracking,
     seat-spinning preparations) quickly accelerates to a loony
     game of one-upsmanship between these two irascible Ducks.
     There is keyboard stomping, lid-banging, piano wire plucking
     zaniness.


     THE AUDIENCE

     is HOWLING.  People are wiping the tears from their eyes
     they're laughing so hard.  All except...


     VALIANT

     He lights a cigarette impassively, not humored by the Toon
     hijinx.  He spots an empty table off to the side and makes
     his way towards it.  A SILLY GEEZER in a loud suit is at the
     next table.  The Geezer nods to him soberly as Valiant pulls
     Out the chair and sits down.  A LOUD FLATULENCE SOUND erupts
     from under Valiant.  The Geezer slaps his thigh with the
     hilarity of it all.

                               GEEZER
               Will you listen to that?  It's a pip!
               I'm thinking of callin' it a Whoopee
               Cushion.

     Valiant reaches under himself and comes up holding a deflated
     rubber bladder.  The Geezer retrieves it from him.

                               GEEZER
                       (continuing)
                No hard feelings, I hope.  Put 'er
                there...

     The Geezer grabs Valiant's hand before he can say no.  We
     HEAR A BUZZ.  Valiant retracts his hand as if shocked.  The
     Geezer howls with laughter and turns his palm to Eddie.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               Hand buzzer... real gasser.

     Valiant rolls his eyes and grabs a Penguin as it glides by.

                               VALIANT
               Scotch.

                               PENGUIN
               There's a two drink minimum.

                               VALIANT
               Just as long as there's no maximum.

                               GEEZER
               Waiter, I'll sign my check now.

     The Penguin puts a bill down on the Geezer's table and zips
     off.  The Geezer takes a fountain pen out of his jacket and
     writes on the bill.  But there doesn't seem to be any ink
     coming out.  He shakes and shakes the pen to get it flowing.
     It flows all right.  Ink splatters all over Valiant's shirt
     and pants.  Valiant looks down at the stain, doing a slow
     burn.  The Geezer starts laughing.  Valiant jumps up and
     grabs him by the lapels.

                               VALIANT
               That's it for you, pops!

                               GEEZER
                      (freaked)
               Calm down, son.  Look, the ink is gone.

     Valiant looks down at his shirt.  The stain is gone.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               See?  It disappears.

                               VALIANT
               Well, why don't you make like the ink?

     Valiant drops him into his chair and returns to his seat.
     The Penguin glides up with his drinks.  Valiant swallows the
     first one with one quick jerk of the head.


     ON STAGE

     Donald and Daffy's PIANO COMPETITION has reached a CRESCENDO
     of mayhem.  They've got the axes out, and in time with the
     MUSIC they reduce their pianos to matchsticks.  At the
     completion of the piece, they step to the front of the stage
     and with great decorum, arms around each other, they take
     their bows.  The curtain comes down to GREAT APPLAUSE.  We
     HEAR SFX of CRASHING AND BASHING backstage.  Now from behind
     Valiant, we HEAR a familiar high-pitched VOICE.

                               CIGARETTE GIRL
               Cigars... cigarettes... Eddie?

     Valiant turns to see BETTY BOOP standing with a box of
     tobacco wares strapped around her neck.  In contrast to all
     the other Toons, Betty's in black and white.

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (continuing)
               Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We
               miss you in Toontown.

                               VALIANT
               Wish I could say the same.  What're you
               doin' here, Betty?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Work's been slow for me since the
               cartoons went to color.  But I still
               got it, Eddie...
                      (sings)
               'Boop boop be-doop'.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, you still got it, Betty.
                      (indicates
                       Geezer)
               Who's Mr. Jocularity?

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (leans in)
               That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.

                               VALIANT
               Shoulda guessed.

                               BETTY BOOP
               He comes here every night to see
               Jessica Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               Big on the musical comedy, huh?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Sounds like you ve never seen her,
               Eddie.

     Now the lights dim and Betty moves on.


     ON STAGE

     the dour DROOPY walks out with the spotlight following him.
     He's the evening's emcee.

                               DROOPY
                      (deadpan)
               Hello, everybody.  I hope you're all
               having as much fun as I am.  I have a
               small announcement to make.  Jessica
               Rabbit will not be able to sing
               tonight.

     There's a ROAR OF DISAPPROVAL from the men in the crowd.
     They shower him with debris.

                               DROOPY
                      (continuing;
                       deadpan)
               I was merely jesting.  Without further
               ado... here's woman times two,
               Toontown's own chanteuse par
               excellance... Jessica Rabbit!

     There is excited APPLAUSE as the lights dim. A TOON COMBO
     made up of CROWS in shades STRIKES UP the intro to the smokey
     song, "Why Don't You Do Right".  A spotlight hits the
     curtain. Now a curvaceous leg pokes out, teasingly.  The
     crowd goes wild as the rest of the body belonging to the leg
     emerges.  JESSICA RABBIT is a generously endowed red-headed
     bombshell.  She's a humanoid Toon... in her case, more
     beautiful than human.  Her figure is testimony to what a guy
     can do with a pencil and a fertile imagination,


     REACTION - VALIANT

     This is not quite the bunny he expected Roger to be married
     to.  His jaw drops.  And his reaction is mirrored all around
     the room.  The men are panting so hard you couldn't keep a
     match lit.


     CLOSEUP - JESSICA

     as she steps to the mike.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (sings)
               'You had plenty of money back
                  in '22
               You let other woman make a fool
                  of you
               Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...
               Get out of here and
               Get me the money too...'

     Jessica takes the mike and comes off the stage.  Slinkily.
     she wanders among the tables, teasing the men as she goes.

     Now there's a HOWL from behind Valiant.  A Tex Avery type
     TOON WOLF, who came masquerading as a human, couldn't help
     but show his true colors at the sight of Jessica.  He HOWLS
     as if it were a full moon.  His tongue rolls out of his head
     and piles up on the floor like so much clothesline.  His
     eyeballs telescope out of his head.  And finally, the Wolf
     levitates and snaps rigid like an open jacknife.  As the Wolf
     makes a rush for the stage, the Gorilla Bouncer grabs him by
     the suspenders.  The Wolf, legs spinning madly, practically
     knocks Valiant's table over as he grabs at Jessica.  But the
     Wolf has come to the end of his suspenders.  He snaps back
     toward the Gorilla who is holding an anvil in front of the
     suspenders.  CLANG!  The Wolf hits the anvil and slides to
     the floor.  The Gorilla calmly whisks him into a dustpan and
     carries him out.


     JESSICA

     like all good saloon singers, has continued her act
     undaunted.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (singing)
               'Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...'

     She sashays over to the Geezer's table.  Teasingly, she
     swirls the whisps of white hair onto his head into a Dairy
     Queen.  He giggles gleefully and makes a grab at Jessica.
     But she slips out of his grasp like mercury.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'You ain't got no money
               Ain't got no use for you...'

     Now Jessica works her way over to Eddie.  She stops at his
     table and sings tauntingly.  Then with a flourish, she throws
     herself in his lap, and belts out the finale.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'So get out of here...
               And get me the money toooo!'

     There is RAUCOUS APPLAUSE when she finishes.  Jessica looks
     deep into Eddie's eyes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Thanks for your lap.

     Before Eddie can reply, she jumps off, and slinks offstage,
     leaving Eddie a pile of human wreckage.  Valiant slugs the
     rest of his drink down to put out the fire in his libido.

     When the lights come up, Valiant looks over to where Acme is
     slicking down his eyebrows and patting his hair down.  He
     stands, picks up a bouquet of roses from the chair beside
     him, and as he passes Valiant's table, gives him a big wink.
     Valiant watches Acme disappear backstage.  He stands, drops
     a couple bucks on the table, and follows after him.


     BACKSTAGE

     Valiant steps past the curtain, keeping a discreet distance.
     He follows Marvin Acme down a corridor and around the corner.
     Acme stops and knocks on a dressing room door.  After a
     moment, it opens and Acme goes inside.  Valiant checks over
     his shoulder, but the backstage area is empty.  He eases over
     to the door and puts his eye to the keyhole.


     POV THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Jessica is seated at her dressing table.  Acme is on his
     knees next to her, kissing his way up her gloved hand, eyes
     closed in ecstasy.  Jessica takes her hand out of the glove
     and starts combing her hair, leaving Marvin kissing a
     suspended Toon glove.


     ANGLE ON VALIANT

     while he continues his peeping.  The Gorilla bouncer sneaks
     up behind him.

                               GORILLA
               Hey, whaddaya think you're doin',
               chump?

                               VALIANT
               Who're you callin' chump, chimp?

     The Gorilla smiles sadistically when he recognizes Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               Oh, it's da comedian...

     The Gorilla grabs Valiant by the belt and lifts him off the
     ground.  He opens the fire door and heaves Valiant out.


     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

     Valiant comes flying out the door and CRASHES into a bunch of
     garbage cans in the alley.  The Gorilla stands in the doorvay
     regarding the dazed Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               And don't lemme catch your peepin' face
               around here again.  Got it?

                               VALIANT
               Ooga-booga.

     The Gorilla slams the door.  Valiant picks himself up out of
     the garbage.  He brushes himself off, then starts down the
     alley toward the rear of the building.  We FOLLOW him around
     the corner where he stops under Jessica's dressing room
     window.  He drags over a milk crate to stand on, takes a
     small camera out of his pocket and opens the bellows.  He
     stands on the crate and aims the camera through the corner of
     the window, as we HEAR the MUFFLED CONVERSATION from within.

                               ACME (O.S.)
               Are we going to play pattycake tonight?

                               JESSICA RABBIT (0.5.)
               Marvin, I have a headache...

                               ACME (O.S.)
                      (hurt)
               But you promised...

                               JESSICA RABBIT (O.S.)
               Oh, all right.  But this time take that
               hand buzzer off...

     Valiant's eyes widen in disgust.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus Christ...

     As he starts CLICKING pictures...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

     There's one light on in the Administration building.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     It's a large art deco office with walls covered with photos
     of Maroon and various celebrities, human and Toon.  R.K.
     Maroon is seated behind his desk.  Standing nearby is
     Valiant.  They are both regarding a hysterical Roger Rabbit,
     who's holding a set of 8 x lO glossies.  He's WAILING and
     CRYING, Toon tears flooding off him in a torrent.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Pattycake!  Pattycake!

                               VALIANT
               Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a
               good pair of shoes over it.

     ANGLE ON RUG

     Roger's tears have formed a puddle around the desk.  Valiant
     lifts a well-worn oxford and shakes the water off it.


     MAROON

     hands Roger his handkerchief.  Roger AAH-OO-GA'S his nose.

                               MAROON
               Take comfort, son, you're not the first
               man whose wife played pattycake on him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I don't believe it.  I won't believe
               it.

                               MAROON
               The pictures don't lie.  Mr. Valiant
               here took them himself.

     Roger takes another look at the pictures.


     CLOSE - PHOTOS

     They're shots of Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme seated knee
     to knee, caught in the act of slapping palms... really
     playing pattycake.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Maroon gets up and crosses to a bar table set up by the
     window.  He pours a drink from a crystal decanter as Roger
     starts sobbing again.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But Jessy... she's the light of my
               life, the apple of my eye, the cream in
               my coffee...

     Valiant eyes the booze longingly as he mutters to himself.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you better start thinkin' about
               drinkin' it black.

                               MAROON
               Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's
               been my friend and neighbor for thirty
               years.

     Maroon gestures out the window.  We see a blinking neon sign
     on the roof of the building across the street -- "Acme - If
     It's Acme - It's A Gasser!"

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Who would have thought he was the Sugar
               Daddy?

     Maroon turns and carries the drink to Roger.  Meanwhile,
     Valiant sidles over to the bar to help himself.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Well, the important thing now Roger, is
               to put all this behind you.
                      (hands him
                       drink)
               Drink this, son, you'll feel better.

     Roger takes the glass and shoots it down in one gulp.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               I know this all seems painful now, but
               you'll find someone new.  Won't he, Mr,
               Valiant?

     Eddie has just picked up the decanter to pour one for
     himself.

                               VALIANT
                      (over shoulder)
               Oh, yeah.  Good lookin' guy like him.
               Dames'll be breakin' his door down.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     The booze is taking its effect.  There's a RUMBLE like a
     volcano about to erupt.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     Toon steam whistle SHRIEKING.  The HIGH PITCH causes glass
     objects in the room to SHATTER... including the crystal
     decanter that Valiant's holding in his hand.  It EXPLODES,
     soaking his suit with booze.  Valiant looks down at the
     damage, completely exasperated.

                               VALIANT
               Son-of-a-bitch...
                      (turns)
               Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now,
               so about the rest of my fee...

                               MAROON
               Sure, Valiant, sure...

     Maroon sits at the desk and writes a check.

                               MAROON
               Being experienced in these matrimonial
               matters, you have any advice for our
               friend here?

     Valiant crosses to the desk and takes the check.

                               VALIANT
               My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get
               yourself a quickie divorce.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Divorce?  Never!

     Suddenly Roger jumps onto Maroon's desk and grabs Valiant by
     the lapels.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Marriage is a two-way street and we're
               just experiencing a detour!  Jessica
               and I are going to get back together.
               We're going to be happy!   H-A-P-P-I!

     Roger zips off the desk and CRASHES out the window, leaving a
     rabbit outline in the glass... backlit by the blinking Acme
     sign.  Maroon and Valiant walk to the window and look out the
     rabbit-shaped hole in the window.

                               VALIANT
               At least he took it well.


     INT. VALIANT'S BUNGALOW - CLOSE - EMPTY BOOZE BOTTLE - EARLY
     MORNING

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL the bottle's on the floor next to the
     couch Valiant's passed out on.  He's still dressed in his
     clothes.  PAN the small studio apartment.  In the
     kitchen/alcove, Valiant has created a makeshift darkroom.  We
     see a curtain on a clothesline.  Various trays, and some
     pictures clipped up on clothespins.  The pictures depict
     Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme in various states of
     pattycake.  Now there is LOUD POUNDING on the door.  But it
     doesn't break through VaLiant's subconscious for several
     seconds.  Finally, he rouses, gets up and walks a crooked
     line to the door.  Valiant opens it and squints into the
     excruciating sunlight.  When his eyes focus, REVEAL a
     hang-dog POLICE DETECTIVE holding Eddie's morning paper.

                               VALIANT
               Lieutenant Santino... how ya doin'?

     Santino ignores the question and regards Valiant with a
     mixture of disgust and pity.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for
               a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               That's what you woke me up for?

     Santino flops open the morning paper.  Valiant's eyes narrow
     as he reads it.  The headline screams:  "TOON KILLS MAN!" And
     underneath:  "Marvin Acme Murdered at the Hands of Jealous
     Rabbit".  Santino throws the paper on the sofa.

                               LT. SANTINO
               You got trouble, Eddie.

     EXT. ACME FACTORY - DAY

     An L.A. police car turns into the yard of the Acme factory
     and pulls up in front of the old factory building.  There's
     all kinds of official activity in the yard... cop cars, a
     Coroner's truck, etcetera.

     Valiant and Santino get out of the police car.  Santino
     starts into the factory.  But he realizes Valiant's not
     following him.  He turns to see Valiant looking over the wall
     behind the factory, transfixed.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Now what?

                               VALIANT
               Just haven't been this close to
               Toontown for awhile.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The sky above the wall is a different color, a little bit
     more vibrant, a "Toon Blue", you might call it.


     SANTINO

     walks back and takes Valiant's arm.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Let's go, somebody wants to see you.

     Santino leads Valiant into the factory.


     INT. FACTORY - DAY

     It's a large warehouse filled with stacks of Toon gags,..
     boxes of dynamite, giant slingshots, boulders, everything
     you've ever seen in a Roadrunner cartoon.  Santino stops
     where a large black safe is imbedded at a cockeyed angle in
     the floor.  A FORENSIC TEAM is at work around the safe.
     They're chalking the outline around a body half obscured by
     the safe.

                               LT. SANTINO
               They say the rabbit got the safe idea
               from a cartoon he was makin' the other
               day.

                               VALIANT
               What a gasser.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Wait here...

     Santino walks to Acme's glassed office where a sobbing
     Jessica Rabbit is being interrogated.  We can only see her,
     not the person doing the interrogating.  Valiant sidles over
     to where the Forensic Guys are dusting the photographs he had
     taken for prints.  One of the Forensic Guys looks up from his
     work.

                               FORENSIC #1
               Say, didn't you used to be Eddie
               Valiant?

     Valiant ignores the slings and arrows and surveys the scene
     of the crime.  The door of the safe is ajar.  Valiant tries
     to look inside.  Forensic #2 closes the door with his knee.

     Now we HEAR the VOICE of Jessica Rabbit from behind them.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Mr. Valiant?

     Valiant turns to the voice.  WHAP!  Jessica slaps him hard
     enough across the face to make his head turn.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               I hope you're proud of yourself.

     She turns on her heel and storms off, sobbing into a
     handkerchief.  Valiant, rubbing his jaw, looks after her.  So
     do the Forensic Guys.

                               FORENSIC #1
               She likes you, Valiant.

                               FORENSIC #2
                      (low wolf
                       whistle)
               When they drew her, they broke the
               pencil.

     Now two WHITE-JACKETS from the Coroner's office start to
     carry Acme out on a stretcher.  As they pass Valiant, a hand
     still wearing a Hand Buzzer flops out.  Valiant grabs it --
     stopping the stretcher.

                               VALIANT
               Makes you wonder what in the world she
               was doin' with a guy who didn't clean
               his fingernails.


     CLOSE - HAND

     Imbedded under the fingernails is a reddish-brown substance.

                               FORENSIC #1
               So... it's blood.


     VALIANT

     peels a piece of it off... it chips and falls to the ground.
     He squats to examine it.

                               VALIANT
               It's not blood, it's paint.

     Suddenly the end of a cane comes down on Valiant's hand,
     pinning it to the floor.  Valiant follows the cane UP to it's
     gavel-shaped head -- past black pants, a black robe, to a
     cadaver-like complected face, and a large hooked proboscis.
     The head is shaved.  Rimless tinted glasses obscure the eyes.
     Although he's human, the total appearance is frighteningly
     vulture-like.  JUDGE DOOM is accompanied by Santino.

                               DOOM
               Is this man removing evidence from the
               scene of a crime?

                               LT. SANTINO
                      (deferential)
               Uh... no, Judge Doom.  Valiant here was
               just about to hand it over, weren't
               you, Valiant?

                               DOOM
               I'll take that.

     Doom takes his cane off Eddie's hand and reaches out for the
     paint chip.  Valiant palms a piece and drops a smaller piece
     into Doom's hand.  Doom examines it.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Looks like the deceased grabbed a
               handful of your client's pantaloons,
               Mr. Valiant.

     Valiant stands to face the Judge, who towers over him.

                               VALIANT
               He's not my client.  I was workin' for
               R.K. Maroon.

                               DOOM
               Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told
               us the rabbit became quite agitated
               when you showed him the pictures, and
               said nothing would stand in the way of
               him getting his wife back.  Is that
               true?

                               VALIANT
               Hey, pal, do I look like a
               stenographer?

                               LT. SANTINO
               Watch your mouth, Eddie, he's a judge.

     Doom smiles thinly at Valiant, tarns and walks with purpose
     towards the door.  Santino and Valiant follow.

                               DOOM
               The rabbit's movements are fairly clear
               after leaving the Maroon Studios.  He
               ran across the street, jimmied this
               door open, hoisted the safe on a block
               and tackle...


     EXT. ACME FACTORY

     Doom leads them outside and indicates a window.

                               DOOM
               ... then stood out here waiting for his
               prey.  After he cold-bloodedly
               accomplished his task, he went home.
               He was almost apprehended there by my
               men.

     Doom nods his head toward a group of sinister WEASLES (a la
     Disney's "Wind In The Willows").  They're loitering by a
     dogcatcher's wagon with "Toontown Control" on the side,
     cleaning their fingernails with switchblades and polishing
     Toon revolvers.
         
                               VALIANT
               Men?  They look more like weasles to
               me.

                               DOOM
               Yes, I find that weasles have a special
               gift for the work.
                      (turns back to
                       Valiant)
               The rabbit didn't contact you by any
               chance, did he?

                               VALIANT
               Why would he contact me?  I just took
               some lousy pictures.

                               DOOM
               So you wouldn't have any idea where he
               might be?

                               VALIANT
               Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's
               very nice this time of year.

     Doom steps into Valiant's face.

                               DOOM
               I'm surprised you aren't more
               cooperative, Mr. Valiant.  A human has
               been murdered by a Toon.  Don't you
               appreciate the magnitude of that?  My
               goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to
               rein in the insanity.  To bring a
               semblance of law and order to a place
               where no civilized person has ever been
               able to step foot.
               The only way to do that is to make the
               Toons respect the law.

     Suddenly a "YA-HA-HOOEY" interrupts his pontification, as a
     scruffy little TOON GOPHER comes hurtling over the wall from
     the Toontown side.  He's holding his blackened rear end...
     apparently the result of a run-in with a stick of dynamite.
     BONK!  The Gopher hits Doom in the back of the head, sending
     them both sprawling.  The Gopher picks himself up and shakes
     off the effects of the concusion.  When he sees who he's
     knocked down, he panics.

                               GOPHER
                      (petrified)
               Judge Doom!  Here, let me get that for
               ya.

     He whips a clothes brush out of his back pocket and furiously
     tries to clean the Judge's cloak.  Doom picks up the Gopher
     by the scruff of the neck and gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               Why, you filthy little vagrant, you've
               soiled my robe!

                               GOPHER
               It's cleanin' up real good. Judge.

                               DOOM
               You've defiled a symbol of justice.

     As Doom carries the Gopher to the "Toontown Control" wagon,
     Valiant shoots a look to Santino.

                               VALIANT
                      (aside)
               Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?

                               LT. SANTINO
               No one knows.  He bought the election
               a few years back.  He's been rulin'
               Toontown ever since.

     When Doom gets to the wagon, the Weasles open up the back.
     In place of steel bars is a stream of fluid.  A Weasle turns
     a key and the flow of liquid stops.  The Gopher starts
     kicking furiously, trying to avoid the lock-up.

                                       GOPHER
                Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme
                go.  I think I hear my mother callin'
                me.

     Finally, the Gopher breaks free and makes a desperate dash
     for the wall.  Doom watches him run and calmly turns to where
     his car is parked.  It's a black Lincoln touring car with an
     ugly bird-like hood ornament.

                               DOOM
               Voltaire... the Gopher!

     Suddenly. the hood ornament SQUAWKS to life.  It's a hideous
     TOON VULTURE.  The Vulture flaps into flight.

     Just as the Gopher is about to make it over the top of the
     wall the Vulture's talons sink into his rear end and lift him
     airborne.  The Vulture drops the Gopher off with the Weasles.
     They pin him down.

                               GOPHER
               Hey, don't I have any rights?

                               DOOM
               Yes, you do... to a swift and speedy
               trial.

     One of the Weasles retrieves a briefcase from the sedan, puts
     it on the hood and snaps it open.  Twelve TOON KANGAROOS pop
     up, arranged in a jury box.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Court is now in session.

     He raps the Gopher on the head with the gavel end of his
     cane.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               The defendant is charged with vagrancy,
               assault and resisting arrest.  How do
               you find him?

     The Kangaroo court delivers the verdict instantly. Twelve
     LITTLE KANGAROOS pop up out of their Momma's pouches, holding
     up small cards, each with a letter spelling Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  He turns his attention back
     to the Gopher.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I hereby sentence you to the dip!

                               GOPHER
               Oh no, not the dip!  Anything but the
               dip!  I'm too young to die...

     As the Judge pulls on a black rubber glove, the Weasles take
     out a stainless steel tub WHEEZING with sadistic glee.  They
     fill it from a spigot on the truck.

                               VALIANT
               What's with the dip?

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's how he gets rid of the
               troublemakers.  It's a combination of
               acetone, turpentine and paint remover.
               He calls it the...  Final Solution.


     THE GOPHER

     is wriggling and SCREAMING bloody murder as Doom lifts him up
     and holds him over the tub.  Then, as he's lowered into the
     solution, he starts to disappear. His pathetic SCREAMS are
     snuffed MID-YELP.

                               GOPHER
               Help!  Help!  He...

     The Gopher's gone.  All that's left of him is a paint slick
     on the surface of the liquid.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus.

     Doom pulls off the black rubber gloves finger by finger and
     hands them to a Weasle.  He turns to Valiant.

                               DOOM
                They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
                but that's how we handle things in
                Toontown.  I would think you'd
                appreciate that.

     He gets into his car, he pauses and looks back at Valiant.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               After all, didn't a Toon kill your
               brother?


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Dolores is behind the bar cutting lemon peels and preparing
     for the day's bartending.  There's one early customer, a
     grey-haired TROLLEYMAN in his Red Car uniform.  His hat's on
     the stool next to him and he's already drunk.  The door
     opens.  It's Valiant.  He walks over to the bar, reaches for
     a bottle and a shot glass and helps himself.  Dolores picks
     up a copy of the morning paper.

                               DOLORES
               Hey, Eddie, looks like you really
               stepped in it this time.

                               VALIANT
               What are you complaining about?  Here's
               your fifty bucks.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (mumbling to
                       himself)
               Thirty-five years and all I got to show
               for it is a ticket punch.

                               VALIANT
               What's with Earl?

                               DOLORES
               A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some
               big company called Cloverleaf
               Industries.

                               VALIANT
               No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?

                               DOLORES
               Bastards put him on notice.

     Valiant picks up his glass. lifts it in toast to the
     Trolleyman.

                               VALIANT
               Here's to the pencil pushers.  May they
               all get lead poisoning.

     Now the Trolleyman unsteadily climbs up on his stool to get
     close to the Holy Grail... the Red Car route map over the
     bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (wistfully)
               The old Number Six Line... who'da
               thought they'd close that one down?

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, get him down from there.  He's
               gonna break his neck.

     Eddie grabs Earl around the legs and throws him over his
     shoulder like a sack of potatoes.  He carries him over to a
     booth and puts him down carefully, covering him with a
     tablecloth.

                               TROLLEYMAN
               Took you right to Toontown, it did.

                               VALIANT
               I know, I know... poor S.O.B.

     Valiant walks back to his drink at the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Do you think the rabbit did it?

                               VALIANT
               I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Make that a round.

     Valiant and Dolores look down the bar, but there's no one
     there.  Finally the familiar cowlick of Baby Herman rises to
     the top of the bar as he clambers up a barstool.

                               DOLORES
               We don't serve formula. Snookums.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You serve martinis, doncha?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah...

    Baby Herman slides his baby bottle down the bar to Dolores.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be
               wet.
                      (to Valiant)
               You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby
               Herman.

                               VALIANT
               I know who you are.  Kinda out of your
               neighborhood, aren't you?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a
               friend of mine's bein' framed.

                               VALIANT
               You mean the rabbit?  They got him
               cold.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You don't believe that.  I mean. the
               guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete
               fool...  but he'd never kill anyone.
               I know the guy.

     Dolores brings Baby Herman his baby bottle cocktail.

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (continuing)
               Thanks, doll.

     When Dolores turns around, Baby Herman pats her on the
     bottom.

                               DOLORES
                      (over her
                       shoulder)
               Oh, a ladies man, huh?

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (sotto voce; to
                       Valiant)
               My problem is I got a fifty-year-old
               lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

                               VALIANT
               My problem is I come here to drink in
               peace.  So if you don't mind...

                               BABY HERMAN
               C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole
               thing smell a bit funny to you?  I
               mean, no offense, but how did a
               mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in
               the first place?

                               DOLORES
                      (chiming in)
               Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an
               ad in the Yellow Pages.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.

                               BABY HERMAN
               And another thing, the paper said no
               will was found.  But every Toon knows
               Acme had a will and, in it he promised
               to leave Toontown to the Toons.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it then?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Somebody took it from him.  That's what
               this whole thing's about.

                               DOLORES
               The papers said the safe door was
               opened, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya,
               Dolores?

                               BABY HERMAN
               My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always
               was after Acme's property.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket and dangles it
     in front of Baby Herman.

                               BABY HERMAN
               No.  But neither does Roger.  That's
               Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise
               Orange.

                               DOLORES
               Well, I'll be...

                               BABY HERMAN
               So what's your next move, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               My next move?  That's easy.  I'm
               gettin' up, and I'm walkin' out the
               door, and I'm goin' home to bed.

     Valiant stands.

                               DOLORES
               So you're not even gonna bother to find
               out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?

                               VALIANT
               He's a Toon... who cares?

     Baby Herman shakes his head sorrowfully.  As Valiant heads
     for the door, Dolores whaps her towel down on the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Well, you used to care, Eddie.  And it
               didn t matter if a client's skin was
               black, white, or painted!

     Valiant ignores her and walks out the door.


     INT. VALIANT'S HOUSE - DAY

     Eddie comes in the door with his coat over his shoulder.  He
     tosses the jacket over the chair and walks to the Murphy bed.
     He grabs the strap, and loosening his tie, walks away from
     the wall, pulling the bed down.  What he doesn't see is...


     ROGER RABBIT

     asleep in the bed.


     VALIANT

     still with his back to Roger, sits down exhaustedly on the
     bed and kicks off his shoes.  He lies back and pulls the
     covers over him.  He closes his eyes, rolls over to get
     comfortable.  Now he and Roger are nose-to-nose.  They both
     open their eyes at the same time.  They freak.

                               VALIANT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

     They both jump out of the bed.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I needed a place to hide.  I'm in
               trouble, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could
               get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm
               here.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my
               house?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, I asked the newsboy on the
               corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked
               a janitor, the fireman and finally the
               green grocer down the way.  He was very
               helpful.

                               VALIANT
               In other words, the whole goddamn world
               knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!

     Eddie tries to open the door, but Roger blocks it
     spider-like, arms and legs extended.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Eddie, don't put me out.  I
               didn't do it, I swear.

     Valiant gives up trying to open the door and grabs Roger.  He
     pulls and he pulls.  Finally Roger snaps off like a broken
     rubber band.  The two of them go tumbling backward.  Valiant
     makes a grab for Roger but he slips out of his grasp like
     quicksilver.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Sure I wanted to win Jessy back, but
               not that way.

     Valiant lunges again.  Roger dodges.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               After I left you, I went to see her at
               the Ink & Paint Club.

     Valiant picks himself up and tries to catch his breath.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               She was on stage, so I found a piece of
               paper and wrote her a love letter.

     Roger pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and starts
     reading.

                                ROGER RABBIT
                       (continuing)
               'Dear Jessy.  How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the ways.  1-1000, 2-1000,
               3-1000...

     Valiant leaps for Roger and gets bim by the throat.  He rips
     the paper out of Roger's hand and crumples it up and throws
     it down.  He opens the door, throws Roger outside and quickly
     slams the door shut.  He leans against it, breathing hard.
     Suddenly, Roger comes through the mail slot like a limbo
     dancer.  Valiant, too tired to chase him, just watches him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, that wasn't very nice.

     He retrieves the love letter, straightens it and puts it back
     in his pocket.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               It took me almost an hour to compose
               that.  But I decided not to leave it
               anyway.  I'd read it in person, that
               was my plan.

     Valiant crosses to the kitchen area where the dark room is
     still set up.  He opens the cabinet under the sink and comes
     out with a bottle of Scotch.  He takes a shot glass and pours
     himself one.

                               VALIANT
               Look, pal, if you're still here when I
               finish this drink, I'm callin' the
               police.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya.
               The police'll just dip me.  They were
               waitin' for me when I got home last
               night.  I ran.

                               VALIANT
               If you're so innocent, why'd you run?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always
               run.

     Valiant shoots the drink down and holds up the empty glass.
         
                               VALIANT
               That's it.

     He crosses to the phone on the counter.  He lifts the
     receiver and starts to dial.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, this is the moment of truth!  And
               I've spoken the truth, but you won't
               believe the truth.  So I guess the
               truth is my goose is cooked, my hash is
               slung. my fait is accompli.

     As Valiant finishes dialing, he idly puts the empty shot
     glass down on a photograph on the counter.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Won't anything change your mind?

     Valiant turns from the pleading rabbit.  Now something he
     sees on the counter gets his attention.


     POV THROUGH SHOT GLASS

     The shot glass is resting on one of the reject pictures of
     Acme and Jessica.  The bottom of the glass is magnifying the
     back of the exuberant Marvin Acme.  Sticking out of his back
     pocket is a legal folder headed "Last Will and Testament".


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He looks as if the truth has just hit him in the face.

                               VALIANT
               The goddamn will.

                               VOICE
                      (on phone)
               L.A.P.D.?

     Valiant slowly returns the phone to the cradle,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You mean you believe me?

     Now outside we HEAR TIRES SCREECHING to a stop.  Roger runs
     to the window and pulls back the drapes.  His eyes bug out of
     his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's Toon Control!

     Valiant comes to the window and looks out, too.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The Toon Control wagon has stopped in front of the house.
     The Weasles pile out.  One of them takes what looks like a
     butterfly net out of the back.  Several others grab violin
     cases.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     Valiant jerks Roger back behind the curtain.

                               VALIANT
               Get away from that window.

     Roger, elated, jumps into Valiant's arms.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You're gonna help me?  How can I ever
               thank you?

     He plants a big wet Toon kiss on Valiant's lips.

                               VALIANT
               For starters... don't ever kiss me.


     EXT. BUNGALOW

     The Weasles are filing up the walk to the front door.  The
     leader pounds on the front door.

                               WEASLE
               Police...


     INT. BUNGALOW

     Valiant puts Roger down.

                               VALIANT
               I'll talk to 'em.  Find a place to
               hide.

     Roger zips to the closet door and goes inside.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Not in there.  That's the first place
               they'll look.

     Valiant goes to the closet and opens the door.  REVEAL Roger
     is now dressed in Eddie's trenchcoat and hat.  Playfully,
     Roger snaps one of the handcuffs onto Eddie's wrist.  He's
     got the Other attached to one of his wrists.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest!
               Just kidding...

                               VALIANT
               You idiot.  I lost the key for those
               cuffs.

     BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The KNOCKING is more impatient.  Valiant
     looks to the door.

                               WEASLE (O.S.)
               Open up!


     EXT. VALIANT'S DOOR

     The Weasles open the violin cases and take out real tommy guns
     and shoulder them in teams of two.  Suddenly they unleash a
     torrent of MACHINE GUN FIRE, making the outline of a weasle
     in the door with BULLETS.  The leader blows on the cut-out
     and it falls in.  The Weasles file through one by one.


     INT. APARTMENT

     The Weasles don't bother to look around.  They all just start
     BLASTING.  Bullets fly every which way.  The barrage destroys
     Valiant's apartment in a matter of seconds.  When the
     shooting stops and the smoke clears, the Weasles look around.
     The head Weasle spots blood all over the kitchen floor.

                                WEASLE #1
               We got him.

     But when he looks behind the counter, it's only a shattered
     ketchup bottle.


     EXT. REAR OF APARTMENT

     Eddie and Roger, handcuffed together, are beating it down the
     alley.  Roger, being a rabbit, is beating it a lot faster.
     He's kicking up dust, his legs are blur.  Valiant stumbles
     trying to keep up.  When they round the corner, Roger slams
     on the brakes, Toon style.  Valiant goes skidding past him and
     is jerked to a stop like a dog on a short leash.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a
               Toon.

                               VALIANT
               Don't ever forget that.


     EXT. BUNGALOW - BACK WINDOW - THE WEASLES

     come piling out the window.  They start sniffing the ground.
     Suddenly one of them freezes on point, like a dog.  Another
     blows a HUNTER'S HORN and they're off on the trail.


     EXT. STREET - EDDIE AND ROGER

     emerge from the alley.  They pause momentarily to
     reconnoiter.  Eddie decides to go left, Roger right.  When
     they get to the end of the cuffs, they snap back into a pile.
     Valiant gets back to his feet and hauls Roger up angrily.

                               VALIANT
               This way, goof...

     They start across the street.  But Roger goes on one side of
     the Street sign, Eddie the other.  Roger coils around it like
     a tether ball.  Valiant yanks Roger off the sign and they
     duck across the street just as a trolley car passes.


     THE WEASLES

     come bloodhounding around the corner.  They search the street
     for signs of the fugitive.  But when they get to the trolley
     tracks, they stop, bewildered.

                               WEASLE #1
               Scent's cold.

                               WEASLE #2
               Pssst.

     He points toward the trolley car pulling into the Terminal
     Station.  They fall all over themselves scurrying over to the
     trolley.  They surround it and jump aboard, tommy-gun at the
     ready.


     INT. RED CAR

     The CONDUCTOR raises his hands like it was a hold-up.  A
     couple PASSENGERS scream as the Weasles search the car.  But
     no Roger or Eddie.  As quickly as they got on, they get off.


     EXT. RED CAR

     as it pulls away.  The Weasles look around perplexed.

                               WEASLE #1
               Funny... I could swear I smelled
               rabbit.


     ANGLE FROM ABOVE

     Eddie and Roger are balanced on the trolley wire above the
     Weasles' heads.  As the Weasles sniff around the barn, Eddie
     and Roger ease along the wire, using the wall of the Terminal
     Bar to lean on.


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - KITCHEN

     Dolores is preparing corned beef and cabbage.  The RADIO is
     PLAYING "MARES EAT OATS".  A NEWSCASTER breaks into the
     music.

                               NEWSCASTER
               News flash... Hollywood.  Citywide
               Toonhunt for Roger Rabbit, suspect in
               Acme slaying.  Police describe him as
               short, cuddly...  and psychotic.

     Dolores turns just as Roger's grinning face appears in the
     window.

                               DOLORES
                      (startled)
               Mother Mary...

     Now Eddie's face comes into view.  He motions for her to open
     the window.


     OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

     Roger and Eddie watch another trolley approach.  The contact
     arm sparks its way along the wire as it rolls along towards
     them.  Valiant watches as Dolores struggles to get the window
     open.

                               VALIANT
               Hurry, hurry...

     At the last second, the window opens.  Eddie jumps for the
     sill, Roger dangling from the cuffs as the trolley passes.


     INT. KITCHEN

     Dolores helps pull Valiant through the window.  Then he drags
     Roger inside.

                               DOLORES
               Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it
               is?

                               VALIANT
               Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

     Roger bows at the waist, takes her hand and kisses it like
     Charles Boyer

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Charmed, enchanted, pleasure's all
               mined.

                               DOLORES
               Where'd you find him?

                               VALIANT
               The Toon Fairy left him under my
               pillow.

     Now Roger spots a plate of freshly shucked corn.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               May I?

     Before she can answer, he grabs an ear, presses it to his
     lips and applies the typewriter method to it.  When he gets
     to the end of a row, we even HEAR the BING!

                               DOLORES
               He's a riot.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed
               to him.
                      (holds up
                       cuffs)
               Anybody in the back room?

                               DOLORES
               It's all yours.

     We FOLLOW Dolores as she leads Valiant and Roger across the
     hall.  She stops at a door, unlocks it, and leads them in.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     It's a tiny storage room/office with an institutional metal
     desk, a cot, and assorted janitorial supplies stacked around.
     Dolores shuts and locks the door behind her.  Valiant goes to
     a metal locker and digs through some tools, coming out with a
     hacksaw.  He sits on the cot and starts working on the cuffs.

                               DOLORES
               So you decided to help him after all?

                               VALIANT
               I oughta have my head examined.
                      (to Roger)
               Will you hold still?

     Roger quiets like a child for a moment as Valiant saws
     feverishly.  Then Roger slips his hand out of the cuff and
     holds his side while Eddie keeps sawing.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Does this help?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, that's better.

     Valiant saws a couple more strokes before the realization of
     what Roger's done hits him.  His face darkens.  Roger sees
     the look and sheepishly tries to recover by sticking his hand
     back in the cuff.

                               VALIANT
               You mean to tell me you coulda taken
               your hand outta that cuff at any time?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, no, not any time.  Only when it
               was funny.

     Valiant looks at Roger like he's about to brain him.  Roger
     pulls his hand free again, and cowers out of range.  Valiant
     just rubs his forehead.

                               VALIANT
               Are you always this funny, or only on
               days when you're wanted for murder?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My philosophy is if you don't have a
               sense of humor, you're better off dead.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah... well you just might get your
               wish.

                               DOLORES
               Can you get him out of it, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               If I can find whoever wanted to kill
               Acme bad enough to get this.

     Valiant throws the pattycake picture down on the table.
     Dolores and Roger both examine it closely.

                               DOLORES
               Acme's will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               So that's what this little drama is all
               about.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of
               the sound mind, your wife the sound
               body.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I resent that innuendo!  My wife is
               completely innocent.

                               VALIANT
               Your wife may be a lot of things, pal,
               but innocent isn't one of them.

                               DOLORES
               So what's the scam, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody
               wants Acme's property.  Cack the old
               man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the
               will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               The habeus corpus is thickening.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't
               think they got the will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               How do you know that?

                               VALIANT
               Well, Acme had the will in his pocket
               that night at the club.  It was gone in
               the morning when the cops found the
               body.

                               DOLORES
               Maybe they just took it out of his
               pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Then why'd they bother to crack the
               safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from
               Mount Baldy and it won't open.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your
               logic is specious.  What prevented Mr.
               Acme from putting the will back in the
               safe before they killed him?

                               VALIANT
               Because he's not forty feet tall.  The
               safe was up on the ceiling, remember?

     Dolores whistles over his deductions.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow
               maybe I'll go down to probate court and
               see who's sniffin' around Acme's
               estate?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle
               Maroon's cage.

     Valiant finishes sawing the cuffs.  He stands and throws the
     cuffs aside.  Valiant and Dolores go to the door.  Roger
     follows them eagerly.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               What should I do?  Who should I see?
               Where should I go?

     Valiant turns.

                               VALIANT
               Nothin', no one, nowhere,

     He slams the door.


     INT. POLO LOUNGE - CLOSE - MAROON

     He's in a booth in the middle of a business lunch.

                               MAROON
               Maybe money grows on trees in Toontown,
               but not at the Maroon Studio.

     WIDEN THE SHOT to REVEAL that Maroon's sharing a booth with
     BUGS BUNNY and his AGENT.  Bugs is chewing on a carrot.

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Look, Doc, fiduciary considerations
               aside, Roger Rabbit may have been
               willing to play second banana to an
               ankle-biter, but I ain't.


     ACROSS THE ROOM

     A MAITRE D' is leading Valiant and Augie, the deaf-mute to a
     table by the door.

                               VALIANT
               This'll be fine, huh, Augie?

      Augie nods his head.  They sit and pick up the menus.  Augie
      takes one peek and looks at Valiant, alarmed.  He scribbles a
      note.  Valiant reads it.

                               VALIANT
               Forget about the prices, pal.  If you
               want the shrimp cocktail, you have a
               shrimp cocktail.
                      (puts menu
                       down)
               Excuse me, Augie, I've got a little
               table-hopping to do.

      Valiant gets up from the table and starts across the room.


      AT MAROON'S BOOTH

                               AGENT
               I think you should know, R.K., we're in
               negotiations for Bugs to star in his
               own series at Warner Brothers.

                               MAROON
               Trying to scare up a bidding war
               between me and Jack Warner, eh?  Well,
               it won't work.  I'll call William
               Morris and I'll have 'em put out a
               rabbit call the likes of which this
               town's never seen!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               It's your dime, Doc.

                               MAROON
               And stop callin' me Doc!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Eh, sure, Doc.

     Now Valiant arrives, pulls up a chair from next table and
     sits down.

                               VALIANT
               Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?

                               MAROON
               Valiant?  What're you doin' here?

                               VALIANT
               I Just thought I'd drop by and show you
               a photograph.

                               MAROON
               I've already seen your photographs.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought
               you might be interested.

     Valiant takes an enlargement of the pattycake shot and puts
     it on the table in front of Maroon.  We can clearly see the
     will sticking out of Acme's pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Anyway... enjoy your lunch.

     Valiant stands and departs.  But his visit has done it's
     trick.  Maroon looks l'ike he's seen a ghost.  We FOLLOW
     Valiant across the room to his table where Augie is
     blissfully attacking a shrimp cocktail.

                               VALIANT
               How is that, Augie, pretty good?

     Augie nods enthusiastically.  Valiant keeps an eye on
     Maroon's booth.  Now he nudges Augie as Maroon excuses
     himself and goes into the phone booth just outside the door.
     Augie puts his shrimp fork down and picks up his pencil.


     AUGIE'S POV

     We see Maroon talk on the phone MOS.  As his lips move,
     Valiant supplies his words.

                               VALIANT (V.O.)
               It's me.  Valiant says there's a will.
               I don't know what he's trying to
               pull...


     BACK TO SCENE

     Valiant is reading of Augie's pad as Augie reads Maroon's
     lips, and scribbles down what he says.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               Somebody's gonna have to take care of
               him.

     Augie looks up from his scribbling to exchange an eyebrow
     raising glance with Valiant.  Then he turns back to Maroon
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               The old man had it at the club that
               night.  That's right.  Yeah, I'm sure.
               I'll be there.

     Augie stops writing as Maroon hangs up the phone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing; to
                       Augie)
               Where?

     Augie shrugs his shoulders.  Disappointed, Valiant lights a
     cigarette.  Now Augie elbows him and gestures across at
     Maroon, who's making another call.  Augie starts writing
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       reading)
               Iris... cancel my appointments this
               afternoon.  I'll be at Forest Lawn.

     Maroon hangs up the phone and comes out of the phone booth.
     He hustles out of the room.  Valiant stands.

                               VALIANT
               You did great, Augie.  Have another
               shrimp cocktail.

     Valiant drops a twenty on the table and pats Augie on the
     back.


     EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

     A CARHOP wheels a yellow Packard up in front.  Maroon climbs
     in and ROARS off.  Valiant ENTERS THE FRAME.  He looks after
     Maroon, then calmly starts walking down the driveway.


     EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - RED CAR STOP - DAY

     A Red Car pulls up.  Valiant climbs off.  He calmly crosses
     the street and ducks behind the cemetery entranceway as
     Maroon's Packard ROARS through.

                               VALIANT
                      (impressed)
               Love that Red Car.

     As Valiant starts to walk up the hill...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE ACME FUNERAL SITE - LONG SHOT - DAY

     A hearse, and a line of black limos are parked in the lane.
     Nearby, Marvin Acme's funeral is in progress.  Clustered
     around a gravesite are the mourners... TOONS of every stripe.
     There's MICKEY MOUSE comforting MINNIE.  TOM AND JERRY.
     HECKLE AND JECKLE.  CHIP 'N DALE.  Everyone from the famous
     to the not so famous is in attendance.  The eulogy is being
     delivered in a familiar blustery Southern VOICE.  It's
     FOGHORN LEGHORN.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Today we commit the body of brother
               Acme to the cold, I say cold, cold
               ground.  We shed no tears for we know
               that Marvin is going to a better place.
               That high, high, I say that
               high-larious place up in the sky.

     Foghorn Leghorn dramatically points skyward.

                               TOONS
                      (in unison)
               A-men!


     NEW ANGLE - VALIANT

     is leaning up against a palm tree on the hill.  We have been
     watching the proceedings from his POV.  Now he sees Maroon's
     car pull up.  He moves around to the other side of the tree
     as Maroon passes and starts wending his way through the
     crowd.


     AT THE GRAVESITE

     Foghorn Leghorn nods to the funeral DIRECTOR, a pasty-faced
     human in a black mourning coat.  The Director starts to turn
     the crank lowering the coffin into the grave.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Give us a sign, brother Herman, that
               you've arrived...

     Much to the funeral Director's amazement, the crank starts
     PLINKING Out the tune to "POP GOES THE WEASLE".  Now the Toon
     mourners pick up on it and join in.

                               TOONS
                      (singing)
               Round and round the mullberry bush, The
               monkey chased the weasle...

     The crank and SONG start going FASTER AND FASTER.

                               TOONS
                      (continuing;
                       singing)
               The monkey raid it all was in fun.  POP!
               Goes the weasle.

     Suddenly half of the lid to Acme's coffin flies open and a
     harlequin CLOWN BOI-YOI-YOINGS out.  The funeral Director
     faints dead away as the Toon SOBS turn to LAUGHTER.  The
     Toons turn and head away from the grave comforted by a
     funeral befitting a gag king.  They climb into their cars and
     SCREECH off like the start of the Indy 500.  One mourner is
     left at the gravesite.  Sitting in a chair dabbing at her
     eyes with a handkerchief is Jessica Rabbit.  Maroon walks up
     behind her.

                               MAROON
               So... trying to pull a fast one on me,
               huh?

     Jessica turns, startled.  She stands and faces Maroon.


     VALIANT

     smiles and leans in.  This is the moment he's been waiting
     for.  Now just as the conversation begins, it is drowned out
     by the NOISE from a LAWN MOWER.  Valiant turns to see a
     GARDENER riding around on a small tractor cutting the grass.
     Valiant tries to flag him down as he watches Maroon and
     Jessica having an arguement.  There's accusatory finger
     pointing.  In pantomime, Maroon gestures into his pocket as
     if describing the position of Acme's will.

     Jessica tries to leave.  He grabs her arm.  They're screaming
     at each other but we don't hear a word.  Valiant waves
     frantically for the Gardener to cut the machine.  But the
     Gardener misconstrues it as a friendly greeting and waves
     back.  Valiant turns in time to see Jessica kick Maroon in
     the groin and stomp off to a red Auburn Speedster.  She jumps
     in and speeds away as Maroon staggers back to his car.  The
     Gardener stops the tractor next to Valiant.  He SHUTS OFF THE
     ENGINE.  The cemetery is completely still again.

                               GARDENER
               Somethin' you want, mister?

                               VALIANT
               Not anymore...


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT

     A Steinway piano truck is parked next to the stage door.  TWO
     husky PIANO MOVERS are rolling a baby grand up the ramp to
     the stage door.  They knock on the door.  The Gorilla opens
     it and they muscle the piano inside.  After a moment, they
     reemerge.  We FOLLOW them back to the truck where a second
     baby grand stands ready to be moved.

                               MOVER #1
               I don't know about you, but it makes me
               sick to think of these beautiful pianos
               gettin' chopped into match sticks every
               night by those screwy ducks.

     Struggling, they push this second piano into the club.


     INT. CLUB - BACKSTAGE

     They roll the piano over to the wall and park it next to the
     first.

                               MOVER #2
                      (shakes head)
               And they call it entertainment.

     As they go out the stage door, MOVE IN on the baby grand.


     INSIDE THE PIANO - VALIANT

     is lying prone -- using the Steinway as his own Trojan Horse.
     He lifts the piano lid to climb out, but then HEARS FOOTSTEPS
     approaching.  He lowers the lid again.  Now someone starts
     testing the keys.  We see the hammers strike the strings,
     RUNNING UP THE SCALES until they reach the one under
     Valiant's nose.  The hammer whacks Valiant's nose on the
     backswing and strikes the string making a terrible SOUR NOTE.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
                      (exasperated
                       QUACK)
               Phooey!  Out of tune again!

                               DAFFY DUCK (V.O.)
               Not to worry, Donald.  We can fix that
               with my sledgehammer.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
               Never mind, Daffy.  I've got an axe in
               my dressing room.

     Valiant's eyes widen.


     ANGLE ON PIANO

     as the VOICES of Daffy and Donald recede, Valiant raises the
     lid and quickly climbs out.  He eases over to Jessica's
     dressing room.  As he starts to open the door, he HEARS
     SCUFFLING from inside.  Valiant puts his ear to the door.
     More SCUFFLING.  Valiant straightens, then suddenly whips the
     door open and flicks on the light.


     INT. DRESSING ROOM

     Nobody's there.  Perplexed, Valiant closes the door behind
     him and checks behind the dressing screen.  In the closet.
     No one.  He shrugs and starts to search the room.  He goes to
     Jessica's dressing table and rifles the drawers.  In her
     purse he discovers a Toon revolver.  He examines it.

                               VALIANT
               Girl's gotta protect herself.

     Valiant puts the gun back in the purse and closes the drawer.
     As he stands, he pauses to consider a Hurrel-like
     black-and-white photo of Roger Rabbit in a silver deco frame.
     He's dramatically posed with a cigarette like he was Tyrone
     Power.

     Valiant shakes his head and turns from the table.  Something
     catches his eye.


     ANGLE ON FLOOR

     Behind the dressing table, the corner of a piece of blue
     paper peeks out.  Valiant stoops down and fishes it out.
     It's a cover for a legal document -- "Last Will and Testament
     -- Marvin Acme".


     VALIANT

     stands, pleased.  He opens the blue folder.  But it's empty.
     Valiant puts it in his inside pocket and turns to go when
     suddenly an unseen hand flicks the lights off.

                               VALIANT
               Son of a bitch...

     We can't see anything in the darkness.  But we hear the SOUND
     of A FISTFIGHT.  There's the CRASHING of lamps and furniture
     breaking.  Now the door opens for a second as the assailant
     escapes.  Light floods in the room, illuminating Valiant on
     the floor with a curtain wrapped around his head.  As he
     struggles free the door closes.  The room is dark again.
     Valiant scrambles to the door.  When he whips it open, REVEAL
     the Gorilla framed in the doorway.  Valiant is frozen.  The
     Gorilla flicks on the light.  He smiles wickedly.

                               GORILLA
               And here I tought we had mice.

     Valiant tries to make a break for it.  WHAM!  The Gorilla
     lays him out cold with a right cross.

                                              BLACKOUT.


     FADE IN:

     VALIANT'S POV FROM FLOOR

     As his vision comes INTO FOCUS, Valiant sees the Gorilla,
     Jessica Rabbit, the Weasles and Judge Doom are standing over
     him.

                               GORILLA
               ... I caught him rummagin' around in
               here.  Then I called you, Judge, on a
               counta you be da one we pay juice to.

                               DOOM
                      (clears throat)
               You did the right thing, Bongo.


     THE WEASLES

     pull a groggy Valiant upright and plop him in a chair in
     front of Doom.

                               DOOM
               Being caught breaking and entering is
               not very good advertising for a
               detective.  What were you looking for,
               Mr. Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Ask her...

     Valiant nods toward Jessica, who stands coolly smoking a
     cigarette.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Last week some heavy breather wanted
               one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe
               that's what he was after?

                               VALIANT
               Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I
               woulda broken into Frederick's of
               Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin
               Acme's will.

                               DOOM
               Marvin Acme had no will.  I should
               know, the probate is in my court.

                               VALIANT
               He had a will, all right.  She took it
               off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon
               knocked him off.  Then she set up her
               loving husband to take the fall.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You, Mr. Valiant, are either drunk or
               punch drunk.  Probably both.

                               DOOM
               These are bold accusations, Mr.
               Valiant.  I hope you have some proof?

                               VALIANT
               I found the cover the will came in
               behind the dressing table.

     Valiant reaches into his pocket.  But the blue envelope is
     gone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               They must've taken it off me.

                               DOOM
               They?

                               VALIANT
               The other people who were in here
               lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught
               'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted
               me.

     The Gorilla makes a move for Valiant.  Doom stops him.

                               DOOM
               Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr.
               Valiant our own way... downtown.

                               VALIANT
               Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of
               Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk
               to him.

                               DOOM
               Oh, not that downtown.  Toontown.

     The mention of Toontown has a visible impact on Valiant.

                               VALIANT
                      (nervous)
               You're not takin' me to downtown
               Toontown?

                               DOOM
               Indeed we are.  We'll continue the
               interrogation there.

                               VALIANT
                      (very agitated)
               I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me
               Santino.

                               DOOM
               You're a very stubborn man, Mr.
               Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show
               Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed
               men at the Toontown station...

     As the Weasles drag Valiant out of the room...

                               VALIANT
                      (screaming)
               No... you bastards!  Leggo of me!


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The Toon Control Wagon streaks along with the cat SIREN
     WAILING.  It flashes by then slams on the brakes at the
     entrance to an eerie tunnel.  A sign next to the tunnel says:
     "Toontown".


     INT. WAGON

     The Weasles look over at the bound and gagged Valiant.  One
     of them turns Valiant's head to look at the Toontown sign.

                               WEASLE #1
               What're you shakin' for?  Didn't you
               have a good time last time you were
               here?

     With a wicked WHEEZE, the driver floors it.


     EXT. TUNNEL

     The wagon disappears into the murky darkness.  PAN UP to the
     night sky.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     THE SKY - MORNING

     PAN DOWN to the tunnel.  We can't see into the darkness but
     we HEAR HOOTING and HOLLERING from within.  GUNS going off,
     FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING, WHIPS CRACKING, all accompanied by
     the WHEEZING LAUGHTER of the Weasles.

                               WEASLE #1 (O.S.)
               Soo-eey!  Soo-eey!

                               WEASLE #2 (O.S.)
               Let him go, boys.  I think he's got the
               message.

     After a beat, Valiant comes staggering out of the tunnel.
     He's got a burlap sack over his head tied around his waist.
     Behind him, the Weasles emerge holding paint cans and
     brushes.  They watch as he trips and falls by the side of the
     road.  The Weasles GIGGLE victoriously and head back inside.
     Valiant lies there for a moment, catching his breath.  Then
     he struggles to free his hands.  Finally he rips the sack off
     his head and sits up.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     We see he's got a huge Toon pig with a goofy grin painted
     over his head.  Valiant pulls and tugs on it, but this is a
     costume that won't come off.  Valiant curses, gets to his
     feet and stumbles down the road.


     EXT. RED CAR STOP

     Valiant gets in the back of the line of PASSENGERS boarding
     the Red Car.


     INT. RED CAR - VALIANT

     steps aboard.  The Trolleyman, who we recognize as Earl from
     the Terminal bar, does a double-take when he sees the
     ridiculously silly looking man/Toon.

                               EARL
               Here's one for the books... a Toon
               wearin' human clothes.

                               VALIANT
               Earl... it's me, Valiant.

                               EARL
               Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?

                               VALIANT
               Toon cops worked me over.

                               EARL
               Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real
               Toon-a-Roo.

                               VALIANT
                      (apprehensively)
               What am I, Earl?

     Earl breaks the news to Valiant soberly.

                               EARL
               You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

                               VALIANT
               No...

                               EARL
               Does it hurt?

                               VALIANT
               Not much.  It's hard to talk.

                               EARL
               Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you
               sit in the back so you won't cause as
               much of a commotion.

     Valiant tries to pull the brim of his hat down.  But it's
     comically small on the huge head.  He makes his way down the
     aisle past a veritable gauntlet of RAZZING, poking, tripping
     PASSENGERS.  Finally he finds an empty seat in the back as
     the Red Car starts up.


     A LITTLE KID

     wearing a baseball cap is sitting a few seats away with his
     MOTHER.  The Kid looks back at Eddie and laughs.  He leans
     over and whispers something to his Mom.

                               KID
               Can I, Mom?

                               MOMMY
               Go ahead, darling.  Take your bat.

     The Kid takes his baseball bat and approaches Valiant
     innocently.

                               KID
               Hi, Mr. Pig.  If I hit you on the head,
               will you make me a cuckoo bird?

     The Kid starts to take a swing with the bat.

                               VALIANT
               Kid, if you hit me on the head, I'm
               gonna throw you out this window.

     The Kid's eyes widen in terror.  This is not a typical Toon
     response.

                               KID
                      (crying)
                Mommy!


     INT. VALIANT'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

     We hear the SOUND of the SHOWER.  Valiant's hand reaches out
     past the shower curtain and grabs for a bottle.  But it's not
     shampoo.  It's turpentine.

                               VALIANT (O.S.)
               Dammit!

     CLOSE - TUB DRAIN

     The water swirling down the drain is tinged with paint of
     different colors.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He scrubs manically until the last of the pig head is gone.
     He rinses off and he feels around his face.  The absence of
     the Toon mask seems to bring him some relief.  He shuts off
     the shower and slides the shower curtain back.


     VALIANT'S POV - JESSICA RABBIT

     is leaning up against the doorjamb, dressed as usual, in a
     black cocktail dress with elbow length gloves and pearls.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the
               doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear
               it.

                               VALIANT
               That's because I don't have a doorbell.

     Jessica, caught in her lie, flutters her eyelids nervously.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.

                               VALIANT
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a
               towel.

     As she hands him a towel, she stares down at his anatomy.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               What's that thing?

     Valiant looks down at what she's referring to.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a
               mole before?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Toons aren't given imperfections.

                               VALIANT
               No?  I guess we're not counting lying,
               stealing and murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You've got the wrong idea about me.
               I'a a pawn in this just like poor
               Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll
               pay you anything.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta
               have the rabbit to make the scam work.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               No, no, no... I love my husband.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, sure.  I can just feature you
               standin' outside your little hutch,
               holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby
               to come home.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr,
               Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is
               being a woman looking the way I do.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it
               is bein' a man looking at a woman
               looking the way you do.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.

                               VALIANT
               I'm not complainin'.  But give me
               credit.  I'm the guy who took the
               pictures of you and Acme playin'
               pattycake, remember?

     Jessica takes a cigarette out of her purse.  She lights it
     and blows a cloud of Toon smoke.  It forms a recreation of
     what she describes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Maroon came to me.  He told me he'd
               fire Roger if I didn't do it.  I went
               along with him for Roger's sake.  It
               was only pattycake, after all.

     Valiant waves at the smoke scene, dispelling it.

                               VALIANT
               So altruistic.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It's the truth.  Why won't you believe
               it?

                               VALIANT
               Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I
               don't know what you're up to, lady, but
               I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               If I'm as bad as you think, what's
               stopping me from just killing you right
               now?

     Valiant reaches behind him and picks up a small cup on the
     sink.

                               VALIANT
               This cup of turpentine right here.  Go
               for that gun in your purse and I'm
               gonna let you have it.

     Jessica breaks down and starts sobbing.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, Mr, Valiant, please... you're my
               only hope.

     She comes to Eddie and hugs him, burying her head in his
     shoulder.

                                JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm weak... you're strong.  Can't you
               find a place somewhere in your heart to
               help me?

     Valiant looks down at the luscious creature in his arms,
     considering the request.  The moment is interrupted by the
     CLEARING of a VOICE.

                               DOLORES (O.C.)
               Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?

     Valiant, still in just a towel, sheepishly turns to face
     Dolores, who's standing in the doorway.

                               VALIANT
               Dolores...

     Dolores regards Jessica with undisguised contempt.

                               DOLORES
               Lemme guess... your cousin from Des
               Moines?

     Jessica straightens her dress.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Perhaps I should go.

                               DOLORES
               Must you?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Goodbye, Eddie... don't hate me.

     Jessica blows Eddie a TOON KISS which flies across the room,
     landing on Eddie's cheek.  She saunters past the smoldering
     Dolores and out the door.  Dolores walks to Eddie and peels
     the kiss off his cheek.  She crumples it up and throws it
     down in the wastebasket.

                               DOLORES
               What was that?

                               VALIANT
               That was the rabbit's wife.

                               DOLORES
               The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what
               she was doin' with her arms around you?

                               VALIANT
               Probably lookin' for a good place to
               stick a knife.

                               DOLORES
               I just stopped by to tell you that I
               checked out the Acme probate.

                               VALIANT
               Maroon, right?

                               DOLORES
               Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit
               again.

                               VALIANT
                      (startled)
               What the hell would they want with a
               gag factory?

                               DOLORES
               Got me.  But unless the will shows up
               by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

     As Valiant considers this new development, he cocks an ear.
     In the distance, we HEAR FAINT SINGING.

                               VALIANT
               What's that comin' from the bar?

                               DOLORES
                      (listens)
               Sounds like singin'.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, no...

     As Valiant grabs his pants...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Roger's out all right.  In fact, he's using the bar as a
     stage for a song and dance number.  The tune is extremely
     familiar.  In fact, it's the one that opens every Warner
     Brothers cartoon...  The Looney Tune Anthem.  But we've never
     heard words to go with it.

                               ROGER RAB3IT
               'The merry-go-round broke down
               But you don't see me frown...'

     Roger grabs Augie's pad and pencil, scribbles some drawings
     lightning fast.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'Things turned out fine
               And now she's mine...'

     Roger flips through the pad which in crude animation, shows
     the story of Roger and Jessica getting back together,
     culminating in them kissing in a heart.  Augie's delighted.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... Cause the merry-go-round
               Went round...
               Hoo-hoo, Hoo-hoo...'

     Roger does backflips and acts like an escapee from the acute
     ward.


     THE DOOR OPENS

     Eddie and Dolores enter.  Valiant stops in his tracks at the
     sight of Roger's performance... and the smiles on the faces
     of the sourpusses.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     doesn't see Eddie.  He moves into the next verse.  He twirls
     around on the post.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               'My name is Roger Rabbit
               I've got a crazy habit
               I like to sing and dance and yuk...'

     Roger goes to Angelo, lifts off his cap, and whacks his
     toupee, making it spin like a top.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... So brighten up and smile
               You schmuck'.

     All the regulars in the bar have a good laugh at that one.
     Now as Roger twirls around on the post, he smashes into a bar
     tray held by Eddie.  Valiant carries him toward the back
     room, but the irrepressable entertainer gets on his knees Al
     Jolson style and blows kisses to his audience.  The regulars
     are HOWLING as Roger is carried out.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Valiant flings Roger into the room and slams the door behind
     him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, don't I get an encore?

                               VALIANT
               Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out
               there riskin' my neck for you.   I come
               back here and you're singin' and
               dancin'.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But that's my calling, my purpose, my
               raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to
               make people laugh... and believe me,
               those people needed a laugh.

                               VALIANT
               And when they're done laughin' , they're
               gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo
               would rat on you for a nickel!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...

                               VALIANT
               An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He
               just got outta prison.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well... I still don't think he'd turn
               me in.

                               VALIANT
               Just because you got 'em to laugh?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie.
               Sometimes it's the only weapon we have
               in life.

                               VALIANT
               I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson
               variety.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I've met some cynical and miserable
               humans in my time.  But you, Edward
               Valiant, are positively funereal!

                               VALIANT
               Well, right now it's gonna be your
               funereal.

     Valiant takes his fist back to belt Roger.  Roger stands
     stoicly, jaw thrust forward, eyes closed.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead and throw that punch.
                      (opens one eye)
               But you'd be more successful with a
               punch line.

     Valiant drops his fist and rubs his temples with frustration.

                               VALIANT
               You're driving me crazy, you know that?
               Let's go... you ruined this as a hiding
               place.

     Valiant grabs Roger by the scruff of the neck and opens the
     door.  But he ducks back in quickly.


     VALIANT'S POW - THROUGH DOOR - JUDGE DOOM

     has entered the bar.  He stands FRAMED in the doorway,
     Voltaire perched on his shoulder.  The red light of the neon
     sign flashes on his glasses making him look like he's got
     burning coals for eyes.  With the Weasles at the door backing
     him up, the satanic Doom walks to the bar, his FOOTSTEPS
     CREAKING along the wooden floor.  He surveys the scene, leans
     over the bar for a glass.  Doom holds the glass up to the
     light and looks at it disgustedly.  He picks up a bottle of
     scotch and carries it down to where the one-armed Soldier is
     sitting.  Doom stares at him, then pulls the empty sleeve out
     of the amputee's pocket.  He uses it to wipe the inside of
     the glass.

                               DOOM
               I'm looking for a rabbit.  He was last
               seen in this neighborhood.

     The barflies avoid Doom's stare and shoot covered glances to
     one another.  But nobody says a word.  Doom pours a drink
     into his newly cleaned glass... then gently pours it down
     Voltaire's gullet.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               You couldn't miss him.  Buck teeth.
               Orange pants.  About yea big.

     Doom squashes the Midget's head down to approximate the size.

                               DOLORES
               There's no rabbit here, so don't harass
               my customers.

     Doom turns to Dolores.

                               DOOM
               I didn't come here to harass.  I came
               here to reward.

     Doom walks around Dolores toward the back.  But Doom stops
     next to the blackboard.  On it is written:  "Today's Special
     - French Dip - $ .50".  Doom erases the "French" and the
     decimal point in front of the "50".  Then he picks up the
     chalk and starts to write.  The CHALK SQUEAKS excruciatingly
     on the blackboard.  Everyone winces but watches anyway, as
     Doom writes "Rabbit" where the "French" was, and adds the
     zeroes to the "50".  It now reads:  "Rabbit Dip - $5000".


     AT THE BAR - ALL EYES

     are fixed on the figure on the blackboard.  Angelo licks his
     lips.

                               ANGELO
               Hey, I seen a rabbit...

     Angelo looks defensively at all his cronies and back to Doom.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               He's right here in the bar.

     But instead of pointing to the back of the bar, he talks to
     the empty barstool beside him.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               Say 'ello, Harvey.

     The tension is broken.  Everybody at the bar starts HOWLING.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Roger turns to Eddie victoriously.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My pal.


     IN THE BAR

     Doom stares down the regulars until the laughter stops.
     Meanwhile, a Weasle has started sniffing around the bar where
     Roger was dancing.  As Doom turns to leave, the Weasle
     whispers in his ear as he points to the back.  Doom smiles
     and pats the Weasle on the head.  He turns to Angelo and the
     others.

                                        DOOM
                Now we'll see who laughs best...

     The Weasle bloodhounds through the bar with Doom striding
     after him.  We FOLLOW them to the door to the back room.
     Doom rips the door open.


     INT. BACK ROON

     It's dark.  Doom flicks on the light.  REVEAL Valiant on the
     cot, his pint bottle cradled in his arm.  He blinks as if
     awakened from a drunken slumber.

                               DOOM
               Valiant?  Why is it that whenever my
               men smell a rabbit, you're there?

     Valiant plumps the pillow behind his head.

                               VALIANT
               Must be my cologne... Eau Dc Carrot.

                               WEASLE #1
                      (sniffs)
               He's in here all right, boss.

     Suddenly the Weasle grabs the pillow from under Valiant's
     head and carves it to shreds with a switchblade.  Feathers
     fly.  But no rabbit fur.

                               WEASLE #2
               Youse want we should take the place
               apart?

     The rest of the Weasles are arrayed behind Doom with Toon
     crowbars, picks, and a jackhammer.

                               DOOM
               No, Sergeant.  That won't be necessary.

     Doom walks over to the locker.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I know a trick that no Toon can resist.

     Doom raps on the locker with his knuckles.  Da-da-da-da-da...
     It's a familiar pattern that demands a Da-da response.  Doom
     moves to the desk and tries it again.  Da-da-da-da-da...


     INSIDE A MAXWELL HOUSE COFFEE CAN

     Roger is hiding while sweating out the urge to finish the
     familiar coda.  We HEAR the RAPPING again, closer.
     Da-da-da-da-da...  Roger's biting his nails.


     DOOM

     moves to the milk crate the coffee can is on.  Valiant gets
     up off the cot.

                               VALIANT
               You know, Doom, I don't know who's
               Toonier, you or the rabbit.

     Doom just smiles and knocks the pattern out on the crate.

                               DOOM
               Shave... and... a haircut...

     Roger bursts out of the can with the lid on his head.  He
     responds con brio.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Two... bits!
                      (looks around)
               Uh... oh...

     PSSSHEW!  Roger flies out the door.


     INT. THE BAR

     He streaks across the bar and out the front door.   After a
     beat, two Weasles step into the bar holding the butterfly net
     they had stretched across the door.  They WHEEZE with glee at
     the struggling Roger trapped inside.  A third Weasle carries
     the Judge's briefcase.

     Doom strides confidently into the bar.

                               WEASLE
               Oyez... oyez... oyez... court is now in
               session.

     Valiant and Dolores are led out by a couple Weasles holding
     guns on them.  As Doom snaps the briefcase open on the bar,
     the twelve Kangaroos pop up in their jury box.  Doom raps on
     the bar with his gavel-headed cane.  The regulars watch the
     bizarre scene in stunned silence.

                               DOOM
               Roger Rabbit is charged with the cold
               blooded murder of a human... Marvin
               Acme.  The jury will direct their
               attention to exhibits A, B, and C.

     The Weasles display photographs of Jessica and Acme playing
     pattycake, a blow-up of his fingerprints spelling
     RogerRabbitRogerRabbit in the whorls on the photographs, and
     a picture of Acme lying under the safe.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Motive, evidence, modus operandi.  How
               do you find the defendant?

     Once again the Kangaroo court wastes no time delivering the
     verdict.  The Baby Kangaroos pop up with their Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y signs.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  Now two Weasles wheel the
     stainless steel tub filled with dip into the bar.  Another
     hands Doom his black rubber gloves.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               For this heinous crime, I sentence you
               to the dip!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               No, no. not the dip!  Eddie, tell him
               I didn't do it!

                               VALIANT
               I don't think it's gonna matter.
               Sorry, pal, I tried.

                               DOOM
               Yes, and for that you're charged with
               aiding and abetting.  But we'll let
               Santino handle that.

     Doom pulls on the rubber gloves.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last
               request?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs?
               Just kidding.

                               VALIANT
               I think you want a drink.
                      (to Doom)
               How about it, Judge?

                               DOOM
               Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous
               tonight.  The successful conclusion of
               this case draws the curtain on my
               career as a jurist. I'm retiring to
               take a new role in the private sector.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to
               give you a gold watch.

     Valiant pours a glass of whiskey filling it all the way to
     the rim.  He holds it out to Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper
               for me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But, Eddie, you know what happens
               when...

                               VALIANT
               Drink it, jerk.  All of it.

     He grabs Roger's hand and forces the drink into it.  Roger
     shrugs his shoulders and shoots the drink down.  We've seen
     the reaction before.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     STEAM WHISTLE emitting such a PIERCING BLAST that is sends
     everyone into ear-grabbing agony.  Glasses, bottles, mirrors,
     even Doom's glasses SHATTER.  Valiant uses the distraction to
     punch the Weasles holding Roger.  He grabs the rabbit by the
     scruff of the neck. He gets as assist from Augie, who
     couldn't hear the noise.  Unfazed, Augie whacks a Weasle on
     the head with a barstool.  The Midget crawls behind Doom,
     who's been momentarily blinded.  The one-armed Soldier pushes
     him over.  Angelo is turning one Weasle's head around and
     around like a cruller.  Finally, Doom gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               After them you fools...

     As the Weasles regroup, Valiant tips the stainless steel tub
     over sending the dip spilling toward them.  The Weasles
     recoil from the liquid.  Even Doom takes a step backward.


     EXT. TERMINAL BAR

     Eddie and Roger race down the stairs and toward the Toon
     Control Wagon which is parked in front of Doom's Lincoln,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'.
               Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the
               noodle, the grey matter...

                               VALIANT
               If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin'
               from the law with a Toon?

     Valiant opens the door of the Toon Control wagon, and flings
     Roger inside roughly.


     INT. CAB

     Eddie goes to start the vehicle but the key is gone.   Now
     from behind them comes a DEEP RUMBLING VOICE somewhere
     between Lord Buckley and Barry White.

                               VOICE
               Excuse me, gentlemen...

     Eddie and Roger turn.  A snazzy TOON ROADSTER whose grill
     functions as it's mouth is talking from behind the liquid
     bars.

                               ROADSTER
                   If you effect my extrication, I
                   could offer you some carburetion.

     Valiant sighs with resignation and slides out of the cab,
     Roger in tow.


     EXT. REAR OF WAGON

     Eddie and Roger come racing around the side of the wagon.
     Valiant searches the back of the truck for the on/off switch.
     He finds it and turns off the flow of acetone.  The Roadster
     zips out of the truck and lands on the pavement, already
     flexing and limbering.   Behind him, a comical number of other
     TOON DETAINEES hop out like midgets out of a Volkswagon.

     They all head for the hills.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... what're we waitin' for, the
               William Tell Overture?


     ANGLE ON TERMINAL BAR - THE WEASLES

     come piling out.  They stack up like an Indian totem pole
     searching every direction.  One of them spots Eddie and
     Roger.  The Weasles stumble all over themselves in a mad
     scramble down the stairs.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     hop into the sleek two-seater.   Valiant looks at the myriad
     of goofy cartoon gauges and switches on the Roadster's
     dashboard.

                               VALIANT
               What do I do?

                               ROADSTER
               You don't have to do nothin'...

     With a ferocious RUBBER BURNING SQUEAL, the Roadster ROARS
     off in "no frames".  The exit is so fast that Eddie and Roger
     are left behind, hanging mid-air.  But before they hit the
     ground, the Roadster zips back INTO FRAME.  Eddie and Roger
     fall back into their seats.  The Roadster bends around so his
     grill is facing them.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Uh... except hang onto your hat.

     The Roadster ROARS off again in a cloud of Toon dust.


     INT. SANTINO'S COP CAR

     coming the other way.  It's followed by another squad car,
     both with SIRENS BLARING.  When the red blur streaks by, Lt.
     Santino turns to his PARTNER.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell was that?

                               PARTNER
               Speeding rabbit, Lieutenant.

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's what I was afraid of.


     EXT. STREET

     Santino's car does a 180 degree spin, and goes after the
     Roadster.  The second squad car follows.  The Weasles pile
     into the Toon Control wagon and join the chase.


     INT. THE ROADSTER

     rockets down the street, then takes a turn so wide that it
     drives up the front of the corner building, then back down on
     the sidewalk, just avoiding a newsstand.  The squad car
     following is not so dexterous.   It CRASHES into the stand,
     sending newspapers flying.


     THE ROADSTER

     looks back over it's shoulder, admiring his handiwork.

                               ROADSTER
               Read all about it, Benny's back in
               town!

     Up ahead, an egg delivery truck is double-parked in their
     lane.  Benny snaps around just as they're about to crash into
     the back of the truck.  There's nowhere to go.   But Benny's
     cool.

                               ROADSTER
               Going up...

     Suddenly, just before impact, the Toon suspension on the car
     accordions up, giving it a clearance of about fifteen feet...
     just enough to get over the truck.


     THE TOON CONTROL WAGON

     doesn't come with this unique feature.  It tries to avoid the
     truck but SMASHES into the back, splattering hundreds of eggs
     and sending the Weasles flying.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     look down from their suspended position at the chaos behind.

                               ROADSTER
               Next floor, sundries, knick knacks,
               escaped convicts.  Watch your step.

     The Roadster accordions back down to it's original height and
     speeds past TWO MOTORCYCLE COPS.  The motorcycles ROAR after
     them.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, Benny, what were you in for?

                               ROADSTER
               Reckless driving.  Do you believe that?

                               VALIANT
               Hard to imagine.

     Benny zig-zags through traffic, scooting between cars, but
     the Motorcycle Cops manage to stay on his tail.  Up ahead,
     traffic is stopped in his lane.  With nowhere to go, Benny
     passes a trolley car moving down the center of the street.
     Suddenly, he swerves in front of the trolley to elude the
     Cops... only to see another Red Car coming the other way.

                               ROADSTER
               Hold your breath, babies...

     Benny sucks in his girth and gets on his tip-toes as the
     trollies pass on either side of them.


     WIDE SHOT

     When the trollies clear, Benny staggers out from between them
     still on tip-toes.  Benny plops down, squashes, then pops up
     to his old self again.


     BEHIND THEM

     The crippled Toon Control wagon is struggling to keep up.
     Voltaire circles above the truck and picks two Weasles up off
     the roof.  They're each carrying several sticks of dynamite.


     FROM THE AIR

     We see Voltaire flying after the Roadster, which is speeding
     along the palm-lined Elysian Park Drive.  The Weasles light
     the dynamite sticks and with WHEEZING delight, bombard the
     car below.


     BENNY

     swerves right and left dodging the EXPLOSIONS.  Now a stick
     of dynamite falls into the back seat, fuse burning.  Benny
     looks back.

                               ROADSTER
               Hate to sound like Chicken Little, but
               is the sky falling or what?

     Eddie and Roger turn to see the dynamite, fuse burning low.
     Valiant makes a desperate grab for it.  But it rolls under
     the front seat.  Roger jumps in Eddie's lap.


     ABOVE - VOLTAIRE AND THE WEASLES

     satisfied that they've hit their target, swoop back to the
     Toon Control wagon.


     IN THE ROADSTER

     Valiant tries to untangle himself from Roger.

                               VALIANT
               Grab it, you idiot!

     Finally, at the last second, Roger reaches down and picks the
     dynamite up like a hot potato.  He flips it out of the
     Roadster.


     THE DYNAMITE

     spins through the air, finally landing on the roof just as
     Voltaire and the Weasles arrive.  BOOM!  The Toon Control
     wagon is demolished.  When the smoke clears we see the
     Weasles and Voltaire scattered roadside, faces blackened,
     feathers smoking.


     EXT. ECHO PARK STREET

     Benny is leading a merry chase up and down the hills.  Beside
     the two Motorcycles, there are half a dozen squad cars.  But
     as Benny comes over the last rise, we see the road deadends
     at Echo Park Lake.  The police have blocked off the
     perpendicular streets with squad cars.  Eddie and Roger see
     the deadend fast approaching.  Roger covers his eyes with his
     ears.  Valiant braces himself.

                               VALIANT
               The brakes!  The brakes!

     Benny hits the brakes.  Smoke pours out as they burn up and
     the momentum is barely broken.

                               ROADSTER
               Forget the brakes, who brought the
               water wings?

     The Roadster SMASHES through the wooden guard rail and sails
     out over the water.  KERPLOP!  It splashes down in the lake.


     THE POLICE CARS

     SCREECH to a stop at the edge of the lake.  Santino jumps out
     and regards the floating Roadster.  He turns to the other
     cops with a smirk.  When he turns back again, the smirk
     disappears from his face.


     ANGLE ON LAKE

     Benny is calmly swimming away using his fenders to do the
     crawl.  Now they pass a spooning COUPLE in a rowboat.  The
     couple regard them open-mouthed.


     THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

     Benny nears the shoreline, touches bottom and wades out.
     When they hit dry land, Benny shakes off like a dog.  He REVS
     HIS ENGINE.

                               ROADSTER
               Maybe it's my imagination, but I always
               seem to run better after I've had a
               wash.
                     (turns)
               Now where can I drop you cats?

     As Benny ROARS off...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Benny peeks around the corner, then tip-toes into view. down
     the alley until he stops in front of a back door.  Eddie and
     Roger climb out.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks, Benny.

                               ROADSTER
               If you ever need me, just stick out
               your thumb.

     WHOOSH!  Benny is gone.  Valiant goes to the door and unlocks
     it.  As he and Roger head up the back stairs...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. BUILDING - CLOSE - DOORWAY

     A hand painted design on the rippled glass shows a knight on
     a white charger.  On the shield in bold letters it says,
     "Veritas".  And lettered around it -- "Valiant and Valiant -
     Private Investigation".


     VALIANT

     sticks his key in the door and unlocks it.  Roger studies the
     banner.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other
                Valiant?

                               VALIANT
                My brother.  Get inside.

     He pushes Roger into the office.


     INT. OFFICE

     It's a typical detective office -- a couch, a sink, a window
     -- except for the partner's desk in the middle of the room.
     There's a chair on each side.  Valiant closes the door and
     locks it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                So what's our plan, our scenario, our
                modus operandi?

                               VALIANT
                We can't do anything till it's dark.

     Valiant picks up some yellowed newspapers off the couch and
     dumps them on the floor.  They leave a clean spot on the
     couch.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Guess you haven't been here in a while.
                     (reads
                      headline)
                'Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor'.

     Roger walks over to the wall.  He takes a framed picture off
     the wall which shows two guys clowning with Mickey Mouse.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Say, who's this guy laughin'?

                               VALIANT
                Me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've
                never seen you laugh before.  That your
                brother makin' the rabbit ears?

                               VALIANT
                What is this, Twenty Questions?

     Valiant grabs the picture from Roger and re-hangs it.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
                I'm gonna get some sleep.  I suggest
                you do the same.
         
     Valiant stretches out on the couch.  Roger nudges him to move
     over so he can lie down.  Grudgingly, Valiant slides over a
     fraction giving Roger a tiny piece of the couch.  They lie
     head to foot.


     CLOSEUP - VALIANT

     The problems of the day are knitting his brow.  Finally his
     eyes close.  After a beat, we HEAR Roger SNORING.  It's LOUD.
     Valiant's eyes pop open.  He rolls over.  WIDEN THE SHOT to
     see what he sees.


     ABOVE ROGER'S HEAD - A TOON DREAM BUBBLE

     has appeared.  Inside the bubble is a saw sawing back and
     forth through a log.  It is SYNCHRONIZED to the SOUND of
     Roger's SNORE.  Valiant kicks Roger, trying to stop the
     infernal SOUND.

     Roger sits up.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Huh?

     In the dream bubble, the saw cuts through the log.  One end
     of the log falls out of the bubble and BONKS Roger on the
     head, knocking him unconscious.  Valiant shakes his head and
     closes his eyes again.  We PAN UP off his face and PAST the
     window where the sun is setting.  As the CAMERA MOVES ALONG
     THE WALL, we see a gallery of framed newspaper clippings.
     "Valiant and Valiant Crack Popeye Kidnapping - Return Sweepea
     to Loving Arms of Parents".  And... "Brothers Find Brothers:
     Heckle and Jeckle Rescued From Redwood Forest!"  And...
     "Goofy Cleared of Atomic Spying Charges".  The PAN CONTINUES
     until we get to the window again.  Now it's dark outside.
     MOVE DOWN to Valiant's sleeping face.  He stirs. then opens
     one eye.  Now they both pop open at what he sees.


     VALIANT'S POV

     Roger has a magnifying glass an inch in front of his face
     that distorts his grinning face hideously.


     VALIANT

     startled from his sleep, reflexively shoves Roger away from
     him.  He flies into a swivel chair and goes spinning around.

                               VALIANT
                You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked
                you for the patsy.  Always gotta play
                the fool.  You make me sick!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience,
                but what happened to you that was so
                dark, lurid, embittering?

                               VALIANT
                You wanna know?  Well, since you're so
                goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of
                you Toons killed my brother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                A Toon?  Noooo.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who
                killed Bambi's mother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous,
                despicable... a smear on the drafting
                board.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and
                Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All
                Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em.
                And when this guy was accused of
                knockin' over the First National Bank
                of Toontown, we took his case.  But
                when we looked into it, we found out he
                did do it after all.  We went to his
                house to take him in.  But he was wise.
                He got the drop on us... literally.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (wincing)
                Safe?
         
                               VALIANT
                Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into
                Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.

     Now the PHONE on the desk RINGS.  Roger makes a move to it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                I'll get it.

                               VALIANT
                Get away from there.

     The PHONE RINGS TWO MORE TIMES and stops.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Wrong number?

                               VALIANT
                No, it's not.

     Valiant goes to the phone anticipating a RING which comes
     after a moment.  Valiant picks up the receiver.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Dolores?
         
                                              INTERCUT:


     DOLORES

     on the phone in the Terminal Bar.

                               DOLORES
               I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's
               called here about four times.  He says
               he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He
               says he can help you.

                               VALIANT
               I'll bet.

                               DOLORES
               Are you gonna call him, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               What've I got to lose?  You okay,
               Dolores?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah... they closed me down for a
               coupla weeks.

                               VALIANT
               That'll work out just fine.  When this
               thing is over, I'll take you to
               Catalina.  How does that sound?

                               DOLORES
               Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.

     Dolores hangs up the phone.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     VALIANT

     He CLICKS the switchhook and dials.
         
                               VALIANT
               Maroon?  Whaddaya want?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Have you got the will?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe.  Why?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock.
               If you've got the will maybe we can
               stop this thing.

                               VALIANT
               Stop what?

     CLICK.  Maroon has hung up.  Valiant hangs up the phone and
     goes to a wall safe.  He spins the combination.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are
               ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine
               o'clock.

                               VALIANT
               That's why I'll be there at 8:45.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I tell you what, maybe I better come
               with you.

                               VALIANT
               Forget it.

     Valiant reaches into the safe for a .38 revolver.  He checks
     the cylinder. Then he takes out a wooden box about 8" X 12".
     He closes the safe, picks up a black doctor's bag and puts
     the box and the revolver into it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a
               chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you
               think.

                               VALIANT
               How much is a shave and a haircut,
               Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               Two bits.

                               VALIANT
               I rest my case.

     Valiant goes to the door, pauses.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               If I don't make it back here by ten...

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               ... I'd head for Cucamonga.

     Valiant closes the door, leaving Roger alone.  Roger paces
     back and forth manically.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Cucamonga?  I don't know anybody in
               Cucamonga.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - NIGHT

     The lot is dark and deserted.  Now headlights cut through the
     darkness as Maroon's Packard pulls up in front of the
     Administration building.


     INT. CAR - MAROON

     reaches over and opens the glove compartment.  He takes out a
     small automatic.  But his hands are so slippery with
     perspiration, it falls to the floor.  Cursing, he takes out
     a handkerchief, wipes his hands and his face and picks up the
     gun again.  As he gets out of the car, we see the clock says
     8:55.


     INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - NIGHT

     Maroon hustles up to his office door.  He looks nervously
     over his shoulder, then goes inside.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE

     Maroon switches on the lights.  He goes to his desk.  He
     takes out the gun and puts it in the left hand drawer.  Then
     he takes it out and puts it in the right hand drawer.  Then
     back to the original drawer.  Finally satisfied, he goes to
     the bar to calm his obviously shattered nerves.  As his
     shakey hand starts to pour from the decanter, another hand
     comes INTO FRAME.

                               VALIANT
               Steady, R.K., that stuff's eighteen
               years old.

     Maroon jumps back as Valiant steps from behind the curtain,
     holding his black bag.

                               MAROON
               Valiant!  You surprised me.

                               VALIANT
               That was the idea.

     Valiant takes over the pouring duties.  He turns and carries
     Maroon's drink to him.  Maroon goes and sits down in his
     chair.  He looks to the pistol hiding place.  Valiant
     casually sits on the desk, putting his legs over the drawer.

                               VALIANT
               You're not too good at this, are you,
               R.K.?

                               MAROON
               No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker,
               not a murderer.

                               VALIANT
               Well, everybody needs a hobby.

                               MAROON
               No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I
               had nothin' to do with Acme gettin'
               killed.  I just wanted to sell my
               studio.  But they wouldn't buy my
               property unless Acme would sell his.
               And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna
               blackmail Acme with pictures of him and
               the rabbit's wife.

     Maroon gets up from his chair, highly agitated.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               But then it all went to hell.  I been
               around Toons all my life.  I can't sit
               around and see them all destroyed.

     Maroon eyes Valiant's black bag.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               You got the will in there, don't ya?

                               VALIANT
               No, I don't.

                               MAROON
               You tricked me, damn you!

                               VALIANT
               Take it easy.

                               MAROON
               There's no time to take it easy!  You
               don't realize the diabolical mind we're
               dealing with!


     ANGLE ON WINDOW

     A gun pokes through the open window past the curtain.  It's a
     Colt .45 Buntline -- an unmistakeable gun with an extra long
     barrel.

                               MAROON
               If I don't get that will by midnight
               tonight, Toontown's just gonna be land
               for the free...


     VALIANT

     sees a reflection of the gun on the glass on a movie poster
     on the wall.  He turns.  But it's too late.  BANG!  BANG!
     BANG!  Maroon crumples, caught mid-sentence.  Valiant dives
     behind the desk and draws his gun.  He looks over at Maroon's
     dead body on the floor.

                               VALIANT
               And the home of the brave?

     Valiant crawls to the window where the shots came from.  He
     looks out.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The comely silhouette of Jessica Rabbit runs to her car,
     jumps in and ROARS out the the studio gates.


     VALIANT

     grabs his black bag, climbs out of the office window and
     jumps off the fire escape to the lot below.


     EXT. STUDIO LOT

     Valiant hops into Maroon's Packard.  He hits the starter
     button and takes off after Jessica.


     NEW ANGLE

     as the car pulls away, the trunk lid lifts.  Roger Rabbit
     peers out, disoriented.  Then closes it.


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jessica's car speeds along.  Valiant is in close pursuit in
     the Packard.  He's about to catch up on the straightaway when
     Jessica's car disappears into a tunnel.


     VALIANT

     slams on his brakes.  The Packard goes fishtailing, finally
     spinning to a stop at the foot of the "Toontown" sign.

     Valiant gets out of the car.  He looks down the tunnel.  He's
     sweating.  He loosens his necktie.  He paces back and forth
     at the tunnel mouth.  He looks up at the Toontown sign and
     suddenly smashes it with his fist.  It spins around like a
     weathervane.

     Valiant walks to the Packard with purpose.  He grabs the
     black bag and puts it on the hood.  He opens it and takes out
     the wooden box.


     CLOSE - BOX

     as the clasp is popped and the box opened, REVEAL a stunning
     presentation model TOON .38 resting on crushed velvet.  It's
     everything a real gun could be... and more.  Each feature is
     exaggerated... the barrel, the cylinder, the ivory grips are
     all Toon-sized.


     VALIANT

     picks the gun up and hefts it respectfully.  Then he opens an
     ammo section in the wooden box. SIX TOON .38 DUM-DUM BULLETS
     are in velvet creases.  The Toon Bullets blink to life as if
     awakening from a long sleep.

                               DUM-DUM #l
                      (rubbing eyes)
               Eddie... is that really you?

                               VALIANT
               Uh-huh.

                               DUM-DUM #2
               What year is it?

                               VALIANT
               '46.

                               DUM-DUM #3
               Who won the war?

                               DUM-DUM #4
               Who do you think, dummy?

                               DUM-DUM #5
               Welcome back, Eddie.

                               DUM-DUM #6
               Where you been the last five years?

                               VALIANT
               Drunk.

     He opens the cylinder.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Feelin' frisky tonight, boys?

                               DUM-DUMS
               Yeah!

     The Bullets eagerly dive into their respective chambers.  He
     snaps the cylinder closed, reaches into his shoulder holster
     and takes out the pint bottle.  He unscrews the cap and pours
     the rest of the booze onto the ground.  When it's drained, he
     flings the bottle in the air and FIRES the Toon .38.  KA-POW!
     It makes a SOUND like a CANNON.


     THE TOON BULLET

     climbs like a rocket into the dark sky.  It SCREECHES up to
     the bottle, puts on the brakes.  The Bullet puts on a
     jeweler's eyepiece, then it whips out a little hammer and
     chisel acd delivers one delicate tap.


     VALIANT

     watches as a cut glass chandelier falls out of the sky and
     CRASHES at his feet.  Valiant holsters his weapon and climbs
     into the Packard.  He puts it in gear and pulls into the
     tunnel.


     IN THE TUNNEL - DRIVING

     As Valiant heads toward the proverbial light at the end of
     the tunnel, suddenly the CAR RADIO COMES ON.

                               RADIO ANNOUNCER
               ... From the tippy tip top of
               Toontown's Tip Top Club, this is Mellow
               Melody Matinee.  Here's our favorite
               cricket, Jimmy, with 'Give A Little
               Whistle'.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (on radio)
               'When you get in trouble, and you don't
               know right from wrong...'

     Valiant turns the on/off switch, then punches all the buttons
     but to no avail.  The SONG PLAYS ON anyway.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (continuing)
               '... Give a little whistle
               Give a little whistle...'

                               VALIANT
               I hate Toontown...

     As Jimmy croons on, Valiant emerges from the tunnel.


     VALIANT'S FOV

     Through the windshield we see we have arrived in Toontown,
     where it's a beautiful sunny day.  Eddie is now driving down
     a phantasmagorical boulevard in a completely animated world.
     It's a Max Fleischer version of a city neighborhood.  The
     trees and buildings are swaying in time with the MUSIC.
     Eddie looks to his left and sees a huge Aphrodite-like hood
     ornament on the front of a TOON CAR.  Then as the car starts
     to pass him he sees hood... hood... hood... more hood then a
     CHAUFFEUR, then more car, and finally the Wolf we remember
     from the Ink & Paint Club.  He's in top hat and tails, a TOON
     LAMB in the passenger seat.  He tips his hat.

                               WOLF
               Helloooo, cousin.

     Now he drives past a Toon building under construction.  Like
     everything else in Toontown. the construction company sports
     the name "Acme".  The sign out frontsays:  WATCH OUR
     PROGRESS.  Eddie looks up, and before he can drive by, the
     building gets built floor by floor with accompanying SFX in
     about two seconds.

     Up ahead, the street is clear for blocks.  Then suddenly cars
     pour out of all side streets at once, clogging the boulevard
     like arteriosclerosis.  There is mad HONKING in this cartoon
     traffic jam.  Eddie shakes his head.  He pulls over, parks
     and gets out.

     Valiant pulls out his Toon .38.  Suddenly, the street empties
     in the blink of an eye.  Shutters close, and the sidewalk
     rolls up like window shades.  It's so quiet you could hear a
     pin drop.  In fact, a PIN DROPS from a second story window,
     landing with the CLANG! of a manhole cover.  All is quiet
     again.  Valiant starts across the street -- there is a CREAK
     behind him.  Valiant whirls around, levelling his pistol at
     the sound.


     ANGLE ON PACKARD - ROGER

     peeks out of the trunk of Maroon's car.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't shoot, Eddie.  It's me.

     Valiant lowers the gun as Roger emerges.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin' in there?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I followed you to the Maroon Studios.
               When I heard those shots, I thought I'd
               help you and investigate the inside of
               this trunk.

     Valiant reaches into the black bag in the car.  He comes out
     with a pair of TOON HANDCUFFS.  He slaps one on Roger's
     wrist.

                               ROGER RA13BIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, what're you doin'?

     Valiant drags Roger to the steering wheel.

                               VALIANT
               I'm making sure you don't help me
               anymore.

     He locks the cuff to it, and heads across the street.


     AROUND THE CORNER - VALIANT

     stops at a street sign.  The post is bristling with fingers
     pointing in different directions; i.e., Poughkeepsie,
     Transylvania, Walla Walla, South Pole (the finger points down
     of course), and finally a finger which says:  The Dame.
     Eddie follows the finger down the side street to a high rise
     building.

     He catches a glimpse of Jessica darting into the elevators.
     Valiant hustles inside after her.

     Valiant goes to the elevators, and watches the floor
     indicator spinning round and Round, finally stopping with a
     BING at the 125th floor.  The elevator doors open and Valiant
     steps on.


     IN THE ELEVATOR

     Valiant punches 125.  Suddenly the elevator takes out with
     such velocity that Valiant is thrown to the floor.  After a
     moment, it stops so fast that he hits the ceiling.  Then
     bounces back to the floor as the doors open.  He picks
     himself up and steps off the elevator.

     He's in a foyer with four doors.  Valiant opens the first and
     steps inside.  He disappears.


     NEW ANGLE

     Valiant is on the outside of the building hanging onto a
     flagpole for dear life.  He looks down at the street which
     looks miles below.  Valiant inches back along the flagpole to
     the door and pulls himself to safety.


     INSIDE - VALIANT

     tries the next door.  This time more carefully.  A SPEEDING
     TRAIN is coming right at him.  He slams the door.  He tries
     the next one.  A homely OLD TOON LADY is in a bathtub.  She
     lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.  Valiant closes that door
     quickly, and turns to the last.  When he opens this one, we
     HEAR FOREBODING MUSIC.  We see...


     A DARK ALLEY

     Warily, Valiant walks into the alley, gun drawn.  There's a
     NOISE behind the garbage cans.  Valiant turns as a DEAD BODY
     with a knife in his back falls out of the shadows at
     Valiant's feet.  A SQUEAKY VOICE comes from behind Valiant.

                               VOICE
               I guess they didn't clean up after the
               last moider.

     Valiant whips around to see a TOON RAT perched on a skull
     picking his teeth.  Valiant kicks the skull.  The rat
     scrambles for cover.

     As Valiant continues on, we see...


     JESSICA RABBIT

     Steps out of the shadows behind him and aim the gun at his
     back.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't move, Valiant.

     Valiant turns slowly to see Jessica's got a bead on him with
     her revolver.

                               VALIANT
               Well... I always figured I'd get it in
               Toontown.

     BLAM!  She fires.  But Valiant's still standing.  We HEAR a
     CRASH behind Eddie as a figure falls into some boxes from a
     fire escape above.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I think I got him.

     Jessica runs past Valiant to the figure.  He follows,
     bewildered.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     We can see two rabbit ears sticking out from behind a box

                               VALIANT
               You shot Roger.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's
               men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.

     Jessica moves the box aside and tugs on the rabbit ears.  The
     rabbit head pops off.  Underneath is a Weasle.  In his hand
     is the Colt .45 Buntline.

                               VALIANT
               Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't worry, you're not the first.  We
               better get out of here.

     As they run down the alley...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE PACKARD - ROGER

     is behind the wheel making ENGINE NOISES like a little kid.
     He pushes all the buttons, windshield wipers, convertible
     top, etcetera, until he accidentally hits the starter button.
     VROOM!  The Packard fires to life.  Roger's startled for a
     moment, but quickly regains his composure.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hmmm... What would be the harm if I
               took her for a spin?

     He throws it into gear.  The Packard bucks into the car in
     front of it.  Then Roger shifts again.  The same process is
     repeated in reverse.  He SMASHES back and forth.  BANG!
     BANG!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
                Ah... the open road.


     AROUND THE CORNER - EDDIE AND JESSICA

     come racing down the street.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?

                               VALIANT
               Why didn't you tell me?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I didn't know who I could trust.

                               VALIANT
               We're even.  By the way, I did find
               your husband.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (excited)
               Where is he?

                               VALIANT
               He's right here in the...

     Valiant rounds the corner and points toward the spot where
     the car used to be.  But all that remains is a crumpled
     bumper.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               ... car.

     He shakes his head and looks around for signs of Roger.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     THE PACKARD

     is careening down Toon streets totally out of control.
     Panicked, Roger is spinning the wheel as if it were a
     motorboat.  He drives in one side of Mother Goose's Shoe and
     out the other, diapers all over the windshield.  Unable to
     see, Roger steers right off the road.  The car hurtles
     through space.  As it starts to fall, we see it's Toon
     Monument Valley.  The Packard passes a promontory on which
     WILE E. COYOTE is perched.  As Roger passes, he waves to the
     Coyote.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hi, Roger Rabbit.  Love your work.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     EDDIE AND JESSICA

     who are now facing a squad of TEN Toon Control Weasles.  They
     unleash a fusilade of bullets.

     Valiant knocks Jessica to the ground.  The bullets pass
     harmlessly overhead going into the window of the Acme Cheese
     Shop, riddling a round of cheese.  The CHEESEMAKER'S hand
     comes INTO FRAME changing the sign that says "Gouda" to
     "Swiss".

     Valiant rolls and FIRES his Toon .38 Special.  The Toon
     Bullet turns into a cannonball, which rolls down the street
     busting up the Weasle squad like a bowling ball through ten
     pins.

     As Eddie pulls Jessica to her feet, two more Weasles descend
     on them.  They fling Toon knives, which pin Eddie to a wooden
     fence.  Valiant rips one hand free, and BLASTS two shots at
     them.

     The Toon Bullets get to the Weasles, and open their nose
     cones.  Two frying pans emerge and BONK the Weasles on the
     head.

     Jessica starts to pull the knives out, releasing Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               How did you get onto Doom?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Marvin told me.  Doom was after his
               land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he
               brought me his will.

     Valiant sees a Weasle skulking at them with a tommygun.
     BLAM!  Valiant fires at him.  The Weasle ducks back around
     the corner.  But Valiant's Dum-Dum SCREECHES to a stop and
     goes around the corner, too.  We HEAR an EXPLOSION.  The
     Weasle come staggering out and falls in the street.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               When I opened up the blue envelope, all
               that was inside was a blank piece of
               paper.

                               VALIANT
               A joker to the end.

     Now Weasles are coming at them from every direction.  Valiant
     aims the Toon .38 at a Toon tank rolling their way.  But when
     he pulls the trigger, the gun just CLICKS.  Empty.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Looks like our goose is cooked, our
               hash is slung, our fait is accompli...

                               VALIANT
               Lemme guess where you got that from.
               Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see
               in that guy anyway?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He made me laugh.

     Valiant shakes his head.  Now they are completely surrounded
     by Weasles.  The situation looks bleak.

                               VALIANT
               Well, do you prefer to die this way or
               that way?

     Valiant jerks his thumb indicating the direction behind him.
     Suddenly, there's a rubber-burning SCREECH as Benny the
     Roadster arrives next to Valiant's hitchhiker-posed thumb.

                               ROADSTER
               Need a lift?

     Valiant does a take.

                               VALIANT
               Benny.

     The Roadster looks back approvingly as Jessica climbs in with
     Eddie.

                               ROADSTER
               Mr. Valiant, you've made a vast
               improvement in the company you keep.

     Benny blasts through a couple of Weasles.  They swing back
     and forth like tavern doors, then topple.

     He takes a hard right into the next block which is the Toon
     Arctic.  His tires turn into skis.  He slaloms back and forth
     between trees.  The Weasles pursue on dogsled.

     Benny grabs a striped barber's pole -- the North Pole -- and
     slides down it.  They land in the Toon Sahara.  Benny crawls
     up a large sand dune, his tongue hanging out of his radiator.
     He glances back at the Weasles who are mounted on camels,
     waving scimitars.  When they reach the top of the sand dune,
     we see they're on the precipice of a bottomless chasm.

                               ROADSTER
               Look, the drawbridge -- we're gonna
               make it.

                               VALIANT
               I don't see any bridge.

                               ROADSTER
               That's because you gotta draw it first.

     Benny takes a pencil hanging from a post lettered "Draw
     Bridge".  He wets the pencil point and in a flash draws a
     bridge.  It's a rickety rope bridge.  Using the pencil as a
     balancing pole, Benny starts to tiptoe across.

     The Weasles jump off t'heir camels and start filing onto the
     bridge after them.

     When Benny finally reaches the other side, Valiant grabs the
     pencil from him and gets out of the car.

                               VALIANT
               Hold on a second.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Eddie, come on.

     But Valiant stands facing the Weasles, who are charging at
     him, swords raised.  With a sly smile, Valiant holds up the
     eraser end of the pencil.  This freezes the Weasles.  But as
     Valiant starts to erase a rope support, the eraser breaks off
     the pencil and falls down into the chasm.  The Weasles WHEEZE
     with relief and advance for the kill.  At the last second,
     Valiant takes the business end of the pencil and scribbles a
     handsaw.  He grabs it by the handle and saws the rope.  The
     bridge swings away, smacking the Weasles into the opposite
     canyon wall.  One by one, they slide off and disappear into
     the abyss.


     VALIANT

     climbs back into Benny.  The Roadster takes off again, making
     a skidding left turn onto the main drag.  As they make their
     break into the Toontown tunnel...


     EXT. TOONTOWN TUNNEL - L.A. SIDE - NIGHT

     A ten gallon drum is sitting by the side of the road under
     the Toontown sign.  From in the tunnel we hear the SOUND of
     Benny's ENGINE coming closer.  Now a foot comes out of the
     shadows and rests on the ten gallon drum.  As the SOUND of
     the ROADSTER gets VERY LOUD, the foot kicks the drum over,
     spilling a clear liquid across the road.


     NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT

     belongs to Judge Doom.  Doom smiles sadistically as the
     Roadster with Eddie and Jessica aboard comes shooting out of
     the tunnel.  When Benny hits the liquid, he starts to skid.

                               ROADSTER
               Uh-oh... whoaaa...!  Look out!

     His tires smoke, then disappear. It's a dip slick.  Without
     tires, Benny spins out of control, finally ending up in the
     bushes roadside.

     Before Eddie and Jessica can make a move, they are surrounded
     by a horde of Weasles pointing what looks like a hundred guns
     at them.

                               DOOM
               Are you two all right?

     Doom opens one of the Roadster's doors and helps Jessica out.
     Valiant climbs out after her.  The Weasles quickly relieve
     him of his Toon pistol.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               These roads can be very treacherous at
               night, especially in a maniacal Toon
               vehicle.

                               VALIANT
               The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.

                               DOOM
               I've had enough of your insolence!
                      (to Weasles)
               Put him in my car.  I think they'll
               enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at
               the Acme factory.

     The Weasles prod Valiant and Jessica into Doom's Lincoln.  A
     Weasle refers to Benny WHIMPERING in the bushes.

                               WEASLE
               What about him?

                               DOOM
               He's not going anywhere.  We'll send
               the mobile unit after him.

     Doom climbs into the car and it zooms off, Weasles jumping
     onto the running boards.


     BENNY

     crawls out of the bushes on his axles.

                               ROADSTER
               The boinin', the boinin'...

     He makes it down into the drainage ditch, dipping his
     tootsies one by one.  There's a HISS as they hit the water
     and the chemicals from the dip are extinguished.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Oh, yeah... that's better.

     Now Benny hears the SOUND of another VEHICLE COMING out of
     the Toontown Tunnel.  He ducks down and peeks over the ditch
     to see...


     ROGER IN THE PACKARD

     come SCREAMING out of the tunnel backwards.  Maroon's Packard
     looks like the winner of a demolition derby.

     Benny stands and waves to him.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger!

     Roger sees him and slams on the brakes, skidding the Packard
     into the Toontown sign.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Benny?

     Benny hobbles over to the Packard.  He pops his trunk and
     rummages around.  He comes out with Toon boltcutters.  He
     clips Roger's cuffs off.

                               ROADSTER
               Doom's got your wife and Valiant.  He
               took them to the Acme factory,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Let's go!

     Benny nudges Roger to the passenger side.

                               ROADSTER
               Slide over, son.  It looks like you've
               done enough drivin' for tonight.

     Now the Toon Roadster gingerly gets behind the wheel of the
     Packard.  He hits the gas and the Packard lurches down the
     road.


     INT. ACME FACTORY - NIGHT

     Doom's car is parked inside.  There are several other
     vehicles as well.  There's a steamroller, a road grader, and
     a huge modified tanker truck.  It's mounted with a thousand
     gallon vat, the contents of which are being stirred by a
     motorized unit.  All the vehicles are marked with a large
     green four-leaf clover logo.


     VALIANT AND JESSICA

     are held at gunpoint by a couple of Weasles, while several
     others are busy JACKHAMMERING the brick wall at the far end
     of the factory.  Doom pulls on his rubber gloves, turns to
     the Weasles.

                               DOOM
               Frisk them.  See if they have the will.

     Several Weasles rush for the opportunity to frisk Jessica.
     The head Weasle slaps the others away.  Then WHEEZING
     laciviously, he turns to the task.  He starts to move his
     hands over her body when Jessica stomps her heel on his feet.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Get your hands off me, you little
               rodent!

     The Weasle hops away angrily and quickly frisks Valiant.  He
     turns to Doom and shakes his head.

                               DOOM
               No matter.
                      (checks watch)
               I don't expect the will to show up in
               the next fifteen minutes.  By then
               Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite
               legally.

                               VALIANT
               So you're Cloverleaf?

                               DOOM
               No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a
               vast company with diverse interests...
               gasoline, tires, automobiles.


     AT THE BRICK WALL

     The jackhammering has stopped.  A Weasle plucks one brick out
     of the wall.  Toon light beams through.  He reaches into the
     hole in the wall and comes out holding a bunch of Toon
     bananas.  WHEEZING wickedly, he passes them out to his
     compatriots.  They devour the bananas, throwing the peels
     helter-skelter.


     VALIANT

     turns his attention from the brick wall back to Doom.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, Doom.  What would a company
               like that want with Toontown?

                               DOOM
               It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was
               my idea of how to put the land to
               better use.

     Doom goes to the truck and starts turning on valves and
     starting compressors.
                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               In fact, they thought my concept so
               brilliant, that they offered me the
               Directorship of Transportation.  I've
               accepted.
                      (to Weasle)
               Bring me Mr. Valiant's gun.

     The Weasle trots over and delivers Valiant's Toon .38.  Doom
     inspects it.  He reads an engraving on the frame.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               'Thanks for getting me out of the
               hoosegow.  Yosemite Sam'.
                      (looks up)
               How sweet.

     Doom throws the gun on the ground.  He pushes back a long
     lever on the truck, letting loose a tiny spurt of fluid from
     the discharge valve.  The gun disappears.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Dip?

                               DOOM
               That's right.  Enough to dip Toontown
               off the face of the earth.


     EXT. ACME FACTORY - ROGER AND BENNY

     have been watching the proceedings through a window.  They
     turn to each other stunned.

                               BENNY/ROGER RABBIT
               Dip Toontown?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               We gotta do something!

     Roger scurries back to the Packard hidden outside the gates.
     He opens Valiant's black bag and comes out holding Eddie's
     real pistol.  Benny comes tenderfooting up.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger, what're you gonna do with that
               gun?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I'm gonna save them, of course.  You go
               for help.  Find Dolores at the Terminal
               Bar.  She'll know what to do.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... all right...

     Reluctantly, Benny gets behind the wheel of the Packard.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               But you be careful now with that gun.
               This ain't no cartoon.

     Benny pulls away.  Roger turns with determination and zips
     back to the window


     INT. FACTORY

     Doom pulls the tarp off the top of the truck, revealing a
     modified water cannon.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You're sick, Doom.  Where do people
               like you come from?

                               DOOM
               Never mind where I come from.  Just
               watch where I'm going.

                               VALIANT
               Don't you think anyone's gonna notice
               that Toontown's gone?

                               DOOM
               They won't care.  Who's going to miss
               some ridiculous talking mice when they
               can have the future?


     EXT. BACK OF FACTORY - ROGER

     is trying to jimmy open a window using his whole body for
     leverage.  He finally pops the window open.  Gun drawn, he
     climbs over the sill.  And falls head first.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Roger splashes into the toilet bowl in the Acme washroom.  He
     bobs up.  He drains the water out of the pistol barrel and
     peeks over the bowl.  He gets a determined look in his eye.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's time to make my move.

     Roger starts to climb out of the toilet.  He reaches for
     something to grab onto.  Unwittingly, he gets the toilet
     chain hanging from the tank above.  As he pulls himself out,
     the toilet flushes.   Roger has only a moment to register a
     dumbfounded expression before he is sucked down the john.


     IN THE FACTORY - DOOM

     continues expansively.

                               DOOM
               Right here where we're standing, will
               be the cornerstone of my idea... the
               cloverleaf -- an elegant cement
               structure that intertwines freeways.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell's a freeway?

                               DOOM
               A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes
               of asphalt running uninterrupted from
               L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to
               Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica.
               Someday everyone will be in cars
               driving happily, non-stop from one end
               of the L.A. Basin to another.

                               VALIANT
               That's what this is all about?  Tell
               me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway?
               We got the Red Cars, the best public
               transportation in the country.

                               DOOM
               Not for long.  We're retiring the Red
               Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant,
               because they'll have to.  And when they
               drive, they'll have to buy our cars,
               our tires, our gasoline.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Why'd you bother to call it a freeway?

     Doom steps up into their faces.  Behind him, several Weasles
     are fashioning a noose.

                               DOOM
               Has a nice ring.  Too bad you two won't
               be around to enjoy it.

     Suddenly Roger EXPLODES out of the drainage grate in the
     floor.  His entrance sends the Weasles flying.  Roger lands
     on his feet, James Cagney-like, levelling his gun on Judge
     Doom.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Get 'em up.  All of you!  Or I let the
               Judge have it!

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, darling!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, it's me, my dearest.  I'd embrace
               you but first I have to take care of
               some unfinished business.

                               DOOM
               Put that gun down, you buck-toothed
               fool.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead.  Give me an excuse to fill
               you full of holes, pump you full of
               lead.
                      (over shoulder)
               How'm I doin', Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Real good, Rog... but maybe you better
               let me take over.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Not before I satisfy my sense of moral
               outrage.

     Milking the moment, he shifts the gun from one hand to
     another.  He circles Doom, poking and prodding him with the
     gun.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               You think you could get away with this?
               Hah!  We Toons may be idiotic, but
               we're not stupid!


     POV OVERHEAD

     We LOOK DOWN on the proceedings from high in the rafters.
     PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're watching from the POV of Voltaire,
     who's perched on the top inventory rack.  Voltaire cleans his
     fingernails, casually.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, justice, Judge Doom.  The real
               meaning of the word probably hits you
               like a ton of bricks!

     Voltaire calmly nudges an Acme Ton-Of-Bricks off the shelf.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     He never sees it coming.  SMASH!  The bricks land on his head
     and bury him.  The only thing we can see of Roger is his hand
     with the gun in it.

                               DOOM
               Well, this is turning out better than
               I thought.

     Doom picks the gun up.  The Weasles drag Roger out from under
     the bricks.  Big bright stars are circling his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (delirious)
               Look, stars!  Ready when you are,
               Raoul.

     Valiant shakes his head, but Jessica starts to laugh.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I have missed you, Roger.

                               DOOM
               Tie the lovebirds together.

     The Weasles twirl Toon rope around Roger and Jessica like a
     cocoon.  They hook them on a power winch.  Then hit a button
     and raise Roger and Jessica until they're suspended fifteen
     feet above the floor... right in the path of the Dipmobile.

     Doom hands Valiant's gun to the head Weasle.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Let him watch his Toon friends get
               dipped...  then shoot him.

     Doom turns and starts to walk away.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     He steps on a Toon banana peel and goes flat on his keester.


     THE WEASLES

     always quick with a laugh, BREAK UP at their boss'
     misfortune.  The one guarding Eddie is so overcome with
     LAUGHTER that he's slapping his thigh with his gun hand.
     Valiant sees his opportunity.  He starts to make a move
     toward the distracted Weasle and almost gets his hands on the
     gun when:

                               DOOM
               Watch out, you idiot... he's going for
               the gun!

     The Weasle turns at the last second, sticking the barrel up
     against Valiant's nose.  Doom gets to his feet.  He glowers
     at the Weasle and knocks him on the head with the gavel head
     of his cane.  Doom stalks out of the room.

     The Weasles scramble to positions on the Dipmobile.  One
     FIRES UP the ENGINE.

     The streetcleaner brushes start to turn.  The vehicle starts
     to creep forward.

     Another Weasle climbs into the turret.  He puts Roger and
     Jessica in the crosshairs of the cannon.

     Beads of sweat break out on Valiant's face.

     The Weasle, WHEEZING with evil glee, starts to press his
     finger to the trigger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You guys think this is real funny,
               doncha?
                      (to Valiant)
               Eddie, do somethin'!

     At the last second, Eddie shouts at the Weasle.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!

     The Weasle turns to him.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Before you pull the trigger, I want you
               to know somethin' about the guy you're
               about to dip.

     Suddenly, Eddie breaks into the "Looney Tooney Song".  The
     song Roger had sung in the bar.  The silly voice that comes
     out of his mouth surprises everybody, especially Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'His name is Roger Rabbit
               He's got a crazy habit...'

     Valiant starts skulking across the floor.  It's a cross
     between Groucho Marx and a Chuck Berry Duck Walk.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'He likes to sing and dance and yuk
               So brighten up and smile you
                  schmuck...'

     Valiant starts "hoo-hooing", slapping himself in the
     forehead.  Now the Weasles start GIGGLING.  They've never
     seen a human do this before.

                               VALIANT
               'Now my name's Eddie V
               I'm looney too you'll see'

     Valiant flips into a handstand and starts walking on his
     hands.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I walk with my hands
               And I shake with my feet...'

     He offers his foot to a Weasle who shakes it.  The others
     HOWL.  Eddie flips upright and grabs a stick of Acme
     dynamite.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I think dynamite
               Is swell to eat'.

     Eddie takes a bite out of the Toon dynamite and acts like
     he's savoring it.  The spectacle of this human doing this is
     too much to bear.  Now the Weasles are rolling on the ground,
     holding their sides.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He's lost his mind!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah, isn't it great?  Keep it up,
               Eddie... you're killing 'em, you're
               slayin' 'em, you're knockin' 'em dead.

     Roger means it.  The Weasles are laughing so hard they're
     giving themselves heart attacks.  Valiant spins around on the
     floor like a clock dial gone berserk.

                               VALIANT
               Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...

     One by one, the Weasles keel over... dead.  Opaque WEASLE
     SPIRITS leave their bodies with wings and harps, and float
     heavenward, still laughing.


     VOLTAIRE

     alarmed at the scene below, grabs a brick and flaps toward
     the ceiling.  He throws the brick through the skylight and
     flies out.

                               VOLTAIRE
               Doom!  Doom!


     ON THE DIPMOBILE

     The Weasle on the turret collapses onto the trigger.  The
     unmanned dip cannon starts spraying, as the arm sweeps
     slowly back and forth like an, automatic lawn sprinkler.


     VALIANT

     hitches a ride on the last ascending Weasle Spirit, letting
     it hoist him to the top of the truck.  As he moves the Weasle
     body off the trigger...


     VOLTAIRE

     CRASHES back through the skylight and swoops down on Eddie.
     He sinks his talons into Eddie's back and lifts him into the
     air.

     As Valiant is being pulled skyward he reaches for something
     along the wall of inventory.  He grabs a handful of Acme
     Small Pills and jams a couple dowm the buzzard's mouth.
     Instantly, Voltaire starts to shrink.  As he gets smaller, he
     can no longer hold Eddie up.  They both descend as Voltaire
     shrinks to the size of a chick.

     The sprayer is swinging back towards Roger and Jessica.  At
     the last second, Valiant reaches up and blocks it.  It swings
     back the other way.

     As Valiant scrambles up on the vehicle to turn it off,
     Voltaire has found a box of Acme Big Pills.  He pecks into
     it... and after a beat, EXPLODES out of the box.  He's now
     three times the size he was before.  Voltaire flaps in for
     the kill.

     Valiant reaches the turret just in time to swing the cannon
     around.  The spray of dip blasts one of Voltaire's wings off.
     He spins earthward like a flaming Messerschmidt, finally
     landing in the dip vat and dissolving into a black pool.

     Doom arrives just in time to see his pet bird dissolved.
     Angrily, he steps onto a giant Acme Mousetrap.  He uses a
     piece of Acme cheese to spring it, catapulting him through
     the air.

     Just as Valiant is about to turn off the dip cannon, Doom
     lands on the truck.  He knocks Eddie off the turret with a
     flying tackle.  They both hit the floor.

     Doom gets up, leaving Eddie stunned.  He sprints to where the
     Weasle had dropped Eddie's pistol.  Finally Eddie shakes it
     off.  He sees Doom about to reach the gun.  He straps on a
     pair of Acme Rocket Skates, fires them up and shoots across
     the floor.  He knocks Doom into a stack of Acme boxes,
     toppling the whole shelf down on top of him.

     As the sprayer swings back toward Roger and Jessica, they
     have their last moment together.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, I want you to know I love you.
               I loved you more than any woman has
               ever loved a rabbit.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Be comforted in the knowledge that as
               we face the Grim Dipper, our paint will
               be comingled for eternity.

     They both close their eyes, waiting for the end.  But it
     never cames.  The truck runs up on some boxes and the sprayer
     arm swings back the other way.

     Doom grabs an Acme slingshot, loads an Acme boulder and fires
     it at Valiant.  BLAM!  It whacks Valiant on the head, laying
     him out cold in front of the Cloverleaf steamroller,

     Doom climbs into the steamroller and starts it up.  He puts
     it into gear and starts it rolling toward Valiant.

     Valiant comes around to see the huge roller bearing down on
     him.  At the last second, Valiant rolls out of the way and
     grabs an Acme boxing glove.  It accordians out and smashes
     Doom in the face.  He goes flying out of the driver's seat,
     turning the wheel as he falls.  The steamroller starts to
     turn in circles.

     Valiant jumps Doom.  But Doom is stronger.  He throws Valiant
     off and starts whacking him with his fist.  He pummels
     Valiant backward toward the drum of the steamroller.  Valiant
     grabs the nearest thing for defense.  It's a can of Acme
     Stay-Put Adhesive.  He whips it up in front of his face.
     Doom puts his fist right through it, covering his hand with
     glue.  He smiles at Valiant and hauls off again.  Valiant
     ducks.  Doom's fist strikes the top of the drum of the
     steamroller.  Frantically he tries to pull it off.  But it
     "Stays-Put".  The roller starts to suck his fist down and
     under.

                               DOOM
               Nooooo!

     Jessica and Roger avert their eyes as the steamroller crushes
     Doom.

     Valiant breathes a sigh of relief.  He starts for the dip
     truck as the cannon swings back toward Roger and Jessica.
     But neither of them are watching the cannon.  Their eyes are
     fixed on the ground behind the steamroller.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     There isn't the messy pile of blood and guts you'd expect to
     see if a human got run over.  Instead, we see that Judge
     Doom's remains have rolled out like a flat black pancake.
     After a beat, an edge curls up with a CREAK.  Now the whole
     shape peels off the floor and wobbles to it's feet. REVEALING
     DOOM IS A TOON.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie, look out!


     VALIANT

     turns to see Doom stick his flattened thumb in his mouth.  He
     blows, re-inflating himself.  His glasses CRACK and fall off.
     Then his prosthetic eyeballs pop out.  His teeth shatter and
     fall out of his mouth like china.  Underneath his latex mask
     we can see his Toon mouth and evil red Toon eyes.

                               VALIANT
               Holy shit, he's a Toon!

                               DOOM
               Surprised?

                               VALIANT
               Not really.  Only a Toon could think of
               something as goofy as that freeway
               idea.

     Doom takes the black rubber gloves off, REVEALING red hands
     with long fingernails.  He makes his fist into an anvil and
     advances on Valiant.

                               DOOM
               Is that so?  Well, we'll see who's the
               goofy one.

     BLAM!  From ten feet away, he smashes Valiant with a
     bone-crushing punch.  Valiant staggers backwards.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               By the way, when I killed your brother,
               Teddy, I used to talk just like this.

     Doom spesks in a Toony high-pitched squeak.  Valiant
     recognizes him now.

                               VALIANT
               You?

                               DOOM
               That's right, me.

     BLAM!  Doom hammers Valiant again.  He's defenseless against
     Doom's super human strength.  BLAM!  Valiant goes
     sprawling to the ground.  Now Doom's hand turns into a
     buzzsaw.  He goes to administer the coup de grace.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Now Eddie's gonna be deady, just like
               Teddy.

     With his last ounce of strength, Valiant grabs the Acme
     Boxing Glove.  He pops it.  The glove extends across the
     room, punching the release lever on the dip truck.


     CLOSE - VALVE

     A flood of dip gushes out of the valve and rolls toward Doom
     like a wave.


     DOOM

     SCREAMS as the torrent hits him with a CRASH.  But there's no
     escape for him this time.  The flood of liquid envelopes him
     at the ankles.  He dissolves into it like a melting candle.


     THE DIPMOBILE

     continues forward inexorably.  The arm is swinging towards
     Roger and Jessica.  It gets closer and closer...

     Valiant tries to get to the truck, but it's too late.  The
     cannon has reached them.


     CLOSE - ROGER AND JESSICA

     They close their eyes, preparing to meet their Maker.  But
     nothing happens.

     The spray of the cannon suddenly peters out.  It dries up in
     a harmless drip as the tank has completely emptied.

     Valiant gets to the controls of the power winch.  He hoists
     Roger and Jessica up out of the way.  The Dipmobile passes
     harmlessly underneath them and SMASHES through the brick
     wall.


     TOONTOWN

     is REVEALED in all its splendor.  It's a bucolic setting.  A
     rainbow shares the blue sky with a smiling sun.  Fawns and
     butterflies, chipmunks and flowers watch curiously as the dip
     truck rolls past.  Suddenly it's lifted off the ground.  We
     see it's resting on the top of a TOON GIANT's head.  This
     Giant plucks the truck off his head, regards it, then pops it
     in his mouth.


     VALIANT

     lowers Roger and Jessica to the ground.  We HEAR POLICE
     SIRENS approach.  When Valiant unties them, Jessica turns and
     exclaims...

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               My hero!

     Then she hugs Roger passionately.  Valiant can only shrug.


     THROUGH THE WALL - TOONS

     start coming in.  They look around at the scene, bewildered,
     then gather around Doom's robe, mask and shoes lying in the
     puddle of dip.  There's a reddish slick floating on top.
     Valiant wanders over and joins them.

                               VALIANT
               Hi-ho, the Doom is dead.


     ANGLE ON DOOR

     Dolores, Lt. Santino, and several other COPS rush in, guns
     drawn.  Dolores runs to Eddie and puts her arms around him.
     Santino looks down at the remains on the floor.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell is that?

                               VALIANT
               Doom.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Jesus Christ... that was the Judge?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket.  He puts it
     up against the red slime on the robe.  It's a match.

                               VALIANT
               That was the murderer of Herman Acme,
               Maroon... and my brother.

     Dolores looks down at the front of Valiant's shirt.  A dark
     stain is appearing.

               Eddie, we better get you to hospital.
               You're bleedin'.

     Valiant looks down at the stain.

                               VALIANT
               That's not blood.  That's ink.  That
               goof Acme squirted me with some the
               other day.  Why it's comin' 'through
               now, I don't know.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's because it's
               Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up
               three days later.  Gives you enough
               time to get away from the victim so he
               doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great
               gag.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah...

               I'll treat you to a new shirt.  After
               all, you did save Toontown.

               Problem is without Marvin's will, the
               land still goes to Cloverleaf.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's right.  If only we knew what
               happened to that will...

     Valiant looks up from his shirt.

                               VALIANT
               Say Roger, remember that love letter
               you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint
               Club?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               I think you oughta read it to her.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Good idea.

     He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the paper and clears his
     throat.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing;
                       reads)
               Dear Jessy... How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the... I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body... Hey?


     CLOSE - PAPER

     The Disappearing-Reappearing Ink is coming up over Roger's
     scribbling.

               Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,
               do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the
               property known as Toontown to those
               loveable characters...

     PAN the Toon crowd, who are listening to the reading of the
     will.  It is a gallery of recognizable faces.  Everyone from
     Mickey to Bugs, Yakky Doodle to Yosemite Sam, Dumbo to Dopey,
     Bambi to Droopy, Tweety Bird to Tinkerbell.  They're all
     there.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               ... who have given me and the rest of
               humanity so much mirth and merriment...
               the Toons.

     The Toon crowd erupts with a CHEER!  Hats go in the air and
     they descend on Roger, slapping his back.  Roger breaks away
     from the crowd and joins Eddie.


     TWO SHOT - EDDIE AND ROGER

     They stand side by side, looking out over Toontown.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Eddie, you still think I'm a
               patsy, a simp, a chump?

     Eddie wipes the spit off his face.

                               VALIANT
               No, kid, you're a real hero.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I guess I am at that.  Cigar?

     Roger holds out a large stogie.

                               VALIANT
               Why not?

     Roger lights Eddie's and one for himself.

                               VALIANT
                       (continuing)
               By the way, Roger, you were right about
               your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm
               glad you got her back.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               And I'm glad you got your sense of
               humor back.  Think you'll keep it?

                               VALIANT
               Only time will tell.

     Valiant puffs on the cigar.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               From this box here...

     Valiant glances down.  The box says, "Acme Exploding Cigars".
     He looks to Roger, but it's too late.  KABOOM!  KABOOM!
     Their cigars blow up in classic Toon tradition, blackening
     both their faces.  Roger starts laughing.  Eddie stares at
     Roger for a moment, then he starts laughing too.  They throw
     their heads back in a HOWL.  The other Toons join in.  Pretty
     soon the whole factory is shaking with LAUGHTER.


     A TOON COP

     dressed in blue uniform and hat with his back to us tries to
     restore order in the Acme factory.  As soon as he talks, we
     recognize the stutter.  It's PORKY PIG.

                               PORKY PIG
               O-k-k-k, mmmove along.  There's
               nnnothin' else to see.  T-t-that's it.

                       CAMERA)
               Hmm, I l-l-like the sound of that.

     Then, savoring the phrase, Porky stutters out the famous
     sign-off.

                               PORKY PIG
                      (continuing)
                Eee-ba-da, eee-ba-da... t-t-that's all,

          OUTSKIRTS OF A SOUTH TEXAS RAILROAD YARD (SAN RAFAEL)

          A TRAIN ROARS PAST REVEALING IN THE DISTANCE FIVE MET RIDING
          TOWARD CAMERA along the tracks. In CLOSE F.G. is.the back
          part of a sign.

          NARRATOR
          To most of America in 1913, the Age
          of Innocence had arrived and the
          stories of the Indian Wars and the
          Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters
          had become either barroom ballyhoo
          or front-porch remiraiscences... .But
          on both sides of the $io Grande men
           still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's
          and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a
          changing land.
          THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY..
          The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are
          regulation.
          PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead
          of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain...
          Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early
          forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant
          for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes
          in himself and those around him.
          Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are
          not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a
          killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for
          trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside
          and against society because he believes in that way of life
          and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of
          regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man'
          according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad,
          and he wouldn't have it any other way.
          Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant.
          Dutch is bigâ good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong
          loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and
          regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm,
          but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one.
          Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH,
          dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot
          tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and

          sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal,
          vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing
          for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go.
          They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each
          other and that is limited.
          A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL.
          Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle
          20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty
          under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with
          Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them
          all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent
          dignity of. man (some men at least). " He is faster than his
          companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't.
          laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride --
          Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,.
          he will have no regrets.
          REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP. Witut.speaking they, begin
          to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order.

          4 THE SIGN READS IN RAILROAD LETTERS: SAN RAFAEL, TEXAS
           And underneath, someone has printed:

           Wï¿½LCO ME TO SAN RAFAEL

          PIKE' AND ' DUTCH STARE FOR A MOMENT AT THE SIGN, slightly
          bemused. _

          Make you feel welcome?

          (DRYLY)

          TEC TOR
          What's it say?

          ANGEL
          (baiting him)
          It invites us to stay with the community
          and grow. It is here, perhaps with time
          and small miracle -- that you could be
          taught to read.

          Tector looks at Angel for a long moment, then turns to Pike.

          TECTOR
          I never enlisted to serve with no
          smart-mouthed kid.

          ANGEL
          Nor I with dogs.

          DUTCH
          (grinning at Pike)
           ITd like to transfer to another unit --
           there seems to be dissension in the
          ranks.

           PIKE
          (t0 Teotor and Angel)
          Itll transfer both of you -- just one
          more word.
          They look at him silently. He means it. Finally Tike spurs
          his horse and the group sta'ts for town, CAMERA PANNING. THEM

          EXT.. MAIN SQUARE OF SAN RAFAEL DAY


          THE SQUARE. SHOWS THE MEXICAN/SPANISH INFLUENCE AND.IS CROWDED
          with weekend visitors. Men,. women and children are. milling
          about, shopping and idly trading gossip.. The town.has the
          look of turn of the century Americana along with its.Spanisn
          heritage. The group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed.-
          Riding downethe street they pass:
          A LARGE TENT IN FRONT OF WHICH IS A BANNER ANNOUNCING a
          W.C.T.U. meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass
          drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on
          inside.

          SPEAKER (OS)
          Leviticus. 10.9. Do not drink wine or
          strong drink thou,nor thy sons with
          thee least ye die. It shall be a
          statute forever. Look. not though. upon.
          the. wine when it. is red when it giveth
          his color in the cup when it moveth
          itself aright at the last it biteth
          like a serpent and stingeth like an
          adder.

          (THEN)
          That is in the good book.. but here in
          this town, it is five cents a glass.
          Five cents a glass, does anyone think
          that that is really the price of a
          ----drink? The price of a drink let him
          decide who has lost his courage and his
          pride and who lies a govelling heap
          of clay not far removed from a beast

          I hereby solemnly procaise, God helping

          ABE,. PHIL AND BURT, at the hitching rail on one side of the
          street,. turn and keep pace with the group on horseback.

          ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE THREE OTHER SOLDIERS,

          BUCK, FRANK AND CRAZY LEE, DO THE SAME.

          10 PIKE AND HIS GROUP RIDE PAST THE GENERAL STORE AND THE

          SALOON. AT Tï¿½- END OF THE STREET, THEY DISMOUNT ACROSS FROM
          THE YELLOW AND BROWN RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION BUILDING. As
          they swing out of the saddle the other ' soldiers' join them.

          horses and step onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds
          the'square. Some passersby look curiously.

          PIKE
          (after a moment, a little

          AWKWARDLY)
          Fall in -- and follow me.
          The men,. with the 'exception of Tector, Phil and Abe, shuffle
          into a ragged column of twos.

           Real quiet, 'sir.'
           Pike looks at the horses, then at:

          13, THE SIGN OVER THE ENTRANCE OF A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET
           It reads: PECOS AND SOUTH TEXAS R.R.
          14. PIKE PAUSES. FOR A MINUTE and behind him the men surreptitious-
          ly touch their holstered forty-five automatics. Pike leaves
          the boardwalk, crossing toward. the railroad office. Tector
          and Phil stay with the horses.

          PIKE AND DUTCH, LOOKING AROUND AS THEY LEAVE. THE BOARDWALK,

          ACCIDENTALLY BUMP INTO A LADY SHOPPER, WHO DROPS HER PACIKAGE.

          PIKE

          DUTCH

          Dutch picks up the package, Pike offers the lady his arm.
          She hesitates, accepts. Pike and Dutch, followed by the
          others, lead her across the 'street.

          16. ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING OPPOSITE THE RAILROAD OFFICE ARE

          TEN. MEN STRETCHED OUT BEHIND THE FALSE FRONT T_DLY WATCHING
          THE CROWD BELOW, THEIR RIFLES AT THEIR SIDES Behind them.
          on the flat of the roof are open bedrolls, and the remains of
          at least three meals. It is hot., they have been there a -long
          time, and they are tired.

          HARDCASES -- frowns a little as he watches the soldiers in
          the street below. It is. hotter than hell on the tin roof and
          he is sweating heavily. He turns, edges forward, then nudges:
          18, DEKE THORNTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM, his back against the wall,
          Thornton is a hard-bodied, quiet-spoken man, with a lined
          face and the embittered manner of someone who has changed
          sides to stay alive and while part of his life has gone out

          He's there.
          The bounty hunters react and prepare to fire. Over this shot
          is the sound of Pike calling to Thornton -- from the past.

          smiling with the thought that their visit means. military

          84 BUT HE TAKES THE MARSHAL, the deputy and one bounty hunter
           with him before he is cut to pieces.
          85 HARRIGAN AND THORNTON LOOKING DOWN at the shambles in the

          AND IRATE TOWNSPEOPLE. BENSON, a beefy redneck rancher,
          curses bitterly as he crosses to Harrigan.

          BENSON
          We're holding you -- your whole damned rail-

          our town as a battlefield; You're
          going to pay, sir -- your-railroad

          HARRIGAN

          Without the railroad this place would
          still be a lousy little pueblo, so

          88 IN THE STREET -- HE STOPS, looking at the dead and dying,

          LISTENING:

           BENSON (OS)

           federal troops -- I'll stop you and

          Your men enter this town again and
          they will be shot on sight;
          Thornton ignores them, slowly rolling a cigarette, looking
          after Pike.
          Harrigan exits, crosses to Thornton.

          HARRIGAN
          I pulled. you out of jail to get- that

          think you're not going back behind
          bars for twenty more years?
          Thornton's face twists as he hears again the clanging of cell
          doors and the whimpering of prisoners..

          THORNTON
          Because I'm all you've got
          (then, softly)
          Because I know him.
          (turning away bitterly)
          Because you know I'll get him -- I'll
          kill him rather than go-back.

          89 THE WILD BUNCH RIDES DOWN A STEEP TRAIL INTO A DRY ARROYO
           They are weary, but determined. Buck, last in line, covered
           with blood, is swaying in the saddle. Although severely
           wounded, he still clutches the bags of silver.
          90 REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE ARROYO THE MEN SPUR their horses
           across the d r y stream bed and up the steep bank on. t he other
          side.

          91 DUTCH AND PIKE ARE IN THE LEAD. BEHIND THEM THE OTHERS LUNGE
           UP IN SINGLE FILE. Angel, second to last, reaches the top,
          turns as:

          92 BUCK, NOW COMPLETELY BLIND, FALLS BACKWARD OVER THE REAR OF

           HIS HORSE, HITS THE GROUND AND SOMERSAULTS BACKWARDS TO THE
           BOTTOM, still clutching the saddle bags.
          93 ANGEL PULLS UP and calls to Pike.

           ANGEL
          Fijate.
          94 BUCK, ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES, MOANS WITH PAIN as he attempts
          to crawl up the slope.

          looking down.

          Buck lurches forward, grabbing at Pike who steps back, Pike
          crosses to his horse, and painfully climbs into the saddle.

          BUCK
          (dying, almost incoherent
          with pain)
          I kin still -ride...I can't see, but I
          kin ride...

          99 BUCK, ON HIS KNEES, â¢ IS CAUGHT SQUARE BY THE. SHO T AND HURLED
          OVER BACKWARDS. He slides several feet over the smooth,
          round pebbles of the wash, then is still.
          Pike turns his horse and spurs it . up the slope.
          100 THE MEN WATCH SILENTLY AS PIKE RIDES UP. and halts. They
          don't move, all looking down-at-Buck.

          PIKE

          trying to cover the loss)
          You boys want to move on -- or stay here

          The following scenes will be superimposed over 101 and 102.
          The suite consists of three adjoining rooms and is very
          plush indeed,
          TWO VERY BEAUTIFUL-YOUNG WOMEN in revealing night dress are
          hindering more than helping, a somewhat loaded Pike Bishop
          as he attempts to get into his clothes. The ladies are
          giggling. and there is a great deal of grab-ass between the
          three. -
          101-B THORNTON, fully dressed and looking very sharp in his big
          city clothes, enters from one of. the adjoining rooms.
          ELIZABETH, a tall, lovely near-naked,.dark-haired girl,
          follows him and takes his arm possessively. For a moment
          both watch:
          101-C PIKE'S girls'effectively stop his half-hearted attempts and
          begin disrobing him.

          That's my business -- being sure.
          There is a knock at the door and. Thornton whirls. Elizabeth

          The other men pursue.P.ike as the Deputy bends down and

          AT A SMALL DESK IN FRONT OF THE OTHER BOUNTY HUNTERS,
          The interior of the room is tawdry, disorderly and smells
          bad. The bare walls are decorated with pin-ups from the
          Police Gazette.
          The men sit attentively on the bunks. and.foot lockers.,
          Harrigan is marking beside their names in a large ledger

          him again -- you'd like that, wouldn't
          .you?

           HIS GLOVED HAND, then looks up at the eight bounty hunters
           who are sitting on their horses watching him.

          112 PIKE AND HIS MEN RIDE INTO THE RUINS OF A SMALL RANCHERO.
          A young boy takes their horses while an old.man and his
          wounded son (the father of the boy) watch. Behind them,
          an ancient woman pays no attention as she slaps tortillas
          into shape. Two small children watch, big-eyed.
          ;113 THE MEN ARE QUIET WITH FATIGUE AS THEY DISMOUNT AND TIE. j
          THEIR HORSES.. FREDDY SYKES, a skinny old man in tattered range
          clothes, crosses to Pike as he unloads his saddle bags.

          SYKES
          Them others ain't comin'?

          PIKE
          No.

          SYKES
          (after a moment)
          None of 'em?
          111 PIKE TAKES THE BAGS OUT OF THE CORRAL TO THE FIRE that burns
          near an adobe wall and drops them on a poncho, watches as
          the others do the same.

          SYKES
          (joining him again; worried)
          But I got horses and gear for all
          them fellers like you said --

          PIKE
          They won't need them -- we will.
          Sykes thinks this over, finally nods. a little and turns away.
          115 LYLE AND HIS BROTHER AND DUTCH STAND in a half. circle around
          the poncho. waiting. Angel, the last, drops his saddle bag,
          then crosses to the wall and drops down to rest. For a long
          moment the men look down.a-t the pile of saddle bags.

          starting out and this is our stake for
          new territory.
          Pike looks at him silently. He has heard this kind of
          argument many times in the past and it is obvious he is sick
          to death of it. Lyle finally looks awa- at his brother;

          TECTOR
          And I figure a 'share to that old
          man for watching the horses is a
          share too much.

          takes out a sack of silver, kneels to slit the bag open.

          MOVES OUT OF THE BACKGROUND, a buffalo gun now dangling

          Well, I caught up to them -- two or
          three times -- There was a man named
           Harrigan -- He had a certain way of
          doing things -- So I made him change
          his ways -- when you do that to a
           narrow man -- he can't live with it -

          the stirrup he stiffly starts to swing on. The leather
          breaks and. he falls under the animal. Landing on his
          back, he lets out a loud shriek.

          150 PIKE STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET. None of them move forward
          to help him and he doesn't expect them to. He is

          and mounts, concealing his pain, taking a few seconds to
          gather up the reins and position himself. In the b.g.,
          Dutch swings onto his horse.

          Huerta,' s counter-revolutionary army and their ladies,,
          A small mariachi band wanders among the. tables. playing folk.
          songs of the era. In certain areas horses are stabled.--
          a blacksmith shop is working, guns are being repaired, knives
          and bayonets sharpened..,and food is being cooked for the
          troops by their women. Kids, as .always,. are very evident.
          19L. MAPACHE AND HIS GROUP ARE SEATED AT A TABLE which is in' a
          covered area raised above the others. It is obvious from.
          his position and respect accorded him that he is the local
          .boss of the area.' The German officer, Mohr, and Ernst, are
          'sitting on one side of him. Lieutenant Zamorra is seated
          on the other side. Herrera is close by.
          1.95. PIKE AND THE OTHERS MOVE TOWARDS A CORNER of the cantina
          eyeing the Mexicans with the kind of caution that men who
          are vastly outnumbered generally show.. They sit quietly
          at a table, ignoring the suspicious looks of the soldiers.
          196 AT MAPACHE'S LONG TABLE, the General and the Germans watch
          them with pointed interest. Mohr nudges Mapache and asks
          who they are. Mapache shr ugs -- he doesn't know,
          197 EMMA, A PRETTY WAITRESS, CROSSES TO PIKE'S table to take
          their order.

          around the cantina. At a nearby table a group of men are
          throwing dice and laughing loudly. The mariachis are gather-
          ing around Mapache.. Lyle shifts in his chair to look at them.
          198 MAPACHE IS LAUGHING AND DRINKING. The German. leans close
          to Zamorra and speaks in Spanish.

          MOHR
          Do you know these Americans?

          ZAMORRA
          No.
          The German settles back in his.chair and. begins placing
          a cigarette in a holder.

          1.99 TECTOR AND LYLE LOOK SUSPICIOUSLY AROUND AT THE MEXICANS
          in the cantina. The other men tired from the trail only
          half listen to them as the girl serves beer.

          TECTOR
          Probably talking about us behind our
          backs.
          200 DUTCH TURNS TO PIKE WHO IS QUAFFING a large beer.

          Mapache and the'others slowly rise, look at Angel, now
          realizing who shot the girl.
          208 MAPACHE STARTS TOWARDS THEM. He pushes over chairs and shoves
          people aside as he approaches the group. Zamorra9 the Germans
          and other members of his retinue are close on his heels.

          Mapache laughs. His ego is pleased with the idea that.he
          had taken someone's woman. He turns and explains grandly
          in Spanish to the rest of. the cantina.

          A killer for Huerta who calls himself
          a.general.-- with enough guns he can
          become a power in northern Mexico -
          my guess is Pike will try and get
          them f or â¢ him.

          HARRIGAN
          The train will be guarded by regular
          troops!!

          THORNTON
          Not regulars --.green recruits and not.
          worth a damn! I'll need twenty trained
          men -- not recruits or this gutter trash
          you.'ve given me.

          HARRIGAN
          You'll get the job done with what you
          have -- that'p our bargain.

          five feet in diameter with a small. open oven in the center
          surrounded by a great deal of rocks. Light comes in through
          a tiny hole in the center of the ceiling which also allows
          smoke to escape.
          PIKE, ANGEL AND DUTCH are sitting on a bench against one
          wall. Angel has been cleaned up, but looks beaten.
          225 SYKES IS IN ONE CORNER, thoroughly enjoying himself.
          The men are all nude and stark white against the mud.' color of
          the walls. As the woman exits, Dutch stands and empties a
          bucket of water over' himself -and the others. They all gasp
          with relief. All have towels around their waists and none
          are completely sober. Pike's leg is heavily scarred and he
          is in pain. He stands and drinks, gets closer to the fire9
          massaging his leg.

          DUTCH
          I don't see how you stand it

          PIKE
          Some day I'm going to build me one of

          The soldiers in the back of the car continue to sleep as

          the train.

          287 THE TRAIN NEARS A WAGON ROAD WITH A NARROW BRIDGE THAT
          CROSSES IT AND SUDDENLY the wheels lock. With a shower of
          sparks it slides to a stop beside:"
          288 A LARGE WAGON ON THE RIVERSIDE OF THE CROSSING. The
          bandits scramble off the train and begin loading cases of
          guns onto the waiting wagon. Sykes and Tector Gorch assist,
          them. The wagon is directly beside the car and the unload-

          yells down to the men:

          He turns and scrambles down inside the cab.

          Large barrels on the side of the wagon serve as floatation
          gear. The current catches it and begins to swing it on
          the rope downstream and across the river..
          295 THE BOUNTY HUNTERS ARE RAPIDLY CLOSING THE GAP. In the
          distance. they can see the bandits, now in mid-stream,

           The shot has come from behind. Above and through the trees

           is beside him. Sykes is still on the reins, Angel is sitting
           on the cases of guns. The Gorch brothers are both riding '14

          Last I saw he was ridin' four sticks of

          Pike drinks, hands it'to Sykes who drunks, hands it to Angel
          who drinks,. hands it with a touch of a smile to Tector who
          hesitates, then half grins himself; drinks and hands it to
          Lyle. Lyle looks at the bottle, upends it over his mouth, a
          few drops spill out into his mouth, looks at the bottle in
          disbelief, tosses it gently aside.

          It'll be a cold day in hell 'fore

          watch the buzzards. They'll show
          you where he is -- you might even
          get a pair of. boots.
          Jess thinks this over and grins, then the smile fades.

          But what if he ain't dead?

          lowers his rifle and sags back. His leg is dark with dried
          blood and he's weak. Around the wound is a crude bandage
          made from his shirt -- with a tourniquet twisted tightly
          above it. After a moment, there is a noise and he looks
          away at:

          440 THE FIGURE OF A MEXICAN PEON -- BLURRED AND INDISTINCT
          AGAINST THE RAYS of the late afternoon sun, a machete

          bottle of mescale and takes a drink.
          459 ON THE FLOOR OF THE HUT A SAD BUT NOT UNATTRACTIVE WOMAN is
          sitting looking at a handful of silver in her hand. In one
          corner a baby whines as the flies bother it.
          Through an open door leading to another room,.the drunken
          voices of the Gorch brothers can be heard as they bargain
          with DELORES, a very reluctant prostitute.

          LYLE (OS)

          rushes him from behind with a machete and the cross fire of
          his own men kills him as he swings the weapon into TectorPs

          falls as bullets cut into him. He rolls, then.crawls under
          the tables dragging the useless lower half'of his body. Al-
          thotgh in pain, he is grinning strangely. He removes a car-
          bine from a dead soldier and. props himself on a bench. Taking
          careful aim,, he fires and a 'soldier drops screaming-.and.

          again, a man dying each time he pulls the trigger..

          knife and hardly able to move, falls on Dutch -- the weight
          of the.fall-burying the weapon deep into Dutch's back.
          Crumpled together, both.men die,

          506 IN THE COURTYARD A SMALL GROUP OF WOMEN wrapped in. black
          robosas are burning candles and moving. among the dead bodies.
          that spill out of the large room of the hacienda and into the
          yard. It is a scene of carnage, blood now black in.the sun,
          a million flies and the walls lined with waiting vultures.
          There is no sign of soldiers anywhere.. A few of the bodies
          have been dragged into the courtyard. Most, including Pike,
          Dutch and the others, including Mapache, lie where they fell.

          507 THE BOUNTY HUNTERS, LED BY THORNTON, RIDE UP TO THE ARCHES
          AND DISMOUNT, their horses snorting nervously at the smell of
          blood and the stench of death. At-the end of the courtyard
          where five corpses are heaped in a small Di13, a lone vulture
          stands. patiently near them.
          As the bounty hunters approach and the-.bird labors reluctantly
          into flight, the men dismount.
          Thornton, looking in through the broken wall, turns away.

FADE IN:

EXT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

Under gloomy sky a huge fortress looms on a volcanic
mountainside.  From within WE HEAR the agonizing scream
of a woman giving birth.

INT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

The scream continues as WE MOVE THROUGH the grim corri-
dors of the castle TOWARD stairs leading down to a
dungeon.

INT.. DUNGEON - DAY

Silhouetted in sadows, three Nockmaar MINIONS stand
guard.  In a jail cell, sex fully pregnant WOMEN watch
from behind iron bars.  The screaming stops.  There's a
moment of silence.  As WE MOVE INTO another jail cell
WE HEAR a slap and the first cry of a newborn BABY.

In the cell a black-robed DRUID watches intensely as
ETHNA, a midwife, leans over the MOTHER and wraps the
baby in swaddling.

                         DRUID
          Is it a girl?

                         ETHNA
          It is a girl.

                         DRUID
          Show me its arm.

Ethna peels back the swaddling.  On the baby's arm is a
small marking.

                         DRUID
          It's true then.  I must tell Queen
          Bavmorda.

With great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon
stairs.  Ethna gently places the baby on the mother's
breast.  The mother comforst the baby lovingly until it
stops crying.  Then she reaches out and clasps the
midwife's wrist.

                        MOTHER
          Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're
          going to kill my baby.

Ethna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes
her head at the mother.

                         ETHNA
          They'll kill you.

                        MOTHER
          Please save my baby.

Ethna hesitates.  Then decides.  She quickly wraps to-
gether some rags and gives them to the mother.

                         ETHNA
          Pretend this is the child.

                        MOTHER
          Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you.

The mother kisses her baby and hands it to Ethna, who
hides the baby inside the basket of rags.  Ethna car-
ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs.

The mother lies back and sighs with relief.  Then she
hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear.

QUEEN BAVMORDA sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her
black robes flowing behind her.  The druid hurries
alongside.

                       BAVMORDA
          We will start the ritual at dusk.
          You're certain this is the one?

                         DRUID
          It bears the markings.

                       BAVMORDA
          I must see for myself!  Just as the
          omen foretold!

The guards fearfully move aside as Bavmorda enters the
cell.

                       BAVMORDA
          So.  You *were* the one.

                        MOTHER
          Yes.  But nothing you can do will
          stop the prophecy.

                       BAVMORDA
          This child will have no power over
          me....

Bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi-
ously tears them apart.

                       BAVMORDA
                      (furiously)
          Where's the baby!

One of the guards looks up the stairs.

                         GUARD
          The midwife!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.

                       BAVMORDA
          Find that baby!  Use the dogs!
          Sorsha!

Two guards draw swords and charge upstairs.  Bavmorda
grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kill her.

Bavmorda storms away with the druid.  WE SEE the shadow
of the guard move over the terrified mother.  War drums
begin to beat out an alarm.

EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

TITLES BEGIN.  The midwife hurries through swirling
show, clutching the baby.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Nockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate
village, driving ferocious DEATH DOGS into huts,
violently searching for the baby.  The oppressed, poor
VILLAGERS are yanked into the street.  Some of them are
beaten.  One is killed.

The midwife hides behind a hut, still holding the baby,
then runs away from the village.

EXT. GRASSLAND - DAY

Ethna treks across an open grass field.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

She huddles by a fire, exhausted and hungry, her
clothes filthy and torn, and she rocks the crying baby.
She hears dogs howling in the distance.  She clutches
the baby, kicks out the fire, and runs.

EXT. OCEAN CLIFFSIDE - DAY

She scrambles over rocks on a windswept coastline.

EXT. FOREST - DAWN

Ethna runs desperately for her life.  Chasing her are
two vicious DEATH DOGS.  She scrambles across a shallow
river.  She claws at rock and tears away sticks and
driftwood matted together with weeds.  Into this she
places the baby and sets it afloat downstream.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!

The dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the
river.  The midwife claws her way up a steep bank, lur-
ing the dogs.  As they attack her:

                        MIDWIFE
          I don't have her!  No!  No!

She grabs a stick and tries to defend herself, thrash-
ing at the snarling dogs.

From the baby's view, as it floats down the river, WE
SEE the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees.

EXT. DOWNRIVER - DAY - MONTAGE

The little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the
current.  It glances off jutting rocks, tumbles over
rapids, and scrapes under overhanging trees.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

At last the raft catches in some weeks, almost dumping
the baby.

TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS

Suddenly WE HEAR rustling leaves, possibly another
Death Dog.  Then WE HEAR giggling.  Two children, RANON
and MIMS, watch in amazement from the riverbank.

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Holding onto a plow, WILLOW UFGOOD struggles behind a
huge hog.  From a heavy sack slung over his shoulder he
tosses seeds.

                         RANON
          Dada!  We found something in the
          river!

Willow beams with joy as his son and daughter race to-
ward him.  They grab his sleeves and tug him away from
his plow.

                        WILLOW
          I can't run off and play with you
          now.  I've got work to do.

                      RANON/MIMS
          But Dada, you gotta see it!  Hurry!

Willow drops his sack of seeds.  The ugly hog glares at
him like a guilty conscience.  The children squeal with
excitement as their father runs toward the river with
them.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

WE SEE Willow from the baby's view.  His eyes pop open.
He quickly backs his children away.

                        WILLOW
          Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't
          know where it's been.  It could be
          diseased.

                         MIMS
          It's a baby!

                         RANON
          It's not a Nelwyn baby.

                        WILLOW
          No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn
          baby.  It looks like a daikini...

                         MIMS
          Ooh, it's so cute...

                        WILLOW
          Mims!  Get back here!  It might
          bite you.

Willow drags Mims away.  Then the baby starts crying.

                         RANON
          Can't we keep it, Dada?

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely not.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood!

Willow, in a sudden panic, sees BURGLEKUTT in the dis-
tance.  He splashes into the river, grabs the raft,
plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying
baby.

                        WILLOW
          Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect --
          that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon,
          keep this thing hidden...

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Burglekutt's beady eyes spot Willow making a mad dash
for his plow.  Swinging his fat stomach, he angrily
points his walking stick and goes after him.

                         KIAYA
          Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done
          anything wrong!

Willow's wife KIAYA chases Burglekutt across the field,
her beautiful long hair flowing behind her.  Willow
quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all
day.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  What do you think you're
                doing!  I tell the planting seeds
                in this village.

                         KIAYA
          I told him we didn't steal it, Wil-
          low.

Burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of
Willow's sack and shakes them under Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          You haven't paid your debts.  Where
          did you get these seeds?

With pride, Willow puts his arm around his wife.

                        WILLOW
          In the forest.  My family's been
          gathering them since last fall.
          There's no law against that, Bur-
          glekutt.

Suddenly the children laugh in the distance.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!  You left the children
          alone by the river??

In alarm she runs off before Willow can stop her.  Bur-
glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get
          your planting done before the rains
          start.  You're gonna lose this
          land.

He raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes
them down at Willow's boots.  He waddles away toward
two of his MEN who wait by the road.  Then:  Kiaya
SHRIEKS from the river.  Burglekutt stops in his tracks
and shakes his head as if to say "the whole family's
crazy."  Off he trudges.  Willow watches and waits.
Then runs as fast as he can to the river.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Kiaya cradles the baby in her arms.  Willow runs up,
and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his
hips.

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely, under no condition, is
          anyone in this family going to fall
          in love with that baby.

They all fall in love as he speaks.  The children fol-
low Kiaya up on the bank, walking right past Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby.
          Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be
          ignored!

Ignored, Willow huffs after them across his unplowed
field.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow nervously paces as Kiaya pours water in a wood
tub and the children entertain the naked baby with
sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a
magic trick.

                        WILLOW
          This is bad.  If we're caught with
          that little daikini it'll be the
          end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need
          that for the festival.
                (indicates magic cloth)
          Kiaya, what are we going to do?

                         KIAYA
          We're gonna give this baby a bath.

The baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the
bath.

                        WILLOW
          Burglekutt's right.  There's not
          enough time to finish plowing.
          We'll lose everything and I'll end
          up working in the mines.

He shudders at the thought.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, do you think we should take
          her to the Village Council?

                        WILLOW
          No, no!  They'll think it's a bad
          omen.  There'll be a flood or a
          drought or a plague and
          everybody'll blame me for it!

                         RANON
          Look.  What's that?

Willow leans forward.  On the baby's shoulder is a
small branded scar in a circular design.  It only adds
to Willow's fears.

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.  This is trouble.
          I'll talk to the High Aldwin about
          it tomorrow at the Festival.

The baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

The raucous BAND plays as NELWYNS dance and celebrate
amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers.  A
crowd cheers wildly as MINERS battle FARMERS in a tug-
of-war, finally yanking the farmers face-first into a
puddle of mud.  On a stage a HARLEQUIN dances delight-
fully.  While on a raised platform the five members of
the VILLAGE COUNCIL sit and observe, mildly amused.
The head councilman is Burglekutt.

The WE SEE Willow on another stage.  He flourishes his
colorful sticks and cloths.  In the audience WE NOTICE
his friend MEEGOSH, who wears a miner's apron, rooting
Willow on.

                        WILLOW
          And now!  For our final amazing bit
          of magic, I will make an entire pig
          completely disappear!

Meegosh applauds as Mims and Ranon trot out lugging a
tiny baby pig in a crate.  As Willow takes the pig out
it bites his hand and gets away.  Willow tackles and
squashes it.  The crowd laughs and half of them leave,
and Meegosh covers his face.

Mims and Ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket.  Willow
cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his
back and suddenly it's gone!  Impresse, the crowd
gasps.  Then the pig squeals and dashes through
Willow's legs and leaps off the stage.

                         CROWD
          Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss!

Burglekutt and the Council shake their heads as Willow,
embarassed, picks up his things.  Meegosh trots up
with the pig under his arm.

                        WILLOW
          Meegosh, I'm in trouble.

                        MEEGOSH
          Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need
          a better pig, that's all.

But as they walk past the Village Council, and Bur-
glekutt sneers down at Willow, Meegosh catches on.

                        MEEGOSH
          Now Burglekutt's got you in the
          squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in
          the mines like me.

                        WILLOW
          Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces.
          That's the last thing I'd ever do.
                     (he shudders)
          I gotta get my crop planted.

                        MEEGOSH
          You know I'll help you as much as I
          can, Willow.

The Village Council members stand up respectfully as
the wise old HIGH ALDWIN hobbles through the adoring
crowd.  Mims and Ranon rush up to Willow with several
other children who are eating candy.

                         MIMS
          Dada, can we get treacle candy?
          Can we, can we?  Please?

                        WILLOW
                     (preoccupied)
          Meegosh, can you watch the chil-
          dren?  I gotta talk to the High
          Aldwin.

                        MEEGOSH
                    (truly amazed)
          The High Aldwin??  Why?

But Willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving
Meegosh with a dozen sugar-charged children and a pig.

Willow desperately pushes past people and finally
reaches the High Aldwin.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  I have to talk to you.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Not today, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          It's a matter of great importance
          to me!

Burglekutt stares angrily from his platform.  Slightly
annoyed, the High Aldwin stops and places his hand on
Willow's shoulder.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Intuition, Willow -- remember?  I
          know you're eager to be my appren-
          tice, Willow.  But today is the
          spring festival.

Suddenly a walking stick is pointed at Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!!
          Willow Ufgood???

His belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging
his councilmen to join in.  Willow shrinks away, em-
barassed.

Then a terrified SHRIEK shatters the festivity.  Music 
stops and people grab their children and run for their
lives.  A DEATH DOG rips a trail of destruction through
the village.

Meegosh holds onto Ranon and Mims.  But when Mims sees
Willow she runs right out into the open.  Willow
charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from
the beast's claws.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!  Bordak!

A loud war cry distracts the dog.  VOHNKAR, the
toughest warrior in the village, leads a charging army
of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks.  Wil-
low and Meegosh grab sticks.  The Nelwyns battle the
Death Dog.  At last, Vohnkar drives a spear through its
chest and it dies hideously.

                        MEEGOSH
          What was it looking for?

                      A VILLAGER
          It said "bordak"!  What does it
          mean?

                      COUNCILMAN
                      (scholarly)
          Baby!  It means baby!  It was look-
          ing for somebody's baby!

Mothers grab their children, people look around the
wrecked village in terror.  There's a haunting silence.

                         MIMS
          Mommy?

Suddenly alarmed, Willow races towrd his distant farm,
his children hurrying behind.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  Kiaya!

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow bursts in and finds Kiaya calmly feeding the
baby.  Relieved, he throws his arms around her.

                        WILLOW
          We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We
          must take her to the Council.

The children run in and they all huddle together, cher-
ishing their precious lives.

INT. COUNCIL BUILDING - DAY

Arguing villagers pack the church-shaped room to the
open door at the back and into the balconies above.
The councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the
High Aldwin seated in a special chair above them.  Tak-
ing charge, Burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with
his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          An evil beast from the outer world
          has invaded our peaceful village,
          looking for a baby!

This only adds to the frenzy.

                      A VILLAGER
          It's a sign!  An omen!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Our crops will die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Silence!  One beast we can kill.
          But there may be more!  And they
          won't give up their search till
          they've found what they're looking
          for!

                        MEEGOSH
          Whose baby is it!

                    OTHER VILLAGERS
          Who's to blame for this!

Amid the chaos the High Aldwin slowly stands up.  As if
he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the
back.

At the back door, holding the baby, Willow tries to
push his way through the jostling crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hand.  It flashes magically.  He
points as he speaks:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Willow Ufgood!  Come before me!

The crowd stands apart as Willow walks the length of
the room.  Kiaya and the children follow part way and
then stand aside next to Meegosh.  Burglekutt simmers
as Willow approaches the platform.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Earlier today you tried to tell me
          something, Willow.

                        WILLOW
                    (bows his head)
          My family found this baby in the
          river, High Aldwin.

The crowd stirs but the High Aldwin silences them with
a simple gesture.  He gazes down at the baby mysteri-
ously.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          A daikini child...
                   (his eyes close)
           ...of some importance, I feel...

                      BURGLEKUTT
          That's what the beasts want!  Give
          it back!

The crowd rumbles, many agree.

                        WILLOW
          They'll kill her!  We can't let
          this baby die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          What do we care!

Burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him.
Almost in a trance:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
           ...importance...yes...this child
          is special...

                      COUNCILMAN
          What should we do?

Instantly, the High Aldwin drops his arms and opens his
eyes.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          This child must be taken beyond the
          boundaries of our village.  All the
          way to the daikini crossroads.

The room goes silent.

                      A VILLAGER
          Who will do that?

                   SEVERAL VILLAGERS
          Vohnkar!  Vohnkar!

Vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and
pounds his chest once with his fist.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The outer world is dangerous and
          corrupt, Vohnkar.  And this baby is
          hunted by blood-hungry beasts.  Are
          you willing to sacrifice your life?

Brave Vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful-
ly.

                        VOHNKAR
          If I go, who'll defend you if other 
          beasts attack?

The crowd rumbles and shouts, and Vohnkar mops his brow
and scuttles away from the platform.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          He's right!  It seems only fair
          that the man to take this baby to
          the crossroads...
                  (walking stick up)
           ...be the very man who plucked
          it...
                 (walking stick down)
           ...out of the river!

All eyes turn to Willow.  Kiaya gasps and Meegosh holds
her back.

                        WILLOW
          I can't do it!  I haven't put my
          crop in!

                     A COUNCILMAN
          You caused this trouble.  You found
          the baby...you get rid of it!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          I nominate Willow Ufgood!

The crowd cheers wildly.  The High Aldwin steps forward
to the edge of the platform.  With a flourish he waves
his arms.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          I will consult the bones!

Something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands.  The
crowd jumps away.  The High Aldwin scatters small bones
across the floor below him.  He leans down and studies
the bones.  Willow looks at Kiaya, who is worried and
afraid.  The High Aldwin speaks softly to him:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones tell me nothing.
                   (he eyes Willow)
          But I must make a decision.  Is
          there love in your heart for this
          child?

Willow hesitates.  He looks at the baby.

                        WILLOW
          Yes.

The High Aldwin bolts straight up, broadcasting:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones have spoken!  Willow?
          The security of this village
          depends on you!

The people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to
leave.  Kiaya and Meegosh and the children push their
way toward Willow, who stands there staring at the
baby.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

Kiaya's hair hangs down her back in a long tight braid.
Near the fire she packs supplies into a travel sack.
On the other side of the fire, Willow diapers the baby.
The house is quiet.

                         MIMS
          Dada?

Willow sets the baby down.  He goes around an opne wall
an sits on his daughter's bed, straightening her blank-
ets and toys.

                         MIMS
          Watch out for brownies, Dada.

                        WILLOW
          I will, Mims.  Goodnight.

He smiles and kisses her.  Then crosses over to Ranon's bed.

                         RANON
          Dada, what's a daikini?

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis are giant people who live
          far far away.

                         RANON
          Are you scared?

Willow shrugs.  Ranon sits up in bed.

                         RANON
          I could be you rguard!  I could
          carry your spear!

                        WILLOW
                       (smiles)
          What a great son you are, Ranon.  I
          wish I could take you with me.  Now
          go to sleep...

Ranon slides down under his blankets.  Willow kisses
him, looks at him a moment, then quietly withdraws to-
ward the fire.

EXT. SACRED HILL - SUNRISE

The silhouette of a distant hill with druid stones on
top.

Carrying the baby, Willow climbs the hill with his fami-
ly.  He wears a papoose rig, supply pack, and a dagger.
He hands the baby to Kiaya, then walks through the
towering stones.  The High Aldwin solemnly looks out at
the distant forest.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Now, you know where you're going?
               (Willow shakes his head)
          Down there, through those trees,
          follow the river.  You'll know the
          crossroads by a big daikini struc-
          ture.  Willow, this is serious
          business.  Don't waste any time,
          the outer world is no place for a
          Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first
          daikini you see, then hurry home as
          fast as you can.

                        WILLOW
          If I'm not strong enough to be your
          apprentice, how can I do this?

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          You're strong enough.  But you're
          going to need courage, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          I don't want courage.  I don't want
          to be a warrior.  All I've ever
          wanted was to do magic, real magic,
          like you!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Real magic, Willow, is simply the
          art of controlling the reality of
          others.  You lack faith in your-
          self.  You must learn to trust your
          intuition.

The High Aldwin picks up a rock.  With intense concen-
tration he squeezes it in his outstretched hand.  Then
throws it in the air.  It changes into a bird and flies
away.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Go in the direction the bird is
          flying.

                        WILLOW
                       (amazed)
          Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd
          turn Burglekutt into a toad!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Waste magic on revenge?  You have
          much to learn, Willow...

The High Aldwin touches Willow's shoulder and turns
away.  The children are playing tag among the stones.
Willow hugs them.  Kiaya places the baby in the papoose.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, we've never been apart.  I
          miss you already.  Take this.  It
          will bring you luck.

Kiaya, whose head is covered with a kerchief, places a
braided necklace on her own hair around Willow's neck.

                        WILLOW
          You cut your hair, Kiaya?

He kisses her.  The adjusts the papoose and heads off
down the hill.  The others wave goodbye sadly.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Kiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her
arms around Willow, tears in her eyes.  At last they
break apart, and Willow begins the journey.

EXT. WOODS - DAY - MONTAGE

Willow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain,
amazed and frightened.  Animals rustle in the brush and
he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking
burrs off his legs.  He hides from a fierce bear.  The
bear sees him and runs away.  Willow hurries along,
shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's
weight.

EXT. ROAD - EVENING

The baby is fussing hungrily.  Willow impetuously digs
a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to
feed her.  Then he hears something.  Sensing danger, he
clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank.  He
hides under a bridge.

NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS on horseback thunder toward the
bridge, led by the knight SORSHA whose face is hidden
under a black helmet and visor.  In the other direction
Willow sees a LIEUTENANT and two DEATH DOGS.  They all
meet on the bridge.  The hideous soldiers are part hu-
man, part beast.

                      LIEUTENANT
          We've patrolled the hills.  This is
          where they killed the nursemaid.

                        SORSHA
          She must have done something with
          the child.  Widen the search!

One of the Death Dogs is chewing on the Lieutenant's
stirrup.

                      LIEUTENANT
          Get away from there!

The dog panics and gnashes at the Lieutenant's arm,
ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth.  Horses
rear.  The Lieutenant draws his sword lightning-fast.
He slices and kills the Death Dog.  The baby begins to
cry but the death-howl of the beast drowns her out as
it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below.
The soldiers gallop off into the woods.

Willow falls back against the riverbank, shrinking away
from the murdered Death Dog which lies bloody and
twisted in the water.  The terrified baby cries in his
arms.

EXT. ROAD - MORNING

A harmless rabbit springs across Willow's path.  Willow
trips over a stone and almost falls flat on his face.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.  Where am I?  I should
          stick you in a tree and go back
          home.
                    (looks at baby)
          I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.

He hurries along the road, looking over his shoulder.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY - MONTAGE

Various VIEWS of Willow and the baby trekking across
vast hills and valleys.

EXT. HILL - DAY

Gasping with exhaustion, Willow staggers up a sloping
hill and drops to his knees.  His eyes brighten.  In
the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden
scaffolding.

                        WILLOW
          That's it.  The crossroads...

He stands and heads toward it cautiously.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The place is disgusting.  Littered with junk, buzzing
with flies, plagued with rodents.  Willow creeps toward
the scaffolding, covering his face against the stench.
From it hang two cages.  In one is a heap of filthy
rags.  In the other a half-clothed skeleton with one
bony arm dangling out.

Willow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted
road.  He shivers with cold.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

Willow waits uneasily, brushing flies off his face.
The baby fusses and squirms.  He peeks inside her
diaper.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

He looks anxiously up and down the road.  The baby's
crying gets worse.  He begins to change her.

EXT. CROSSROADS - SUNSET

Willow finishes building a fire, lighting it with flint
and blowing it into flame.  The baby lies quietly near-
by in a kind fo porta-crib made of papoose and twigs.
Nightfall teems with spooky noises:  crickets, frogs,
bats, owls and howling wolves.  Then a terrible moan
frightens him.

                        WILLOW
          I really hate this.

Not sure where it came from. he backs away from the
fire, under the rag-filled cage.  Suddenly a hand
reaches down and yanks Willow up off the ground!  Wil-
low screams.  The baby cries.  And WE SEE the haggard
unwashed unshaven face of MADMARTIGAN pressing against
the bars of the cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hey, Peck...get me some water...or
          you'll diiiiie...!

Madmartigan shakes Willow like a rag-doll until Willow
nods his head yes.  Then drops him.  Instantly Willow
races around that fire, picking up everything he owns.

                        WILLOW
          I will--I'll getcha water--getcha
          lotsa water--anything you say--!

Willow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the
bushes.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!

He dives headfirst into the weeds.  Madmartigan rattles
his cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a weasely little Peck!
          Gimme some water!

Willow peeks at him and shakes his head.

                        WILLOW
          I'm not coming near you!

They stare at each other across the fire.  Then, Mad-
martigan puts on a very phony smile.

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Good.  How long will it take?

Madmartigan drops the smile and spits at the fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't make me angry, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          You be careful.  I'm a powerful
          sorcerer.  I could turn you into a
          toad just like that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Miserable Pecks.

Willow throws a rock at him.  It bounces off the cage.
Madmartigan sags down into a heap of rags again.

EXT. CROSSROADs - NIGHT

The wind howls through the distant trees as darkness falls.
Willow rocks the baby and eats some bread.  Madmartigan
watches him hungrily, sighing, forlorn, his eyes asking
for pit.  Willow glances at him.  Finally, he can't
take any more and he puts down the baby and pous some
goat's milk in a cup.  He reaches up on tip-toes and
offers the milk to Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's more like it.

Madmartigan snatches the cup and guzzles the milk,
retching horribly at the taste.  Then he tosses the cup
back.

                        WILLOW
          Do any other daikinis ever come by
          here?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Why.

                        WILLOW
          I have to give this baby to some-
          body.

Madmartigan grabs the bars and raises himself up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm somebody.  Lemme out and I'll
          take care of your baby.

He makes little kissing noises to the baby, trying to
be sweet.  However, his teeth are filthy.

                        WILLOW
          No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a
          reason.  I'll wait for somebody else.

Willow retreats to the fire.  Madmartigan whacks the
cage with the back of his hand.

EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT- LATER

By the blazing fire Willow feeds the baby.  WE HEAR
hoofbeats.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Somebody's coming!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!

Excited, Willow tosses more wood on the fire, picks up
the baby and waits.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No, you fool!  Put it out I say!
          Out!

Torches appear up the road.  A horse-drawn wagon
clatters full-speed toward the fire.  WE HEAR load
drunken voices, far from friendly.  Willow quickly
dives into the bushes.

Four boorish PICTS, with tatooed faces and arms, halt
at the crossroads, yelling and waving their torches.
Madmartigan is hidden under his rags.  For fun the
Picts set fire to the skeleton cage.  Then head for the
other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!

He rises up in the torchlight.  The Picts taunt him.

                         PICT
          Whose fire!

They jab their torches at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!  Help!  Stop!

                         PICT
          Where are they?  Where did they go?

Madmartigan points way up the road.  The Picts ride
away.  As they go, they swing his cage and st fire to
the floor of it.  Madmartigan frantically geats the
flames.  His sleeves ignite.

Willow scrambles out of the bushes and scoops up hand-
fuls of dirt, which he chucks at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                  (spitting out dirt)
          Thanks for your help, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          Are you okay?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          As if you care.  I saved your life,
          Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!
                 (points dramatically)
          You wanna give your baby to them??
          They eat babies!

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.

Madmartigan literally licks his wounds, dragging his
parched tongue along the length of his forearm.  Willow
begins to walk away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The world's gone insane.  Good men
          locked in cages, criminals running
          free.  It doesn't pay to be honest,
          Peck.

Willow stops and turns around.

                        WILLOW
          Don't call me a Peck.  My name is
          Willow.

Madmartigan slinks down like a cat and slowly extends
his derty hand through the bars.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, Willow.  I'm Madmartigan.

Willow stares warily at the hand.  Madmartigan smiles.
Willow quickly shakes his hand and jumps away.  Madmar-
tigan laughs in a harmless, friendly way.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You a woodcutter?

                        WILLOW
          Farmer.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic-
          tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me:
          victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor-
          rupt, rotten world.

A rat lumbers out of the darkness and sniffs toward the
baby in the porta-crib.  Madmartigan suddenly points.
Willow screams and chases the rat away.  Madmartigan
shakes his head as solemnly as an undertaker.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Listen, Willow my friend.  I'm
          really a good man.  Give me my
          freedom, and I'll look after that
          baby for you.  Trust me.

After a moment, Willow takes out his dagger.  He stands
on his toes under a cage, reaches up, and hacks at the
chain lock.  Madmartigan's eyes widen over-eagerly.  he
rubs his hands together and licks his lips.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's it--good--good--like that,
          yes, good, good, the chain--that's
          it, come on--come on--!

Willow suddenly steps away.

                        WILLOW
          Nooo, I don't think I should.

Madmartigan goes berserk.  His arms flail and the whole
cage shakes and swings and he bangs his head on the
roof.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!!  Stupid Peck!  I'll kill ya!
          Let me out!

Willow scrambles back to the fire and scoops up the
baby and rocks her in his arms.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAWN

Madmartigan is making something out of scraps of bark
and cloth.  He smiles sweetly as Willow wakes up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Morning, Willow.

Willow turns his back on him and tends to the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorry I yelled at you.  I've been
          in this cage toooo long.  Can't
          think straight anymore.  Owww...!

Willow looks over.  madmartigan pats his arms in pain.

                        WILLOW
          You all right?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

He holds up his arms in agony.  Willow fishes some
gooey jelly out of his sack and smears a gob of it on a
leaf.  He hands it up to Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          See if this helps.

Madmartigan wipes the goo all over his arms.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Aaaaaahhhh.  Better.  Here, I made
          something for the baby.

He holds out a ratlle and shakes it.  Willow accepts
it.

                        WILLOW
          What's inside?

Madmartigan sticks his finger in his mouth and pries it
open as wide as possible.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A tooth.
                   (Willow reacts)
          I'm strving.  I got no used for it.

Noise in the distance.  up the road Willow sees a
MESSENGER charging on horseback.  He gallops right
past, whipping his horse, almost knocking Willow off
the road.  Then another MESSENGER follows with the same
urgency.  Willow grabs the baby and steps out to stop
him.

                        WILLOW
          Stop!  Wait!

The messenger screams a Willow who jumps aside as he
thunders by.  The two horsemen disappear up the road.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                   (with authority)
          Smells like a battle.

                        WILLOW
          Are you a warrior?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The greatest swordsman that ever
          lived.

Madmartigan slices the air with an imaginary sword.
Willow shakes his head and goes back to the baby.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

WE SEE the empty road.  Willow's head pops INTO FRAME.
He grabs the baby.

                        WILLOW
          What's that?  I hear something!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You hear trouble.

                        WILLOW
          What is it?

The horizon rumbles.  Madmartigan cups his ear.  Cyni-
cally:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A hundred horses...five or six
          wagons...  and about six thousand
          fools.

Two CAVALRY OFFICERS gallop into view, raising a plume
of dust.  Then an enormous ARMY appears:  cavalry, foot
soldiers, assault wagons: shields, swords, spears,
raised banners.

The two officers shout orders over the thunderous
clamor of hoofbeats, marching boots and clanking armor.
Charging back and forth, they shepherd the army through
the crossroads.  Willow holds the baby.  Fighting dust
and noise he tries to get the officer's attention.

                        WILLOW
          Sir?  Sir!

                        OFFICER
          Out of the way!

An officer's horse nearly kicks Willow, who scurries
out of the way.  Huddling with the baby, he notices
AIRK THAUGHBAER, a large, muscular, bearded officer,
clearly in charge.  On horseback, Airk breaks file and
rides up to the other officers.

                         AIRK
          Push 'em harder!  No rest at mid-
          day!  We need to make ten more
          leagues by dark!

Shouting orders, the officers split up, charging to the
front and rear of the army.  Airk watches the army
pass.  Willow desperately scrambles up to him.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  Sir!  I have this baby.  We
          found her in our village.  Will you
          take her...?

Huge Airk looks down from his huge horse.  Little Wil-
low holds up the baby.

                         AIRK
          We're going into battle, little
          one.  Find a woman to take care of
          it.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He thought you were a woman, Airk!

Airk snaps hes head around and his eyes flash.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan!  What did you do this
          time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nothing you wouldn't have done it my
          place!

Airk's horse prances menacingly around Madmartigan's
cage.

                         AIRK
          I always knew you'd end up in a
          crow's cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Least I'm not down there herding
          sheep!

Airk laughs sourly and rocks the cage.

                         AIRK
          You're lucky somebody got to you
          first, Madmartigan!  I'd've killed
          you myself after that stunt at
          Land's End!

He swings that cage and starts to ride away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa
          here.

                         AIRK
                  (really sarcastic)
          Hey, remember?  You don't need my
          help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit
          trap like this?  Come on!  I could
          open it for you, but I wouldn't
          wanna insult you!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your
          war for you.

Airk quickly drops the banter and glares at Madmartigan seri-
ously.

                         AIRK
          You're nothing but trouble, Madmar-
          tigan.  And I got plenty of that.
          Stay in your coffin and rot!

Airk spurs his horse and smashes the cage as he charges
off.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll be around long after you're
          dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get
          outa here I'll cut your head off
          and stick it on a pig-pole!

                        WILLOW
          Friend of yours?

Madmartigan snarls down at Willow as the army continues
to march by.  But then he quickly gets cute again.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, little baby...

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

A ghostly wind hants the barren crossroads.  The road
is pocked with hoofprints and wagon tracks.  Willow
shakes his head at the ashes of his dead fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

Madmartigan squeezes his face between the bars of his
cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nobody's gonna take your baby.
          Know why?  Nobody cares...
                        (beat)
          Except me.
                      (wistfully)
          You wanna go back to your farm.
          You wanna go back to your family.
          I could take care of that baby.
          I'll look after her like she was me
          own.

                        WILLOW
          You don't know anything about ba-
          bies.

Madmartigan kneels and straightens up and points up his
finger astutely.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahhh!  But I know a lot of women
          who do.  Why, if I had somebody in
          my life--a little daughter for
          instance--I'd have a reason to
          live...

He clsps his hands together outside the bars, plead-
ing:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow.  You can't let me die here.
          Not when I wanna help you.

Willow looks at the baby in the porta-crib.  Then looks
up the empty road.  Then looks hard at Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          You gotta promise to feed her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I will.

                        WILLOW
          Fresh goat's milk.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Absolutely!

Willow draws his dagger and begins to hack at the
chain.

                        WILLOW
          And give her a bath everyday, and
          don't let her get cold.  And keep
          her diaper changed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Of course!  I promise!

Willow hacks and pries at the chain until it breaks
open.  The bottom of the cage falls out, dumping Mad-
martigan into a heap of rags and dust.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come to Daddy, little darlin'.
                    (picks her up)
          I think she likes me!

Kneeling on the ground, he plays with the baby.  Willow
quickly hitches the papoose to Madmartigan's back and
hands him supplies.

                        WILLOW
          Here are her diaper rags.  And this
          is her milk bladder.  And when she
          cries--she's either hungry or she's
          tired--rock her on your left
          shoulder.  She likes that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good
          hands.  You haven't made a mistake.

Willow takes the baby and kisses her.

                        WILLOW
          Bye.

He puts her in the papoose.

                        WILLOW
                   (to Madmartigan)
          Please take good care of her.

Madmartigan stands up.  He towers above Willow.  He
pats Willow on the head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You've done a great job.  Now you
          go back to your family and get your
          crop in.

Madmartigan smiles, turns, and marches off down the
road.  Willow sighs with relief, his task accomplished.
He watches Madmartigan and the baby disappear over a
hill.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Swinging his arms and whistling a tune, Willow struts
proudly up a gentle hill.

                        WILLOW
          Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's
          come home!  Welcome back, Willow!
          He deserves a medal:  he's quite
          mystical.  For honor, for bravery,
          for his intuitive powers...
                     (he chuckles)
           ...let's make him Apprentice
          Aldwin.  Better still:  High
          Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf-
          good, High Aldwin of---

The baby cries!  Willow spins around.  Flying towrd
him is an incredible VULTURE with enormous winds.  In
its claws it carries the baby, papoose and all.  It
swoops straight at Willow, buzzing him, and Willow hits
the dirt.  He looks up.  To add to the wonder:  riding
the vulutre is an ELF.

                        WILLOW
          Come back here, you!  That's my
          baby!!

The vulture zooms off into the tall majestic trees of
the forest, with the baby crying.  Shouting and waving
madly, Willow gallops after it.

EXT. THROUGH THE FOREST - DAY

Willow tears after the vulture which vanishes in the
towering trees.  As the path narrows, something whis-
tlse past his ear.  Finger-length arrows rain down on
him from every direction, peppering the surrounding
trees.  Some even hit Willow.  He plucks them out as he
races along.

He comes to a fork in the path:  Decision!  He starts
down one way, then slams on the brakes.  He sees ropes
and nets.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no, it's a trap!

He hurries back to the fork and takes the safer route--

                        WILLOW
          Oh noooooo!!

--and gets swallowed by a deadly pit.

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - UNDERGROUND

Willow wakes up as a pail of water hits him in the
face.  His feet and wrists are being bound.  Several
little ELVES are gawking and laughing at him.  They
wear samurai-type outfits and angry little haircuts.

                        WILLOW
                      (focusing)
          Where am I?  Where's the baby?

FRANJEAN, the Elfin king, struts forward arrogantly.
He speaks a haughty, nasal accent resembling French:

                       FRANJEAN
          I am Franjean, king of the world.

Willow struggles against the ropes that bind him.

                        WILLOW
          That baby's my responsibility!

Outraged, Franjean smacks Willow's nose with the
back of his hand.

                       FRANJEAN
          I don't care.  We paid for her.  Go
          back to sleep, monsieur...

As he leaves, Franjean nods to an intense-looking ARCH-
ER elf heavily armed with arrows and a spear.  The
archer dips his spear in a bowl of purple liquid.  He
pricks Willow's arm.

                        WILLOW
          Yeow!
                (he loses consciousness)
          Madmartigan...I never should've
          trusted you...

FADE TO BLACK

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - DAWN

Willow's eyes open.  A wild little face is looking at
him.  A wild little person is standing on his chest.

                         TEEMO
          Tongue.

Too groggy to argue, Willow sticks out his tongue.
TEEMO the brownie crushes a brittle leaf and tosses the
dust into Willow's mouth.  Smacking his lips, Willow
comes around.  He sees, down between his legs, another
brownie named ROOL cutting the ropes.

                        WILLOW
          Who are you?

                         ROOL
          Quiet, you fool!

                         TEEMO
                       (formal)
          We are emissaries of her majesty,
          Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of
          Coshairm.

                        WILLOW
          Queen Cherlindrea?

                         TEEMO
          She requests the presence of your-
          self and the young princess.

                        WILLOW
          Who??

                         TEEMO
          You're the guardian, aren't you?

                         ROOL
          Quit yakking, Teemo.  We gotta get
          outa here!

Willow rolls onto his knees, stands up and bumps his
head on the ceiling.  The fuzzy-headed brownies creak
open the door and becon Willow to follow.  He squeezes
through.

INT. ELFIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND

Like a rabbit warren, compartments branch off the main
tunnel.  Willow scrunches along behind the tip-toeing
brownies.  They hear the baby crying.  They peek
through the door.

Inside a cluttered room they see thebaby crying miser-
ably.  Her tears are being carried to a high level in
tiny buckets on a mechanized wheel, operated by FOUR
ELVES.

                         TEEMO
          Elves!  They're always tormenting
          babies.  They make them cry and
          take their tears.

                         ROOL
          Somebody has to do it.

                        WILLOW
          Why??

                         ROOL
          How else they gonna make dew drops?

The baby shrieks.

                        WILLOW
          I'm getting her out of there!

                         TEEMO
          No!  You let us handle this.  Come
          along, Rool!

Teemo ridiculously pushes Willow away from the door.
With a macho swagger he adjusts his dagger belt, and he
and Rool open the door.

INT. ELFIN TEAR FACTORY

They enter like gunslingers in a saloon.  The four
elves, who are twice their size, turn and face them.
Teemo draws his small dagger.  With confidence he
smiles at Rool.

                         TEEMO
          Watch this.  Right between the
          eyes.

                         ROOL
                    (to the elves)
          He never misses.

Artfully Teemo poises the dagger above his head.  With
all his might he throws.  His dagger flip-flops through
the air and lands at the elves' feet, plink-plunk.

                         TEEMO
          Ooops.  Was that right?  That
          wasn't right.

Suddenly the entire wall implodes.  The elves scream
and panic as Willow comes crashing in like King Kong.
He grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm.

EXT. ELF HOLE - DAY

The brownies scamper out of a hole in the ground where
the elves keep their vultures corralled.

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Hyah!  Hyah!  Git!

They untie th evulture and send them flapping away in
the forest as Willow wiggles out of the elf hole with
the baby.  They run for their lives.

EXT. FOREST - CHASE - DAY

Rool and teemo tear along at incredible speed, Willow
barely keeping up with them.  Little elf arrows shower
the forest as the angry elves chase after them, whoop-
ing and screaming.

EXT. DEEP GORGE - DAY

They skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion.
The elves are shrieking toward them. The only chance
of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge.
The brownies scamper out.  Willow looks down and reels
with vertigo.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go out there with the baby!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
                  (frantically point)
          Elves!!

The elf army pours out of the forest.  Willow holds his
breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of
the tree.  Arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a
drunken tightrope walker toward the middle.  The brown-
ies wait for him.

                        WILLOW
          Ohhh, I hate this.

                         TEEMO
          Take your time.  Don't worry about
          the elves.  They won't come out
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Why not?

                         ROOL
          Because of the trolls.

                        WILLOW
          Trolls?

The brownies console Willow with unworried laughter.

                         TEEMO
          Relax.  They only come out at
          night.

An ugly TROLL snarls up behind Willow.  They all scream
and race for the other side.  Another TROLL pops up to
meet them.  The trolls slink along like possums.  The
brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk.

The elves, meanwhile, flint-start a fire at their end
of the tree.  One troll claws at the brownies inside
the trunk while the other chases Willow across gangling
branches.  Then the baby falls out of the papoose!  She
tumbles and catches on a low branch and Willow races
the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into
the gorge.

One troll catches Rool but can't then get his claw out
of the trunk.  The brownies finally excape.  The tree
burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots.
A troll howls as he falls to his death.  The other
scrambles up the tree and grabs Willow's foot.
Willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll.

Flames lick at Willow as he at last hauls himself to
safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree
goes crashing down in the gorge.

                        WILLOW
          This is not going well.

                         TEEMO
          Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know
          what to do.

Willow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into
the forest.  Hobbling slightly on his bootless foot.

EXT. MAJESTIC FOREST - SUNSET

Fading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful
trees as Willow and the brownies trek into the magical
Fairy Kingdom.  Elora Danan falls into a peaceful
sleep.

EXT. FAIRY KINGDOM - NIGHT

Willow comes to a halt.  His mouth drops open.  The
forest is a luminous Milky Way of dancing, flying
FAIRIES, like fireflies.  The brownies tug at his
pant-legs and whisper.

                         TEEMO
          Come on.  This is a privilege.  No-
          body ever gets called before Her
          Majesty.

Wonder-struck, Willow walks into a clearing where
colorful night-flowers bloom.  He lowers himself onto
an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand.  Other
BROWNIES stand watching, like courtiers.  The tiny
fairies fly up to Willow's face and giggle:  they look
like five-year-old girls, full of mischief and fun.

Suddenly a strange LIGHT begins to throb behind the
trees, peircing the forest with helter-skelter beams.
Willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings
his eyes.

                         ROOL
          Stand up!  It's the queen!

CHERLINDREA, the Fairy Queen, materializes out of frag-
ments of moving light, diaphanous, sylph-like, beauti-
ful.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Willow Ufgood.

                        WILLOW
                       (blinded)
          Yes...?

                      CHERLINDREA
          I hope you are comfortable here,
          inside my kingdom...

Willow says nothing, still batling the bright light.

                         TEEMO
          Talk!  Say something!

                        WILLOW
          I can't see anything--she's too
          bright!

                      CHERLINDREA
          I'm sorry...

The light diminishes, enabling Willow to see the queen.
She is a beautiful vision, with flowing hair and lumi-
nous eyes.  Her magical presence both stuns and
impresses Willow.  She turns to the brownies.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Broke-heart of nightingale for our
          honored guest.

All the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into
action, bustling about, going to work, some even trip-
ping over one another.  They bring Willow a drink in a
delicate cup-shaped leaf, and he takes a sip.

The queen dissolves and reappears near Willow.  She le-
ans down and opens the baby's swaddling and looks at
the mark on the baby's arm.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy
          has come true.

The tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh
with respect and amazement.  Cherlindrea seems to levi-
tate the baby out of Willow's arms, floating her magi-
cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks.  The
brownies and fairies crowd around, with great rever-
ence.

                        WILLOW
          You mean, you know who this baby
          belongs to?

                      CHERLINDREA
          She belongs to all of us.  She is
          the future queen and ruler of all
          kingdoms on earth.

Willow starts to get up.

                        WILLOW
          What a relief.  Now I can go home.

The queen fragments and reappears right in front of
Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          No, Willow.  Your journey has just
          begun.  It has been foretold that
          this child shall bring about the
          downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose
          evil powers have darkened our
          world.  Upon you depends this
          princess's life.

                        WILLOW
          Me?

The Fairy Queen flashes and vanishes.  Willow lowers
himself back down again.  She reappears behind him.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are the guardian, Willow.  You
          must take her to Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          What is Tir Asleen?

Willow can't keep track of her.  She keeps changing her
shape.  The brownies and fairies snicker at Willow's
confusion.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is a distant castle, where a
          great king and queen will look
          after Elora Danan and keep her safe
          until she is old enough to rule.

She is gone again.  Willow looks everywhere, frusturated
by these riddles and mysteries.

                        WILLOW
          Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is
          it?

She reappears again.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The way has been lost in time. But
          there is one person, a druid sor-
          ceress, who might guide you there.
          She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda
          many years ago.  Her name is Fin
          Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You need a warrior for this job.
          I'm nobody.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are very important, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          No I'm not.  Have you really looked
          at me?
                  (jumps to his feet)
          I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

From down at his feet, Rool and Teemo stare up, insult-
ed.

                        WILLOW
                     (continuing)
          Why can't you do it?  You have mag-
          ical powers.

                      CHERLINDREA
          My prsence cannot extend beyond
          this forest.  But I can give you
          these...

Cherlindrea drops three small objects in Willow's hand.

                      CHERLINDREA
          They will protect you.  Use them
          wisely.

Willow looks at them for quite a while.

                        WILLOW
          They look like acorns.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Anything you hurl them at will turn
          to stone.

Willow looks closely at the acorns, then up at the
queen.

                        WILLOW
          They're magic?  Are you serious?

The forest light grows brighter.  The queen looms over
Willow and he again has to shield himself from the
brightness.

                      CHERLINDREA
                       (sternly)
          I am very serious, Willow.  There
          is no time to lose.

Now she intensifies her light so that Willow backs
away, completely covering his face.

                        WILLOW
          But I've got a family to think
          about!  They need me!

The queen swirls around him like a solar wind, blowing
the forest trees, scaring even the brownies.  And then
all of a sudden:  silence.  And total darkness.  ALL WE
SEE, in dim moonlight, is Willow's face, peeking out
from between his fingers.

                        WILLOW
          Hello...?

The queen's voice echoes the forest.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Bavmord'a powers are growing like
          an evil plague.  Soon she will con-
          trol the lives of you children,
          your wife, your village...everyone.

Very gradually and beautifully the firey fairies begin
to flicker, restoring light to the forest.  More light
genlty brightens, bathing the woods, and the Fairy
Queen reappears.  She is holding Elora Danan in her
arms.  The brownies creep out from behind the trees.
All eyes are upon Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The choice is yours.

Willow takes the baby and looks at her for a moment.
He struggles with his conscience.  The fairies and
brownies wait in anticipation.  At last Willow looks up
at them, resolved and determined.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do
          it!

The fairy kingdom sends up a great cheer and applause.
Fairies giggle playfully around Willow's face, and
brownies hug his ankles.

                        WILLOW
          But I only have one shoe.

EXT. WOODED HILL - DAY

WE SEE Willow's feet as he walks along.  He has himself
a brand-new shoe.

Spirits high, he treks in the sunshine, papoose
strapped to his back.  Teemo rides in his pocket, while
Rool straddles the papoose, tickling the giggling baby.

                        WILLOW
          Wait till I tell my children.
          Stuff like this never happens in my
          village.

He digs a magic acorn out of his pocket and tosses it
high in the air.  The brownies gasp.

                         TEEMO
          Hey, careful there!

                        WILLOW
          How do these work I wonder?  I got-
          ta save one to show the High
          Aldwin.

                         ROOL
          Look!  Death below!

Rool points through the trees.  Willow hurries down the
hill to the tree-line.  In the valley below, 200 NOCK-
MAAR SOLDIERS and CALVALRYMEN battle a hundred ragtag
REBEL TROOPS.  From this sage position high on the
hillside, Willow watches in disgust.  Weapons clash and
men fall to their deaths.

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis...

They hear a CLANK behind them.  Willow slowly turns
around.  There is movement in the trees.  The hillside
woods are full of Nockmaar HORSEMEN moving right up next to him.

In the valley, the oupowered rebels are being forced
up the hill toward them.  Willow is suddenly standing
under several large horses and black-armored minions.
He is frozen in fear.

                       HORSEMEN
          Hyaaaaahh!!

Swords flash and the horseman charge!  The brownies
jump and run for their lives.  Willow stumbles and
spins as horse after horse thunders past him, nearly
trampling him and the baby to death.

The Nockmaar reinforcements descend upon the remaining
rebels and crush them.  Willow falls and quickly digs
the baby out of the papoose.  She is shrieking in ter-
ror.  He holds her tight and runs along the tree-line,
following the brownies, while the bloody battle rages
below.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't
          cry, Elora.  Things can't get any
          worse than this...

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Bleak rain dribbles down Willow's miserable face.  Pro-
tecting the baby, he hurries toward a tavern.  The bot-
tom of the building is an open stable with several
horses.  Two burly IRON-WORKERS clank a red-hot wagon
rim, fixing a nearby wagon hitched to a horse.

It's a rough place.  Rool and Teemo peek out of
Willow's pockets.  Upstairs PEOPLE drink and shout.

                         TEEMO
          I'm not going in there.

                         ROOL
          Me neither!

                        WILLOW
          Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What
          could possibly happen?

Suddenly there's a CRASH up above and two PICTS burst
through a balcony and land in the mud, fighting vi-
ciously.  Rool and Teemo duck inside Willow's pockets.
Willow steps around the Picts, dashes through the
stable and up the stairs.

INT. TAVERN - MAIN ROOM - DAY

The place is packed with tattooed PICTS, nomadic FAMI-
LIES, MOTHERS wit BABIES, THIEVES and CUTTHROATS.
Willow enters with the crying baby.

                        WILLOW
          Could you spare some milk for this
          poor hungry baby?

Everyone looks up.  Mopping a table is an ugly BARMAID
as big as a wrestler.

                        BARMAID
          Get outa here, Peck!

                        PATRONS
          A Peck!  Get him out!  Beat it,
          Peck!

They hurl stuff at him and threaten him with their
weapons.  Willow runs along the wall and takes cover
under some stairs.  He pulls open his pocket and peers
down inside.

                        WILLOW
          I could use your help, boys.

Instantly his pocket whips shut and trembles.  Willow
cautiously looks out under the stairs.  He sees a pail
of milk very near some ROUGHNECKS.  Willow puts his
little finger in the baby's mouth, silencing her.  He
creeps out.  And bravely reaches for the milk.

                     TEEMO'S VOICE
          Willow?

Willow slaps his pocket.  Then stretches his arm out
very, very slowly.  And gets the pail and zips back
under the stairs.

                        WILLOW
          This is not fun.

He soaks a rag with milk and feeds the baby.  Catching
his breath, he backs up and leans agains a woodplank
wall.

                        WILLOW
          Woah!

The plank gives way and Willow falls through the wall.

INT. TAVERN - DAY

Willow somersaults into a bedroom near an unmade bed.
Peeking up he sees two women getting dressed in a pan-
ic.  One is a plump-chested WENCH with a pretty face.

                         WENCH
          Hurry!  Hurry!

Very frightened, she looks out the window.  The other
woman, who wears a kerchief over her hair, packs thick
powder and make-up paint on her face.

                   THE OTHER WOMAN
                  (in a gruff voice)
          How do I look?

It's Madmartigan!  Willow pops up like a jack-in-the-
box.

                        WILLOW
          You!!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Where the hell did you come from?

Willow strides toward Madmartigan, holding the baby
like a machine gun.

                        WILLOW
          I trusted you...

The brownies peek out.

                         ROOL
          Who's he?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're crawling with rodents.

The bedroom door explodes open.  In storms a big, mean,
half-drunk raging lug named LLUG.

                         LLUG
          Where is he!!

Madmartigan wraps a muffler around his throat.  The
wench innocently curtsies.

                         WENCH
          There's nobody here except me and
          my, um, cousin.

Llug knocks his wife out of the way and glares susi-
ciously at Madmartigan, who bats his heavily made-up
eyelashes.  He speaks in a high feminine voice.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          How do you do.

Llug sniffs at Madmartigan then fixes his gaze on
Madmartigan's flat chest.  He goes to squeeze him
there, but Madmartigan ducks out of the way and
snatches the baby from Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Give me that baby!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          These Pecks make terrible nurse-
          maids.

                        WILLOW
          Nursemaid?!

Willow angrily jumps up and down, swiping at the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          They get too excited.

With a swing of the hip, Madmartigan butts Willow aside
and maternally puts the baby against his chest.  Llug
houd-dogs him around the room, finally cornering him
and staaring lecherously into his eyes.

                         LLUG
          Wanna breeeeeeed?


Madmartigan protects himself by holding the baby up in
front of his face.  Then he smells the baby.  He winces
and groans.

                        WILLOW
                   (mischievously)
          Time to change her diaper.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time to leave.

Madmartigan throws open the door and dashes out.  But
he doesn't get very far.  Several NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS
push him back in.  Then they grab madmartigan and Wil-
low, and Llug and his wife, and haul them all outside.

INT. TAVERN - HALLWAY - DAY

Madmartigan is slammed against a wall.  The Willow.
Then Llug and his wife.  In the b.g. Nockmaar troops
are rousting the tavern, taking babies away from
frightened mothers and inspecting them.

Heavy bootsteps thud toward them.  Willow looks out and
recognizes Sorsha, the black-helmeted knight from the
bridge.

                        SORSHA
          You!  Are you the mother of that
          child?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No.
           (looks at Llug; in a high voice)
          I mean yes.

Sorsha strides over to Madmartigan, her sword drawn.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

                        WILLOW
          No!  You can't!

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Why not?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Willow)
          Why not?

                        WILLOW
          Because she's sick.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Sorsha)
          Because she's sick.

                        SORSHA
          Give it to me!

Sorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike.
She grabs for the baby.  Instinctively, Madmartigan el-
bows her away, whacking her hard and knocking her off-
balance against a nearby bench.  The soldiers tense up,
pointing their swords and spears.

Sorsha regains her balance.  She rips off her black
helmet.  Long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders.
She is a young woman, and Madmartigan's eyes pop open.
He does his best to keep up his femal facade.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          Gawd...you're...beautiful...

                        SORSHA
          You're not a woman.

Sorsha comes right up to Madmartigan, squinting into
his eyes.  The she rips away his kerchief and muffler.

                         LLUG
          Not a woman??!!

All hell breaks loose.  Llug charges for Madmartigan's
throat.  Madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and
dashes right out the window.  Llug bulldozes Sorsha and
her Lieutenant, and the tavern patrons take advantage
of the chaos and stampede for the stairs.  Willow dives
out the window after Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          After them!!

She grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who
clatter toward the stairs, flinging people out of their
way.

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Madmartigna jumps off the upstairs balcony and lands in
the wagon below.  The two iron-workers look up with
concern.  Then they react with surprise as Madmartigan
rips away his disguise.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Wait!

Up above, Willow charges along the balcony.  Madmarti-
gan juggles the baby and whips the reins.  The wagon
pulls away, iron-workers scrambling after it.  Willow
flings himself off the balcony.  The brownies tumble
out of his pocket.  They all land in the back of the
wagon as it takes off.

It has stopped raining.  In the stable under the
tavern, horses smash together and people fall in the
mud, and the Nockmaar soldiers get tangled up in the
traffic jam.

EXT. ROAD - CHASE - DAY

As Madmartigan lashes the horse, Willow crawls up to
hum and takes the baby.

                        WILLOW
          We could've been killed, Madmarti-
          gan!

In the back, the brownies boucne all over the place
amid wooden kegs and other objects.  When they finally
get their balane they look back in alarm.

Chasing them are two Nockmaar HORSEMEN plus a DEATH DOG
and a war chariot.

Willow ducks low and peeks out, protectively hugging
the baby.  The wagon bounces and flies along, but the
minions are quickly gaining.  Rool and Teemo spring
into action.  They struggle with all their might and
manage to kck small wooden kegs off the back of the
wagon.

The kegs bounce onto the road, and the minions lose
some ground trying to avoid them.  But soon the horse-
men flank the wagon.  One leaps off his galloping horse
and climbs on board.  The other draws an arrow and gets
ready to fire.

Madmartigan is about to be shot between the eyes.  He
quickly rolls into the back.  The archer firse! and
hits the other minion in the chest.  Madmartigna snaps
a wooden stake off the wagon side and smashes
the wounded minion off the wagon:  he crashes onto the
road.

Willow harnesses the papoose to his chest and grabs the
reins.  At the same time the minion archer leaps
aboard.  He and Madmartigan fight in the back.

                        WILLOW
          Heeyah!  Heeyah!

Then there's a terrible howl right beside Willow.  The
Death Dog is leaping alongside the wagon, gnashing and
trying to board.  Willow yanks the reins and swerves
the wagon into the dog, which yelps furiously.  In the
back, Madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the
swerving jolt.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no!

Up ahead Willow sees an exposed tree root in the road.
The wagon is headed straight for it!  The wheel hits
the root hard and Willow is dumped onto the wagon floor
and very nearly goes overboard.

In the back, Madmartigan and the minion keep fighting
as the wagon clatter along out of control.  The Death
Dog catches up again and this time spring aboard.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

The dog snaps at the baby.  Willow scurries under the
wagon seat.  The dog stands up on its hind feet.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

It gets ready to attack.  But WHACK! an overhanging
tree branch hits it and Willow looks up from under the
seat and sees the mangled dog twitching and dangling
from the tree, rapidly disappearing in the distance.

In the back, meanwhile, the minion draws a knife.  Mad-
martigan ducks out of his way, hanging onto a post at
the edge of the tailgate.  The minion comes after him.

Suddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off.
The jolt throws the minion off balance.  Madmartigan
kicks him.  The minion hurtles off the taligate but
holds on, dragged by the wagon.

Rool and Teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large
wooden keg.  Together they yank it.  Untying the keg and
sending it tumbling off the back.  The minion looks up
in horror as the heavy keg crushes him.

But the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along
with one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins
and looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them
is the war chariot!

The Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the
reins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to
twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his
head.

Madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post.
The chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK!
It lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the
chariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up
each other.  At last Madmartigan lets go of the post
and the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the
airl, over a cliff to his death.

                        WILLOW
          Woah...woah...!

Willow tries to stop the horse.  But the wheel col-
lapses and he is thrown off into a ditch.  The brownies
dive overboard.  Madmartigan jumps off and delibrerately
sends the wagon up the road.  He scrambles down into
the ditch and lies flat beside Willow.

Suddenly, hoofbeats thunder and Sorsha and the rest of
her troops gallop past.  Lying flat, Madmartigna raises
his head and sees Sorsha's long flowing red hair.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That girl is a vision.

As soon as the troops are gone, Willow jumps up.

                        WILLOW
          Where's the baby??

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I thought you had her!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Willow!!

The brownies are waving and gesturing madly, pointing
at a heap of boards and rubble that broke off the
wagon.  Willow and Madmartigan race over and start dig-
ging, flinging debris aside.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now Willow, I know you're gonna
          blame me for this but it wasn't my
          fault...!

                        WILLOW
          Elora Danan!

Willow sees the battered, lifeless papoose.  He grabs
it and rips it open.  Madmartigan kneels in the dirt
remorsefully.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          When I left the crossroads, I got
          ambushed by an elf!

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  You saved her life!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I did?

Willow holds up the baby.  She giggles and smiles.
Madmartigan switches gears, boasting:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I mean, of course I saved her life.
          She's almost my daughter, isn't
          she?

Willow bundles the baby and looks up the road.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here before they
          come back.

They hurry off into the darkening woods.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

A campfire blazes.  Willow tends the baby while the
brownies point up at the stars.

                         TEEMO
          Northeast is that way.  We've come
          west and south.  I think.

Madmartigan dumps a big log on the fire, spraying the
brownies with sparks.

                         ROOL
          Watch it!  You're gonna set us on 
          fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not a bad idea.

Madmartigan terrorizes them with a flaming stick.  Then
he squats beside Willow and the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So you're on your way to Tir
          Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you
          this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't
          exist.

                        WILLOW
          Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The Fairy Queen?  And the baby
          here's a princess?  And these two
          rodents are your guides?

He shakes his head sceptically, stretches out and puts
his feet up on a log.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah well...in the morning I think
          I'll be on my way.

He laughs sarcastically.  Willow sets down the baby.  He
takes off Kiaya's necklace and fingers it sadly.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, I need your help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My help?  A great magician like
          you?  You don't need any help.

Willow stares at him angrily.

                        WILLOW
          But you're a great swordsman!

He jumps and starts pacing around the fire.  Rool and
Teemo dive for cover.

                        WILLOW
                      (explodes)
          You're not a warrior, Madmartigan!
          A warrior wouldn't lie there and do
          nothing!

He kicks Madmartigan's boot and knocks his feet off the
log.

                        WILLOW
          We're in trouble!  You've seen the
          big army that's after us!  You're a
          fake!  You're a bum!  You're a--
          you're a coward!!

He picks up a rock and pitches it wildly at the fire,
sending up a shower of sparks.  Madmartigan eyes him
with concern.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What's with you, Peck?

Willow lets it all pour out.  He begins to cry.

                        WILLOW
          I miss my wife!  I miss my chil-
          dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing
          up so fast, he even helps me on the
          farm now!  And little Mims!  If you
          ever saw her sweet little face
          you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd
          *melt*!
                      (sniffles)
          Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't
          know anything about love.  You
          don't know anything about any-
          thing...

Willow sits on the ground, exhausted.  Madmartigan
picks up the baby and sits with her in his lap.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I was in love once, Willow.  She
          had a hold on my heart.  I could
          barely function.
                       (a pause)
          I *was* a great swordsman!  I was
          knighted!  I could have been king!

                        WILLOW
          You?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed
          me.  She robbed me of my dream.

Madmartigan gently rocks the baby and stares at the
fire.  Willow watches him curiously.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll never fall in love again...

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

Willow wakes up and looks around.  The baby is gone.
He panics.  He scrambles a short distance through
some bushes.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Madmartigan!

They've been camped all night near the shore of a LAKE.
Willow finds Madmartigan and the baby bathing happily
in the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Relax, Willow.  We're having fun.

The baby squeals with delight as Madmartigan twirls her
around.  He lifts her yp and carries her to Willow on
the shore.  The brownies crawl thorugh the bushes.
Rool points out at the lake.

                         ROOL
          That's it!  The sorceress lives
          there!

In the middle of the lake is an island with a single
tree.

                         TEEMO
          Are you sure?

                         ROOL
                       (excited)
          Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on
          that island!

Madmartigan lets out a sarcastic, sceptical laugh.
Teemo scratches his head and squints out at the island.

                         TEEMO
          That tree dosn't look like gold to
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gold!!

Madmartigan rubs his chin with sudden interest.

                         TEEMO
          Its branches are supposed to be
          made of gold, solid gold.

                        WILLOW
          How are we going to get out there?

Madmartigan is suddenly pacing and thinking.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll find a way, Willow.  Look
          over there--that looks like a
          village--maybe they've got a boat.
          Come on, what are you waiting for?

Madmartigan runs along the shore toward a small village
in the distance.

EXT. DESERTED FISHING VILLAGE - DAY

Half a dozen decrepit huts sit rotting on the edge of
the lake.  There are no inhabitants, just a lot of dis-
carded junk, including a few battered fishing boats.
But Madmartigan, keeping one eye on the gold tree out
on the island, is undaunted.  He rummages through the
debris, hauling out a fishing boat and shouldering it
toward the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Give me a hand here, Peck!

Willow hoists the baby into the papoose and helps Mad-
martigan.

                          BOY
          What are you doing?

They turn around.  A golden-haired BOY is standing
waist-deep in th elake.  Madmartigan is instantly wary
of him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          It's nothing to do with you.

But the boy looks innocent and harmless, and Willow ap-
proaches him.

                        WILLOW
          We need to get out to that island.

                          BOY
          The island is cursed.

Madmartigan scoffs at this nonsense, grunting and push-
ing the boat into the water.

                        WILLOW
          We've traveled a long way.  We're
          looking for Fin Raziel.

                         TEEMO
          The sorceress.

                          BOY
          She's there.  But you can't go
          there.  The island is cursed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (no patience)
          Yeah?  Who cursed it?

                          BOY
          Queen Bavmorda.  Her powers govern
          the elements.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahh, he's trying to protect the
          gold.  Come on, Willow.  Jump in.

Madmartigan climbs into the boat and grabs an oar,
eager to go.  Willow looks down at the brownies for
help.

                        WILLOW
          What would the Fairy Queen say?

                         ROOL
          She's not here.

                         TEEMO
                       (to Rool)
          Obviously.

                        WILLOW
          Without Raziel we'll never find Tir
          Asleen.
                      (decision)
          We'd better go.

Willow marches to the boat.  Calmly accepting their
choice, the golden-haired boy dives into the lake and
disappears.  Willow and the brownies board the boat,
and Madmartigan poles them away from the shore.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

They row across the placid lake toward the island.

EXT. ISLAND - DAY

They climb onto the rocky shore.  Flies buzz and swarm
around them, and creepy bugs crawl around their feet.
Broken skeletons litter the shore.  Handing the baby
back and forth, Willow and Madmartigan claw their way
up to the large tree.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Hello?  Fin Raziel?

Madmartigan greedily reaches up to touch a branch.

                        RAZIEL
          Get away!  Get away!

A littel animal scurries down the tree and hisses vi-
ciously at Madmartigan, chattering its teeth.

                        RAZIEL
          You'll die!  You'll die!

RAZIEL scampers over to Willow.  Her voice screeches
like a parrot.  She looks like an otter with a bush
tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Who are you!  Who are you!

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to
          find Fin Raziel.

She springs right onto Willow's chest.

                        RAZIEL
          That's me!  Raziel!  Raziel!

Willow looks down at the browines questioninghly.

                        WILLOW
          This can't be right.  This isn't a
          sorceress.  This is some kind of
          animal.

                         TEEMO
          Queen Bavmorda transformed her.

                        RAZIEL
          What do you want!

                        WILLOW
          We need your help.  To take this
          baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin-
          cess.

Still sceptical, Willow shows Raziel the baby's mark.
Raziel shoots up onto a branch and frantically flicks
her tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Elora Danan!

Madmartigan snaps a branch off the tree.  A flock of
birds suddenly screech and fly away.  His eyes bulge.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Rool!  Teemo!  You were right!
          This whole tree is made of gold!!

He strips away the bark, revealing a vein of gold.

                        RAZIEL
          Fools!  You should never have come
          to this place!  We're all going to
          die!

The wind begins to blow and the sky darkens.  Raziel
zips over to Willow and whispers intensely.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got to get off this island
          right now.  Hurry!  The boat!  It's
          our only chance!

The wind howls.  they hurry down to the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!

Madmartigan is greedily breaking branches off the tree.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Wait!  Gold!  Gold!

Waves lash at the boat as they jump aboard.  Madmarti-
gan loads up with branches.  As they push off, he
scrambles down the rocks.  Just in time he jumps into
the boat as the storm swirls it out into the frothy
lake.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Willow clutches the baby as the raging storm pitches
the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Help, Madmartigan!  The oar!

Madmartigan hangs onto his gold, but pices of it drop
and topple overboard.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My gold!

Suddenly a hand appears on the stern.  The water boy
climbs in.

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

                        WILLOW
          No!

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

Madmartigna hesitates but then smashes the boy back
into the lake.  The boy surfaces like a dolphin.  His
shape begins to change, becoming fish-like, diving and
vanishing.

Then:  he attacks the boat!  He is now a ferocious
shark-like monster.  He chomps the boat and the gold
branches slide into the water.  Madmartigan bashes the
monster with the oar, then grabs an anchor.  The mon-
ster attacks again and Madmartigan jabs its gill with
the anchor.

The monster sinks into the lake.  They all sigh with
relief.  Madmartigan shrugs proudly.  Suddenly the an-
chor line unravels, tangling Madmartigan's legs in
fishing nets and yanking him overboard.

Underwater, Madmartigan swirls behind the monster.  He
pulls himself along the anchor line and finally cuts
himself free with his dagger.

He surfaces and madly swims toward the pitching boat.
Willow reaches out to him.  The monster surfaces and
circles the boat.  Then it attacks Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!  Help!!  Willow!!!

Willow digs out a magic acorn.  But he drops it!  He
fumbles in the leaking boat and finally finds it.  The
monster opens its jaws and goes to devour Madmartigan.
Willow throws the acorn.

The monster miraculously turns to stone.  Madmartigan
grabs the boat and watches in amazement as the monster
sinks.  Willow hauls him into the boat.

EXT. LAKESHORE - DAY

The storm begins to die down as they jump to shore, ex-
hausted.  Madmartigan wears nothing now but a ragged
loincloth.  He falls to his knees, coughing and spit-
ting.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...you...you got...magic...!
          Wait...we could team up...!

He pulls himself up and follows Willow.  Suddenly they
all stop.  Sorsha and her men come out of the woods.

                        RAZIEL
          Flee!  Flee!

The brownies scurry into a hole.  Raziel makes a dash
for it but a soldier skewers her tail with his spear,
dangling her in front of Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Raziel.  Did you think my mother
          would allow you to escape?

Sorsha gestures, and the soldier takes Raziel away.
The lieutenant wrestles the baby away from Willow.  He
gives her to Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          This is what we're looking for.  It
          bears the markings.

Willow panics.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  If there's
          one thing I'm good at, it's charm-
          ing a woman...

He swaggers forward.  Sorsha turns and looks at him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So.  Couldn't live without me, huh?

Sorsha looks up and down at his naked body.

                        SORSHA
          Lose your skirt?  How embarassing.

Madmartigan looks down and adjusts his loincloth.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Still got what counts.

A pause as he smiles at her.

                        SORSHA
          Not for long.

She raises her fist and zap:  Madmartigan is instantly
surrounded by spears and swords.

                        SORSHA
          We'll join the column.  Bring them
          with us.

Madmartigan and Willow are roughly taken away.  Sorsha
and her troops mount horses and ride off.  Rool and
Teemo crawl lup from under a rock.

                         TEEMO
          We gotta follow them.

                         ROOL
          Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any-
          way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's
          go home.

Rool walks off and Teemo grabs him, yanks him back.

                         TEEMO
          Get back here, Rool!

                         ROOL
          Ouch!  Let go of me!

Rool throws a punch, and the brownies somersault into
the bushes fighting each other.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Sorsha and her men now ride with a caravan of fifty
NOCKMAAR TROOPS.  Chained by their necks.  Willow and
Madmartigan walk behind a wagon.  Raziel sits trapped
in a cage on the back of the wagon.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go on...

Willow loses strength, falls and is dragged.  Madmarti-
gan picks him up and carries him on his shoulders.
Sorsha sees this.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, why don't you use your mag-
          ic to get us out of here?

                        RAZIEL
          He's no magician.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He turned that monster into stone!

Raziel peers sternly at Willow, who is eye-level with
her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Did *you* give that acorn its power?

                        WILLOW
          No.

                        RAZIEL
          A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool
          can use it.

Madmartigan shakes his head at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Then you get us out of here.

                        RAZIEL
          I will!  But I need help!

                        WILLOW
          I'll help you...!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I won't.

                        RAZIEL
          You must learn magic.

                        WILLOW
          That's all I ever wanted!

                        RAZIEL
          Then I will teach you.

Sorsha rides up from the rear of the caravan, carrying
the baby, who is crying.  Madmartigan, with Willow
still on his shoulders, straightens up and flirts with
her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nice horse...nice hair...real nice
          hair...I'd say you've got the most
          beautiful hair I've ever--

She flashes her eyes at him.

                        SORSHA
          Wolff wants to boil you in oil.

She nods toward her Lieutenant, who snarls viciously.

                        SORSHA
          Don't tempt me.

She turns away.  The baby squirms and cries.

                        WILLOW
          If you rest the baby on your
          shoulder, she'll stop crying.

                        SORSHA
          Shut up.

Sorsha rides along.  She shifts the baby to her other
shoulder, and she instantly stops crying.  Sorsha
throws a look at Willow.  Madmartigan takes a long deep
breath.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.

                        SORSHA
                    (angry threat)
          My step-father's going to tear you
          apart.

Madmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm torn apart already.  I mean it!
          Under all that armor is a 
          beautiful--

CRACK!  Sorsha whips her horse and gallops ahead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Who is that girl, anyway?

                        RAZIEL
          Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

Madmartigan snaps his finger and discourages himself.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Forget that one, Madmartigan.

Raziel leaps against the bars of her cage, chatters her
teeth and whispers to Willow.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow.  To learn magic, first you 
          must make your own philosopher's
          stone!

                        WILLOW
          What do I need for that?

                        RAZIEL
          We must start with feathers, dung,
          and a lock of your hair.

Willow pulls a strand of his hair out in front of his
eyes and frowns at it.  Madmartigan, meanwhile, can't
take his eyes off Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now that's a woman...!

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Fires and torches burn around pitched tents.  Soldiers
eat and drink, and meat is thrown out to Death Dogs.
From her cage, Raziel looks down at Willow, still
chained to the wagon next to Madmartigan.  Willow is
grinding a substance with a rock.

                        RAZIEL
          Keep working at it.  Forget all you
          know, or think you know.  A
          magician's power depends on disord-
          er of the mind.

She twists her head through the bars.  Madmartigan
squints up at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You got that one covered.

Willow hears the baby crying in a distant tent.

                        WILLOW
          I hope she's all right.  How much
          more do I have to do of this?

                        RAZIEL
          Till it's in a powder.  The energy
          exits within you...

                        WILLOW
                      (reciting)
          I know, and the magician's goal is
          to find his true self.  But what's
          this got to do with it?

                        RAZIEL
          As below, so above.  You hold the
          univers, Willow, in your hand.

Madmartigan clasps his forhead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm beginning to think you two
          *deserve* to be locked up.

                        WILLOW
          The universe is a living creature,
          like you and me, Madmartigan.

Madmartigan cynically gazes at the sky, gesturing wide-
ly.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're a tiny version of all that?

                        RAZIEL
          As above, so below.

Madmartigan rolls his eyes.  Willow jumps to his feet
and shows Raziel the substance.

                        WILLOW
          I'm all finished.  Now what?

                        RAZIEL
          Burn it to a fine ash.

Willow looks around.  Heavily armed Nockmaar minions
rip chunks of meat around a campfire.

                        WILLOW
          How am I gonna do that?

                        RAZIEL
          Patience.  Concentrate.  You will
          find a way.

Suddenly bootsteps clomp toward them.  Willow quickly
folds the powder inside some cloth and hides it in his
pocket.  The Lieutenant marches up and scrutinizes them
suspiciously.  He abruptly snatches Willow up, hacks
the chain and drags him off.

                        WILLOW
          What's going on?

Madmartigan sturggles against his chains.  Angry and
worried:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurt him and you'll answer to me!

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - NIGHT

The Lieutenant clamps irons on Willow's wrists, flings
him into a tent and exits.  Willow looks up and sees
Sorsha, still in her uniform, impatiently pacing wiht
the crying baby.

                        SORSHA
          This baby won't do what I say.  You
          seem to know what to do.  Here!
          Make it shut up.

Sorsha dumps the baby in Willow's arms and then backs
away.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed.

                        SORSHA
          I changed her already!

Willow politely shrugs.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed again.
Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow
changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re-
lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror.
Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the
fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

                        SORSHA
          Who is that horrible friend of
          yours?

                        WILLOW
                  (watching the fire)
          Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Who is he?

                        WILLOW
          I don't know much about him.

Sorsha fiddles with her long red hair.  Willow creeps
toward the fire.

                        SORSHA
          He's very bold.  Do you really
          think my hair is beautiful?

She turns and looks right at Willow.  He looks back.
She asks the question again by holding out strands of
her hair.

                        WILLOW
          Uh, yes.  It's very nice hair.

He suddenly strides over to Sorsha.

                        WILLOW
          She's hungry.

                        SORSHA
          I know she's hungry.  I tried to
          feed her but she wouldn't eat a
          thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.

                        WILLOW
          Here.  Hold her.

He hands Sorsha the baby, then goes to the fire where
there's a stone crock of milk.  He carefully takes his
cloth pouch out of his pocket and unfolds it.  At the
other side of the tent Sorsha awkwardly paces with the
baby.

                        SORSHA
          I tried everything.  A spoon.  I
          poured milk into her mouth, she just
          spat it out.  I don't know what to
          do, I'm not a mother.

During this, Willow ignites his powdery substance.  It
flares slightly then burns to an ash.  He gathers it
up, then returns to Sorsha with the milk.

                        WILLOW
          Sometimes she likes it heated.

Willow finds a strip of cloth, dips it in the milk, and
feeds Elora Danan in Sorsha's arms.  He looks up at
Sorsha and smiles.

                        WILLOW
          She's a good baby.

Sorsha looks down at the baby.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - MORNING

The caravan packs up to move on.  Soldiers drag Willow
to the wagon and lift him on board, chaining him beside
Raziel's cage.  Willow excitedly pats his pocker, and
whispers:

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  I got the ashes!

When the soldiers leave, he digs out the pouch and
proudly shows it to Raziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Good!  The first step is complete.

Chained behind the wagon, Madmartigan reaches forward
and pokes Willow with his finger?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Did she ask about me?

                        WILLOW
          Who?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard
          time.  You were in her ten all
          night.  Did she say anything?

Willow deliberately plays innocent.

                        WILLOW
          She said lots of thing.s

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!

Willow grins.  At last:

                        WILLOW
          She asked about you, Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Well what did she say?

Suddenly Sorsha gallops by on horseback, holding the
baby.  She flings a wad of clothes at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Here.  You're going to need these
          where we're going.

She rides off.  Madmartigan looks down at the clothes.
The looks at Willow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's in love.

                        WILLOW
          You're crazy.  I think you're in
          love.

EXT. SNOW MOUNTAIN - DAY

The Nockmaar caravan climbs into snow-covered moun-
tains.  In the wagon, Raziel is grilling Willow.  He
concentrates hard, cramming, memorizing, straining.

                        RAZIEL
          We don't have much time left!  Go
          on!  Go on!

                        WILLOW
          I must concetrate my
          imagination...to creat a
          new...reality!

                        RAZIEL
          What's the magician's weapon?

                        WILLOW
          The limitless power of...

Raziel flips around in spasms of impatience.

                        RAZIEL
          Your will!  Your will!  What else
          could it be?

                        WILLOW
                     (frustrated)
          I can't remember all these things.
          What am I learning?

                        RAZIEL
          The art of transformation!


                        WILLOW
                     (exasperated)
          But what am I gonna transform??

                        RAZIEL
          Me!

Willow and Madmartigan stare at Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You?

                     MADMARTIGAN
          What are you gonna become, Raziel?
          Queen of the rodents?

Sorsha rides up to the wagon.

                        SORSHA
          The baby's cold.  Take her.

She dismounts.  With care, keeping the baby bundled,
she hands the baby to Willow.  Madmartigan watches and
listens.

                        RAZIEL
          You remind me of your father, Sor-
          sha.

                        SORSHA
          My father was a weakling.

                        RAZIEL
          He was a great king.
                 (Madmartigan reacts)
          Not like your step-father, not like
          your mother.  He ruled Tir Asleen
          with kindness, and a generous
          heart.

                        SORSHA
          My mother calls that weakness.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What do *you* call it?

Sorsha turns and glares at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I do what I'm told.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Too bad you're not more like
          your father.

She looks at him a moment, then abruptly mounts her
horse and rides ahead.

EXT. ROAD TOWARD SNOW CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

The caravan rides toward a large Nockmaar camp.  Death
Dogs howl and fires burn ominously in the distance.
Willow and madmartigan watch as KING KAEL rides out to
meet the caravan.

Kael is huge, powerful and cruel, partbeast, part man,
and he carries a terrible sword at his side.  Sorsha
carefully shows him the baby.  He grabs it from her.

                        SORSHA
          Be careful.

                         KAEL
          Don't tell me what to do.

Kael viciously hits Sorsha, knocking her off her horse.
Madmartgian and Willow watch angrily.  Kail gallops to-
ward camp with the baby under his ar.  Sorsha shakes
away the pain and, humiliated, mounts her horse.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We gotta get the baby out of here.

Raziel dashes around her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Tonight!  Complete the
          philosopher's stone!  I must be
          turned back!

Looking off into the camp, angry and resolute, Willow
takes out the ingredients for the stone.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it, Raziel...

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT

Now in a kind of portable cell, Madmartigan clutches
the jail bars and looks out at the camp.  Fires and
torches burn, and Nockmaar soldiers patrol.

Shivering cold, willow sits cross-legged in the jail,
melting snow into a bowl.  On a nearby lean-to, where
skins and shields are kept, Raziel hangs in her cage.

Somewhere the baby is crying.  In the distance Sorsha
goes inside one of the tenst. There's a muffled yel-
ling between Sorsha and Kael.  Then Keal storms out of
the tent and goes inside the tent next door.

Willow pours the ashes into the melted snow.

                        RAZIEL
          Let it settle.  Carefully, slowly.
          Concentration and will.  Now pour
          the water off.

As Willow works, Madmartigan binds together scrap
sticks of wood, making a long pole.  He gingerly hooks
Raziel's cage with this, lifting it from the spike.

                        WILLOW
          Oooh, this smells terrible.

                        RAZIEL
          That's the life spark.  Exxence of
          magic and sorcery!

Madmartigan angles the pole and the cage slide toard
him.  He grabs it with both hands and rips it apart.
Raziel right away scurries down the cell bars, jumps
into the jail and bits Willow's hand.

                        WILLOW
          Ouch!!

                        RAZIEL
          Shhhhh!

They look out nervously at patrolling Nockmaar sol-
diers.  Willow sucks the back of his hand.

                        WILLOW
          What'd you bit me for!!

                        RAZIEL
          We need blood.  To nourish the
          stone.  charge the stone with ener-
          gy.

Willow drips his blood into the concoction then stirs
it with a twig.  It begins to glow from within.

                        RAZIEL
          The components of the stone are
          fusing...

Willow's eyes widen with anticipation.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT - LATER

Fires have burned down.  Most of the camp is sleeping.
It is nearing dawn.  Madmartigan stares out at Sorsha's
tent, deep in thought.  Willow holds up the completed
PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, a red ball of pliable putty.

                        RAZIEL
          Again:  what is the magician's
          weapon?

                        WILLOW
          His will.

                        RAZIEL
          Now use it.

Willow presses the philopher's stone against the
chainlock.  He sheepishly looks over his hsoulder at
Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I just wanted to test it first.

                        RAZIEL
          No!  Change me back into a sor-
          ceress, Willow.

Willow goes to Raziel and concentrates with physical
and mental intensity.

                        WILLOW
          Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha...

It starts to work.  Raziel curls into a ball of fur.
The fur changes to feathers.  She begins to squawk
strangely.  She emerges as a raven-sized bird.

                        WILLOW
          What did I do?

He sags with exhaustion and massages his blistered
hands.  Then: CLINK!  The lock falls open.  They all
look over, and Madmartigan picks it up off the ground.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not bad, Peck.  I'm impressed.  You
          busted the lock.

Wilow clutches Madmartigan's arm.  He holds up the
stone.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get
          Eloran Danan.

With coldness in his eyes, madmartigan stares across
the camp at Sorsha's tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Let's get Elora Danan.

They sneak away.

                        RAZIEL
          Wait!  What about me!

Raziel flaps her wings and flies up into the dark sky.

EXT. THROUGH THE CAMP - DAWN

Willow and Madmartigan sneak behind tents, hiding from
the patrolling guards.  Very quietly they creep up to
Kael's tent.  Madmartigan knocks out a guard and steals
his knife.  They crawl dangerously over to Sorsha's
tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a magician, Willow.  But I'm
          a thief.  Wait here.  I'll get the
          baby.

Madmartigan slits the back of the tent open and slips
inside.  Raziel flutters down and lands on Willow's
shoulder.

                        RAZIEL
          I'm supposed to be a beautiful wo=
          man.

Willow shrugs apologetically.

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - DAWN

Crouched inside the large tent, Madmartigan calculates
his next move.  In the far corner, Sorsha lies asleep.
He steals the baby from a crib of straw.  Starts to
leave.  But stops.  Willow pokes his head inside.

                        WILLOW
                      (whispers)
          Come on, Madmartigan...!

Madmartigan stares over at Sorsha.  Lured by her beau-
ty, he slowly walks toward her bed.

                        WILLOW
          What are you doing?  Get out of
          there...!

Madmartigan looks down at her.  Morning rushlight il-
luminates her youthful face, and her long red hair is
spread across her pillow.  Out of her armor, in soft
nightclothes, she looks like a goddess.  Upon her
breast is a golden necklet, inlaid with ornate jewels.
Quietly:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I love you.

He kisses her lips.  Her eyes open.

                        SORSHA
          One move, and you really will be a
          woman.

Holding the baby, Madmartigan does not move a muscle.
Sorsha holds a knife at his crotch.

                        SORSHA
          You're a fool.  Now put her back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm not going to let this baby die.

Sorsha presses the knife.

                        SORSHA
          Don't make me kill you.

Willow watches as Madmartigna carefully backs away from
Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I believe you would...

Sitting up, Sorsha waves her knife.  Madmartigan places
the baby in the straw crib.

                        SORSHA
          Why did you say that?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Say what?

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Madmartigan walks back to Sorsha' bed.  Willow crawls
into the tent, behind Madmartigan's back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Because it's true.

                        SORSHA
          I don't believe you.

Sorsha defensively kneels on her bed as Madmartigan
walks toward her.  He shows no fear of her knife, com-
pelled instead by honest passion.  For once, he isn't
conning anybody.  His feelings are genuine.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I wish it weren't true.  I swore
          I'd never let this happen.  I hate
          you.  I hate your beauty, I hate
          your innocence, I hate the feelings
          you've awakened in me.

The knife trembles in Sorsha's hand.

                       MADMARTIGAN
          I'm in love with you, Sorsha.  I
          don't want to be, but a power has
          enchanted me and I stand helpless
          against it.  It's torture.  Battle-
          field or prison cell was never half
          as cruel.

He kneels onto her bed.  Her hand falls, her knife
falls to the floor, her chest heaves with fear and emo-
tion.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I want you and I can't have you so
          I want you all the more.  If this
          were another time and another place
          I'd--

He stops.  He looks into her eyes.  Willow dashes out of
the tent with the baby.

                        SORSHA
          You'd what?

Madmartigan takes Sorsha in his arms and kisses her.
Her trembling body surrenders to him.  Until:

They hear a SCREAM outside the tent.  It all happens
quickly.  Kael rips open the canvas and catches them in
their embrace.  In one hand he holds the baby.  In the
other hand:  Willow.

                         KAEL
          What's going on here!!

Sorsha sees the baby, sees the empty crib, and smashes
Madmartigan hard across the face.

                        SORSHA
          Deceiver!!

Kael hurls Willow across the tent and tosses the baby
in the straw.  Growling horribly he lunges at Madmarti-
gan.  Madmartigan rolls away and sees Sorsha's sword
nearby.  Grabs it.  As Kael draws his sword, Madmarti-
gan artfully slices away the center pole, and the en-
tie tent collapses.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - MORNING

Bodies writhe under the fallen mass of canvas, and Ra-
ziel hovers and screeches above.  Then, a silver blade
slits through the tent, and out jumps Madmartigan
wielding Sorsha's sword.

Alarm!  Nockmaar soldiers and Death Dogs charge across
the snow.  Madmartigan battles them with incredible
skill, backing toward the mountain slope.

Wilow crawls out from under the corner of the tent,
clutchign the baby.  Madmartigan kills several so-
diers, littering the snow with bodies and weapons.
Willow reacts, impressed by Madmartigan's swordsman-
ship.  Madmartigan makes the mistake of acknowledging
it:  he bows, prod and cocky.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whoops!

He slips on the ice and catches himself.  Nearby a
shield skids off along the snow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Jump on the shiled!

Kael howls and thrashes inside the collapsed tent.
Then he gashes it open with his huge black sword.  He
sees Willow and the baby get on the large shield.

                         KAEL
          Bowmen!  Horses!  After them!

Madmartigan runs toward the shield.  Archers draw their
bows.  Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha beside Kael.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  I didn't betray you.  I
          love you!

As arrows rain down around him, Madmartigan leaps onto
the shield behind Wuillow.  Sorsha watches them as they
slide away down the mountain, Raziel flapping and
shrieking overhead.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!!

Kael waves his sward and a crack squad of Nockmaar
HORSEMEN gallop down the mountain after the sled-
shield.

EXT. DOWN THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN - DAY

Willow hugs the baby while he sits between
Madmartigan's legs, and the shield zooms down the moun-
tain, zig-zagging through trees.  Madmartigan steers by
using Sorsha's sword as a ski pole.

The Nockmaar horsemen gallop after them.

The shield skips and flies over snowdrifts and bumps.
Raziel squawks in terror above them.  Just missing
trees and rocks, they pick up speek.  Their eyes sud-
denly widen.  Dead ahead is a huge wall of ice!

                        WILLOW
          Nooo!!!

Willow shuts his eyes.  the shield speeds toward the
wall.  At the last moment Madmartigan steers them into
a small opening, little more than a crack.  Raziel,
nearly smashing into the wall herself, soars up into
the sky and loses them.

INT. ICE TUNNEL - DAY

They slide and sway down a long tube of ice, picking up
incredible speed until they loop 360 degrees upside-
down and around and go shooting out a hole at the other
end.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

They soar thorugh the air.  Madmartigan and Willow
shriek in terror.  But Elora Danan giggles:  she's hav-
ing fun!  But in the air the shield goes one way and
they go another, flipping and hanging onto one another
and landing on soft snow with a fffump.  Inertia keeps
them rolling.

Clumped together, they tumble down the mountain, gath-
ering snaw as they go, bouncing and rolling into a
snowball that gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger!

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

The snowball steamrolls toward a small village at the
foot of the mountain.  CHLDREN look up and squeal with
delight while the adult VILLAGERS run for their lives.

It plows through the middle of the village, scattering
peole and animals left and right.  At last it smashes
against a stone house and cracks open like an egg.

Raziel flies down and lands on top of the snowball,
flapping her wings frantically.  madmartigan crawls out
as the villagers rush up.  They stand back in amaze-
ment:  the baby starts crying.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!  Are you all
          right?

Madmartigan drags Willow and the baby out of the snow.
Willow's body is limp, he's unconscious.  Then a VIL-
LAGER points up at the mountain.

                       VILLAGER
          King Kael!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Nockmaar troops!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                    (to villagers)
          Help us.

In the distance Kael and his squad of about 15 horsemen
charge toward the village.  The villagers flee into
their huts and houses.  Madmartigan scoops up Willow
and the baby.  Some villagers usher them around a
corner and into a house just as Kael's army invades the
town.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Madmartigan is bustled underground thorugh a cellar
into a hidden storage room and a disguised door shuts
behind him.  MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN huddle here in
silence, like refugees or criminals.  Madmartigan hands
the crying baby to a WOMAN then lays Willow on the
floor.  Suddenly a huge hand clamps his shoulder:  his
old friend and rival Airk Thaughbaer.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan.  Settled down with a
          family huh?

Madmartigan knocks Airk's hand away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You left me to die, friend.

                         AIRK
          You managed alright.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Is this what's left of your army?

Among the refugees is a handful of war-battered WARRI-
ORS.  One of them, an OFFICER looks out through the
ceiling beams.

                        OFFICER
          Keep that baby quiet.

They hear hoofbeats outside.  Airk gives Madmartigan a
flask of whiskey.  He squirts whiskey into Willow's
mouth and Willow coughs and shudders awake.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Raziel flies onto a rooftop and looks down.  Nockmaar
soldiers flood the village, dismounting, kicking down
doors, searching houses.  Then Raziel sees Kael riding
alongside Sorsha.

In her armor, at a distance, Sorsha looks fierce.  But
CLOSER her eyes show confusion, hesitation.  Kael
watches her closely as he waves his sword at the vil-
lage.

                         KAEL
          Where is it!  Tell us or we'll burn
          your village!  Sorsha!

He shakes her roughly.  She dismounts.  Raziel watches
as Sorsha and two other soldiers enter the house where
Madmartigan and Willow are hiding.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Willow holds the baby tight.  Madmartigan, Airk and the
Officer watch through the cracks.  Boots pound above,
shaking dust down on them.  A door opens.

Nobody breathes.  Willow buries the baby in his chest.
Madmartigan peeks through the door.  Sorsha, alone,
comes down into the cellar.  They see her.  Searching.
Airk's men reach for their swords, begin to draw.
Whisper:

                        OFFICER
          Kill her.

Madmartigam shakes his head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You'll draw the others.

Airk looks at Madmartigan curiously.  Madmartigan
watches Sorsha. She is right there, inches away.
Inaudibly, be says her name.  At last she goes back
upstairs.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Sorsha comes up and begins to leave with the other two
soldiers.

INT. CELLAR

In Willow's arms, the baby lets out a cry.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS

Sorsha and the soldiers stop and draw swords.  The
baby's cry is suddenly drowned out by a loud SDRRECH.
Raziel flaps in through a window and flies madly around
the house, cawing and shrieking insanely.  Sorsha and
the soldiers sheathe their swords and leave.

INT. CELLAR

Everyone sighs with relief.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

In the distance the Nockmaar army is setting houses ab-
laze and Kael is terrorizing the fleeing people with
his sword.  Sorsha mounts her horse.  Her attention is
momemtarily caught by a MAN across the street who, from
the back, looks like Madmartigan.  She gasps.  The man
turns around.  She sags with disappointment, spurs her
horse, and rides off.

The deadly squad of Nockmaar horsemen gallops out of
the village.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Madmartigan and Willow come upstairs with Airk and his
men.

                         AIRK
          It's you they're after, Madmarti-
          gan.  What did you do this time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          They're not after me.  They want
          the baby.

Living in the house is a scrawny, shifty-eyed man named
CUTH.  He watches and listens.

                         AIRK
          Who is this baby?

Willow steps forward, both protective and proud.

                        WILLOW
          The princess, Elora Danan.

They all know of her.  They all sigh with respeck and
awe, and they bow.

                        PEOPLE
          The prophecy has come true.

                         AIRK
          Give her to us.  We'll protect her.

Raziel screeches from a ceiling beam.

                        RAZIEL
          Not safe!  Not safe!

Willow looks up at Raziel hopefully.

                        WILLOW
          We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
          She'll be safe there from
          Bavmorda's powers.

Airk looks up at Raziel.  Then down at Willow.  He
clasps Madmartigan's arm.

                         AIRK
          Tir Asleen is a myth.  It doesn't
          exist.

                        RAZIEL
          It does!  It does!  I will show
          you!

Airk impatiently waves the bird away and shoves Madmar-
tigan in the chest.

                         AIRK
          You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?
          I've lost half my men fighting
          Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock-
          maar army.  Now you and this Peck,
          and that magpie up in the rafters,
          are gonna take 'em on alone?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (challenging)
          Then come with us.

Airk angrily stabs his finger at the floor.

                         AIRK
          The war is here!  In towns and vil-
          lages like this!

Airk crosses his arms and turns his back, looking out
at the burning houses and the suffering families.

                         AIRK
          You're chasing a dream.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Just get me some horses.

Airk glares at him furiously.  Then he kicks open the
door and storms out into the street.  Madmartigan and
Willow hurry after him.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Airk and his men, plus some villagers, watch as Madmar-
tigan mounts a large horse.  Then some villagers help
Willow wiggle up onto a small pony.  They sling the
baby over Willow's back and stuff saddlebags with pro-
visions

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Once again, Airk, we say goodbye.

Sadly and cynically, Airk laughs.

                         AIRK
          One day one of us willl stand on
          the other's grave.

They shake hands ruggedly.  Madmartigan nods at Willow
and they head off.  Airk watches them go, clearly am-
bivalent about staying behind.  They ride up the snowy
slope, Raziel circling above.

WE SEE Cuth.  He scratches his filthy beard.  He sneaks
off through the village, in the direction of the Nock-
maar army.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

Snow circles around them as they climb.  Then, oddly,
the mountain becomes warmer, and the snow melts away.
They reach a slope of dark vitreous lava.

                        RAZIEL
          Nockmaar!  Nockmaar!

Far away, at the top of the mountain, looms the ominous
Catsle of Nockmaar.  The black lava flows from it
like a deadly shadow.

EXT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Their horses rear up as they approach the mouth of the
cave.  Raziel waits for them, circling and cawing.

                        RAZIEL
          This way!  The cave!

They dismount and lead the horses.  But the horses pan-
ic, their frightened neighing voices echoing deep in
the gloomy cave, and they break away and run off.

Willow swallows hard.  He and Madmartigan follow Raziel
inside.

INT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Daylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten
lava.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  I can't stand being
          in closed-in places.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Want me to carry Elora?

                        WILLOW
          I'm used to her.  How's she doing?

Willow wears the papoose on his back.  Madmartigan
looks in at the baby's face.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's doing a lot better than we
          are, Peck.

Willow and Madmartigan laugh, which breaks the tension.
Then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat
screeches somewhere and the tension's back.  They keep
going.

INT. DEEPER IN THE CAVE

Hot liquid drips from the ceiling.  Hissing steam bub-
bles from the floor.  they go single-file along a ledge
over a foaming lava pit.  Raziel is squawking way ahead
in the distance.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...this may be a bad time to
          ask this question but...what if
          Raziel's wrong?

                        WILLOW
          She can't be wrong.  She's a very
          very very powerful sorceress.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's a bird, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          That's my fault, not hers.  I've
          got to keep practicing.  I'm still
          in the learning stage but magic,
          Madmartigan, requires concentration
          and--

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Watch it!

                        WILLOW
          Ahhh!

Madmartigan lunges and grabs Willow just as he is about
to fall into the lava pit.  He hauls him to safety.
They gasp with relief. Then they head deeper into the
cave.  They stop.  They hear something.  Something
strange.

Then, something moves on the wall.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

The cave walls come to life.  Down them crawl ugly ROCK
PUFFERS, pillow-sized wall crabs that screech horribly
like bats.  Madmartigan fights them off with his sword.
The Rock Puffers bloat themselves up, tripling their
size.  Madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an
untied balloon.

Suddenly, distant hoofbeats thunder and echo.  Madmar-
tigan flashes his sword and turns around, ready to de-
fend Willow and the baby against the army.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Go, Willow!  Run!  Run!

Willow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder.
At last he turns and runs deeper into the cave.  Mad-
martigan waits.

The Nockmaar soldiers, now increased to eighty, come
charging down the cave.  Kael rides in the lead along-
side the turncoat Cuth.  As they gallop along the
ledge, Cuth makes the mistake of crowding Kael, who an-
grily elbos him, horse and all, into the boiling pit.

The army tramples over the Rock Puffers, which explode
underfoot.  Madmartigan braces himself as they stampede
toward him.  But suddenly the horseman all screech
thir horses to a halt.  The horses rear and back away.

Madmartigan stands there, wondering.  Then suddenly a
shadow looms behind him.  He turns.

The EBORSISK roars and the cave shakes and thunders.
It's an enormous two-headed monster that doesn't like
visitors.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!

He looks around frantically.  Willow is nowhere to be
seen.  Then the baby cries out.  Madmartigan sees them,
cowering behind a rock.  He runs toward them.  The
Eborsisk exhales flames over his head.

                         KAEL
          Go after them!

Soldiers obey Kael and go after Madmartigan.  He fights
them, hacking down a few, while a few others are in-
cinerated by the Eborsisk.  Sorsha's horse rears as she
watches Madmartigan battle for his life.  Archers shoot
arrows, which pierce the Eborsisk and make it even an-
grier.

Willow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket.
A head of the Eborsisk gnashes at Madmartigan.  Madmar-
tigan looks to Willow for help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurry, Willow!  Throw it!

Willow winds up and throws with all his might.  The
Eborsisk blasts a flame, which startles Willow, wreck-
ing his aim.  Madmartigan's eyes pop open and he ducks
as the acorn whistles by his ear.  The acorn bounces
off a rock and flies back, trickles along the ground
and hits a Nockmaar soldier, who is already dead.  The
soldier's body turns to stone.

                        RAZIEL
          Look out!

One of the Eborsisk's heads lunges toward the baby.
Raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monster's
eye as Willow whisks the baby away.

Then Madmartigan leaps up on the Eborsisk.  He climbs
up over its flaming head and drives his sword down
through its skull.  The Eborsisk howls horribly and its
wounded head falls.  Madmartigan topples down its back
and leaps onto a horse, knocking its rider off and, all
in one swashbuckling move, scooping Willow and the baby
up onto the back of the horse and galloping away.

                         KAEL
          After them!!

But as his horsement charge forward, the Eborsisk falls
to its knees, half-dead.  The surviving head blasts the
soldiers with fire.  They rear back on their horses and
continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears.

EXT. CAVE - TIR ASLEEN - DAY

They ride out of the mouth of the dark cave into a lush
valley of flowers.  In the distance stands the beau-
tiful CASTLE OF TIR ASLEEN.  Raziel zooms up out of the
cave an flies above them as they gallop fullspeed to-
ward it.  She soars higher and higher and flies right
over the castle wall.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN CASTLE - DAY

The door of the castle is half open.  Madmartigan and
Willow gallop inside.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Raziel flies down to meet them as they ride into the
castle courtyard.  A haunting wind drones amont TWELVE
PILLARS which look like stone from a distance.

                        RAZIEL
          Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          There's nobody here.

They approach the twelve pillars.

                        RAZIEL
          The Knights of the Pacalcade.  The
          king's bravest warriors.

Suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Kael and his army charge out of the cave and trample
across the valley of flowers.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan rushes to the heavy door and strains to
shut it.

                        RAZIEL
          Turn them back, Willow!

Willow stares at the twelve knights.

                        WILLOW
          How??

                        RAZIEL
          Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur-
          ry!  Invocation!  Release them!

The castle door is rusted and old.  madmartigan heaves
against it.  Outside he can see the army storming to-
ward him.

Willow digs out his philosopher's stone.  He squints
and strains, concentrating his energy.

                        WILLOW
          Beings within, beings without!
          Danu danu walkail funfawtha!

He continues to chant and to concentrate.  One of the
knights comes to life.

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here!
          Look!  You gotta see this!  I did
          it!

                        RAZIEL
          More!  More!

Madmartigan heaves the door shut just as the army
charges up, and he locks it with a huge bolt.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen rear back form the locked door.

                         KAEL
          Assault!  Scale the walls!

He sends his men in all directions.  They leap off
their horses and hack down trees from the nearby woods.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow brings the knights to life, one by one.

                        WILLOW
          Tuatha tuatha danu!

Each knight shakes himself into action.  Madmartigan
follows them in an armory.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!  I transformed them all!
          I'm a magician!

                        RAZIEL
          You didn't transform them, Willow,
          you released them.  That was noth-
          ing.  Now change me.

Willow's on a roll.  He rubs his hands together.

                        WILLOW
          I feel like I could do anything!

He drops to his knees and stretches his philosopher's
stone apart like an accordian.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - ARMORY

Madmartigan and the knights grab weapons and armor.
Two knights wheel a catapult out ot the battlements.
Madmartigan wees, displayed specially on a rack, a com-
plete set of armor of shining silver.  He reaches out
to touch it.

                        KNIGHT
          It belonged to our king.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

The knights light a fire and boil vats of oil.  Willow
struggles to transform Raziel, trying to remember all
he has learned.

                        WILLOW
          Capture the enery...limitless
          power of the will...avvdachh doth
          indicht rredd baerkinhaekin!

Raziel begins to change.  From a bird, she expands,
stretches, and turns into a GOAT.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What
          happened?

Raziel tilts her goat head.

                        RAZIEL
          I hate this.

Suddenly flaming arrows rain down over the castle wall.
Willow scoops up the baby and he and Raziel run for cover.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

From their horses Kael and Sorsha watch as the soldiers
climb the wall.  They suddenly hear a hacking noise
above and several Nockmaar men tumble down the ladders.
Sorsha looks up.

High on the wall stands Madmartigan, magnificently
dressed in the glimmering armor of the King!

Kael roars and points his deadly sword up at Madmarti-
gan.  Then several soldiers attack the castle door with
a huge battering ram and smash it open.

                         KAEL
          Attack!!

Kael and Sorsha gallop into the castle with otehr Nock-
maar horsemen, while Madmartigan continues to battle
attackers on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow looks up as the horsemen charge into the court-
yeard.  He makes a run for the hallway.  SIX HORSEMEN
chase after him, jumping off their horses and drawing
their swords.

Sorsha dismounts, draws a sword, and strides up the
stairs toward teh top of the wall.

INT. ARMORY

Willow runs into the armory and sets the baby down in a
corner.  The six horsement run in and corner him.  He
grabs an enormous broadsword.  Swings it like a base-
ball bat.  The momentum of the heavy sword hurls Willow
across the room.  The blade pierces a Nockmaar man.
Willow grunts and yanks the sword out.  The remaining
soldiers come after him.  Willow swings and flashes the
sword as they close in on him.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

In the courtyard, Raziel the goat butts a few soldiers
as the battle rages.

UP ON THE WALL

Madmartigan stabs a minion and sends him hurtlin down
the wall.  Then he turns around.  Five more enemy
swordsmen slash at him.  Madmartigan is amazing:  spin-
nig, lunging, ducking, he takes out one, two, three,
four of them with ease.  But not the fifth.

It's the Nockmaar Lieutenant.  He and Madmartigan
swordfight.  The Lieutenant hacks the sword out of
Madmartigan's hand: it clatters down into the court-
yeard.

Madmartigan throws up his arm.  The Lieutenant's sword
clangs against his wrist armor, knocking Madmartigan
onto his back.  With two hands the Lieutenant lifts his
sword high and goes to kill Madmartigan.  madmartigan
shuts his eyes.  But nothing happens.

Madmartigan opens his eyes.  the Lieutenant stands
there, frozen, staring at him.  Then falls forward.
Rolls over Madmartigan.  And plummets off teh wall.  In
his place stands Sorsha, holding a bloodied sword.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Madmartigan.

He props himself up on his elbows and smiles.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whose side are you on?

She reaches down and pulls Madmartigan to his feet.

                        SORSHA
          Yours.

They look into each other's eyes.  They go to embrace.

                        MINION
          Arrrggghhh!

Out of nowhere a Nockmaar minion attacks them, his
sword flashing over his head. Sorhsa hardly moves.
She simply dusts him off the wall with her sword.  She
turns back to Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Their armor clanks as they throw their arms around each
other and kiss, high up on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

Kael looks up from his horse.

                         KAEL
          Sorsha!!

He sees Sorsha and Madmartigan coming down the wall,
fighting Nockmaar troops.  Kael holds up his great
hand.  In it he holds the baby.

                         KAEL
          Bordak!

Kael waves his men after Sorsha and Madmartigan.

                         KAEL
          Kill them both!

He laughs viciously then gallops toward the castle
door.  As he reaches it he abruptly stops.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Two hundred HORSEMEN are charging straight toward Kael.
Led by Airk Thaughbaer!

CLOSER, riding in Airk's saddlebags, with their tiny
daggers flashing, are the long-lost brownies, Teemo and
Rool!

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael stuffs the baby deep inside his tunic.

                         KAEL
          Troops!  To Nockmaar!  Ride with
          me!

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan and Sorsha mount horses.  Willow staggers
out of the armory, wounded and bleeding.

                        WILLOW
          I'm sorry.  There were too many of
          them.

Madmartigan scoops him up.  With seven surviving
knights, they ride out.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Many of Kael's men fall in battle.  But Kael and a
dozen horsemen plow through and escape into the cave.

Madmartigan rides up to Airk Thaughbaer and their
horses powerfully dance around each other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Out for a little ride in the coun-
          try, Airk?

                         AIRK
          Thought you might get lonely, Mad-
          martigan!

Then they drop the bravado and clasp hands.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Thank you, friend.

                         AIRK
          Let's go.

They charge into the cave.  The clamor of their
hoofbeats echoes and then fades to silence.  The valley
is littered with fallen soldiers.

Then, Raziel trots out of the castle.  She clip-clops
across the valley and follows the others to the cave.

EXT. VOLCANIC MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen race out of the cave and gallop
up the obsidian mountain toward the dark castle.

The army of Tir Asleen thunders out of the cave in pur-
suit.

Arrows fire back and forth.  The Tir Asleen army stays
right on the enemy's tail.  Willow hangs on to Madmar-
tigan for dear life.

Airk and Madmartigan ride side by side, perfect team-
work, and cut a few Nockmaar ment down.

Then Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha ride up past
everybody.  What a rider she is!  She surprises a cou-
ple of Nockmaar soldiers, swordfighting as she rides,
killing them both.  But she can't catche Kael.  He rides
ahead of everyone else, whipping his horse at an in-
credible speed toward the castle.

The chase continues up the mountain.  The Tir Asleen
army keeps firing arrows at the enemy, or cutting them
down with their swords, until only two Nockmaar men
ride behind Kael.  At last Kael reaches the castle
drawbridge and leaps onto it as it begins to rise.  His
two remaining horsemen leap after him but fall short
and tumble into the dry craggy moat.

The drawbridge shuts with a loud echoing KLUNGG!  Mad-
martigan and Arik screech to a halt on the brink of the
moat.  They look up.  The castle loom, huge, dark,
powerful, evil.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  Any way in there?

Sorsha rides up to his side.

                        SORSHA
          No.  The fortress is protected on
          all sides.

The Tir Asleen warriors, dwarfed by the huge black
wall, look at one another with doubt and worry.

                         AIRK
          Make camp!  We'll assault at dawn.

The army dismounts and begins to unpack supplies.  It
is late in the day and shadows lengthen toward evening.

INT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - LATE AFTERNOON

Kael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up
the gloomy narrowing stairs of the QUEEN'S TOWER.  He
comes to a large door and hesitates a moment, showing
fear.  Then creaks the door open.

INT. QUEEN'T TOWER

BAVMORDA looks up.  Kael cowers, afraid of her evil
power.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kael!

Carved in the floor is a MAGICIAN's CIRCLE, and in the
very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of
shining copper.  Bavmorda stands over the altar, wear-
ing black robes.  Behind her stand two decrepit DRUIDS.
Kael bows.

                         KAEL
          Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child.

The baby squirms and cries.  Seething with hate, Bav-
morda reaches out her arms, then shrinks back.

                       BAVMORDA
          We must start the ritual!

She hears noise outside the castle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who is that?

                         KAEL
          An army of rebels and traitors.

Bavmorda closes her eyes, holds out her hands and feels
the vibrations and energy around her.  Psychically:

                       BAVMORDA
          Where is Sorsha?

                         KAEL
          She has turned against you.

Bavmorda opens her eyes furiously.  to her druids:

                       BAVMORDA
          Purify the altar!  Arrange the im-
          plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha!

The druids take the baby from Kael.  Bavmorda storms
out the door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASLTE - DUSK

The Tir Asleen rebels pitch tents and build fires.
Then they feel a terrible presence and look up at the
castle wall.  Amid torches and hideous minions, Bavmor-
da leers down at them and laughs.

                       BAVMORDA
          This is not an army!

Sorsha looks up, and her mother seems to laugh right at
her.  Madmartigan steps forward.  Seeing him in the ar-
mor of the King, Bavmorda stops laughing, taken aback.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick!
          Hide!

Raziel suddenly butts Willow into a tent.

INT. TENT

Willlow tumbles into the tent and Raziel follows him.

                        RAZIEL
          Get down!  The ritual chant!
          Quick!  Protect yourself!

                        WILLOW
          Why?

                        RAZIEL
          Just do it!

Willow takes out his philosopher's stone and begins to
chant.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE

Madmartigan faces the queen.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn
          her over to us!

Bavmorda stabs her finger down at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You dare to challenge me?  You are
          not warriors.  You're pigs!

She waves her hand, casting a horrible spell over the
army.  Madmartigan's body begins to change its shape.
His armor breaks apart.  He grows hideous.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're all pigs!

The rebel soldiers panic and run.  Slowly, horribly,
they all expand and contort, ripping out of their armor
and clothers, casting down their weapons and shields.

                        SORSHA
          Mother!  No!!

                       BAVMORDA
          You made your decision!

Bavmorda points at Sorsha, and Sorsha, too, begins to
change.  The mountainside becomes a sea of writhing
flesh.  Every one of the Tir Asleen army is transformed
into a pig.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DUSK Bavmorda throws open the
door.  Her druids are binding the baby in a leather
thong.

                       BAVMORDA
          Begin the ritual.  Now!  Light the
          first candle.

A druid lights on of THIRTEEN ENORMOUS CANDLES.  Bav-
morda glares up at the roof.  In the middle of it is a
large circular hole showing the starlit sky.

                       BAVMORDA
          Come, thunder.  Come lightning.
          Touch this altar with your pwer.
          Come into my tower...

Lightning flashes faintly and thunder rumbles in the
distance.  Bavmorda smiles with satisfaction.

A druid places teh baby on the altar.  The other druid
hits a loud gong, once.  Bavmorda enters the Magician's
Circle.  Her face contorts as she recites:

                       BAVMORDA
          Dark runes, dark powers!  Blend and
          bind, bind and blend, Universal
          night!  And the might of Nockmaar!

Magically she produces a razor-sharp knife.  Lightning
flashes again, getting closer.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow is crouched on his knees, chanting with her eyes
closed.

                        RAZIEL
          It's over, Willow.  You did well.
          You protected yourself.

Willow looks up.  He hears the grunting outside.  With
great trepidation, he crawls to the tent door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - OUTSIDE TENT - NIGHT

Willow shudders in horror at the grotesque sight.  Amid
horses and tents and weapons, hundreds of pigs wander
about.  Willow stands and walks through them.  He looks
down at one point and sees Rool and Teemo:  two tiny
baby pigs.  Then he turns and runs back into the tent.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow collapses to his knees beside Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I've come all this way and now
          Elora Dana's going to die!

                        RAZIEL
          No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!

                        WILLOW
          She's too powerful, Raziel

Raziel sternly stamps the ground with her hoof.

                        RAZIEL
          A true magician, Willow, never
          surrenders.  She is a sorceress--I
          am a sorceress!  Transform me now
          and I will destroy her!  Hexagram!

Willow grabs a sword and draws a hexagram around Ra-
ziel.  He steps outside of it, holds up his
philosopher's stone and begins his magic.

                        WILLOW
          Banish all disturbing forces from 
          this place.  Fire, water, above and
          below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal-
          ance.

Raziel begins to change.  Willow wrestles with his own
powers of concentration and will, now and then losing
strength.

                        RAZIEL
                   (voice distorted)
          Don't give up!  Willow!

He chants and strains.  Raziel momentarily changes into
a partly-formed grotesque creature.  Then into a deer.
Then she becomes human.  At last she becomes herself, a
once-beautiful and now elderly woman.  Willow covers
her unclothed body with a simple smock.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!

She looks down at her old hands.  Then her eyes focus
with purpose.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got a lot of work to do, Wil-
          low.  Bring in our brave men.

Willow opens the tent.  Some pigs shuttle in, and Ra-
ziel begins to change them back into warriors.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE -NIGHT

Stationed high on the castle wall, three Nockmaar MIN-
IONS laugh and drink.  Then they hear the terrible
SCREAM of the baby.  They look up at the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

A druid hits the ceremonial gong, twice.  The baby
shrieks.  Standing over her, Bavmorda crushes a piece
of glass with her bare hands and drops the fragments
into a Witch's Bottle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Black fire forever kindled within,
          Let the second right begin!

With a pair of razor-sharp shears she clips the baby's
tiny fingernails and sprinkles them into the Witch's
Bottle.  The bottle glows and sparks, and teh heavens
asnwer with distant thunder.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

In the dark Tir Asleen camp some figures crouch low and
hurry from tent to tent.  CLOSER, the faces of rebel
warriors, watching the castle wall.  Fear.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow, Raziel, Madmartigan, Sorsha, Airk Thaughbaer
and a dozen rebel warriors argue back and forth.

                         AIRK
          Uphill with our rough weapons,
          we'll never make it!

                        SORSHA
          Elora Danan will die!

                        RAZIEL
          By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the
          runic drum!

                        WARRIOR
          Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need
          more forces.  I say we retreat!

The other warriors agree.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda cannot transform you.
          I've protected this camp with a
          spell.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Can you use your magic to get our
          men into the fortress, Raziel?

Raziel shakes her head.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda has shielded it with a
          spell of her own.

The warriors grumble and protest.  In a corner, Rool
and Teemo poke their heads in under the canvas.  Curi-
ously they look at Willow, who sits in silence and deep
though, scratching the ground with his fingernail.

The warriors rumble.

                        WILLOW
          Wait!!

Willow jumps to his feet.  They all turn to him.

                        WILLOW
          I have an idea.  Back in my village
          we catch a lot of hedgehogs.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, this is war, not agricul-
          ture!

                        WILLOW
          I know, I know!  But this is a way
          to get into that castle...

The all gather around Willow to listen.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

Thunder rumbles.  Bavmorda looks up.  Her face is gra-
dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds.
A druid hits the gong three times.  Now three candles
are lit.  The baby screams on the altar.

With a demonic laugh, Bavmorda digs her hands into a
deep vat of blood then raises them over her head.  The
blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black
cloak.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

They all look at Willow.

                         AIRK
          It's too much work.

                        WARRIOR
          It can't be done.

                        SORSHA
          Kael will never fall for it.

Willow looks hopefully at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (doubtful)
          I don't know, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, you promised me you'd
          take care of Elora Danan like your
          own daughter.  She is all that
          matters.  Are you going to abandon
          her?

Madmartigan turns away and scratches his beard.

                         AIRK
          Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna
          listen to a Peck?  You and I are
          warriors.  You know this plan will
          never work.

Frustrated and torn, Madmartigan brushes Airk away.
The men rally with Airk.  Mdmartigan goes over to Sor-
sha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll probably die here, Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          I have no family.

The gong rings four time.  Raziel turns to Airk
and his men.

                        RAZIEL
          If we do not fight, and the baby
          dies, all hope for the future is
          lost.  I shall face the danger
          alone if I have to.

The men shake their heads.

                        WILLOW
          Me, too.

Madmartigan, still torn by indecision, raises his arm
and silences the protest.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time is running out.  We must now
          decide who's going to leave and who
          is going to stay...

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

Light pulsates in the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

The druids cower behind Bavmorda, whose face has taken
on the hideous features of a hellish beast.  The baby
has been streaked with ritual paint.

                       BAVMORDA
          Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak!

Her voice growls a sickening chant, and light shoots
out of her claw-liek fingers, enveloping the baby.  The
baby levitates above the altar in a cocoon of light.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAWN

The sun rises over the volcanic mountain.  The gong
strikes twelve times.  PAN ACROSS the slope outside the
castle.  The Tir Asleen army is gone.  Littered across
the ground are flattened tents, borken wagons an dis-
carded shields.  The wind howls, taking bits of debris
with it.

Alone on the deserted mounatinside stand Willow and Rz-
ziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Time is running out.

                        WILLOW
          Surrender!!

Nockmaar soldiers peer down and laugh.  Willow and Ra-
ziel trek closer to the castle wall.  Willow cups his
mouth.

                        WILLOW
          We are all-powerful magicians!
          Give us the baby or we will destroy
          you!!

The Nockmaar soldiers roar with laughter.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!

The great drawbridge falls across the moat.  Willow
clutches a spear and trembles nervously.

                        RAZIEL
          Patience, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Courage, Willow.

Hoofbeats.  EIGHT HORSEMEN ride out of the castle with
swords high.  Willow lifts his spear with two hands.
Turns.  And smashes the spear on the ground, striking a
loud war drum!

Suddenly Madmartigan leaps out of the ground on horse-
back!

And the entire mountainside comes to life.  Tents and
shields fly away and out of pits and trenches the Tir
Asleen army charges with one loud warcry!

The eight Nockmaar horsemen are quickly cut down.  The
rebels storm across the drawbridge into the castle.
Airk Thaughbaer scoops Willow up on his horse, and Sor-
sha scoops Raziel up on hers.

INT. NOCKMAAR COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Madmartigan leads the assault, cutting down Nockmaar
minions as they run out to defend the fortress.  Sorsha
slides off her horse with Raziel.  Airk sets Willow
down.  Sorsha leads Willow and Raziel into a dark hall-
way.

Rebel warriors storm into the courtyard.  Madmartigan
circles behind Airk, their horses dancing handsomely.

                         AIRK
          Let's squah 'em!

In unison, their swords flash and they charge across
the courtyard chopping down the enemy.

ENT CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

Sorsha hurries Willow and Raziel down a dark hallway.
They come to a corner.

                        SORSHA
          No, Willow!!

She grabs him by the collar and yanks him back.  A huge
DEATH DOG leaps out wiht a gnashing ROAR and Sorsha
kills it with her sword.  Willow sags with relief and
the women grab his hands and haul him further down the
tunnel.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

They come to the gloomy stairs that corkscrew up into
the Queen's Tower.  Willow climbs nervously behind Ra-
ziel and Sorsha.  At the top in THE DOOR.  Light throbs
behind it.

Suddenly they hear a loud SHRIEK and the door shakes
and bangs.  Willow fals to his knees, frozen with
fear.

                        SORSHA
          I will face my mother alone.

Willow and Raziel stay back on the stairs.  Sorsha
climbs to the door.  Courageously, she opens it.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda's monstrous face FILLS THE SCREEN.

                       BAVMORDA
          Sorsha!!

Sorsha recoils in horror.  Bavmorda looks barely human:
she has transformed into a grotesque witch.  She waves
her gnarled hand and her druids attack Sorsha.  Sorsha
kills them.  The baby lies under a deathlike spell on
the copper altar.

                        SORSHA
          I won't let you kill her!

Bavmorda's voice is a demonic growl!

                       BAVMORDA
          You are a weakling.  Like you fa-
          ther!  Can you not see that I am
          about to become all-powerful!

Lightning explodes overhead.  Sorsha lunges for the
baby.  But Bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy
force.

                        SORSHA
          No!!

Pulsating light lifts Sorsha, levitates her across the
room, and drives her toward a wall of spikes.  Just as
she is about to be implaes, another force stops her.
Bavmorda can sense the source of it:

                       BAVMORDA
          Raziel...!!

The door flies open.  The twelve burning candles all
blow out.  There stands Raziel.  Sorsha falls to the
floor, unconscious.  Raziel raises her arms magnifi-
cently.  The sorceresses face each other.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Battle rages.  Madmartigan and Airk lead the assault,
and the Tir Asleen rebels push back the Nockmaar min-
ions.  Down low, where weapons adn bodies fall and
horses clop and stamp, the brownies scurry along in
terror, arms crossed over their heads, looking for
shelter.

Like mice, they dart up some stairs.  Then a huge boot
nearly crushes them.  The dive away and look up.
Towering high above them, Kael lets out a loud warcry.
And brandishes two weapons, a huge sword and a huge
axe.

Madmartigan and Airk turn and see Kael.  They look at
each other.  Like samurai warriors they stand ready.
Kael ralles his weapons and charges toward them.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

Willow creeps toward the door.  It suddenly throbs and
flashes.  He jumps back.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda and Raziel oppose each otehr, circling the al-
tar.  The air between them crackles and sparks with the
concentration of energy between them.

                        RAZIEL
          The baby will be queen.  It has
          been foretold, Bavmorda.

                       BAVMORDA
          My ritual will kill the prophecy!
          Now the child dies with it, its en-
          ergy exiled into oblivion!
                  (lightning flashes)
          You see?  I hold the power of the
          universe!

                        RAZIEL
          Not until your ritual is complete!

                       BAVMORDA
          And who will stop me?  The elements
          are slaves to my command!

She points at the sky.  As if oberying her, lightning
flashes and thunder cracks.

                        RAZIEL
          There is no one who can match your
          sorcery.  Except me!

Raziel waves her arms and light suddenly swirls around
the room.  Bavmorda counters, and chairs come to life,
turning into beasts.  Objects fly about.  The tower be-
comes a storm of chaos and witchcraft.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Kael swings his axe and sword at Airk and Madmartigan.
He roars at his army, and six Nockmaar swordsmen hurry
over to fight with him.  Madmartigan and Airk split up.
Madmartigan battles the six swordsmen.  Airk battles
Kael, who backs Airk up stairs on the castle wall.

Madmartigan fights in the courtyard.  He hears a yell
and looks up.  Kael strikes Airk down.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!!

Airk falls down the stairs.  Madmartigan finishes off
the swordsmen, then runs to him, grabs his bleeding
body.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Airk!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Madmartigan...you're a brave
          warrior...a true friend...a good
          man...

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're gonna win this war, Airk.

An incredible smile lights up Airk's face as he dies.
Madmartigan stands.  Picks up his sword.  And goes up
the stairs after Kael.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

The sorceress continue their battle.  They change
each other into various beasts.  They fight, physically
and magically.

In the midst of chaos, the door opens.  Willow pokes in
his head, reacting in fear.  Then sneaks around the
wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby.

                       BAVMORDA
          As above, so below!  Universe of
          evil, Raziel!  It conquers even
          you!

Bavmorda hurls a final spell at Raziel, crippling her,
throwing her into a corner.  Bavmorda laughs and goes
to the altar.  The baby is gone.

Willow races toward the door with the baby.  The door
suddenly slams shut.  Bavmorda's voice roars out:

                       BAVMORDA
          *Stop!  Bring back that child!!!*

Willow stops.  He turns around.  Bavmorda towers over
him, grotesque, monstrous, poised to destroy Willow
with her magic.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who are you?

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician.

Bavmorda laughs.  Willopw slowly walks toward her.  he
digs into his pocket.  Takes out the last magic acorn.

                        WILLOW
          I'm a *great* magician.

Willow throws the acorn at Bavmorda.  Her hand shoots
out and catches it.  the acron begins to turn her to
stone, petrifying her hand, her wrist, her arm.  Willow
backs away, feeling successful.  But with intense con-
centration of her evil will, Bavmorda fights off the
acron's spell.  It reverses:  her arm, wrist and hand
turn back to flesh.  She crushes the acorn in her
fingers and lets the dust fall to the floor.

                       BAVMORDA
          Is that the extent of your power?

Willow stands there helplessly.  Thunder cracks and
lightning flashes through the open ceiling above the
altar.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

The Tir Asleen rebels, outnumbering and overpowering
the Nockmaar army, fight toward ultimate victory.

Madmartigan battles Kael on the wall outside the
Queen's Tower.  Up and up they go.  A spectacular
swordfight.  Until finally, Madmartigan stabs Kael
through the heart.  kael screeches and falls through
the air into the moat.

Madmartigna hurries toward the top of the tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda looks up at the sky then down at Willow.

                       BAVMORDA
          Place it on the altar.

                        WILLOW
          No.  You can't have her.

                       BAVMORDA
          By ritual, by sorcery, I well draw
          the lightning and send this child
          into the destructive realm.

Willow straightens up, boldly, courageously.

                        WILLOW
          And with my magic I'll send her 
          into the...into the...

He gropes for a word.  Bavmorda laughs at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're no magician.

                        WILLOW
          Into the good.

Bavmorda instantly stops laughing.  her eyes flash.

                       BAVMORDA
          Even I don't have the power to do
          that.  You're a fraud.

Willow suddenly starts chanting, loudly and desperate-
ly.  Raziel opens her eyes and watches.  The chenting
confuses Bavmorda.  Then, Willow cleverly whips the
baby under his legs and behind his back and suddenly
she's gone!

                       BAVMORDA
          Impossible!  Bordak!  Bordak!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.  She lunges across the
copper altar.  Thunder and lightning!

                       BAVMORDA
          Aaaaahhhh!!!

A bright fork of lightning, conjured by her own evil,
shoots in through the ceiling and strikes her.  She
howls in pain.  Her body contorts then bursts into
flame and burns into a shriveling pillar of ash.

Madmartigan breaks open the door and stomrs in.  He
scoops up Sorsha, reviving her with a kiss.

And as if Bavmorda's death has ended evil and oppres-
sion, Raziel stands up with renewed strength.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow...Willow...how...how did you
          do that?

Willow bends down under a nearby chair and picks up the
sleeping baby.

                        WILLOW
          It was just the old disappearing
          pig trick.

Elora Danan's eyes open.  And sunlight floods into the
tower.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Flags fly hihg above the wondrous caslte.  The valley
is lush with flowers, and the kingdom is once abain
alive with happy activity.

At the door of the castle, Willow stnds beside a cute
little white pony.  The court of Tir Asleen has gath-
ered to see him off.  Madmartigan, in robes and armor
worthy of a king, stands proudly beside his queen, Sor-
sha, who holds the baby princess, Elora Danan.

A trumpet blares.  Raziel comes forward from inside the
castle, dressed in druid robes, carrying a sacred BOOK.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow Ufgood.  Take this Book of
          Sorcery.  You are on your way to
          becoming a great magician.

Willow accepts the book.  Everyone applauds.  Willow
smiles gratefully and humbly.  He glances down and no-
tices Rool and Teemo, who have been civilized to a de-
gree with page boy uniforms, fuzzy haircuts, and nifty
little swords.

Madmartigan and Sorsha come forward, with Elora Danan.

                        WILLOW
          Your dream has come true, madmarti-
          gan.

Madmartigan smiles with thanks.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Goodbye, Peck.

Willow has one last look at the baby.  She smiles and
giggles at him.  He happily gives her a kiss.

                        WILLOW
          Farewell, Elora Danan.

Suddenly Willow flies up in the air.  Madmartigan lifts
him onto the pony's back.  Willow and Madmartigan shake
hands warmly.  And Willow rides across the valley of
flowers, everybody waving goodbye to him.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

Musicians stike up a welcoming march.  Willow rides
thorugh his village on his little pony, proudly carry-
ing the sacred book.  The Nelwyn people swarm around
him, wild with excitement and celebration.  Meegosh
runs up, deliriously happy.

The High Aldwin comes forward, beaming with pride, and
honors Willow with a nod of approval.  Willow presents
him with the book.  Old Burglekutt peers out.  His
mouth drops open and he shrinks away from the crowd.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Willow stands up in his stirrups.  He sees Kiaya fight-
ing her way through the crowd to reach him.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!!

He jumps off his pony and runs to her.  They collide,
kiss and embrace.  Then Ranon and Mims jump on their
father and hug him.  Family and friends smother their
homecoming hero with love!

                          Act I

FADE IN:

EXT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

Under gloomy sky a huge fortress looms on a volcanic
mountainside.  From within WE HEAR the agonizing scream
of a woman giving birth.

INT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

The scream continues as WE MOVE THROUGH the grim corri-
dors of the castle TOWARD stairs leading down to a
dungeon.

INT.. DUNGEON - DAY

Silhouetted in sadows, three Nockmaar MINIONS stand
guard.  In a jail cell, sex fully pregnant WOMEN watch
from behind iron bars.  The screaming stops.  There's a
moment of silence.  As WE MOVE INTO another jail cell
WE HEAR a slap and the first cry of a newborn BABY.

In the cell a black-robed DRUID watches intensely as
ETHNA, a midwife, leans over the MOTHER and wraps the
baby in swaddling.

                         DRUID
          Is it a girl?

                         ETHNA
          It is a girl.

                         DRUID
          Show me its arm.

Ethna peels back the swaddling.  On the baby's arm is a
small marking.

                         DRUID
          It's true then.  I must tell Queen
          Bavmorda.

With great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon
stairs.  Ethna gently places the baby on the mother's
breast.  The mother comforst the baby lovingly until it
stops crying.  Then she reaches out and clasps the
midwife's wrist.

                        MOTHER
          Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're
          going to kill my baby.

Ethna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes
her head at the mother.

                         ETHNA
          They'll kill you.

                        MOTHER
          Please save my baby.

Ethna hesitates.  Then decides.  She quickly wraps to-
gether some rags and gives them to the mother.

                         ETHNA
          Pretend this is the child.

                        MOTHER
          Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you.

The mother kisses her baby and hands it to Ethna, who
hides the baby inside the basket of rags.  Ethna car-
ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs.

The mother lies back and sighs with relief.  Then she
hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear.

QUEEN BAVMORDA sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her
black robes flowing behind her.  The druid hurries
alongside.

                       BAVMORDA
          We will start the ritual at dusk.
          You're certain this is the one?

                         DRUID
          It bears the markings.

                       BAVMORDA
          I must see for myself!  Just as the
          omen foretold!

The guards fearfully move aside as Bavmorda enters the
cell.

                       BAVMORDA
          So.  You *were* the one.

                        MOTHER
          Yes.  But nothing you can do will
          stop the prophecy.

                       BAVMORDA
          This child will have no power over
          me....

Bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi-
ously tears them apart.

                       BAVMORDA
                      (furiously)
          Where's the baby!

One of the guards looks up the stairs.

                         GUARD
          The midwife!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.

                       BAVMORDA
          Find that baby!  Use the dogs!
          Sorsha!

Two guards draw swords and charge upstairs.  Bavmorda
grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kill her.

Bavmorda storms away with the druid.  WE SEE the shadow
of the guard move over the terrified mother.  War drums
begin to beat out an alarm.

EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

TITLES BEGIN.  The midwife hurries through swirling
show, clutching the baby.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Nockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate
village, driving ferocious DEATH DOGS into huts,
violently searching for the baby.  The oppressed, poor
VILLAGERS are yanked into the street.  Some of them are
beaten.  One is killed.

The midwife hides behind a hut, still holding the baby,
then runs away from the village.

EXT. GRASSLAND - DAY

Ethna treks across an open grass field.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

She huddles by a fire, exhausted and hungry, her
clothes filthy and torn, and she rocks the crying baby.
She hears dogs howling in the distance.  She clutches
the baby, kicks out the fire, and runs.

EXT. OCEAN CLIFFSIDE - DAY

She scrambles over rocks on a windswept coastline.

EXT. FOREST - DAWN

Ethna runs desperately for her life.  Chasing her are
two vicious DEATH DOGS.  She scrambles across a shallow
river.  She claws at rock and tears away sticks and
driftwood matted together with weeds.  Into this she
places the baby and sets it afloat downstream.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!

The dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the
river.  The midwife claws her way up a steep bank, lur-
ing the dogs.  As they attack her:

                        MIDWIFE
          I don't have her!  No!  No!

She grabs a stick and tries to defend herself, thrash-
ing at the snarling dogs.

From the baby's view, as it floats down the river, WE
SEE the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees.

EXT. DOWNRIVER - DAY - MONTAGE

The little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the
current.  It glances off jutting rocks, tumbles over
rapids, and scrapes under overhanging trees.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

At last the raft catches in some weeks, almost dumping
the baby.

TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS

Suddenly WE HEAR rustling leaves, possibly another
Death Dog.  Then WE HEAR giggling.  Two children, RANON
and MIMS, watch in amazement from the riverbank.

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Holding onto a plow, WILLOW UFGOOD struggles behind a
huge hog.  From a heavy sack slung over his shoulder he
tosses seeds.

                         RANON
          Dada!  We found something in the
          river!

Willow beams with joy as his son and daughter race to-
ward him.  They grab his sleeves and tug him away from
his plow.

                        WILLOW
          I can't run off and play with you
          now.  I've got work to do.

                      RANON/MIMS
          But Dada, you gotta see it!  Hurry!

Willow drops his sack of seeds.  The ugly hog glares at
him like a guilty conscience.  The children squeal with
excitement as their father runs toward the river with
them.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

WE SEE Willow from the baby's view.  His eyes pop open.
He quickly backs his children away.

                        WILLOW
          Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't
          know where it's been.  It could be
          diseased.

                         MIMS
          It's a baby!

                         RANON
          It's not a Nelwyn baby.

                        WILLOW
          No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn
          baby.  It looks like a daikini...

                         MIMS
          Ooh, it's so cute...

                        WILLOW
          Mims!  Get back here!  It might
          bite you.

Willow drags Mims away.  Then the baby starts crying.

                         RANON
          Can't we keep it, Dada?

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely not.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood!

Willow, in a sudden panic, sees BURGLEKUTT in the dis-
tance.  He splashes into the river, grabs the raft,
plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying
baby.

                        WILLOW
          Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect --
          that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon,
          keep this thing hidden...

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Burglekutt's beady eyes spot Willow making a mad dash
for his plow.  Swinging his fat stomach, he angrily
points his walking stick and goes after him.

                         KIAYA
          Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done
          anything wrong!

Willow's wife KIAYA chases Burglekutt across the field,
her beautiful long hair flowing behind her.  Willow
quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all
day.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  What do you think you're
                doing!  I tell the planting seeds
                in this village.

                         KIAYA
          I told him we didn't steal it, Wil-
          low.

Burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of
Willow's sack and shakes them under Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          You haven't paid your debts.  Where
          did you get these seeds?

With pride, Willow puts his arm around his wife.

                        WILLOW
          In the forest.  My family's been
          gathering them since last fall.
          There's no law against that, Bur-
          glekutt.

Suddenly the children laugh in the distance.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!  You left the children
          alone by the river??

In alarm she runs off before Willow can stop her.  Bur-
glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get
          your planting done before the rains
          start.  You're gonna lose this
          land.

He raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes
them down at Willow's boots.  He waddles away toward
two of his MEN who wait by the road.  Then:  Kiaya
SHRIEKS from the river.  Burglekutt stops in his tracks
and shakes his head as if to say "the whole family's
crazy."  Off he trudges.  Willow watches and waits.
Then runs as fast as he can to the river.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Kiaya cradles the baby in her arms.  Willow runs up,
and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his
hips.

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely, under no condition, is
          anyone in this family going to fall
          in love with that baby.

They all fall in love as he speaks.  The children fol-
low Kiaya up on the bank, walking right past Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby.
          Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be
          ignored!

Ignored, Willow huffs after them across his unplowed
field.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow nervously paces as Kiaya pours water in a wood
tub and the children entertain the naked baby with
sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a
magic trick.

                        WILLOW
          This is bad.  If we're caught with
          that little daikini it'll be the
          end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need
          that for the festival.
                (indicates magic cloth)
          Kiaya, what are we going to do?

                         KIAYA
          We're gonna give this baby a bath.

The baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the
bath.

                        WILLOW
          Burglekutt's right.  There's not
          enough time to finish plowing.
          We'll lose everything and I'll end
          up working in the mines.

He shudders at the thought.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, do you think we should take
          her to the Village Council?

                        WILLOW
          No, no!  They'll think it's a bad
          omen.  There'll be a flood or a
          drought or a plague and
          everybody'll blame me for it!

                         RANON
          Look.  What's that?

Willow leans forward.  On the baby's shoulder is a
small branded scar in a circular design.  It only adds
to Willow's fears.

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.  This is trouble.
          I'll talk to the High Aldwin about
          it tomorrow at the Festival.

The baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

The raucous BAND plays as NELWYNS dance and celebrate
amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers.  A
crowd cheers wildly as MINERS battle FARMERS in a tug-
of-war, finally yanking the farmers face-first into a
puddle of mud.  On a stage a HARLEQUIN dances delight-
fully.  While on a raised platform the five members of
the VILLAGE COUNCIL sit and observe, mildly amused.
The head councilman is Burglekutt.

The WE SEE Willow on another stage.  He flourishes his
colorful sticks and cloths.  In the audience WE NOTICE
his friend MEEGOSH, who wears a miner's apron, rooting
Willow on.

                        WILLOW
          And now!  For our final amazing bit
          of magic, I will make an entire pig
          completely disappear!

Meegosh applauds as Mims and Ranon trot out lugging a
tiny baby pig in a crate.  As Willow takes the pig out
it bites his hand and gets away.  Willow tackles and
squashes it.  The crowd laughs and half of them leave,
and Meegosh covers his face.

Mims and Ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket.  Willow
cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his
back and suddenly it's gone!  Impresse, the crowd
gasps.  Then the pig squeals and dashes through
Willow's legs and leaps off the stage.

                         CROWD
          Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss!

Burglekutt and the Council shake their heads as Willow,
embarassed, picks up his things.  Meegosh trots up
with the pig under his arm.

                        WILLOW
          Meegosh, I'm in trouble.

                        MEEGOSH
          Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need
          a better pig, that's all.

But as they walk past the Village Council, and Bur-
glekutt sneers down at Willow, Meegosh catches on.

                        MEEGOSH
          Now Burglekutt's got you in the
          squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in
          the mines like me.

                        WILLOW
          Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces.
          That's the last thing I'd ever do.
                     (he shudders)
          I gotta get my crop planted.

                        MEEGOSH
          You know I'll help you as much as I
          can, Willow.

The Village Council members stand up respectfully as
the wise old HIGH ALDWIN hobbles through the adoring
crowd.  Mims and Ranon rush up to Willow with several
other children who are eating candy.

                         MIMS
          Dada, can we get treacle candy?
          Can we, can we?  Please?

                        WILLOW
                     (preoccupied)
          Meegosh, can you watch the chil-
          dren?  I gotta talk to the High
          Aldwin.

                        MEEGOSH
                    (truly amazed)
          The High Aldwin??  Why?

But Willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving
Meegosh with a dozen sugar-charged children and a pig.

Willow desperately pushes past people and finally
reaches the High Aldwin.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  I have to talk to you.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Not today, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          It's a matter of great importance
          to me!

Burglekutt stares angrily from his platform.  Slightly
annoyed, the High Aldwin stops and places his hand on
Willow's shoulder.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Intuition, Willow -- remember?  I
          know you're eager to be my appren-
          tice, Willow.  But today is the
          spring festival.

Suddenly a walking stick is pointed at Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!!
          Willow Ufgood???

His belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging
his councilmen to join in.  Willow shrinks away, em-
barassed.

Then a terrified SHRIEK shatters the festivity.  Music 
stops and people grab their children and run for their
lives.  A DEATH DOG rips a trail of destruction through
the village.

Meegosh holds onto Ranon and Mims.  But when Mims sees
Willow she runs right out into the open.  Willow
charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from
the beast's claws.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!  Bordak!

A loud war cry distracts the dog.  VOHNKAR, the
toughest warrior in the village, leads a charging army
of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks.  Wil-
low and Meegosh grab sticks.  The Nelwyns battle the
Death Dog.  At last, Vohnkar drives a spear through its
chest and it dies hideously.

                        MEEGOSH
          What was it looking for?

                      A VILLAGER
          It said "bordak"!  What does it
          mean?

                      COUNCILMAN
                      (scholarly)
          Baby!  It means baby!  It was look-
          ing for somebody's baby!

Mothers grab their children, people look around the
wrecked village in terror.  There's a haunting silence.

                         MIMS
          Mommy?

Suddenly alarmed, Willow races towrd his distant farm,
his children hurrying behind.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  Kiaya!

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow bursts in and finds Kiaya calmly feeding the
baby.  Relieved, he throws his arms around her.

                        WILLOW
          We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We
          must take her to the Council.

The children run in and they all huddle together, cher-
ishing their precious lives.

INT. COUNCIL BUILDING - DAY

Arguing villagers pack the church-shaped room to the
open door at the back and into the balconies above.
The councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the
High Aldwin seated in a special chair above them.  Tak-
ing charge, Burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with
his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          An evil beast from the outer world
          has invaded our peaceful village,
          looking for a baby!

This only adds to the frenzy.

                      A VILLAGER
          It's a sign!  An omen!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Our crops will die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Silence!  One beast we can kill.
          But there may be more!  And they
          won't give up their search till
          they've found what they're looking
          for!

                        MEEGOSH
          Whose baby is it!

                    OTHER VILLAGERS
          Who's to blame for this!

Amid the chaos the High Aldwin slowly stands up.  As if
he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the
back.

At the back door, holding the baby, Willow tries to
push his way through the jostling crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hand.  It flashes magically.  He
points as he speaks:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Willow Ufgood!  Come before me!

The crowd stands apart as Willow walks the length of
the room.  Kiaya and the children follow part way and
then stand aside next to Meegosh.  Burglekutt simmers
as Willow approaches the platform.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Earlier today you tried to tell me
          something, Willow.

                        WILLOW
                    (bows his head)
          My family found this baby in the
          river, High Aldwin.

The crowd stirs but the High Aldwin silences them with
a simple gesture.  He gazes down at the baby mysteri-
ously.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          A daikini child...
                   (his eyes close)
           ...of some importance, I feel...

                      BURGLEKUTT
          That's what the beasts want!  Give
          it back!

The crowd rumbles, many agree.

                        WILLOW
          They'll kill her!  We can't let
          this baby die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          What do we care!

Burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him.
Almost in a trance:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
           ...importance...yes...this child
          is special...

                      COUNCILMAN
          What should we do?

Instantly, the High Aldwin drops his arms and opens his
eyes.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          This child must be taken beyond the
          boundaries of our village.  All the
          way to the daikini crossroads.

The room goes silent.

                      A VILLAGER
          Who will do that?

                   SEVERAL VILLAGERS
          Vohnkar!  Vohnkar!

Vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and
pounds his chest once with his fist.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The outer world is dangerous and
          corrupt, Vohnkar.  And this baby is
          hunted by blood-hungry beasts.  Are
          you willing to sacrifice your life?

Brave Vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful-
ly.

                        VOHNKAR
          If I go, who'll defend you if other 
          beasts attack?

The crowd rumbles and shouts, and Vohnkar mops his brow
and scuttles away from the platform.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          He's right!  It seems only fair
          that the man to take this baby to
          the crossroads...
                  (walking stick up)
           ...be the very man who plucked
          it...
                 (walking stick down)
           ...out of the river!

All eyes turn to Willow.  Kiaya gasps and Meegosh holds
her back.

                        WILLOW
          I can't do it!  I haven't put my
          crop in!

                     A COUNCILMAN
          You caused this trouble.  You found
          the baby...you get rid of it!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          I nominate Willow Ufgood!

The crowd cheers wildly.  The High Aldwin steps forward
to the edge of the platform.  With a flourish he waves
his arms.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          I will consult the bones!

Something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands.  The
crowd jumps away.  The High Aldwin scatters small bones
across the floor below him.  He leans down and studies
the bones.  Willow looks at Kiaya, who is worried and
afraid.  The High Aldwin speaks softly to him:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones tell me nothing.
                   (he eyes Willow)
          But I must make a decision.  Is
          there love in your heart for this
          child?

Willow hesitates.  He looks at the baby.

                        WILLOW
          Yes.

The High Aldwin bolts straight up, broadcasting:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones have spoken!  Willow?
          The security of this village
          depends on you!

The people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to
leave.  Kiaya and Meegosh and the children push their
way toward Willow, who stands there staring at the
baby.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

Kiaya's hair hangs down her back in a long tight braid.
Near the fire she packs supplies into a travel sack.
On the other side of the fire, Willow diapers the baby.
The house is quiet.

                         MIMS
          Dada?

Willow sets the baby down.  He goes around an opne wall
an sits on his daughter's bed, straightening her blank-
ets and toys.

                         MIMS
          Watch out for brownies, Dada.

                        WILLOW
          I will, Mims.  Goodnight.

He smiles and kisses her.  Then crosses over to Ranon's bed.

                         RANON
          Dada, what's a daikini?

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis are giant people who live
          far far away.

                         RANON
          Are you scared?

Willow shrugs.  Ranon sits up in bed.

                         RANON
          I could be you rguard!  I could
          carry your spear!

                        WILLOW
                       (smiles)
          What a great son you are, Ranon.  I
          wish I could take you with me.  Now
          go to sleep...

Ranon slides down under his blankets.  Willow kisses
him, looks at him a moment, then quietly withdraws to-
ward the fire.

EXT. SACRED HILL - SUNRISE

The silhouette of a distant hill with druid stones on
top.

Carrying the baby, Willow climbs the hill with his fami-
ly.  He wears a papoose rig, supply pack, and a dagger.
He hands the baby to Kiaya, then walks through the
towering stones.  The High Aldwin solemnly looks out at
the distant forest.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Now, you know where you're going?
               (Willow shakes his head)
          Down there, through those trees,
          follow the river.  You'll know the
          crossroads by a big daikini struc-
          ture.  Willow, this is serious
          business.  Don't waste any time,
          the outer world is no place for a
          Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first
          daikini you see, then hurry home as
          fast as you can.

                        WILLOW
          If I'm not strong enough to be your
          apprentice, how can I do this?

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          You're strong enough.  But you're
          going to need courage, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          I don't want courage.  I don't want
          to be a warrior.  All I've ever
          wanted was to do magic, real magic,
          like you!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Real magic, Willow, is simply the
          art of controlling the reality of
          others.  You lack faith in your-
          self.  You must learn to trust your
          intuition.

The High Aldwin picks up a rock.  With intense concen-
tration he squeezes it in his outstretched hand.  Then
throws it in the air.  It changes into a bird and flies
away.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Go in the direction the bird is
          flying.

                        WILLOW
                       (amazed)
          Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd
          turn Burglekutt into a toad!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Waste magic on revenge?  You have
          much to learn, Willow...

The High Aldwin touches Willow's shoulder and turns
away.  The children are playing tag among the stones.
Willow hugs them.  Kiaya places the baby in the papoose.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, we've never been apart.  I
          miss you already.  Take this.  It
          will bring you luck.

Kiaya, whose head is covered with a kerchief, places a
braided necklace on her own hair around Willow's neck.

                        WILLOW
          You cut your hair, Kiaya?

He kisses her.  The adjusts the papoose and heads off
down the hill.  The others wave goodbye sadly.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Kiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her
arms around Willow, tears in her eyes.  At last they
break apart, and Willow begins the journey.

EXT. WOODS - DAY - MONTAGE

Willow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain,
amazed and frightened.  Animals rustle in the brush and
he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking
burrs off his legs.  He hides from a fierce bear.  The
bear sees him and runs away.  Willow hurries along,
shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's
weight.

EXT. ROAD - EVENING

The baby is fussing hungrily.  Willow impetuously digs
a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to
feed her.  Then he hears something.  Sensing danger, he
clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank.  He
hides under a bridge.

NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS on horseback thunder toward the
bridge, led by the knight SORSHA whose face is hidden
under a black helmet and visor.  In the other direction
Willow sees a LIEUTENANT and two DEATH DOGS.  They all
meet on the bridge.  The hideous soldiers are part hu-
man, part beast.

                      LIEUTENANT
          We've patrolled the hills.  This is
          where they killed the nursemaid.

                        SORSHA
          She must have done something with
          the child.  Widen the search!

One of the Death Dogs is chewing on the Lieutenant's
stirrup.

                      LIEUTENANT
          Get away from there!

The dog panics and gnashes at the Lieutenant's arm,
ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth.  Horses
rear.  The Lieutenant draws his sword lightning-fast.
He slices and kills the Death Dog.  The baby begins to
cry but the death-howl of the beast drowns her out as
it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below.
The soldiers gallop off into the woods.

Willow falls back against the riverbank, shrinking away
from the murdered Death Dog which lies bloody and
twisted in the water.  The terrified baby cries in his
arms.

EXT. ROAD - MORNING

A harmless rabbit springs across Willow's path.  Willow
trips over a stone and almost falls flat on his face.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.  Where am I?  I should
          stick you in a tree and go back
          home.
                    (looks at baby)
          I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.

He hurries along the road, looking over his shoulder.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY - MONTAGE

Various VIEWS of Willow and the baby trekking across
vast hills and valleys.

EXT. HILL - DAY

Gasping with exhaustion, Willow staggers up a sloping
hill and drops to his knees.  His eyes brighten.  In
the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden
scaffolding.

                        WILLOW
          That's it.  The crossroads...

He stands and heads toward it cautiously.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The place is disgusting.  Littered with junk, buzzing
with flies, plagued with rodents.  Willow creeps toward
the scaffolding, covering his face against the stench.
From it hang two cages.  In one is a heap of filthy
rags.  In the other a half-clothed skeleton with one
bony arm dangling out.

Willow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted
road.  He shivers with cold.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

Willow waits uneasily, brushing flies off his face.
The baby fusses and squirms.  He peeks inside her
diaper.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

He looks anxiously up and down the road.  The baby's
crying gets worse.  He begins to change her.

EXT. CROSSROADS - SUNSET

Willow finishes building a fire, lighting it with flint
and blowing it into flame.  The baby lies quietly near-
by in a kind fo porta-crib made of papoose and twigs.
Nightfall teems with spooky noises:  crickets, frogs,
bats, owls and howling wolves.  Then a terrible moan
frightens him.

                        WILLOW
          I really hate this.

Not sure where it came from. he backs away from the
fire, under the rag-filled cage.  Suddenly a hand
reaches down and yanks Willow up off the ground!  Wil-
low screams.  The baby cries.  And WE SEE the haggard
unwashed unshaven face of MADMARTIGAN pressing against
the bars of the cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hey, Peck...get me some water...or
          you'll diiiiie...!

Madmartigan shakes Willow like a rag-doll until Willow
nods his head yes.  Then drops him.  Instantly Willow
races around that fire, picking up everything he owns.

                        WILLOW
          I will--I'll getcha water--getcha
          lotsa water--anything you say--!

Willow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the
bushes.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!

He dives headfirst into the weeds.  Madmartigan rattles
his cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a weasely little Peck!
          Gimme some water!

Willow peeks at him and shakes his head.

                        WILLOW
          I'm not coming near you!

They stare at each other across the fire.  Then, Mad-
martigan puts on a very phony smile.

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Good.  How long will it take?

Madmartigan drops the smile and spits at the fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't make me angry, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          You be careful.  I'm a powerful
          sorcerer.  I could turn you into a
          toad just like that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Miserable Pecks.

Willow throws a rock at him.  It bounces off the cage.
Madmartigan sags down into a heap of rags again.

EXT. CROSSROADs - NIGHT

The wind howls through the distant trees as darkness falls.
Willow rocks the baby and eats some bread.  Madmartigan
watches him hungrily, sighing, forlorn, his eyes asking
for pit.  Willow glances at him.  Finally, he can't
take any more and he puts down the baby and pous some
goat's milk in a cup.  He reaches up on tip-toes and
offers the milk to Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's more like it.

Madmartigan snatches the cup and guzzles the milk,
retching horribly at the taste.  Then he tosses the cup
back.

                        WILLOW
          Do any other daikinis ever come by
          here?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Why.

                        WILLOW
          I have to give this baby to some-
          body.

Madmartigan grabs the bars and raises himself up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm somebody.  Lemme out and I'll
          take care of your baby.

He makes little kissing noises to the baby, trying to
be sweet.  However, his teeth are filthy.

                        WILLOW
          No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a
          reason.  I'll wait for somebody else.

Willow retreats to the fire.  Madmartigan whacks the
cage with the back of his hand.

EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT- LATER

By the blazing fire Willow feeds the baby.  WE HEAR
hoofbeats.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Somebody's coming!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!

Excited, Willow tosses more wood on the fire, picks up
the baby and waits.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No, you fool!  Put it out I say!
          Out!

Torches appear up the road.  A horse-drawn wagon
clatters full-speed toward the fire.  WE HEAR load
drunken voices, far from friendly.  Willow quickly
dives into the bushes.

Four boorish PICTS, with tatooed faces and arms, halt
at the crossroads, yelling and waving their torches.
Madmartigan is hidden under his rags.  For fun the
Picts set fire to the skeleton cage.  Then head for the
other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!

He rises up in the torchlight.  The Picts taunt him.

                         PICT
          Whose fire!

They jab their torches at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!  Help!  Stop!

                         PICT
          Where are they?  Where did they go?

Madmartigan points way up the road.  The Picts ride
away.  As they go, they swing his cage and st fire to
the floor of it.  Madmartigan frantically geats the
flames.  His sleeves ignite.

Willow scrambles out of the bushes and scoops up hand-
fuls of dirt, which he chucks at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                  (spitting out dirt)
          Thanks for your help, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          Are you okay?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          As if you care.  I saved your life,
          Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!
                 (points dramatically)
          You wanna give your baby to them??
          They eat babies!

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.

Madmartigan literally licks his wounds, dragging his
parched tongue along the length of his forearm.  Willow
begins to walk away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The world's gone insane.  Good men
          locked in cages, criminals running
          free.  It doesn't pay to be honest,
          Peck.

Willow stops and turns around.

                        WILLOW
          Don't call me a Peck.  My name is
          Willow.

Madmartigan slinks down like a cat and slowly extends
his derty hand through the bars.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, Willow.  I'm Madmartigan.

Willow stares warily at the hand.  Madmartigan smiles.
Willow quickly shakes his hand and jumps away.  Madmar-
tigan laughs in a harmless, friendly way.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You a woodcutter?

                        WILLOW
          Farmer.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic-
          tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me:
          victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor-
          rupt, rotten world.

A rat lumbers out of the darkness and sniffs toward the
baby in the porta-crib.  Madmartigan suddenly points.
Willow screams and chases the rat away.  Madmartigan
shakes his head as solemnly as an undertaker.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Listen, Willow my friend.  I'm
          really a good man.  Give me my
          freedom, and I'll look after that
          baby for you.  Trust me.

After a moment, Willow takes out his dagger.  He stands
on his toes under a cage, reaches up, and hacks at the
chain lock.  Madmartigan's eyes widen over-eagerly.  he
rubs his hands together and licks his lips.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's it--good--good--like that,
          yes, good, good, the chain--that's
          it, come on--come on--!

Willow suddenly steps away.

                        WILLOW
          Nooo, I don't think I should.

Madmartigan goes berserk.  His arms flail and the whole
cage shakes and swings and he bangs his head on the
roof.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!!  Stupid Peck!  I'll kill ya!
          Let me out!

Willow scrambles back to the fire and scoops up the
baby and rocks her in his arms.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAWN

Madmartigan is making something out of scraps of bark
and cloth.  He smiles sweetly as Willow wakes up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Morning, Willow.

Willow turns his back on him and tends to the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorry I yelled at you.  I've been
          in this cage toooo long.  Can't
          think straight anymore.  Owww...!

Willow looks over.  madmartigan pats his arms in pain.

                        WILLOW
          You all right?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

He holds up his arms in agony.  Willow fishes some
gooey jelly out of his sack and smears a gob of it on a
leaf.  He hands it up to Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          See if this helps.

Madmartigan wipes the goo all over his arms.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Aaaaaahhhh.  Better.  Here, I made
          something for the baby.

He holds out a ratlle and shakes it.  Willow accepts
it.

                        WILLOW
          What's inside?

Madmartigan sticks his finger in his mouth and pries it
open as wide as possible.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A tooth.
                   (Willow reacts)
          I'm strving.  I got no used for it.

Noise in the distance.  up the road Willow sees a
MESSENGER charging on horseback.  He gallops right
past, whipping his horse, almost knocking Willow off
the road.  Then another MESSENGER follows with the same
urgency.  Willow grabs the baby and steps out to stop
him.

                        WILLOW
          Stop!  Wait!

The messenger screams a Willow who jumps aside as he
thunders by.  The two horsemen disappear up the road.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                   (with authority)
          Smells like a battle.

                        WILLOW
          Are you a warrior?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The greatest swordsman that ever
          lived.

Madmartigan slices the air with an imaginary sword.
Willow shakes his head and goes back to the baby.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

WE SEE the empty road.  Willow's head pops INTO FRAME.
He grabs the baby.

                        WILLOW
          What's that?  I hear something!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You hear trouble.

                        WILLOW
          What is it?

The horizon rumbles.  Madmartigan cups his ear.  Cyni-
cally:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A hundred horses...five or six
          wagons...  and about six thousand
          fools.

Two CAVALRY OFFICERS gallop into view, raising a plume
of dust.  Then an enormous ARMY appears:  cavalry, foot
soldiers, assault wagons: shields, swords, spears,
raised banners.

The two officers shout orders over the thunderous
clamor of hoofbeats, marching boots and clanking armor.
Charging back and forth, they shepherd the army through
the crossroads.  Willow holds the baby.  Fighting dust
and noise he tries to get the officer's attention.

                        WILLOW
          Sir?  Sir!

                        OFFICER
          Out of the way!

An officer's horse nearly kicks Willow, who scurries
out of the way.  Huddling with the baby, he notices
AIRK THAUGHBAER, a large, muscular, bearded officer,
clearly in charge.  On horseback, Airk breaks file and
rides up to the other officers.

                         AIRK
          Push 'em harder!  No rest at mid-
          day!  We need to make ten more
          leagues by dark!

Shouting orders, the officers split up, charging to the
front and rear of the army.  Airk watches the army
pass.  Willow desperately scrambles up to him.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  Sir!  I have this baby.  We
          found her in our village.  Will you
          take her...?

Huge Airk looks down from his huge horse.  Little Wil-
low holds up the baby.

                         AIRK
          We're going into battle, little
          one.  Find a woman to take care of
          it.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He thought you were a woman, Airk!

Airk snaps hes head around and his eyes flash.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan!  What did you do this
          time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nothing you wouldn't have done it my
          place!

Airk's horse prances menacingly around Madmartigan's
cage.

                         AIRK
          I always knew you'd end up in a
          crow's cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Least I'm not down there herding
          sheep!

Airk laughs sourly and rocks the cage.

                         AIRK
          You're lucky somebody got to you
          first, Madmartigan!  I'd've killed
          you myself after that stunt at
          Land's End!

He swings that cage and starts to ride away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa
          here.

                         AIRK
                  (really sarcastic)
          Hey, remember?  You don't need my
          help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit
          trap like this?  Come on!  I could
          open it for you, but I wouldn't
          wanna insult you!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your
          war for you.

Airk quickly drops the banter and glares at Madmartigan seri-
ously.

                         AIRK
          You're nothing but trouble, Madmar-
          tigan.  And I got plenty of that.
          Stay in your coffin and rot!

Airk spurs his horse and smashes the cage as he charges
off.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll be around long after you're
          dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get
          outa here I'll cut your head off
          and stick it on a pig-pole!

                        WILLOW
          Friend of yours?

Madmartigan snarls down at Willow as the army continues
to march by.  But then he quickly gets cute again.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, little baby...

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

A ghostly wind hants the barren crossroads.  The road
is pocked with hoofprints and wagon tracks.  Willow
shakes his head at the ashes of his dead fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

Madmartigan squeezes his face between the bars of his
cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nobody's gonna take your baby.
          Know why?  Nobody cares...
                        (beat)
          Except me.
                      (wistfully)
          You wanna go back to your farm.
          You wanna go back to your family.
          I could take care of that baby.
          I'll look after her like she was me
          own.

                        WILLOW
          You don't know anything about ba-
          bies.

Madmartigan kneels and straightens up and points up his
finger astutely.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahhh!  But I know a lot of women
          who do.  Why, if I had somebody in
          my life--a little daughter for
          instance--I'd have a reason to
          live...

He clsps his hands together outside the bars, plead-
ing:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow.  You can't let me die here.
          Not when I wanna help you.

Willow looks at the baby in the porta-crib.  Then looks
up the empty road.  Then looks hard at Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          You gotta promise to feed her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I will.

                        WILLOW
          Fresh goat's milk.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Absolutely!

Willow draws his dagger and begins to hack at the
chain.

                        WILLOW
          And give her a bath everyday, and
          don't let her get cold.  And keep
          her diaper changed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Of course!  I promise!

Willow hacks and pries at the chain until it breaks
open.  The bottom of the cage falls out, dumping Mad-
martigan into a heap of rags and dust.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come to Daddy, little darlin'.
                    (picks her up)
          I think she likes me!

Kneeling on the ground, he plays with the baby.  Willow
quickly hitches the papoose to Madmartigan's back and
hands him supplies.

                        WILLOW
          Here are her diaper rags.  And this
          is her milk bladder.  And when she
          cries--she's either hungry or she's
          tired--rock her on your left
          shoulder.  She likes that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good
          hands.  You haven't made a mistake.

Willow takes the baby and kisses her.

                        WILLOW
          Bye.

He puts her in the papoose.

                        WILLOW
                   (to Madmartigan)
          Please take good care of her.

Madmartigan stands up.  He towers above Willow.  He
pats Willow on the head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You've done a great job.  Now you
          go back to your family and get your
          crop in.

Madmartigan smiles, turns, and marches off down the
road.  Willow sighs with relief, his task accomplished.
He watches Madmartigan and the baby disappear over a
hill.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Swinging his arms and whistling a tune, Willow struts
proudly up a gentle hill.

                        WILLOW
          Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's
          come home!  Welcome back, Willow!
          He deserves a medal:  he's quite
          mystical.  For honor, for bravery,
          for his intuitive powers...
                     (he chuckles)
           ...let's make him Apprentice
          Aldwin.  Better still:  High
          Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf-
          good, High Aldwin of---

The baby cries!  Willow spins around.  Flying towrd
him is an incredible VULTURE with enormous winds.  In
its claws it carries the baby, papoose and all.  It
swoops straight at Willow, buzzing him, and Willow hits
the dirt.  He looks up.  To add to the wonder:  riding
the vulutre is an ELF.

                        WILLOW
          Come back here, you!  That's my
          baby!!

The vulture zooms off into the tall majestic trees of
the forest, with the baby crying.  Shouting and waving
madly, Willow gallops after it.

EXT. THROUGH THE FOREST - DAY

Willow tears after the vulture which vanishes in the
towering trees.  As the path narrows, something whis-
tlse past his ear.  Finger-length arrows rain down on
him from every direction, peppering the surrounding
trees.  Some even hit Willow.  He plucks them out as he
races along.

He comes to a fork in the path:  Decision!  He starts
down one way, then slams on the brakes.  He sees ropes
and nets.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no, it's a trap!

He hurries back to the fork and takes the safer route--

                        WILLOW
          Oh noooooo!!

--and gets swallowed by a deadly pit.

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - UNDERGROUND

Willow wakes up as a pail of water hits him in the
face.  His feet and wrists are being bound.  Several
little ELVES are gawking and laughing at him.  They
wear samurai-type outfits and angry little haircuts.

                        WILLOW
                      (focusing)
          Where am I?  Where's the baby?

FRANJEAN, the Elfin king, struts forward arrogantly.
He speaks a haughty, nasal accent resembling French:

                       FRANJEAN
          I am Franjean, king of the world.

Willow struggles against the ropes that bind him.

                        WILLOW
          That baby's my responsibility!

Outraged, Franjean smacks Willow's nose with the
back of his hand.

                       FRANJEAN
          I don't care.  We paid for her.  Go
          back to sleep, monsieur...

As he leaves, Franjean nods to an intense-looking ARCH-
ER elf heavily armed with arrows and a spear.  The
archer dips his spear in a bowl of purple liquid.  He
pricks Willow's arm.

                        WILLOW
          Yeow!
                (he loses consciousness)
          Madmartigan...I never should've
          trusted you...

FADE TO BLACK

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - DAWN

Willow's eyes open.  A wild little face is looking at
him.  A wild little person is standing on his chest.

                         TEEMO
          Tongue.

Too groggy to argue, Willow sticks out his tongue.
TEEMO the brownie crushes a brittle leaf and tosses the
dust into Willow's mouth.  Smacking his lips, Willow
comes around.  He sees, down between his legs, another
brownie named ROOL cutting the ropes.

                        WILLOW
          Who are you?

                         ROOL
          Quiet, you fool!

                         TEEMO
                       (formal)
          We are emissaries of her majesty,
          Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of
          Coshairm.

                        WILLOW
          Queen Cherlindrea?

                         TEEMO
          She requests the presence of your-
          self and the young princess.

                        WILLOW
          Who??

                         TEEMO
          You're the guardian, aren't you?

                         ROOL
          Quit yakking, Teemo.  We gotta get
          outa here!

Willow rolls onto his knees, stands up and bumps his
head on the ceiling.  The fuzzy-headed brownies creak
open the door and becon Willow to follow.  He squeezes
through.

INT. ELFIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND

Like a rabbit warren, compartments branch off the main
tunnel.  Willow scrunches along behind the tip-toeing
brownies.  They hear the baby crying.  They peek
through the door.

Inside a cluttered room they see thebaby crying miser-
ably.  Her tears are being carried to a high level in
tiny buckets on a mechanized wheel, operated by FOUR
ELVES.

                         TEEMO
          Elves!  They're always tormenting
          babies.  They make them cry and
          take their tears.

                         ROOL
          Somebody has to do it.

                        WILLOW
          Why??

                         ROOL
          How else they gonna make dew drops?

The baby shrieks.

                        WILLOW
          I'm getting her out of there!

                         TEEMO
          No!  You let us handle this.  Come
          along, Rool!

Teemo ridiculously pushes Willow away from the door.
With a macho swagger he adjusts his dagger belt, and he
and Rool open the door.

INT. ELFIN TEAR FACTORY

They enter like gunslingers in a saloon.  The four
elves, who are twice their size, turn and face them.
Teemo draws his small dagger.  With confidence he
smiles at Rool.

                         TEEMO
          Watch this.  Right between the
          eyes.

                         ROOL
                    (to the elves)
          He never misses.

Artfully Teemo poises the dagger above his head.  With
all his might he throws.  His dagger flip-flops through
the air and lands at the elves' feet, plink-plunk.

                         TEEMO
          Ooops.  Was that right?  That
          wasn't right.

Suddenly the entire wall implodes.  The elves scream
and panic as Willow comes crashing in like King Kong.
He grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm.

EXT. ELF HOLE - DAY

The brownies scamper out of a hole in the ground where
the elves keep their vultures corralled.

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Hyah!  Hyah!  Git!

They untie th evulture and send them flapping away in
the forest as Willow wiggles out of the elf hole with
the baby.  They run for their lives.

EXT. FOREST - CHASE - DAY

Rool and teemo tear along at incredible speed, Willow
barely keeping up with them.  Little elf arrows shower
the forest as the angry elves chase after them, whoop-
ing and screaming.

EXT. DEEP GORGE - DAY

They skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion.
The elves are shrieking toward them. The only chance
of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge.
The brownies scamper out.  Willow looks down and reels
with vertigo.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go out there with the baby!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
                  (frantically point)
          Elves!!

The elf army pours out of the forest.  Willow holds his
breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of
the tree.  Arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a
drunken tightrope walker toward the middle.  The brown-
ies wait for him.

                        WILLOW
          Ohhh, I hate this.

                         TEEMO
          Take your time.  Don't worry about
          the elves.  They won't come out
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Why not?

                         ROOL
          Because of the trolls.

                        WILLOW
          Trolls?

The brownies console Willow with unworried laughter.

                         TEEMO
          Relax.  They only come out at
          night.

An ugly TROLL snarls up behind Willow.  They all scream
and race for the other side.  Another TROLL pops up to
meet them.  The trolls slink along like possums.  The
brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk.

The elves, meanwhile, flint-start a fire at their end
of the tree.  One troll claws at the brownies inside
the trunk while the other chases Willow across gangling
branches.  Then the baby falls out of the papoose!  She
tumbles and catches on a low branch and Willow races
the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into
the gorge.

One troll catches Rool but can't then get his claw out
of the trunk.  The brownies finally excape.  The tree
burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots.
A troll howls as he falls to his death.  The other
scrambles up the tree and grabs Willow's foot.
Willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll.

Flames lick at Willow as he at last hauls himself to
safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree
goes crashing down in the gorge.

                        WILLOW
          This is not going well.

                         TEEMO
          Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know
          what to do.

Willow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into
the forest.  Hobbling slightly on his bootless foot.

EXT. MAJESTIC FOREST - SUNSET

Fading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful
trees as Willow and the brownies trek into the magical
Fairy Kingdom.  Elora Danan falls into a peaceful
sleep.

EXT. FAIRY KINGDOM - NIGHT

Willow comes to a halt.  His mouth drops open.  The
forest is a luminous Milky Way of dancing, flying
FAIRIES, like fireflies.  The brownies tug at his
pant-legs and whisper.

                         TEEMO
          Come on.  This is a privilege.  No-
          body ever gets called before Her
          Majesty.

Wonder-struck, Willow walks into a clearing where
colorful night-flowers bloom.  He lowers himself onto
an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand.  Other
BROWNIES stand watching, like courtiers.  The tiny
fairies fly up to Willow's face and giggle:  they look
like five-year-old girls, full of mischief and fun.

Suddenly a strange LIGHT begins to throb behind the
trees, peircing the forest with helter-skelter beams.
Willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings
his eyes.

                         ROOL
          Stand up!  It's the queen!

CHERLINDREA, the Fairy Queen, materializes out of frag-
ments of moving light, diaphanous, sylph-like, beauti-
ful.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Willow Ufgood.

                        WILLOW
                       (blinded)
          Yes...?

                      CHERLINDREA
          I hope you are comfortable here,
          inside my kingdom...

Willow says nothing, still batling the bright light.

                         TEEMO
          Talk!  Say something!

                        WILLOW
          I can't see anything--she's too
          bright!

                      CHERLINDREA
          I'm sorry...

The light diminishes, enabling Willow to see the queen.
She is a beautiful vision, with flowing hair and lumi-
nous eyes.  Her magical presence both stuns and
impresses Willow.  She turns to the brownies.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Broke-heart of nightingale for our
          honored guest.

All the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into
action, bustling about, going to work, some even trip-
ping over one another.  They bring Willow a drink in a
delicate cup-shaped leaf, and he takes a sip.

The queen dissolves and reappears near Willow.  She le-
ans down and opens the baby's swaddling and looks at
the mark on the baby's arm.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy
          has come true.

The tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh
with respect and amazement.  Cherlindrea seems to levi-
tate the baby out of Willow's arms, floating her magi-
cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks.  The
brownies and fairies crowd around, with great rever-
ence.

                        WILLOW
          You mean, you know who this baby
          belongs to?

                      CHERLINDREA
          She belongs to all of us.  She is
          the future queen and ruler of all
          kingdoms on earth.

Willow starts to get up.

                        WILLOW
          What a relief.  Now I can go home.

The queen fragments and reappears right in front of
Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          No, Willow.  Your journey has just
          begun.  It has been foretold that
          this child shall bring about the
          downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose
          evil powers have darkened our
          world.  Upon you depends this
          princess's life.

                        WILLOW
          Me?

The Fairy Queen flashes and vanishes.  Willow lowers
himself back down again.  She reappears behind him.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are the guardian, Willow.  You
          must take her to Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          What is Tir Asleen?

Willow can't keep track of her.  She keeps changing her
shape.  The brownies and fairies snicker at Willow's
confusion.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is a distant castle, where a
          great king and queen will look
          after Elora Danan and keep her safe
          until she is old enough to rule.

She is gone again.  Willow looks everywhere, frusturated
by these riddles and mysteries.

                        WILLOW
          Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is
          it?

She reappears again.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The way has been lost in time. But
          there is one person, a druid sor-
          ceress, who might guide you there.
          She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda
          many years ago.  Her name is Fin
          Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You need a warrior for this job.
          I'm nobody.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are very important, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          No I'm not.  Have you really looked
          at me?
                  (jumps to his feet)
          I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

From down at his feet, Rool and Teemo stare up, insult-
ed.

                        WILLOW
                     (continuing)
          Why can't you do it?  You have mag-
          ical powers.

                      CHERLINDREA
          My prsence cannot extend beyond
          this forest.  But I can give you
          these...

Cherlindrea drops three small objects in Willow's hand.

                      CHERLINDREA
          They will protect you.  Use them
          wisely.

Willow looks at them for quite a while.

                        WILLOW
          They look like acorns.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Anything you hurl them at will turn
          to stone.

Willow looks closely at the acorns, then up at the
queen.

                        WILLOW
          They're magic?  Are you serious?

The forest light grows brighter.  The queen looms over
Willow and he again has to shield himself from the
brightness.

                      CHERLINDREA
                       (sternly)
          I am very serious, Willow.  There
          is no time to lose.

Now she intensifies her light so that Willow backs
away, completely covering his face.

                        WILLOW
          But I've got a family to think
          about!  They need me!

The queen swirls around him like a solar wind, blowing
the forest trees, scaring even the brownies.  And then
all of a sudden:  silence.  And total darkness.  ALL WE
SEE, in dim moonlight, is Willow's face, peeking out
from between his fingers.

                        WILLOW
          Hello...?

The queen's voice echoes the forest.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Bavmord'a powers are growing like
          an evil plague.  Soon she will con-
          trol the lives of you children,
          your wife, your village...everyone.

Very gradually and beautifully the firey fairies begin
to flicker, restoring light to the forest.  More light
genlty brightens, bathing the woods, and the Fairy
Queen reappears.  She is holding Elora Danan in her
arms.  The brownies creep out from behind the trees.
All eyes are upon Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The choice is yours.

Willow takes the baby and looks at her for a moment.
He struggles with his conscience.  The fairies and
brownies wait in anticipation.  At last Willow looks up
at them, resolved and determined.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do
          it!

The fairy kingdom sends up a great cheer and applause.
Fairies giggle playfully around Willow's face, and
brownies hug his ankles.

                        WILLOW
          But I only have one shoe.

EXT. WOODED HILL - DAY

WE SEE Willow's feet as he walks along.  He has himself
a brand-new shoe.

Spirits high, he treks in the sunshine, papoose
strapped to his back.  Teemo rides in his pocket, while
Rool straddles the papoose, tickling the giggling baby.

                        WILLOW
          Wait till I tell my children.
          Stuff like this never happens in my
          village.

He digs a magic acorn out of his pocket and tosses it
high in the air.  The brownies gasp.

                         TEEMO
          Hey, careful there!

                        WILLOW
          How do these work I wonder?  I got-
          ta save one to show the High
          Aldwin.

                         ROOL
          Look!  Death below!

Rool points through the trees.  Willow hurries down the
hill to the tree-line.  In the valley below, 200 NOCK-
MAAR SOLDIERS and CALVALRYMEN battle a hundred ragtag
REBEL TROOPS.  From this sage position high on the
hillside, Willow watches in disgust.  Weapons clash and
men fall to their deaths.

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis...

They hear a CLANK behind them.  Willow slowly turns
around.  There is movement in the trees.  The hillside
woods are full of Nockmaar HORSEMEN moving right up next to him.

In the valley, the oupowered rebels are being forced
up the hill toward them.  Willow is suddenly standing
under several large horses and black-armored minions.
He is frozen in fear.

                       HORSEMEN
          Hyaaaaahh!!

Swords flash and the horseman charge!  The brownies
jump and run for their lives.  Willow stumbles and
spins as horse after horse thunders past him, nearly
trampling him and the baby to death.

The Nockmaar reinforcements descend upon the remaining
rebels and crush them.  Willow falls and quickly digs
the baby out of the papoose.  She is shrieking in ter-
ror.  He holds her tight and runs along the tree-line,
following the brownies, while the bloody battle rages
below.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't
          cry, Elora.  Things can't get any
          worse than this...

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Bleak rain dribbles down Willow's miserable face.  Pro-
tecting the baby, he hurries toward a tavern.  The bot-
tom of the building is an open stable with several
horses.  Two burly IRON-WORKERS clank a red-hot wagon
rim, fixing a nearby wagon hitched to a horse.

It's a rough place.  Rool and Teemo peek out of
Willow's pockets.  Upstairs PEOPLE drink and shout.

                         TEEMO
          I'm not going in there.

                         ROOL
          Me neither!

                        WILLOW
          Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What
          could possibly happen?

Suddenly there's a CRASH up above and two PICTS burst
through a balcony and land in the mud, fighting vi-
ciously.  Rool and Teemo duck inside Willow's pockets.
Willow steps around the Picts, dashes through the
stable and up the stairs.

INT. TAVERN - MAIN ROOM - DAY

The place is packed with tattooed PICTS, nomadic FAMI-
LIES, MOTHERS wit BABIES, THIEVES and CUTTHROATS.
Willow enters with the crying baby.

                        WILLOW
          Could you spare some milk for this
          poor hungry baby?

Everyone looks up.  Mopping a table is an ugly BARMAID
as big as a wrestler.

                        BARMAID
          Get outa here, Peck!

                        PATRONS
          A Peck!  Get him out!  Beat it,
          Peck!

They hurl stuff at him and threaten him with their
weapons.  Willow runs along the wall and takes cover
under some stairs.  He pulls open his pocket and peers
down inside.

                        WILLOW
          I could use your help, boys.

Instantly his pocket whips shut and trembles.  Willow
cautiously looks out under the stairs.  He sees a pail
of milk very near some ROUGHNECKS.  Willow puts his
little finger in the baby's mouth, silencing her.  He
creeps out.  And bravely reaches for the milk.

                     TEEMO'S VOICE
          Willow?

Willow slaps his pocket.  Then stretches his arm out
very, very slowly.  And gets the pail and zips back
under the stairs.

                        WILLOW
          This is not fun.

He soaks a rag with milk and feeds the baby.  Catching
his breath, he backs up and leans agains a woodplank
wall.

                        WILLOW
          Woah!

The plank gives way and Willow falls through the wall.

INT. TAVERN - DAY

Willow somersaults into a bedroom near an unmade bed.
Peeking up he sees two women getting dressed in a pan-
ic.  One is a plump-chested WENCH with a pretty face.

                         WENCH
          Hurry!  Hurry!

Very frightened, she looks out the window.  The other
woman, who wears a kerchief over her hair, packs thick
powder and make-up paint on her face.

                   THE OTHER WOMAN
                  (in a gruff voice)
          How do I look?

It's Madmartigan!  Willow pops up like a jack-in-the-
box.

                        WILLOW
          You!!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Where the hell did you come from?

Willow strides toward Madmartigan, holding the baby
like a machine gun.

                        WILLOW
          I trusted you...

The brownies peek out.

                         ROOL
          Who's he?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're crawling with rodents.

The bedroom door explodes open.  In storms a big, mean,
half-drunk raging lug named LLUG.

                         LLUG
          Where is he!!

Madmartigan wraps a muffler around his throat.  The
wench innocently curtsies.

                         WENCH
          There's nobody here except me and
          my, um, cousin.

Llug knocks his wife out of the way and glares susi-
ciously at Madmartigan, who bats his heavily made-up
eyelashes.  He speaks in a high feminine voice.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          How do you do.

Llug sniffs at Madmartigan then fixes his gaze on
Madmartigan's flat chest.  He goes to squeeze him
there, but Madmartigan ducks out of the way and
snatches the baby from Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Give me that baby!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          These Pecks make terrible nurse-
          maids.

                        WILLOW
          Nursemaid?!

Willow angrily jumps up and down, swiping at the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          They get too excited.

With a swing of the hip, Madmartigan butts Willow aside
and maternally puts the baby against his chest.  Llug
houd-dogs him around the room, finally cornering him
and staaring lecherously into his eyes.

                         LLUG
          Wanna breeeeeeed?


Madmartigan protects himself by holding the baby up in
front of his face.  Then he smells the baby.  He winces
and groans.

                        WILLOW
                   (mischievously)
          Time to change her diaper.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time to leave.

Madmartigan throws open the door and dashes out.  But
he doesn't get very far.  Several NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS
push him back in.  Then they grab madmartigan and Wil-
low, and Llug and his wife, and haul them all outside.

INT. TAVERN - HALLWAY - DAY

Madmartigan is slammed against a wall.  The Willow.
Then Llug and his wife.  In the b.g. Nockmaar troops
are rousting the tavern, taking babies away from
frightened mothers and inspecting them.

Heavy bootsteps thud toward them.  Willow looks out and
recognizes Sorsha, the black-helmeted knight from the
bridge.

                        SORSHA
          You!  Are you the mother of that
          child?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No.
           (looks at Llug; in a high voice)
          I mean yes.

Sorsha strides over to Madmartigan, her sword drawn.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

                        WILLOW
          No!  You can't!

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Why not?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Willow)
          Why not?

                        WILLOW
          Because she's sick.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Sorsha)
          Because she's sick.

                        SORSHA
          Give it to me!

Sorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike.
She grabs for the baby.  Instinctively, Madmartigan el-
bows her away, whacking her hard and knocking her off-
balance against a nearby bench.  The soldiers tense up,
pointing their swords and spears.

Sorsha regains her balance.  She rips off her black
helmet.  Long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders.
She is a young woman, and Madmartigan's eyes pop open.
He does his best to keep up his femal facade.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          Gawd...you're...beautiful...

                        SORSHA
          You're not a woman.

Sorsha comes right up to Madmartigan, squinting into
his eyes.  The she rips away his kerchief and muffler.

                         LLUG
          Not a woman??!!

All hell breaks loose.  Llug charges for Madmartigan's
throat.  Madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and
dashes right out the window.  Llug bulldozes Sorsha and
her Lieutenant, and the tavern patrons take advantage
of the chaos and stampede for the stairs.  Willow dives
out the window after Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          After them!!

She grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who
clatter toward the stairs, flinging people out of their
way.

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Madmartigna jumps off the upstairs balcony and lands in
the wagon below.  The two iron-workers look up with
concern.  Then they react with surprise as Madmartigan
rips away his disguise.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Wait!

Up above, Willow charges along the balcony.  Madmarti-
gan juggles the baby and whips the reins.  The wagon
pulls away, iron-workers scrambling after it.  Willow
flings himself off the balcony.  The brownies tumble
out of his pocket.  They all land in the back of the
wagon as it takes off.

It has stopped raining.  In the stable under the
tavern, horses smash together and people fall in the
mud, and the Nockmaar soldiers get tangled up in the
traffic jam.

EXT. ROAD - CHASE - DAY

As Madmartigan lashes the horse, Willow crawls up to
hum and takes the baby.

                        WILLOW
          We could've been killed, Madmarti-
          gan!

In the back, the brownies boucne all over the place
amid wooden kegs and other objects.  When they finally
get their balane they look back in alarm.

Chasing them are two Nockmaar HORSEMEN plus a DEATH DOG
and a war chariot.

Willow ducks low and peeks out, protectively hugging
the baby.  The wagon bounces and flies along, but the
minions are quickly gaining.  Rool and Teemo spring
into action.  They struggle with all their might and
manage to kck small wooden kegs off the back of the
wagon.

The kegs bounce onto the road, and the minions lose
some ground trying to avoid them.  But soon the horse-
men flank the wagon.  One leaps off his galloping horse
and climbs on board.  The other draws an arrow and gets
ready to fire.

Madmartigan is about to be shot between the eyes.  He
quickly rolls into the back.  The archer firse! and
hits the other minion in the chest.  Madmartigna snaps
a wooden stake off the wagon side and smashes
the wounded minion off the wagon:  he crashes onto the
road.

Willow harnesses the papoose to his chest and grabs the
reins.  At the same time the minion archer leaps
aboard.  He and Madmartigan fight in the back.

                        WILLOW
          Heeyah!  Heeyah!

Then there's a terrible howl right beside Willow.  The
Death Dog is leaping alongside the wagon, gnashing and
trying to board.  Willow yanks the reins and swerves
the wagon into the dog, which yelps furiously.  In the
back, Madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the
swerving jolt.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no!

Up ahead Willow sees an exposed tree root in the road.
The wagon is headed straight for it!  The wheel hits
the root hard and Willow is dumped onto the wagon floor
and very nearly goes overboard.

In the back, Madmartigan and the minion keep fighting
as the wagon clatter along out of control.  The Death
Dog catches up again and this time spring aboard.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

The dog snaps at the baby.  Willow scurries under the
wagon seat.  The dog stands up on its hind feet.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

It gets ready to attack.  But WHACK! an overhanging
tree branch hits it and Willow looks up from under the
seat and sees the mangled dog twitching and dangling
from the tree, rapidly disappearing in the distance.

In the back, meanwhile, the minion draws a knife.  Mad-
martigan ducks out of his way, hanging onto a post at
the edge of the tailgate.  The minion comes after him.

Suddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off.
The jolt throws the minion off balance.  Madmartigan
kicks him.  The minion hurtles off the taligate but
holds on, dragged by the wagon.

Rool and Teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large
wooden keg.  Together they yank it.  Untying the keg and
sending it tumbling off the back.  The minion looks up
in horror as the heavy keg crushes him.

But the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along
with one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins
and looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them
is the war chariot!

The Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the
reins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to
twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his
head.

Madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post.
The chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK!
It lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the
chariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up
each other.  At last Madmartigan lets go of the post
and the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the
airl, over a cliff to his death.

                        WILLOW
          Woah...woah...!

Willow tries to stop the horse.  But the wheel col-
lapses and he is thrown off into a ditch.  The brownies
dive overboard.  Madmartigan jumps off and delibrerately
sends the wagon up the road.  He scrambles down into
the ditch and lies flat beside Willow.

Suddenly, hoofbeats thunder and Sorsha and the rest of
her troops gallop past.  Lying flat, Madmartigna raises
his head and sees Sorsha's long flowing red hair.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That girl is a vision.

As soon as the troops are gone, Willow jumps up.

                        WILLOW
          Where's the baby??

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I thought you had her!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Willow!!

The brownies are waving and gesturing madly, pointing
at a heap of boards and rubble that broke off the
wagon.  Willow and Madmartigan race over and start dig-
ging, flinging debris aside.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now Willow, I know you're gonna
          blame me for this but it wasn't my
          fault...!

                        WILLOW
          Elora Danan!

Willow sees the battered, lifeless papoose.  He grabs
it and rips it open.  Madmartigan kneels in the dirt
remorsefully.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          When I left the crossroads, I got
          ambushed by an elf!

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  You saved her life!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I did?

Willow holds up the baby.  She giggles and smiles.
Madmartigan switches gears, boasting:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I mean, of course I saved her life.
          She's almost my daughter, isn't
          she?

Willow bundles the baby and looks up the road.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here before they
          come back.

They hurry off into the darkening woods.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

A campfire blazes.  Willow tends the baby while the
brownies point up at the stars.

                         TEEMO
          Northeast is that way.  We've come
          west and south.  I think.

Madmartigan dumps a big log on the fire, spraying the
brownies with sparks.

                         ROOL
          Watch it!  You're gonna set us on 
          fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not a bad idea.

Madmartigan terrorizes them with a flaming stick.  Then
he squats beside Willow and the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So you're on your way to Tir
          Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you
          this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't
          exist.

                        WILLOW
          Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The Fairy Queen?  And the baby
          here's a princess?  And these two
          rodents are your guides?

He shakes his head sceptically, stretches out and puts
his feet up on a log.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah well...in the morning I think
          I'll be on my way.

He laughs sarcastically.  Willow sets down the baby.  He
takes off Kiaya's necklace and fingers it sadly.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, I need your help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My help?  A great magician like
          you?  You don't need any help.

Willow stares at him angrily.

                        WILLOW
          But you're a great swordsman!

He jumps and starts pacing around the fire.  Rool and
Teemo dive for cover.

                        WILLOW
                      (explodes)
          You're not a warrior, Madmartigan!
          A warrior wouldn't lie there and do
          nothing!

He kicks Madmartigan's boot and knocks his feet off the
log.

                        WILLOW
          We're in trouble!  You've seen the
          big army that's after us!  You're a
          fake!  You're a bum!  You're a--
          you're a coward!!

He picks up a rock and pitches it wildly at the fire,
sending up a shower of sparks.  Madmartigan eyes him
with concern.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What's with you, Peck?

Willow lets it all pour out.  He begins to cry.

                        WILLOW
          I miss my wife!  I miss my chil-
          dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing
          up so fast, he even helps me on the
          farm now!  And little Mims!  If you
          ever saw her sweet little face
          you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd
          *melt*!
                      (sniffles)
          Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't
          know anything about love.  You
          don't know anything about any-
          thing...

Willow sits on the ground, exhausted.  Madmartigan
picks up the baby and sits with her in his lap.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I was in love once, Willow.  She
          had a hold on my heart.  I could
          barely function.
                       (a pause)
          I *was* a great swordsman!  I was
          knighted!  I could have been king!

                        WILLOW
          You?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed
          me.  She robbed me of my dream.

Madmartigan gently rocks the baby and stares at the
fire.  Willow watches him curiously.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll never fall in love again...

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

Willow wakes up and looks around.  The baby is gone.
He panics.  He scrambles a short distance through
some bushes.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Madmartigan!

They've been camped all night near the shore of a LAKE.
Willow finds Madmartigan and the baby bathing happily
in the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Relax, Willow.  We're having fun.

The baby squeals with delight as Madmartigan twirls her
around.  He lifts her yp and carries her to Willow on
the shore.  The brownies crawl thorugh the bushes.
Rool points out at the lake.

                         ROOL
          That's it!  The sorceress lives
          there!

In the middle of the lake is an island with a single
tree.

                         TEEMO
          Are you sure?

                         ROOL
                       (excited)
          Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on
          that island!

Madmartigan lets out a sarcastic, sceptical laugh.
Teemo scratches his head and squints out at the island.

                         TEEMO
          That tree dosn't look like gold to
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gold!!

Madmartigan rubs his chin with sudden interest.

                         TEEMO
          Its branches are supposed to be
          made of gold, solid gold.

                        WILLOW
          How are we going to get out there?

Madmartigan is suddenly pacing and thinking.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll find a way, Willow.  Look
          over there--that looks like a
          village--maybe they've got a boat.
          Come on, what are you waiting for?

Madmartigan runs along the shore toward a small village
in the distance.

EXT. DESERTED FISHING VILLAGE - DAY

Half a dozen decrepit huts sit rotting on the edge of
the lake.  There are no inhabitants, just a lot of dis-
carded junk, including a few battered fishing boats.
But Madmartigan, keeping one eye on the gold tree out
on the island, is undaunted.  He rummages through the
debris, hauling out a fishing boat and shouldering it
toward the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Give me a hand here, Peck!

Willow hoists the baby into the papoose and helps Mad-
martigan.

                          BOY
          What are you doing?

They turn around.  A golden-haired BOY is standing
waist-deep in th elake.  Madmartigan is instantly wary
of him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          It's nothing to do with you.

But the boy looks innocent and harmless, and Willow ap-
proaches him.

                        WILLOW
          We need to get out to that island.

                          BOY
          The island is cursed.

Madmartigan scoffs at this nonsense, grunting and push-
ing the boat into the water.

                        WILLOW
          We've traveled a long way.  We're
          looking for Fin Raziel.

                         TEEMO
          The sorceress.

                          BOY
          She's there.  But you can't go
          there.  The island is cursed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (no patience)
          Yeah?  Who cursed it?

                          BOY
          Queen Bavmorda.  Her powers govern
          the elements.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahh, he's trying to protect the
          gold.  Come on, Willow.  Jump in.

Madmartigan climbs into the boat and grabs an oar,
eager to go.  Willow looks down at the brownies for
help.

                        WILLOW
          What would the Fairy Queen say?

                         ROOL
          She's not here.

                         TEEMO
                       (to Rool)
          Obviously.

                        WILLOW
          Without Raziel we'll never find Tir
          Asleen.
                      (decision)
          We'd better go.

Willow marches to the boat.  Calmly accepting their
choice, the golden-haired boy dives into the lake and
disappears.  Willow and the brownies board the boat,
and Madmartigan poles them away from the shore.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

They row across the placid lake toward the island.

EXT. ISLAND - DAY

They climb onto the rocky shore.  Flies buzz and swarm
around them, and creepy bugs crawl around their feet.
Broken skeletons litter the shore.  Handing the baby
back and forth, Willow and Madmartigan claw their way
up to the large tree.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Hello?  Fin Raziel?

Madmartigan greedily reaches up to touch a branch.

                        RAZIEL
          Get away!  Get away!

A littel animal scurries down the tree and hisses vi-
ciously at Madmartigan, chattering its teeth.

                        RAZIEL
          You'll die!  You'll die!

RAZIEL scampers over to Willow.  Her voice screeches
like a parrot.  She looks like an otter with a bush
tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Who are you!  Who are you!

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to
          find Fin Raziel.

She springs right onto Willow's chest.

                        RAZIEL
          That's me!  Raziel!  Raziel!

Willow looks down at the browines questioninghly.

                        WILLOW
          This can't be right.  This isn't a
          sorceress.  This is some kind of
          animal.

                         TEEMO
          Queen Bavmorda transformed her.

                        RAZIEL
          What do you want!

                        WILLOW
          We need your help.  To take this
          baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin-
          cess.

Still sceptical, Willow shows Raziel the baby's mark.
Raziel shoots up onto a branch and frantically flicks
her tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Elora Danan!

Madmartigan snaps a branch off the tree.  A flock of
birds suddenly screech and fly away.  His eyes bulge.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Rool!  Teemo!  You were right!
          This whole tree is made of gold!!

He strips away the bark, revealing a vein of gold.

                        RAZIEL
          Fools!  You should never have come
          to this place!  We're all going to
          die!

The wind begins to blow and the sky darkens.  Raziel
zips over to Willow and whispers intensely.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got to get off this island
          right now.  Hurry!  The boat!  It's
          our only chance!

The wind howls.  they hurry down to the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!

Madmartigan is greedily breaking branches off the tree.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Wait!  Gold!  Gold!

Waves lash at the boat as they jump aboard.  Madmarti-
gan loads up with branches.  As they push off, he
scrambles down the rocks.  Just in time he jumps into
the boat as the storm swirls it out into the frothy
lake.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Willow clutches the baby as the raging storm pitches
the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Help, Madmartigan!  The oar!

Madmartigan hangs onto his gold, but pices of it drop
and topple overboard.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My gold!

Suddenly a hand appears on the stern.  The water boy
climbs in.

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

                        WILLOW
          No!

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

Madmartigna hesitates but then smashes the boy back
into the lake.  The boy surfaces like a dolphin.  His
shape begins to change, becoming fish-like, diving and
vanishing.

Then:  he attacks the boat!  He is now a ferocious
shark-like monster.  He chomps the boat and the gold
branches slide into the water.  Madmartigan bashes the
monster with the oar, then grabs an anchor.  The mon-
ster attacks again and Madmartigan jabs its gill with
the anchor.

The monster sinks into the lake.  They all sigh with
relief.  Madmartigan shrugs proudly.  Suddenly the an-
chor line unravels, tangling Madmartigan's legs in
fishing nets and yanking him overboard.

Underwater, Madmartigan swirls behind the monster.  He
pulls himself along the anchor line and finally cuts
himself free with his dagger.

He surfaces and madly swims toward the pitching boat.
Willow reaches out to him.  The monster surfaces and
circles the boat.  Then it attacks Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!  Help!!  Willow!!!

Willow digs out a magic acorn.  But he drops it!  He
fumbles in the leaking boat and finally finds it.  The
monster opens its jaws and goes to devour Madmartigan.
Willow throws the acorn.

The monster miraculously turns to stone.  Madmartigan
grabs the boat and watches in amazement as the monster
sinks.  Willow hauls him into the boat.

EXT. LAKESHORE - DAY

The storm begins to die down as they jump to shore, ex-
hausted.  Madmartigan wears nothing now but a ragged
loincloth.  He falls to his knees, coughing and spit-
ting.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...you...you got...magic...!
          Wait...we could team up...!

He pulls himself up and follows Willow.  Suddenly they
all stop.  Sorsha and her men come out of the woods.

                        RAZIEL
          Flee!  Flee!

The brownies scurry into a hole.  Raziel makes a dash
for it but a soldier skewers her tail with his spear,
dangling her in front of Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Raziel.  Did you think my mother
          would allow you to escape?

Sorsha gestures, and the soldier takes Raziel away.
The lieutenant wrestles the baby away from Willow.  He
gives her to Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          This is what we're looking for.  It
          bears the markings.

Willow panics.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  If there's
          one thing I'm good at, it's charm-
          ing a woman...

He swaggers forward.  Sorsha turns and looks at him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So.  Couldn't live without me, huh?

Sorsha looks up and down at his naked body.

                        SORSHA
          Lose your skirt?  How embarassing.

Madmartigan looks down and adjusts his loincloth.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Still got what counts.

A pause as he smiles at her.

                        SORSHA
          Not for long.

She raises her fist and zap:  Madmartigan is instantly
surrounded by spears and swords.

                        SORSHA
          We'll join the column.  Bring them
          with us.

Madmartigan and Willow are roughly taken away.  Sorsha
and her troops mount horses and ride off.  Rool and
Teemo crawl lup from under a rock.

                         TEEMO
          We gotta follow them.

                         ROOL
          Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any-
          way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's
          go home.

Rool walks off and Teemo grabs him, yanks him back.

                         TEEMO
          Get back here, Rool!

                         ROOL
          Ouch!  Let go of me!

Rool throws a punch, and the brownies somersault into
the bushes fighting each other.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Sorsha and her men now ride with a caravan of fifty
NOCKMAAR TROOPS.  Chained by their necks.  Willow and
Madmartigan walk behind a wagon.  Raziel sits trapped
in a cage on the back of the wagon.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go on...

Willow loses strength, falls and is dragged.  Madmarti-
gan picks him up and carries him on his shoulders.
Sorsha sees this.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, why don't you use your mag-
          ic to get us out of here?

                        RAZIEL
          He's no magician.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He turned that monster into stone!

Raziel peers sternly at Willow, who is eye-level with
her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Did *you* give that acorn its power?

                        WILLOW
          No.

                        RAZIEL
          A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool
          can use it.

Madmartigan shakes his head at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Then you get us out of here.

                        RAZIEL
          I will!  But I need help!

                        WILLOW
          I'll help you...!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I won't.

                        RAZIEL
          You must learn magic.

                        WILLOW
          That's all I ever wanted!

                        RAZIEL
          Then I will teach you.

Sorsha rides up from the rear of the caravan, carrying
the baby, who is crying.  Madmartigan, with Willow
still on his shoulders, straightens up and flirts with
her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nice horse...nice hair...real nice
          hair...I'd say you've got the most
          beautiful hair I've ever--

She flashes her eyes at him.

                        SORSHA
          Wolff wants to boil you in oil.

She nods toward her Lieutenant, who snarls viciously.

                        SORSHA
          Don't tempt me.

She turns away.  The baby squirms and cries.

                        WILLOW
          If you rest the baby on your
          shoulder, she'll stop crying.

                        SORSHA
          Shut up.

Sorsha rides along.  She shifts the baby to her other
shoulder, and she instantly stops crying.  Sorsha
throws a look at Willow.  Madmartigan takes a long deep
breath.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.

                        SORSHA
                    (angry threat)
          My step-father's going to tear you
          apart.

Madmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm torn apart already.  I mean it!
          Under all that armor is a 
          beautiful--

CRACK!  Sorsha whips her horse and gallops ahead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Who is that girl, anyway?

                        RAZIEL
          Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

Madmartigan snaps his finger and discourages himself.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Forget that one, Madmartigan.

Raziel leaps against the bars of her cage, chatters her
teeth and whispers to Willow.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow.  To learn magic, first you 
          must make your own philosopher's
          stone!

                        WILLOW
          What do I need for that?

                        RAZIEL
          We must start with feathers, dung,
          and a lock of your hair.

Willow pulls a strand of his hair out in front of his
eyes and frowns at it.  Madmartigan, meanwhile, can't
take his eyes off Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now that's a woman...!

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Fires and torches burn around pitched tents.  Soldiers
eat and drink, and meat is thrown out to Death Dogs.
From her cage, Raziel looks down at Willow, still
chained to the wagon next to Madmartigan.  Willow is
grinding a substance with a rock.

                        RAZIEL
          Keep working at it.  Forget all you
          know, or think you know.  A
          magician's power depends on disord-
          er of the mind.

She twists her head through the bars.  Madmartigan
squints up at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You got that one covered.

Willow hears the baby crying in a distant tent.

                        WILLOW
          I hope she's all right.  How much
          more do I have to do of this?

                        RAZIEL
          Till it's in a powder.  The energy
          exits within you...

                        WILLOW
                      (reciting)
          I know, and the magician's goal is
          to find his true self.  But what's
          this got to do with it?

                        RAZIEL
          As below, so above.  You hold the
          univers, Willow, in your hand.

Madmartigan clasps his forhead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm beginning to think you two
          *deserve* to be locked up.

                        WILLOW
          The universe is a living creature,
          like you and me, Madmartigan.

Madmartigan cynically gazes at the sky, gesturing wide-
ly.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're a tiny version of all that?

                        RAZIEL
          As above, so below.

Madmartigan rolls his eyes.  Willow jumps to his feet
and shows Raziel the substance.

                        WILLOW
          I'm all finished.  Now what?

                        RAZIEL
          Burn it to a fine ash.

Willow looks around.  Heavily armed Nockmaar minions
rip chunks of meat around a campfire.

                        WILLOW
          How am I gonna do that?

                        RAZIEL
          Patience.  Concentrate.  You will
          find a way.

Suddenly bootsteps clomp toward them.  Willow quickly
folds the powder inside some cloth and hides it in his
pocket.  The Lieutenant marches up and scrutinizes them
suspiciously.  He abruptly snatches Willow up, hacks
the chain and drags him off.

                        WILLOW
          What's going on?

Madmartigan sturggles against his chains.  Angry and
worried:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurt him and you'll answer to me!

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - NIGHT

The Lieutenant clamps irons on Willow's wrists, flings
him into a tent and exits.  Willow looks up and sees
Sorsha, still in her uniform, impatiently pacing wiht
the crying baby.

                        SORSHA
          This baby won't do what I say.  You
          seem to know what to do.  Here!
          Make it shut up.

Sorsha dumps the baby in Willow's arms and then backs
away.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed.

                        SORSHA
          I changed her already!

Willow politely shrugs.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed again.
Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow
changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re-
lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror.
Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the
fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

                        SORSHA
          Who is that horrible friend of
          yours?

                        WILLOW
                  (watching the fire)
          Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Who is he?

                        WILLOW
          I don't know much about him.

Sorsha fiddles with her long red hair.  Willow creeps
toward the fire.

                        SORSHA
          He's very bold.  Do you really
          think my hair is beautiful?

She turns and looks right at Willow.  He looks back.
She asks the question again by holding out strands of
her hair.

                        WILLOW
          Uh, yes.  It's very nice hair.

He suddenly strides over to Sorsha.

                        WILLOW
          She's hungry.

                        SORSHA
          I know she's hungry.  I tried to
          feed her but she wouldn't eat a
          thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.

                        WILLOW
          Here.  Hold her.

He hands Sorsha the baby, then goes to the fire where
there's a stone crock of milk.  He carefully takes his
cloth pouch out of his pocket and unfolds it.  At the
other side of the tent Sorsha awkwardly paces with the
baby.

                        SORSHA
          I tried everything.  A spoon.  I
          poured milk into her mouth, she just
          spat it out.  I don't know what to
          do, I'm not a mother.

During this, Willow ignites his powdery substance.  It
flares slightly then burns to an ash.  He gathers it
up, then returns to Sorsha with the milk.

                        WILLOW
          Sometimes she likes it heated.

Willow finds a strip of cloth, dips it in the milk, and
feeds Elora Danan in Sorsha's arms.  He looks up at
Sorsha and smiles.

                        WILLOW
          She's a good baby.

Sorsha looks down at the baby.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - MORNING

The caravan packs up to move on.  Soldiers drag Willow
to the wagon and lift him on board, chaining him beside
Raziel's cage.  Willow excitedly pats his pocker, and
whispers:

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  I got the ashes!

When the soldiers leave, he digs out the pouch and
proudly shows it to Raziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Good!  The first step is complete.

Chained behind the wagon, Madmartigan reaches forward
and pokes Willow with his finger?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Did she ask about me?

                        WILLOW
          Who?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard
          time.  You were in her ten all
          night.  Did she say anything?

Willow deliberately plays innocent.

                        WILLOW
          She said lots of thing.s

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!

Willow grins.  At last:

                        WILLOW
          She asked about you, Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Well what did she say?

Suddenly Sorsha gallops by on horseback, holding the
baby.  She flings a wad of clothes at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Here.  You're going to need these
          where we're going.

She rides off.  Madmartigan looks down at the clothes.
The looks at Willow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's in love.

                        WILLOW
          You're crazy.  I think you're in
          love.

EXT. SNOW MOUNTAIN - DAY

The Nockmaar caravan climbs into snow-covered moun-
tains.  In the wagon, Raziel is grilling Willow.  He
concentrates hard, cramming, memorizing, straining.

                        RAZIEL
          We don't have much time left!  Go
          on!  Go on!

                        WILLOW
          I must concetrate my
          imagination...to creat a
          new...reality!

                        RAZIEL
          What's the magician's weapon?

                        WILLOW
          The limitless power of...

Raziel flips around in spasms of impatience.

                        RAZIEL
          Your will!  Your will!  What else
          could it be?

                        WILLOW
                     (frustrated)
          I can't remember all these things.
          What am I learning?

                        RAZIEL
          The art of transformation!


                        WILLOW
                     (exasperated)
          But what am I gonna transform??

                        RAZIEL
          Me!

Willow and Madmartigan stare at Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You?

                     MADMARTIGAN
          What are you gonna become, Raziel?
          Queen of the rodents?

Sorsha rides up to the wagon.

                        SORSHA
          The baby's cold.  Take her.

She dismounts.  With care, keeping the baby bundled,
she hands the baby to Willow.  Madmartigan watches and
listens.

                        RAZIEL
          You remind me of your father, Sor-
          sha.

                        SORSHA
          My father was a weakling.

                        RAZIEL
          He was a great king.
                 (Madmartigan reacts)
          Not like your step-father, not like
          your mother.  He ruled Tir Asleen
          with kindness, and a generous
          heart.

                        SORSHA
          My mother calls that weakness.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What do *you* call it?

Sorsha turns and glares at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I do what I'm told.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Too bad you're not more like
          your father.

She looks at him a moment, then abruptly mounts her
horse and rides ahead.

EXT. ROAD TOWARD SNOW CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

The caravan rides toward a large Nockmaar camp.  Death
Dogs howl and fires burn ominously in the distance.
Willow and madmartigan watch as KING KAEL rides out to
meet the caravan.

Kael is huge, powerful and cruel, partbeast, part man,
and he carries a terrible sword at his side.  Sorsha
carefully shows him the baby.  He grabs it from her.

                        SORSHA
          Be careful.

                         KAEL
          Don't tell me what to do.

Kael viciously hits Sorsha, knocking her off her horse.
Madmartgian and Willow watch angrily.  Kail gallops to-
ward camp with the baby under his ar.  Sorsha shakes
away the pain and, humiliated, mounts her horse.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We gotta get the baby out of here.

Raziel dashes around her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Tonight!  Complete the
          philosopher's stone!  I must be
          turned back!

Looking off into the camp, angry and resolute, Willow
takes out the ingredients for the stone.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it, Raziel...

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT

Now in a kind of portable cell, Madmartigan clutches
the jail bars and looks out at the camp.  Fires and
torches burn, and Nockmaar soldiers patrol.

Shivering cold, willow sits cross-legged in the jail,
melting snow into a bowl.  On a nearby lean-to, where
skins and shields are kept, Raziel hangs in her cage.

Somewhere the baby is crying.  In the distance Sorsha
goes inside one of the tenst. There's a muffled yel-
ling between Sorsha and Kael.  Then Keal storms out of
the tent and goes inside the tent next door.

Willow pours the ashes into the melted snow.

                        RAZIEL
          Let it settle.  Carefully, slowly.
          Concentration and will.  Now pour
          the water off.

As Willow works, Madmartigan binds together scrap
sticks of wood, making a long pole.  He gingerly hooks
Raziel's cage with this, lifting it from the spike.

                        WILLOW
          Oooh, this smells terrible.

                        RAZIEL
          That's the life spark.  Exxence of
          magic and sorcery!

Madmartigan angles the pole and the cage slide toard
him.  He grabs it with both hands and rips it apart.
Raziel right away scurries down the cell bars, jumps
into the jail and bits Willow's hand.

                        WILLOW
          Ouch!!

                        RAZIEL
          Shhhhh!

They look out nervously at patrolling Nockmaar sol-
diers.  Willow sucks the back of his hand.

                        WILLOW
          What'd you bit me for!!

                        RAZIEL
          We need blood.  To nourish the
          stone.  charge the stone with ener-
          gy.

Willow drips his blood into the concoction then stirs
it with a twig.  It begins to glow from within.

                        RAZIEL
          The components of the stone are
          fusing...

Willow's eyes widen with anticipation.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT - LATER

Fires have burned down.  Most of the camp is sleeping.
It is nearing dawn.  Madmartigan stares out at Sorsha's
tent, deep in thought.  Willow holds up the completed
PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, a red ball of pliable putty.

                        RAZIEL
          Again:  what is the magician's
          weapon?

                        WILLOW
          His will.

                        RAZIEL
          Now use it.

Willow presses the philopher's stone against the
chainlock.  He sheepishly looks over his hsoulder at
Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I just wanted to test it first.

                        RAZIEL
          No!  Change me back into a sor-
          ceress, Willow.

Willow goes to Raziel and concentrates with physical
and mental intensity.

                        WILLOW
          Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha...

It starts to work.  Raziel curls into a ball of fur.
The fur changes to feathers.  She begins to squawk
strangely.  She emerges as a raven-sized bird.

                        WILLOW
          What did I do?

He sags with exhaustion and massages his blistered
hands.  Then: CLINK!  The lock falls open.  They all
look over, and Madmartigan picks it up off the ground.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not bad, Peck.  I'm impressed.  You
          busted the lock.

Wilow clutches Madmartigan's arm.  He holds up the
stone.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get
          Eloran Danan.

With coldness in his eyes, madmartigan stares across
the camp at Sorsha's tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Let's get Elora Danan.

They sneak away.

                        RAZIEL
          Wait!  What about me!

Raziel flaps her wings and flies up into the dark sky.

EXT. THROUGH THE CAMP - DAWN

Willow and Madmartigan sneak behind tents, hiding from
the patrolling guards.  Very quietly they creep up to
Kael's tent.  Madmartigan knocks out a guard and steals
his knife.  They crawl dangerously over to Sorsha's
tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a magician, Willow.  But I'm
          a thief.  Wait here.  I'll get the
          baby.

Madmartigan slits the back of the tent open and slips
inside.  Raziel flutters down and lands on Willow's
shoulder.

                        RAZIEL
          I'm supposed to be a beautiful wo=
          man.

Willow shrugs apologetically.

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - DAWN

Crouched inside the large tent, Madmartigan calculates
his next move.  In the far corner, Sorsha lies asleep.
He steals the baby from a crib of straw.  Starts to
leave.  But stops.  Willow pokes his head inside.

                        WILLOW
                      (whispers)
          Come on, Madmartigan...!

Madmartigan stares over at Sorsha.  Lured by her beau-
ty, he slowly walks toward her bed.

                        WILLOW
          What are you doing?  Get out of
          there...!

Madmartigan looks down at her.  Morning rushlight il-
luminates her youthful face, and her long red hair is
spread across her pillow.  Out of her armor, in soft
nightclothes, she looks like a goddess.  Upon her
breast is a golden necklet, inlaid with ornate jewels.
Quietly:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I love you.

He kisses her lips.  Her eyes open.

                        SORSHA
          One move, and you really will be a
          woman.

Holding the baby, Madmartigan does not move a muscle.
Sorsha holds a knife at his crotch.

                        SORSHA
          You're a fool.  Now put her back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm not going to let this baby die.

Sorsha presses the knife.

                        SORSHA
          Don't make me kill you.

Willow watches as Madmartigna carefully backs away from
Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I believe you would...

Sitting up, Sorsha waves her knife.  Madmartigan places
the baby in the straw crib.

                        SORSHA
          Why did you say that?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Say what?

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Madmartigan walks back to Sorsha' bed.  Willow crawls
into the tent, behind Madmartigan's back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Because it's true.

                        SORSHA
          I don't believe you.

Sorsha defensively kneels on her bed as Madmartigan
walks toward her.  He shows no fear of her knife, com-
pelled instead by honest passion.  For once, he isn't
conning anybody.  His feelings are genuine.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I wish it weren't true.  I swore
          I'd never let this happen.  I hate
          you.  I hate your beauty, I hate
          your innocence, I hate the feelings
          you've awakened in me.

The knife trembles in Sorsha's hand.

                       MADMARTIGAN
          I'm in love with you, Sorsha.  I
          don't want to be, but a power has
          enchanted me and I stand helpless
          against it.  It's torture.  Battle-
          field or prison cell was never half
          as cruel.

He kneels onto her bed.  Her hand falls, her knife
falls to the floor, her chest heaves with fear and emo-
tion.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I want you and I can't have you so
          I want you all the more.  If this
          were another time and another place
          I'd--

He stops.  He looks into her eyes.  Willow dashes out of
the tent with the baby.

                        SORSHA
          You'd what?

Madmartigan takes Sorsha in his arms and kisses her.
Her trembling body surrenders to him.  Until:

They hear a SCREAM outside the tent.  It all happens
quickly.  Kael rips open the canvas and catches them in
their embrace.  In one hand he holds the baby.  In the
other hand:  Willow.

                         KAEL
          What's going on here!!

Sorsha sees the baby, sees the empty crib, and smashes
Madmartigan hard across the face.

                        SORSHA
          Deceiver!!

Kael hurls Willow across the tent and tosses the baby
in the straw.  Growling horribly he lunges at Madmarti-
gan.  Madmartigan rolls away and sees Sorsha's sword
nearby.  Grabs it.  As Kael draws his sword, Madmarti-
gan artfully slices away the center pole, and the en-
tie tent collapses.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - MORNING

Bodies writhe under the fallen mass of canvas, and Ra-
ziel hovers and screeches above.  Then, a silver blade
slits through the tent, and out jumps Madmartigan
wielding Sorsha's sword.

Alarm!  Nockmaar soldiers and Death Dogs charge across
the snow.  Madmartigan battles them with incredible
skill, backing toward the mountain slope.

Wilow crawls out from under the corner of the tent,
clutchign the baby.  Madmartigan kills several so-
diers, littering the snow with bodies and weapons.
Willow reacts, impressed by Madmartigan's swordsman-
ship.  Madmartigan makes the mistake of acknowledging
it:  he bows, prod and cocky.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whoops!

He slips on the ice and catches himself.  Nearby a
shield skids off along the snow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Jump on the shiled!

Kael howls and thrashes inside the collapsed tent.
Then he gashes it open with his huge black sword.  He
sees Willow and the baby get on the large shield.

                         KAEL
          Bowmen!  Horses!  After them!

Madmartigan runs toward the shield.  Archers draw their
bows.  Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha beside Kael.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  I didn't betray you.  I
          love you!

As arrows rain down around him, Madmartigan leaps onto
the shield behind Wuillow.  Sorsha watches them as they
slide away down the mountain, Raziel flapping and
shrieking overhead.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!!

Kael waves his sward and a crack squad of Nockmaar
HORSEMEN gallop down the mountain after the sled-
shield.

EXT. DOWN THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN - DAY

Willow hugs the baby while he sits between
Madmartigan's legs, and the shield zooms down the moun-
tain, zig-zagging through trees.  Madmartigan steers by
using Sorsha's sword as a ski pole.

The Nockmaar horsemen gallop after them.

The shield skips and flies over snowdrifts and bumps.
Raziel squawks in terror above them.  Just missing
trees and rocks, they pick up speek.  Their eyes sud-
denly widen.  Dead ahead is a huge wall of ice!

                        WILLOW
          Nooo!!!

Willow shuts his eyes.  the shield speeds toward the
wall.  At the last moment Madmartigan steers them into
a small opening, little more than a crack.  Raziel,
nearly smashing into the wall herself, soars up into
the sky and loses them.

INT. ICE TUNNEL - DAY

They slide and sway down a long tube of ice, picking up
incredible speed until they loop 360 degrees upside-
down and around and go shooting out a hole at the other
end.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

They soar thorugh the air.  Madmartigan and Willow
shriek in terror.  But Elora Danan giggles:  she's hav-
ing fun!  But in the air the shield goes one way and
they go another, flipping and hanging onto one another
and landing on soft snow with a fffump.  Inertia keeps
them rolling.

Clumped together, they tumble down the mountain, gath-
ering snaw as they go, bouncing and rolling into a
snowball that gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger!

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

The snowball steamrolls toward a small village at the
foot of the mountain.  CHLDREN look up and squeal with
delight while the adult VILLAGERS run for their lives.

It plows through the middle of the village, scattering
peole and animals left and right.  At last it smashes
against a stone house and cracks open like an egg.

Raziel flies down and lands on top of the snowball,
flapping her wings frantically.  madmartigan crawls out
as the villagers rush up.  They stand back in amaze-
ment:  the baby starts crying.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!  Are you all
          right?

Madmartigan drags Willow and the baby out of the snow.
Willow's body is limp, he's unconscious.  Then a VIL-
LAGER points up at the mountain.

                       VILLAGER
          King Kael!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Nockmaar troops!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                    (to villagers)
          Help us.

In the distance Kael and his squad of about 15 horsemen
charge toward the village.  The villagers flee into
their huts and houses.  Madmartigan scoops up Willow
and the baby.  Some villagers usher them around a
corner and into a house just as Kael's army invades the
town.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Madmartigan is bustled underground thorugh a cellar
into a hidden storage room and a disguised door shuts
behind him.  MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN huddle here in
silence, like refugees or criminals.  Madmartigan hands
the crying baby to a WOMAN then lays Willow on the
floor.  Suddenly a huge hand clamps his shoulder:  his
old friend and rival Airk Thaughbaer.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan.  Settled down with a
          family huh?

Madmartigan knocks Airk's hand away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You left me to die, friend.

                         AIRK
          You managed alright.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Is this what's left of your army?

Among the refugees is a handful of war-battered WARRI-
ORS.  One of them, an OFFICER looks out through the
ceiling beams.

                        OFFICER
          Keep that baby quiet.

They hear hoofbeats outside.  Airk gives Madmartigan a
flask of whiskey.  He squirts whiskey into Willow's
mouth and Willow coughs and shudders awake.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Raziel flies onto a rooftop and looks down.  Nockmaar
soldiers flood the village, dismounting, kicking down
doors, searching houses.  Then Raziel sees Kael riding
alongside Sorsha.

In her armor, at a distance, Sorsha looks fierce.  But
CLOSER her eyes show confusion, hesitation.  Kael
watches her closely as he waves his sword at the vil-
lage.

                         KAEL
          Where is it!  Tell us or we'll burn
          your village!  Sorsha!

He shakes her roughly.  She dismounts.  Raziel watches
as Sorsha and two other soldiers enter the house where
Madmartigan and Willow are hiding.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Willow holds the baby tight.  Madmartigan, Airk and the
Officer watch through the cracks.  Boots pound above,
shaking dust down on them.  A door opens.

Nobody breathes.  Willow buries the baby in his chest.
Madmartigan peeks through the door.  Sorsha, alone,
comes down into the cellar.  They see her.  Searching.
Airk's men reach for their swords, begin to draw.
Whisper:

                        OFFICER
          Kill her.

Madmartigam shakes his head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You'll draw the others.

Airk looks at Madmartigan curiously.  Madmartigan
watches Sorsha. She is right there, inches away.
Inaudibly, be says her name.  At last she goes back
upstairs.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Sorsha comes up and begins to leave with the other two
soldiers.

INT. CELLAR

In Willow's arms, the baby lets out a cry.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS

Sorsha and the soldiers stop and draw swords.  The
baby's cry is suddenly drowned out by a loud SDRRECH.
Raziel flaps in through a window and flies madly around
the house, cawing and shrieking insanely.  Sorsha and
the soldiers sheathe their swords and leave.

INT. CELLAR

Everyone sighs with relief.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

In the distance the Nockmaar army is setting houses ab-
laze and Kael is terrorizing the fleeing people with
his sword.  Sorsha mounts her horse.  Her attention is
momemtarily caught by a MAN across the street who, from
the back, looks like Madmartigan.  She gasps.  The man
turns around.  She sags with disappointment, spurs her
horse, and rides off.

The deadly squad of Nockmaar horsemen gallops out of
the village.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Madmartigan and Willow come upstairs with Airk and his
men.

                         AIRK
          It's you they're after, Madmarti-
          gan.  What did you do this time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          They're not after me.  They want
          the baby.

Living in the house is a scrawny, shifty-eyed man named
CUTH.  He watches and listens.

                         AIRK
          Who is this baby?

Willow steps forward, both protective and proud.

                        WILLOW
          The princess, Elora Danan.

They all know of her.  They all sigh with respeck and
awe, and they bow.

                        PEOPLE
          The prophecy has come true.

                         AIRK
          Give her to us.  We'll protect her.

Raziel screeches from a ceiling beam.

                        RAZIEL
          Not safe!  Not safe!

Willow looks up at Raziel hopefully.

                        WILLOW
          We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
          She'll be safe there from
          Bavmorda's powers.

Airk looks up at Raziel.  Then down at Willow.  He
clasps Madmartigan's arm.

                         AIRK
          Tir Asleen is a myth.  It doesn't
          exist.

                        RAZIEL
          It does!  It does!  I will show
          you!

Airk impatiently waves the bird away and shoves Madmar-
tigan in the chest.

                         AIRK
          You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?
          I've lost half my men fighting
          Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock-
          maar army.  Now you and this Peck,
          and that magpie up in the rafters,
          are gonna take 'em on alone?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (challenging)
          Then come with us.

Airk angrily stabs his finger at the floor.

                         AIRK
          The war is here!  In towns and vil-
          lages like this!

Airk crosses his arms and turns his back, looking out
at the burning houses and the suffering families.

                         AIRK
          You're chasing a dream.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Just get me some horses.

Airk glares at him furiously.  Then he kicks open the
door and storms out into the street.  Madmartigan and
Willow hurry after him.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Airk and his men, plus some villagers, watch as Madmar-
tigan mounts a large horse.  Then some villagers help
Willow wiggle up onto a small pony.  They sling the
baby over Willow's back and stuff saddlebags with pro-
visions

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Once again, Airk, we say goodbye.

Sadly and cynically, Airk laughs.

                         AIRK
          One day one of us willl stand on
          the other's grave.

They shake hands ruggedly.  Madmartigan nods at Willow
and they head off.  Airk watches them go, clearly am-
bivalent about staying behind.  They ride up the snowy
slope, Raziel circling above.

WE SEE Cuth.  He scratches his filthy beard.  He sneaks
off through the village, in the direction of the Nock-
maar army.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

Snow circles around them as they climb.  Then, oddly,
the mountain becomes warmer, and the snow melts away.
They reach a slope of dark vitreous lava.

                        RAZIEL
          Nockmaar!  Nockmaar!

Far away, at the top of the mountain, looms the ominous
Catsle of Nockmaar.  The black lava flows from it
like a deadly shadow.

EXT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Their horses rear up as they approach the mouth of the
cave.  Raziel waits for them, circling and cawing.

                        RAZIEL
          This way!  The cave!

They dismount and lead the horses.  But the horses pan-
ic, their frightened neighing voices echoing deep in
the gloomy cave, and they break away and run off.

Willow swallows hard.  He and Madmartigan follow Raziel
inside.

INT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Daylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten
lava.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  I can't stand being
          in closed-in places.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Want me to carry Elora?

                        WILLOW
          I'm used to her.  How's she doing?

Willow wears the papoose on his back.  Madmartigan
looks in at the baby's face.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's doing a lot better than we
          are, Peck.

Willow and Madmartigan laugh, which breaks the tension.
Then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat
screeches somewhere and the tension's back.  They keep
going.

INT. DEEPER IN THE CAVE

Hot liquid drips from the ceiling.  Hissing steam bub-
bles from the floor.  they go single-file along a ledge
over a foaming lava pit.  Raziel is squawking way ahead
in the distance.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...this may be a bad time to
          ask this question but...what if
          Raziel's wrong?

                        WILLOW
          She can't be wrong.  She's a very
          very very powerful sorceress.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's a bird, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          That's my fault, not hers.  I've
          got to keep practicing.  I'm still
          in the learning stage but magic,
          Madmartigan, requires concentration
          and--

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Watch it!

                        WILLOW
          Ahhh!

Madmartigan lunges and grabs Willow just as he is about
to fall into the lava pit.  He hauls him to safety.
They gasp with relief. Then they head deeper into the
cave.  They stop.  They hear something.  Something
strange.

Then, something moves on the wall.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

The cave walls come to life.  Down them crawl ugly ROCK
PUFFERS, pillow-sized wall crabs that screech horribly
like bats.  Madmartigan fights them off with his sword.
The Rock Puffers bloat themselves up, tripling their
size.  Madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an
untied balloon.

Suddenly, distant hoofbeats thunder and echo.  Madmar-
tigan flashes his sword and turns around, ready to de-
fend Willow and the baby against the army.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Go, Willow!  Run!  Run!

Willow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder.
At last he turns and runs deeper into the cave.  Mad-
martigan waits.

The Nockmaar soldiers, now increased to eighty, come
charging down the cave.  Kael rides in the lead along-
side the turncoat Cuth.  As they gallop along the
ledge, Cuth makes the mistake of crowding Kael, who an-
grily elbos him, horse and all, into the boiling pit.

The army tramples over the Rock Puffers, which explode
underfoot.  Madmartigan braces himself as they stampede
toward him.  But suddenly the horseman all screech
thir horses to a halt.  The horses rear and back away.

Madmartigan stands there, wondering.  Then suddenly a
shadow looms behind him.  He turns.

The EBORSISK roars and the cave shakes and thunders.
It's an enormous two-headed monster that doesn't like
visitors.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!

He looks around frantically.  Willow is nowhere to be
seen.  Then the baby cries out.  Madmartigan sees them,
cowering behind a rock.  He runs toward them.  The
Eborsisk exhales flames over his head.

                         KAEL
          Go after them!

Soldiers obey Kael and go after Madmartigan.  He fights
them, hacking down a few, while a few others are in-
cinerated by the Eborsisk.  Sorsha's horse rears as she
watches Madmartigan battle for his life.  Archers shoot
arrows, which pierce the Eborsisk and make it even an-
grier.

Willow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket.
A head of the Eborsisk gnashes at Madmartigan.  Madmar-
tigan looks to Willow for help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurry, Willow!  Throw it!

Willow winds up and throws with all his might.  The
Eborsisk blasts a flame, which startles Willow, wreck-
ing his aim.  Madmartigan's eyes pop open and he ducks
as the acorn whistles by his ear.  The acorn bounces
off a rock and flies back, trickles along the ground
and hits a Nockmaar soldier, who is already dead.  The
soldier's body turns to stone.

                        RAZIEL
          Look out!

One of the Eborsisk's heads lunges toward the baby.
Raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monster's
eye as Willow whisks the baby away.

Then Madmartigan leaps up on the Eborsisk.  He climbs
up over its flaming head and drives his sword down
through its skull.  The Eborsisk howls horribly and its
wounded head falls.  Madmartigan topples down its back
and leaps onto a horse, knocking its rider off and, all
in one swashbuckling move, scooping Willow and the baby
up onto the back of the horse and galloping away.

                         KAEL
          After them!!

But as his horsement charge forward, the Eborsisk falls
to its knees, half-dead.  The surviving head blasts the
soldiers with fire.  They rear back on their horses and
continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears.

EXT. CAVE - TIR ASLEEN - DAY

They ride out of the mouth of the dark cave into a lush
valley of flowers.  In the distance stands the beau-
tiful CASTLE OF TIR ASLEEN.  Raziel zooms up out of the
cave an flies above them as they gallop fullspeed to-
ward it.  She soars higher and higher and flies right
over the castle wall.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN CASTLE - DAY

The door of the castle is half open.  Madmartigan and
Willow gallop inside.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Raziel flies down to meet them as they ride into the
castle courtyard.  A haunting wind drones amont TWELVE
PILLARS which look like stone from a distance.

                        RAZIEL
          Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          There's nobody here.

They approach the twelve pillars.

                        RAZIEL
          The Knights of the Pacalcade.  The
          king's bravest warriors.

Suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Kael and his army charge out of the cave and trample
across the valley of flowers.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan rushes to the heavy door and strains to
shut it.

                        RAZIEL
          Turn them back, Willow!

Willow stares at the twelve knights.

                        WILLOW
          How??

                        RAZIEL
          Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur-
          ry!  Invocation!  Release them!

The castle door is rusted and old.  madmartigan heaves
against it.  Outside he can see the army storming to-
ward him.

Willow digs out his philosopher's stone.  He squints
and strains, concentrating his energy.

                        WILLOW
          Beings within, beings without!
          Danu danu walkail funfawtha!

He continues to chant and to concentrate.  One of the
knights comes to life.

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here!
          Look!  You gotta see this!  I did
          it!

                        RAZIEL
          More!  More!

Madmartigan heaves the door shut just as the army
charges up, and he locks it with a huge bolt.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen rear back form the locked door.

                         KAEL
          Assault!  Scale the walls!

He sends his men in all directions.  They leap off
their horses and hack down trees from the nearby woods.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow brings the knights to life, one by one.

                        WILLOW
          Tuatha tuatha danu!

Each knight shakes himself into action.  Madmartigan
follows them in an armory.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!  I transformed them all!
          I'm a magician!

                        RAZIEL
          You didn't transform them, Willow,
          you released them.  That was noth-
          ing.  Now change me.

Willow's on a roll.  He rubs his hands together.

                        WILLOW
          I feel like I could do anything!

He drops to his knees and stretches his philosopher's
stone apart like an accordian.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - ARMORY

Madmartigan and the knights grab weapons and armor.
Two knights wheel a catapult out ot the battlements.
Madmartigan wees, displayed specially on a rack, a com-
plete set of armor of shining silver.  He reaches out
to touch it.

                        KNIGHT
          It belonged to our king.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

The knights light a fire and boil vats of oil.  Willow
struggles to transform Raziel, trying to remember all
he has learned.

                        WILLOW
          Capture the enery...limitless
          power of the will...avvdachh doth
          indicht rredd baerkinhaekin!

Raziel begins to change.  From a bird, she expands,
stretches, and turns into a GOAT.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What
          happened?

Raziel tilts her goat head.

                        RAZIEL
          I hate this.

Suddenly flaming arrows rain down over the castle wall.
Willow scoops up the baby and he and Raziel run for cover.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

From their horses Kael and Sorsha watch as the soldiers
climb the wall.  They suddenly hear a hacking noise
above and several Nockmaar men tumble down the ladders.
Sorsha looks up.

High on the wall stands Madmartigan, magnificently
dressed in the glimmering armor of the King!

Kael roars and points his deadly sword up at Madmarti-
gan.  Then several soldiers attack the castle door with
a huge battering ram and smash it open.

                         KAEL
          Attack!!

Kael and Sorsha gallop into the castle with otehr Nock-
maar horsemen, while Madmartigan continues to battle
attackers on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow looks up as the horsemen charge into the court-
yeard.  He makes a run for the hallway.  SIX HORSEMEN
chase after him, jumping off their horses and drawing
their swords.

Sorsha dismounts, draws a sword, and strides up the
stairs toward teh top of the wall.

INT. ARMORY

Willow runs into the armory and sets the baby down in a
corner.  The six horsement run in and corner him.  He
grabs an enormous broadsword.  Swings it like a base-
ball bat.  The momentum of the heavy sword hurls Willow
across the room.  The blade pierces a Nockmaar man.
Willow grunts and yanks the sword out.  The remaining
soldiers come after him.  Willow swings and flashes the
sword as they close in on him.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

In the courtyard, Raziel the goat butts a few soldiers
as the battle rages.

UP ON THE WALL

Madmartigan stabs a minion and sends him hurtlin down
the wall.  Then he turns around.  Five more enemy
swordsmen slash at him.  Madmartigan is amazing:  spin-
nig, lunging, ducking, he takes out one, two, three,
four of them with ease.  But not the fifth.

It's the Nockmaar Lieutenant.  He and Madmartigan
swordfight.  The Lieutenant hacks the sword out of
Madmartigan's hand: it clatters down into the court-
yeard.

Madmartigan throws up his arm.  The Lieutenant's sword
clangs against his wrist armor, knocking Madmartigan
onto his back.  With two hands the Lieutenant lifts his
sword high and goes to kill Madmartigan.  madmartigan
shuts his eyes.  But nothing happens.

Madmartigan opens his eyes.  the Lieutenant stands
there, frozen, staring at him.  Then falls forward.
Rolls over Madmartigan.  And plummets off teh wall.  In
his place stands Sorsha, holding a bloodied sword.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Madmartigan.

He props himself up on his elbows and smiles.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whose side are you on?

She reaches down and pulls Madmartigan to his feet.

                        SORSHA
          Yours.

They look into each other's eyes.  They go to embrace.

                        MINION
          Arrrggghhh!

Out of nowhere a Nockmaar minion attacks them, his
sword flashing over his head. Sorhsa hardly moves.
She simply dusts him off the wall with her sword.  She
turns back to Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Their armor clanks as they throw their arms around each
other and kiss, high up on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

Kael looks up from his horse.

                         KAEL
          Sorsha!!

He sees Sorsha and Madmartigan coming down the wall,
fighting Nockmaar troops.  Kael holds up his great
hand.  In it he holds the baby.

                         KAEL
          Bordak!

Kael waves his men after Sorsha and Madmartigan.

                         KAEL
          Kill them both!

He laughs viciously then gallops toward the castle
door.  As he reaches it he abruptly stops.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Two hundred HORSEMEN are charging straight toward Kael.
Led by Airk Thaughbaer!

CLOSER, riding in Airk's saddlebags, with their tiny
daggers flashing, are the long-lost brownies, Teemo and
Rool!

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael stuffs the baby deep inside his tunic.

                         KAEL
          Troops!  To Nockmaar!  Ride with
          me!

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan and Sorsha mount horses.  Willow staggers
out of the armory, wounded and bleeding.

                        WILLOW
          I'm sorry.  There were too many of
          them.

Madmartigan scoops him up.  With seven surviving
knights, they ride out.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Many of Kael's men fall in battle.  But Kael and a
dozen horsemen plow through and escape into the cave.

Madmartigan rides up to Airk Thaughbaer and their
horses powerfully dance around each other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Out for a little ride in the coun-
          try, Airk?

                         AIRK
          Thought you might get lonely, Mad-
          martigan!

Then they drop the bravado and clasp hands.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Thank you, friend.

                         AIRK
          Let's go.

They charge into the cave.  The clamor of their
hoofbeats echoes and then fades to silence.  The valley
is littered with fallen soldiers.

Then, Raziel trots out of the castle.  She clip-clops
across the valley and follows the others to the cave.

EXT. VOLCANIC MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen race out of the cave and gallop
up the obsidian mountain toward the dark castle.

The army of Tir Asleen thunders out of the cave in pur-
suit.

Arrows fire back and forth.  The Tir Asleen army stays
right on the enemy's tail.  Willow hangs on to Madmar-
tigan for dear life.

Airk and Madmartigan ride side by side, perfect team-
work, and cut a few Nockmaar ment down.

Then Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha ride up past
everybody.  What a rider she is!  She surprises a cou-
ple of Nockmaar soldiers, swordfighting as she rides,
killing them both.  But she can't catche Kael.  He rides
ahead of everyone else, whipping his horse at an in-
credible speed toward the castle.

The chase continues up the mountain.  The Tir Asleen
army keeps firing arrows at the enemy, or cutting them
down with their swords, until only two Nockmaar men
ride behind Kael.  At last Kael reaches the castle
drawbridge and leaps onto it as it begins to rise.  His
two remaining horsemen leap after him but fall short
and tumble into the dry craggy moat.

The drawbridge shuts with a loud echoing KLUNGG!  Mad-
martigan and Arik screech to a halt on the brink of the
moat.  They look up.  The castle loom, huge, dark,
powerful, evil.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  Any way in there?

Sorsha rides up to his side.

                        SORSHA
          No.  The fortress is protected on
          all sides.

The Tir Asleen warriors, dwarfed by the huge black
wall, look at one another with doubt and worry.

                         AIRK
          Make camp!  We'll assault at dawn.

The army dismounts and begins to unpack supplies.  It
is late in the day and shadows lengthen toward evening.

INT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - LATE AFTERNOON

Kael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up
the gloomy narrowing stairs of the QUEEN'S TOWER.  He
comes to a large door and hesitates a moment, showing
fear.  Then creaks the door open.

INT. QUEEN'T TOWER

BAVMORDA looks up.  Kael cowers, afraid of her evil
power.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kael!

Carved in the floor is a MAGICIAN's CIRCLE, and in the
very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of
shining copper.  Bavmorda stands over the altar, wear-
ing black robes.  Behind her stand two decrepit DRUIDS.
Kael bows.

                         KAEL
          Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child.

The baby squirms and cries.  Seething with hate, Bav-
morda reaches out her arms, then shrinks back.

                       BAVMORDA
          We must start the ritual!

She hears noise outside the castle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who is that?

                         KAEL
          An army of rebels and traitors.

Bavmorda closes her eyes, holds out her hands and feels
the vibrations and energy around her.  Psychically:

                       BAVMORDA
          Where is Sorsha?

                         KAEL
          She has turned against you.

Bavmorda opens her eyes furiously.  to her druids:

                       BAVMORDA
          Purify the altar!  Arrange the im-
          plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha!

The druids take the baby from Kael.  Bavmorda storms
out the door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASLTE - DUSK

The Tir Asleen rebels pitch tents and build fires.
Then they feel a terrible presence and look up at the
castle wall.  Amid torches and hideous minions, Bavmor-
da leers down at them and laughs.

                       BAVMORDA
          This is not an army!

Sorsha looks up, and her mother seems to laugh right at
her.  Madmartigan steps forward.  Seeing him in the ar-
mor of the King, Bavmorda stops laughing, taken aback.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick!
          Hide!

Raziel suddenly butts Willow into a tent.

INT. TENT

Willlow tumbles into the tent and Raziel follows him.

                        RAZIEL
          Get down!  The ritual chant!
          Quick!  Protect yourself!

                        WILLOW
          Why?

                        RAZIEL
          Just do it!

Willow takes out his philosopher's stone and begins to
chant.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE

Madmartigan faces the queen.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn
          her over to us!

Bavmorda stabs her finger down at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You dare to challenge me?  You are
          not warriors.  You're pigs!

She waves her hand, casting a horrible spell over the
army.  Madmartigan's body begins to change its shape.
His armor breaks apart.  He grows hideous.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're all pigs!

The rebel soldiers panic and run.  Slowly, horribly,
they all expand and contort, ripping out of their armor
and clothers, casting down their weapons and shields.

                        SORSHA
          Mother!  No!!

                       BAVMORDA
          You made your decision!

Bavmorda points at Sorsha, and Sorsha, too, begins to
change.  The mountainside becomes a sea of writhing
flesh.  Every one of the Tir Asleen army is transformed
into a pig.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DUSK Bavmorda throws open the
door.  Her druids are binding the baby in a leather
thong.

                       BAVMORDA
          Begin the ritual.  Now!  Light the
          first candle.

A druid lights on of THIRTEEN ENORMOUS CANDLES.  Bav-
morda glares up at the roof.  In the middle of it is a
large circular hole showing the starlit sky.

                       BAVMORDA
          Come, thunder.  Come lightning.
          Touch this altar with your pwer.
          Come into my tower...

Lightning flashes faintly and thunder rumbles in the
distance.  Bavmorda smiles with satisfaction.

A druid places teh baby on the altar.  The other druid
hits a loud gong, once.  Bavmorda enters the Magician's
Circle.  Her face contorts as she recites:

                       BAVMORDA
          Dark runes, dark powers!  Blend and
          bind, bind and blend, Universal
          night!  And the might of Nockmaar!

Magically she produces a razor-sharp knife.  Lightning
flashes again, getting closer.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow is crouched on his knees, chanting with her eyes
closed.

                        RAZIEL
          It's over, Willow.  You did well.
          You protected yourself.

Willow looks up.  He hears the grunting outside.  With
great trepidation, he crawls to the tent door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - OUTSIDE TENT - NIGHT

Willow shudders in horror at the grotesque sight.  Amid
horses and tents and weapons, hundreds of pigs wander
about.  Willow stands and walks through them.  He looks
down at one point and sees Rool and Teemo:  two tiny
baby pigs.  Then he turns and runs back into the tent.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow collapses to his knees beside Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I've come all this way and now
          Elora Dana's going to die!

                        RAZIEL
          No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!

                        WILLOW
          She's too powerful, Raziel

Raziel sternly stamps the ground with her hoof.

                        RAZIEL
          A true magician, Willow, never
          surrenders.  She is a sorceress--I
          am a sorceress!  Transform me now
          and I will destroy her!  Hexagram!

Willow grabs a sword and draws a hexagram around Ra-
ziel.  He steps outside of it, holds up his
philosopher's stone and begins his magic.

                        WILLOW
          Banish all disturbing forces from 
          this place.  Fire, water, above and
          below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal-
          ance.

Raziel begins to change.  Willow wrestles with his own
powers of concentration and will, now and then losing
strength.

                        RAZIEL
                   (voice distorted)
          Don't give up!  Willow!

He chants and strains.  Raziel momentarily changes into
a partly-formed grotesque creature.  Then into a deer.
Then she becomes human.  At last she becomes herself, a
once-beautiful and now elderly woman.  Willow covers
her unclothed body with a simple smock.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!

She looks down at her old hands.  Then her eyes focus
with purpose.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got a lot of work to do, Wil-
          low.  Bring in our brave men.

Willow opens the tent.  Some pigs shuttle in, and Ra-
ziel begins to change them back into warriors.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE -NIGHT

Stationed high on the castle wall, three Nockmaar MIN-
IONS laugh and drink.  Then they hear the terrible
SCREAM of the baby.  They look up at the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

A druid hits the ceremonial gong, twice.  The baby
shrieks.  Standing over her, Bavmorda crushes a piece
of glass with her bare hands and drops the fragments
into a Witch's Bottle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Black fire forever kindled within,
          Let the second right begin!

With a pair of razor-sharp shears she clips the baby's
tiny fingernails and sprinkles them into the Witch's
Bottle.  The bottle glows and sparks, and teh heavens
asnwer with distant thunder.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

In the dark Tir Asleen camp some figures crouch low and
hurry from tent to tent.  CLOSER, the faces of rebel
warriors, watching the castle wall.  Fear.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow, Raziel, Madmartigan, Sorsha, Airk Thaughbaer
and a dozen rebel warriors argue back and forth.

                         AIRK
          Uphill with our rough weapons,
          we'll never make it!

                        SORSHA
          Elora Danan will die!

                        RAZIEL
          By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the
          runic drum!

                        WARRIOR
          Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need
          more forces.  I say we retreat!

The other warriors agree.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda cannot transform you.
          I've protected this camp with a
          spell.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Can you use your magic to get our
          men into the fortress, Raziel?

Raziel shakes her head.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda has shielded it with a
          spell of her own.

The warriors grumble and protest.  In a corner, Rool
and Teemo poke their heads in under the canvas.  Curi-
ously they look at Willow, who sits in silence and deep
though, scratching the ground with his fingernail.

The warriors rumble.

                        WILLOW
          Wait!!

Willow jumps to his feet.  They all turn to him.

                        WILLOW
          I have an idea.  Back in my village
          we catch a lot of hedgehogs.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, this is war, not agricul-
          ture!

                        WILLOW
          I know, I know!  But this is a way
          to get into that castle...

The all gather around Willow to listen.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

Thunder rumbles.  Bavmorda looks up.  Her face is gra-
dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds.
A druid hits the gong three times.  Now three candles
are lit.  The baby screams on the altar.

With a demonic laugh, Bavmorda digs her hands into a
deep vat of blood then raises them over her head.  The
blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black
cloak.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

They all look at Willow.

                         AIRK
          It's too much work.

                        WARRIOR
          It can't be done.

                        SORSHA
          Kael will never fall for it.

Willow looks hopefully at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (doubtful)
          I don't know, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, you promised me you'd
          take care of Elora Danan like your
          own daughter.  She is all that
          matters.  Are you going to abandon
          her?

Madmartigan turns away and scratches his beard.

                         AIRK
          Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna
          listen to a Peck?  You and I are
          warriors.  You know this plan will
          never work.

Frustrated and torn, Madmartigan brushes Airk away.
The men rally with Airk.  Mdmartigan goes over to Sor-
sha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll probably die here, Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          I have no family.

The gong rings four time.  Raziel turns to Airk
and his men.

                        RAZIEL
          If we do not fight, and the baby
          dies, all hope for the future is
          lost.  I shall face the danger
          alone if I have to.

The men shake their heads.

                        WILLOW
          Me, too.

Madmartigan, still torn by indecision, raises his arm
and silences the protest.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time is running out.  We must now
          decide who's going to leave and who
          is going to stay...

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

Light pulsates in the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

The druids cower behind Bavmorda, whose face has taken
on the hideous features of a hellish beast.  The baby
has been streaked with ritual paint.

                       BAVMORDA
          Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak!

Her voice growls a sickening chant, and light shoots
out of her claw-liek fingers, enveloping the baby.  The
baby levitates above the altar in a cocoon of light.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAWN

The sun rises over the volcanic mountain.  The gong
strikes twelve times.  PAN ACROSS the slope outside the
castle.  The Tir Asleen army is gone.  Littered across
the ground are flattened tents, borken wagons an dis-
carded shields.  The wind howls, taking bits of debris
with it.

Alone on the deserted mounatinside stand Willow and Rz-
ziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Time is running out.

                        WILLOW
          Surrender!!

Nockmaar soldiers peer down and laugh.  Willow and Ra-
ziel trek closer to the castle wall.  Willow cups his
mouth.

                        WILLOW
          We are all-powerful magicians!
          Give us the baby or we will destroy
          you!!

The Nockmaar soldiers roar with laughter.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!

The great drawbridge falls across the moat.  Willow
clutches a spear and trembles nervously.

                        RAZIEL
          Patience, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Courage, Willow.

Hoofbeats.  EIGHT HORSEMEN ride out of the castle with
swords high.  Willow lifts his spear with two hands.
Turns.  And smashes the spear on the ground, striking a
loud war drum!

Suddenly Madmartigan leaps out of the ground on horse-
back!

And the entire mountainside comes to life.  Tents and
shields fly away and out of pits and trenches the Tir
Asleen army charges with one loud warcry!

The eight Nockmaar horsemen are quickly cut down.  The
rebels storm across the drawbridge into the castle.
Airk Thaughbaer scoops Willow up on his horse, and Sor-
sha scoops Raziel up on hers.

INT. NOCKMAAR COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Madmartigan leads the assault, cutting down Nockmaar
minions as they run out to defend the fortress.  Sorsha
slides off her horse with Raziel.  Airk sets Willow
down.  Sorsha leads Willow and Raziel into a dark hall-
way.

Rebel warriors storm into the courtyard.  Madmartigan
circles behind Airk, their horses dancing handsomely.

                         AIRK
          Let's squah 'em!

In unison, their swords flash and they charge across
the courtyard chopping down the enemy.

ENT CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

Sorsha hurries Willow and Raziel down a dark hallway.
They come to a corner.

                        SORSHA
          No, Willow!!

She grabs him by the collar and yanks him back.  A huge
DEATH DOG leaps out wiht a gnashing ROAR and Sorsha
kills it with her sword.  Willow sags with relief and
the women grab his hands and haul him further down the
tunnel.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

They come to the gloomy stairs that corkscrew up into
the Queen's Tower.  Willow climbs nervously behind Ra-
ziel and Sorsha.  At the top in THE DOOR.  Light throbs
behind it.

Suddenly they hear a loud SHRIEK and the door shakes
and bangs.  Willow fals to his knees, frozen with
fear.

                        SORSHA
          I will face my mother alone.

Willow and Raziel stay back on the stairs.  Sorsha
climbs to the door.  Courageously, she opens it.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda's monstrous face FILLS THE SCREEN.

                       BAVMORDA
          Sorsha!!

Sorsha recoils in horror.  Bavmorda looks barely human:
she has transformed into a grotesque witch.  She waves
her gnarled hand and her druids attack Sorsha.  Sorsha
kills them.  The baby lies under a deathlike spell on
the copper altar.

                        SORSHA
          I won't let you kill her!

Bavmorda's voice is a demonic growl!

                       BAVMORDA
          You are a weakling.  Like you fa-
          ther!  Can you not see that I am
          about to become all-powerful!

Lightning explodes overhead.  Sorsha lunges for the
baby.  But Bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy
force.

                        SORSHA
          No!!

Pulsating light lifts Sorsha, levitates her across the
room, and drives her toward a wall of spikes.  Just as
she is about to be implaes, another force stops her.
Bavmorda can sense the source of it:

                       BAVMORDA
          Raziel...!!

The door flies open.  The twelve burning candles all
blow out.  There stands Raziel.  Sorsha falls to the
floor, unconscious.  Raziel raises her arms magnifi-
cently.  The sorceresses face each other.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Battle rages.  Madmartigan and Airk lead the assault,
and the Tir Asleen rebels push back the Nockmaar min-
ions.  Down low, where weapons adn bodies fall and
horses clop and stamp, the brownies scurry along in
terror, arms crossed over their heads, looking for
shelter.

Like mice, they dart up some stairs.  Then a huge boot
nearly crushes them.  The dive away and look up.
Towering high above them, Kael lets out a loud warcry.
And brandishes two weapons, a huge sword and a huge
axe.

Madmartigan and Airk turn and see Kael.  They look at
each other.  Like samurai warriors they stand ready.
Kael ralles his weapons and charges toward them.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

Willow creeps toward the door.  It suddenly throbs and
flashes.  He jumps back.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda and Raziel oppose each otehr, circling the al-
tar.  The air between them crackles and sparks with the
concentration of energy between them.

                        RAZIEL
          The baby will be queen.  It has
          been foretold, Bavmorda.

                       BAVMORDA
          My ritual will kill the prophecy!
          Now the child dies with it, its en-
          ergy exiled into oblivion!
                  (lightning flashes)
          You see?  I hold the power of the
          universe!

                        RAZIEL
          Not until your ritual is complete!

                       BAVMORDA
          And who will stop me?  The elements
          are slaves to my command!

She points at the sky.  As if oberying her, lightning
flashes and thunder cracks.

                        RAZIEL
          There is no one who can match your
          sorcery.  Except me!

Raziel waves her arms and light suddenly swirls around
the room.  Bavmorda counters, and chairs come to life,
turning into beasts.  Objects fly about.  The tower be-
comes a storm of chaos and witchcraft.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Kael swings his axe and sword at Airk and Madmartigan.
He roars at his army, and six Nockmaar swordsmen hurry
over to fight with him.  Madmartigan and Airk split up.
Madmartigan battles the six swordsmen.  Airk battles
Kael, who backs Airk up stairs on the castle wall.

Madmartigan fights in the courtyard.  He hears a yell
and looks up.  Kael strikes Airk down.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!!

Airk falls down the stairs.  Madmartigan finishes off
the swordsmen, then runs to him, grabs his bleeding
body.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Airk!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Madmartigan...you're a brave
          warrior...a true friend...a good
          man...

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're gonna win this war, Airk.

An incredible smile lights up Airk's face as he dies.
Madmartigan stands.  Picks up his sword.  And goes up
the stairs after Kael.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

The sorceress continue their battle.  They change
each other into various beasts.  They fight, physically
and magically.

In the midst of chaos, the door opens.  Willow pokes in
his head, reacting in fear.  Then sneaks around the
wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby.

                       BAVMORDA
          As above, so below!  Universe of
          evil, Raziel!  It conquers even
          you!

Bavmorda hurls a final spell at Raziel, crippling her,
throwing her into a corner.  Bavmorda laughs and goes
to the altar.  The baby is gone.

Willow races toward the door with the baby.  The door
suddenly slams shut.  Bavmorda's voice roars out:

                       BAVMORDA
          *Stop!  Bring back that child!!!*

Willow stops.  He turns around.  Bavmorda towers over
him, grotesque, monstrous, poised to destroy Willow
with her magic.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who are you?

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician.

Bavmorda laughs.  Willopw slowly walks toward her.  he
digs into his pocket.  Takes out the last magic acorn.

                        WILLOW
          I'm a *great* magician.

Willow throws the acorn at Bavmorda.  Her hand shoots
out and catches it.  the acron begins to turn her to
stone, petrifying her hand, her wrist, her arm.  Willow
backs away, feeling successful.  But with intense con-
centration of her evil will, Bavmorda fights off the
acron's spell.  It reverses:  her arm, wrist and hand
turn back to flesh.  She crushes the acorn in her
fingers and lets the dust fall to the floor.

                       BAVMORDA
          Is that the extent of your power?

Willow stands there helplessly.  Thunder cracks and
lightning flashes through the open ceiling above the
altar.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

The Tir Asleen rebels, outnumbering and overpowering
the Nockmaar army, fight toward ultimate victory.

Madmartigan battles Kael on the wall outside the
Queen's Tower.  Up and up they go.  A spectacular
swordfight.  Until finally, Madmartigan stabs Kael
through the heart.  kael screeches and falls through
the air into the moat.

Madmartigna hurries toward the top of the tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda looks up at the sky then down at Willow.

                       BAVMORDA
          Place it on the altar.

                        WILLOW
          No.  You can't have her.

                       BAVMORDA
          By ritual, by sorcery, I well draw
          the lightning and send this child
          into the destructive realm.

Willow straightens up, boldly, courageously.

                        WILLOW
          And with my magic I'll send her 
          into the...into the...

He gropes for a word.  Bavmorda laughs at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're no magician.

                        WILLOW
          Into the good.

Bavmorda instantly stops laughing.  her eyes flash.

                       BAVMORDA
          Even I don't have the power to do
          that.  You're a fraud.

Willow suddenly starts chanting, loudly and desperate-
ly.  Raziel opens her eyes and watches.  The chenting
confuses Bavmorda.  Then, Willow cleverly whips the
baby under his legs and behind his back and suddenly
she's gone!

                       BAVMORDA
          Impossible!  Bordak!  Bordak!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.  She lunges across the
copper altar.  Thunder and lightning!

                       BAVMORDA
          Aaaaahhhh!!!

A bright fork of lightning, conjured by her own evil,
shoots in through the ceiling and strikes her.  She
howls in pain.  Her body contorts then bursts into
flame and burns into a shriveling pillar of ash.

Madmartigan breaks open the door and stomrs in.  He
scoops up Sorsha, reviving her with a kiss.

And as if Bavmorda's death has ended evil and oppres-
sion, Raziel stands up with renewed strength.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow...Willow...how...how did you
          do that?

Willow bends down under a nearby chair and picks up the
sleeping baby.

                        WILLOW
          It was just the old disappearing
          pig trick.

Elora Danan's eyes open.  And sunlight floods into the
tower.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Flags fly hihg above the wondrous caslte.  The valley
is lush with flowers, and the kingdom is once abain
alive with happy activity.

At the door of the castle, Willow stnds beside a cute
little white pony.  The court of Tir Asleen has gath-
ered to see him off.  Madmartigan, in robes and armor
worthy of a king, stands proudly beside his queen, Sor-
sha, who holds the baby princess, Elora Danan.

A trumpet blares.  Raziel comes forward from inside the
castle, dressed in druid robes, carrying a sacred BOOK.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow Ufgood.  Take this Book of
          Sorcery.  You are on your way to
          becoming a great magician.

Willow accepts the book.  Everyone applauds.  Willow
smiles gratefully and humbly.  He glances down and no-
tices Rool and Teemo, who have been civilized to a de-
gree with page boy uniforms, fuzzy haircuts, and nifty
little swords.

Madmartigan and Sorsha come forward, with Elora Danan.

                        WILLOW
          Your dream has come true, madmarti-
          gan.

Madmartigan smiles with thanks.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Goodbye, Peck.

Willow has one last look at the baby.  She smiles and
giggles at him.  He happily gives her a kiss.

                        WILLOW
          Farewell, Elora Danan.

Suddenly Willow flies up in the air.  Madmartigan lifts
him onto the pony's back.  Willow and Madmartigan shake
hands warmly.  And Willow rides across the valley of
flowers, everybody waving goodbye to him.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

Musicians stike up a welcoming march.  Willow rides
thorugh his village on his little pony, proudly carry-
ing the sacred book.  The Nelwyn people swarm around
him, wild with excitement and celebration.  Meegosh
runs up, deliriously happy.

The High Aldwin comes forward, beaming with pride, and
honors Willow with a nod of approval.  Willow presents
him with the book.  Old Burglekutt peers out.  His
mouth drops open and he shrinks away from the crowd.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Willow stands up in his stirrups.  He sees Kiaya fight-
ing her way through the crowd to reach him.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!!

He jumps off his pony and runs to her.  They collide,
kiss and embrace.  Then Ranon and Mims jump on their
father and hug him.  Family and friends smother their
homecoming hero with love!

       GUN BARREL LOGO OPENS ON

       GENEVA SWITZERLAND, an unnaturally clean city that melds old
       Europe with new money of both dubious and legitimate source.

       INT. HALLWAY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

       An engraved brass plaque announcing the name of the "private
       banking institute" within.

       INT. PENTHOUSE BANK OFFICE - GENEVA - DAY

       JAMES BOND, dressed impeccably as ever, is being FRISKED by
       three THUGS in Armani suits.  They remove A GUN from inside
       his jacket, a well-concealed knife, a metal case, laying them
       on the desk that separates Bond and...

       LACHAISE...an extremely well-groomed gentleman. Behind him,
       three floor-to-ceiling windows lead out to a rooftop garden.

                           LACHAISE
                 Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond,
                 but you understand, a man in my
                 position..

                           BOND
                 Which is neutral, no doubt.

       Lachaise takes the joke a little tight-lipped.  Gestures for
       Bond to sit.

       A GIRL ENTERS, a gorgeous Swiss bombshell in a pin-striped
       suit.  She pushes a cart. On it are a BRIEFCASE and a box of
       EXPENSIVE CIGARS, which she offers to Lachaise and Bond.

                           LACHAISE
                 It wasn't easy, but I retrieved the
                 money.  No doubt Sir Robert will be
                 pleased to see it again.

       The efficient Cigar Girl brings the briefcase to Bond,
       setting it in his lap and opening it up...inside is a good
       deal of CASH in pound sterling.

                           LACHAISE
                 In the current exchange rate, minus the
                 fees, of course, and certain
                 unforeseeable expenses. Here is the
                 receipt...

       The CIGAR GIRL offers Bond a RECEIPT...

                           CIGAR GIRL
                 Would you like to check my figures?

                           BOND
                 Perhaps later.

       She steps back. Bond reaches for the metal case on the
       desk...the THUGS TENSE...

                           BOND
                 My glasses.

       Lachaise nods.  Bond can have his glasses.

       He puts them on, gives a cursory look at the receipt...an odd
       number in pound sterling, calculated down to the penny:

       3,030,303.03.

                           LACHAISE
                 It's all there.

       Bond folds the receipt, slips it into his WALLET...then, he
       removes the glasses, slowly, deliberately, eyeing Lachaise.

                           BOND
                 I didn't come for the money. The report
                 you sold him was stolen from an MI-6
                 agent, who was killed for it.

       He takes a photo from his jacket and lays it on the desk.

                           LACHAISE
                 I did not get the report from an MI-6
                 agent.

                           BOND
                 Who did you get it from?

                           LACHAISE
                 I am just a middle man. I am doing the
                 honourable thing and returning the money
                 to its rightful owner...

                           BOND
                 And we know how difficult that can be for
                 the Swiss.

                           LACHAISE
                     (controlled fury)
                 Your last chance. Take the money.

                           BOND
                 Your last chance. Give me the name.

                           LACHAISE
                 Stripped of all your weaponry, you still
                 threaten me?

       He nods.  An Armani thug steps up and takes out a gun...

                           BOND
                 Perhaps you failed to take into account
                 my...hidden assets.

       Bond's mouth edges into a smile.  A flicker of doubt on
       Lachaise's face -- as Bond's finger finds a protrusion on the
       tiny arm of his glasses and...

       KABOOM!  The pistol on the table FLASHES...blinding those
       around, they cover their eyes, stagger back...it is a brief
       effect, just enough to disorient the thugs and give Bond his
       opening...

       He KARATE-CHOPS HENCHMAN #1 unconscious, taking his gun.
       Kicks HENCHMEN #2 in the face and throws #3 OUT THE WINDOW
       just as they're getting their bearings.  Now he nestles the
       barrel of his borrowed hand gun into the hollow of Lachaise's
       cheek.

                           BOND
                 The name?

                           LACHAISE
                 I can't tell you...
                     (Bond cocks the gun)
                 Alright, alright! But you must protect
                 me!

       And he freezes.  The handle of a THROWING KNIFE is sticking
       out of his neck.  Bond looks up, catches sight of the CIGAR
       GIRL as she vaults out the broken window and onto THE ROOF.

       Bond rushes to the window...

       EXT. VERANDAH - ROOFS - GENEVA - DAY

       She swings on a WIRE across to another roof, quickly
       disappearing into shadows.

       Bond can hear sirens approaching. He returns to...

       THE OFFICE...he grabs the money and moves fast for the door,
       casually slipping that cigar into his pocket...

       Except Henchman #1 has recovered, blocks his way, gun in
       hand.  He starts to squeeze the trigger -- when a RED DOT
       appears on his chest...another window SHATTERS as a bullet
       zings through and pierces the henchman in the heart.

       Bond looks back once at the shattered window, then heads out.

       INT. BANK - GENEVA - DAY

       Bond appears on the top floor of the grand old building, by
       the elevator.  Looks over the balcony, sees figures on the
       stairs.  Hears the elevator cage start from below.

       Thinking fast, he wrenches open the steel gate, leans into
       the lift shaft, watches the elevator COUNTERWEIGHT as it
       comes down.  Almost nonchalant, he steps out...

       INT. STAIRWELL/ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY

       As the cageful of police rises, Bond is now standing on the
       counterweight, DESCENDING.

       EXT. STREET - GENEVA

       Lunchtime.  Faceless business crowds heading for their brief
       moment of freedom, among them we spot BOND...one of them,
       with a briefcase and a suit and tie...HOLD on his face,
       troubled.

       INT. HOTEL - GENEVA - DAY

       The Cigar Girl enters a huge, high-ceilinged room. Edgy, she
       approaches a BIG MAN standing on a balcony overlooking the
       city.  Propped against the doorframe, an assassin's RIFLE
       with LASER-SIGHT attached. BINOCULARS are on a tripod,
       trained on the rooftop below where we can see cops examining
       the shattered office windows.

       The man turns. Powerful, deadly, with a military haircut.
       There is a raised, red scar of an ENTRY WOUND at his temple.
       It throbs and shifts with the slightest facial expression,
       like an insect living just beneath his skin. One EYE seems
       slightly drooping, deadened. The other eye is sharp and black
       as anthracite.  It is a frightening face. This is RENARD.

                           RENARD
                 What's his name? Our friend from MI-6?

                           CIGAR GIRL
                 James Bond.

                           RENARD
                 One of M's more accomplished tin
                 soldiers.

                           CIGAR GIRL
                 He could identify me.

                           RENARD
                 If it concerns you...kill him.

       He touches her cheek and moves into the room, pouring two
       glasses of wine.

                           RENARD
                 Let's toast this James Bond.  We're in
                 his hands now...

       EXT. RIVER THAMES - LONDON - DAY

       A SEAPLANE swoops over the Millennium Dome, banks along the
       snaking river.

       EXT. MI-6 - LONDON - DAY

       Tate Gallery in background, the seaplane moors beneath the
       vast stepped cake that is MI-6.  Bond exits with the
       suitcase.

       INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - DAY

       CAMERA MOVES with Bond as he enters this secret, hi-tech
       world.  He passes through countless security procedures,
       watched by an attentive staff.

       Bond scoops the money out of the suitcase.  Three million
       sterling in tightly bundled hundreds makes quite a sight.  He
       flicks his finger through the last wad, tosses it down
       wistfully.  A blue light scans it on three axis.

       The money is bundled into a clear plastic bag, put on a tray
       and wheeled through a series of barred enclosures into the
       SECURE ROOM.  Bond hands the suitcase to a STAFF MEMBER.

                           BOND
                 Have this checked, see what you can get
                 off it.

       INT. MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY

       Bond appears, hiding something behind his back.  Moneypenny
       brightens.

                           MONEYPENNY
                 James.  Brought me a souvenir from
                 Geneva?

       He produces the cigar, now in a large phallic TUBE.  Stands
       it end up on the desk.

                           BOND
                 Thought you might want one of these.

                           MONEYPENNY
                     (beat, deadpan)
                 I gave up a long time ago.
                     (nods to M's door)
                 She's in with Sir Robert.

       INT. M'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY

       Bond enters.  SIR ROBERT KING is perched on the edge of M's
       desk.  Two glasses, a bottle of scotch open.

                           M
                 Sir Robert King, James Bond.

       King moves toward Bond with an easy, patrician smile. Bond
       notes a TINY BADGE in his lapel -- like the glass eye of a
       stuffed snake.

                           SIR ROBERT
                 Thanks for getting my money back --never
                 expected to see it again.  You're the
                 kind of man I could use.  Though I won't
                 offend certain parties by asking you to
                 join King Industries.

       King looks to M, smiling.

                           BOND
                 Construction's not exactly my line.

                           M
                 Quite the opposite, in fact.

       She couldn't resist. King smiles at Bond.  As he goes, he
       gives M a respectful kiss on the cheek. The door closes.  M
       turns.

                           BOND
                 Old friend?

                           M
                 Since Oxford. I knew him when he had
                 nothing but a brilliant mind and enough
                 guts to conquer the world. He's a man of
                 great integrity.

                           BOND
                 Who buys classified reports for three
                 million pounds.

       M picks up the report from her desk.  Bond notices it is in
       Russian, with a SEAL from a Russian military agency in the
       corner: MIRATOM.

                           M
                 It's a report on weapons security in the
                 former Soviet Union, which, as you know,
                 is shaky at best.  He's had several
                 instances of sabotage at the pipeline,
                 and he's understandably concerned. He
                 called me the moment he realized its
                 sensitive nature.

       She pours a scotch for Bond.  He drops some ice in,
       thoughtful.

                           BOND
                 Someone was watching over me in Geneva.
                 A guardian angel with a laser sight.

       He stops, rubs his thumb and forefinger together -- a strange
       SIZZLING where he touched the ice.  Realization sinks in.

                           BOND
                 King.

       M sees the seriousness in his eyes -- stabs at the intercom:

       Moneypenny's eyes shoot to the intercom console:

       Sir Robert King and an MI-6 AIDE walk toward SECURITY.

       INT. Q DIVISION, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       Q and his men are working on a strange half-built BOAT
       suspended over a water tank.

                           Q
                 ..the hydro boat can operate in three
                 inches of water...

       He looks up as Bond runs through...

       INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       THE MONEY lies on the tray, wrapped in plastic.

       Sir Robert approaches, two rows of security bars between him
       and the cash.  An official produces a bag and moves toward
       it:

                           SIR ROBERT
                 Thanks, but I'll count it myself.
                     (apologetic, smiles)
                 Lifetime habit.  I'm Scottish.

       INT. LOWER CORRIDORS/SECURITY AREA, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       Bond shoots around the corner just in time to see Sir Robert
       disappearing past the THICK STEEL DOOR of the secure room.

                           BOND
                 Stop!  King!

       INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       The shout is muffled, Sir Robert's more interested in the
       money.

       He continues toward camera, that PIN on his lapel emits a
       serene HUM and we

       KABOOM!  A MASSIVE EXPLOSION.

       INT. LOWER CORRIDORS/SECURITY AREA, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       MAYHEM.  FIRE blasts out of the open doorway just as Bond
       reaches it.  The STEEL DOOR flies toward him.  He dives --

       EXT. MI-6/RIVER - CONTINUOUS

       The building rocks.  SMOKE is pouring from a HOLE that's
       appeared in a lower tier. A wall and a section of roof gone.

       EXT. MI-6/RIVER - CONTINUOUS

       A figure staggers out, shaken.  Catching his breath.  BOND.

                                                            CUT TO:

       ECU CIGAR GIRL

       Lining up Bond with her infra-red telescopic sight.

       ANGLE ON BOND

       In the swirling dust and smoke, he suddenly sees a wand of
       red light, pointing at his chest.

       All instinct, he dives for cover.  Powerful, high velocity
       bullet hits blanket the area.  Bond prepares to return fire,
       scanning around for the source. Through the debris he spots
       an unusual, hi-tech BOAT on the river -- long and narrow and
       low.  A figure on board.  THE CIGAR GIRL.

       ANGLE ON CIGAR GIRL

       She FIRES OFF A ROUND OF SHOTS, forcing Bond back into cover.
       Then she guns the engines and SPEEDS OFF down the Thames.

       EXT. MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       Determined, Bond races back into the wreckage...

       INT. MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       Bond races through the chaos that is MI-6 and into...

       Q DIVISION

       Where he leaps into the prototype BOAT.  Q protests...

                           Q
                 It's not finished!

       Bond looks at the mystifying number of buttons and gadgets
       ...presses something red and...THE BOAT LEAPS OUT, ENGINE
       ROARING...

       EXT. SLIPWAY - RIVER - DAY

       THE 007 THEME KICKS IN AS:

       JAMES BOND, in the Q boat, SHOOTS OUT of the MI-6 rubble and
       onto the Thames.

       EXT. RIVER THAMES - DAY

       Bond can see the Cigar Girl up ahead...he is closing the
       distance.  She catches sight of him in pursuit...

       EXT. CIGAR GIRL - BOAT - DAY

       She pushes the boat to its limit, it roars to a new level of
       speed...the chase is on.

       EXT. THAMES - DAY

       Police speedboats, alerted by the commotion, trail Bond.

       ON THE EMBANKMENT

       Police cars scream alongside, sirens wailing.

       ON THE THAMES

       Bond is losing ground as he and the Cigar Girl weave through
       traffic on the Thames. In a gutsy bid to keep pace, he
       corrals the Q boat into a hair-raising SHORT-CUT, shooting
       off...

       UNDERNEATH A PIER

       He maneuvers the boat under the low pier and emerges EVEN
       CLOSER to his prey...

       EXT. CIGAR GIRL - BOAT - DAY

       The Cigar Girl stops her boat, moving to the back, manning
       her large, rear-mountain MACHINE GUN and taking aim at
       Bond...

       EXT. RIVER THAMES - DAY

       Bond continues at full speed, fearless in the hail of bullets
       ricocheting off the vessel.

       THE CIGAR GIRL Remains calm and cool, shooting with
       precision.

       BOND closes in...

       CIGAR GIRL'S eyes widen as...

       BOND STEERS HIS BOAT RIGHT OVER THE MACHINE GUN AND TURRET...

       Cigar Girl dives out of the way, as her boat becomes a RAMP,
       LAUNCHING the Q boat INTO THE AIR before it dives, nose-
       first, into the Thames.

       EXT. - CIGAR GIRL BOAT - CONTINUOUS

       CIGAR GIRL gets up from the deck and sees BOND, turning his
       boat to close in for the kill...

       She scrambles to the helm and SPEEDS OFF, seeing ahead of
       her...

       TOWER BRIDGE

       Just beginning to open, to allow for passage of a small
       tanker.

       EXT. CIGAR GIRL BOAT

       She streaks toward the bridge, Bond lagging behind...

       ON BOND

       As he looses her boat in the distance, he makes a DESPERATE
       MOVE...he cranks the wheel of his boat and veers off, UP A
       SLIPWAY and into...

       EXT. FISH MARKET

       Where the boat hydroplanes on masses of surface water and
       propels him into

       EXT. LONDON STREET

       The hurtling boat causes mayhem and panic as he wrestles with
       the controls, jetting off the street and straight toward...

       EXT. RIVERSIDE RESTAURANT

       Bond's boat crashes right through it, sending diners LEAPING
       in every direction. The Q boat SHOOTS OUT over the balcony
       and splashes down once more into...

       EXT. THAMES - DAY

       Cigar Girl is now clearly in his sights.  She is amazed to
       see that Bond has managed to overtake her.

       The racing boats dice through an armada of lazy, over-loaded
       BARGES, nearly crashing into the much larger vessels.

       AT EVEN PACE NOW...Cigar Girl attempts to force her way past
       him, but Bond, punching buttons on the console of the Q-boat,
       releases a set of catapulting FLAME CANNISTERS which create a
       massive WALL OF FIRE ahead of them...

       CIGAR GIRL is forced toward the very edge of the river...the
       jig is almost up, and then...

       HER P.O.V.  She spots the launching of a HOT AIR BALLOON from
       the base of the massive MILLENNIUM DOME.

       She skids her vessel to a stop at a nearby pier and quickly
       scrambles out of her boat.

       EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME - DAY

       ...A crowd around a RICHARD BRANSON-like figure about to
       climb into his HOT AIR BALLOON.

       The Cigar Girl, brandishing her gun, forces her way through
       the crowd and LEAPS INTO THE BALLOON CARRIAGE, just ready to
       lift off.  She cranks open the gas nozzles and the balloon
       rises with surprising speed.

       EXT. BOND'S BOAT - DAY

       Bond steers his craft toward a slipway adjacent to the pier
       and SHOOTS UP INTO THE AIR...

       EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME

       An amazing sight...Bond's boat sailing through the air just
       beneath the balloon.  With split second precision he reaches
       up and GRABS ONE OF THE ROPES dangling down from the balloon.

       Bond finds himself being CARRIED THROUGH THE AIR as his boat
       falls away from him, hitting the ground and ERUPTING into a
       ball of flame.

       EXT. HOT AIR BALLOON - CONTINUOUS

       As Bond is carried higher and higher, the Cigar Girl begins
       FIRING AT HIM over the edge of the carriage.

       Bond, with ONE HAND, returns fire.

       CIGAR GIRL then leans over the edge of the carriage and
       begins to SLICE THE ROPE that Bond is hanging from.

       The fibers split and fray away from each other as...

       BOND FALLS, heading straight toward...

       THE MILLENNIUM DOME, which the balloon has drifted over.

       AS HE PLUMMETS DOWNWARD...Bond, never surrendering, still
       FIRES HIS WEAPON up at the balloon. A bullet hits the gas
       tank...

       EXT. BALLOON - DAY

       The BALLOON EXPLODES IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL taking the Cigar
       Girl with it...

       EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME - DAY

       Bond lands with a spectacular thudding bounce, the roof of
       the Millennium Dome breaking his fall.

       EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME ROOF - DAY

       He slides uncontrollably down the slope of the Dome as scraps
       of burning balloon rain down all around, before he FALLS OFF
       THE EDGE of the Dome and lands with a THUD ON...

       THE GROUND BELOW

       He struggles up, wincing in SEARING PAIN as his hand goes to
       his INJURED SHOULDER. He hold it, and looks up, into the sky
       as we zero in on the iris of...

       HIS EYE

       reflecting the massive smoke cloud from the explosion as the
       screen transforms into...

       THE MAIN TITLES

       BAGPIPES.  A chapel atop a green slope overlooking the waters
       of Loch Lomond.

       A long line of mourners files out at the end of a memorial
       service.  They mill about on the lawn, among them,  M, grim-
       faced, BILL TANNER, CHIEF OF STAFF and JAMES BOND, his arm in
       a black sling.

       Bond, ever vigilant, scans the crowd...

       HIS P.O.V.  It's like a state funeral.  Rich and powerful
       people, government ministers, chief executives from around
       the world...and then...

       FAR OFF, on a DISTANT RISE, he sees a BIG MAN, not one of the
       mourners but an isolated observer, standing alone, wearing
       sunglasses and a military haircut.

       The man seems to see Bond looking at him...

                           M
                 Bond, we'll meet you inside.

       Bond looks at her for a brief second...when he turns back,
       the man is gone, like an APPARITION.

       Bond walks off, up the grassy slope, toward the rise.

                                                            CUT TO:

       THE VIEW ACROSS THE VALLEY

       Bond stands on the hill, looking below.  He sees nothing but
       a green carpet, not a tree to hide behind.

       He hears a crunch of leaves...turns...

       HIS P.O.V.  A WOMAN, in mourning black, coming up the hill.
       Her china doll face is both fragile and proud.

                           WOMAN
                 Beautiful, isn't it?

                           BOND
                 Yes.

       She steps up to the ridge with him.  A breeze blows her hair.
       They stare out. The sun's rays have broken the clouds and
       strafe the valley.

                           WOMAN
                 Today, of all days, the sun decides to
                 shine.

                           BOND
                 Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the
                 Man Upstairs.

                           WOMAN
                 A word? I'm sure by now he's engineered a
                 hostile takeover.

                           BOND
                 You knew him well?

       The sun glints off her bejewelled earlobe.

                           WOMAN
                 He was my father.

                           BOND
                 I'm sorry.

                           WOMAN
                 He died before he could complete his
                 lifelong dream.
                     (beat)
                 I intend to finish it for him.

       A voice interrupts them, calling from the estate...

                           OLDER MAN
                 Elektra!

                           ELEKTRA
                 Excuse me.

       She walks away, the wind pressing her dress against her
       delicate figure.  She looks brave and vulnerable as she walks
       back toward her father's grand house.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. LIMOUSINE - TRAVELING - DAY

       M, Bond and Tanner in the rear of a limousine. The vehicle
       swoops through the epic countryside of the Scottish
       Highlands.

                           M
                 Elektra?  Running King Industries?
                     (she broods)
                 I've known that girl all her life. I'm
                 not sure she knows what she's walking
                 into.

                           BOND
                 She's not a girl anymore.

       M looks at Bond. Eyes his sling.

                           M
                 I've scheduled a medical for you.

                           BOND
                 It's barely a scratch. The Dome broke my
                 fall.

                           M
                 Well, at least it turned out to have some
                 purpose.

       Bond gives her a look.

                           M
                 No-one goes into the field on this unless
                 they're 100%.  Dr. Greatrex is waiting.

       EXT. CASTLE THANE - HIGHLANDS - DAY

       The limousine swoops under the portcullis, into a courtyard.

       ADJUST ANGLE to reveal huge antennae and satellite dishes
       within.

       SUPER:  MI-6 REMOTE OPERATIONS CENTRE, SCOTLAND

       EXT. CORRIDOR - CASTLE THANE - CONTINUOUS

       Bond walks through the corridors.  Just before he enters the
       medical room, he removes his sling and casually drapes it on
       a suit of armor.

       INT. MEDICAL ROOM - CASTLE THANE - DAY

       Bond sits on the couch, shirt off, awaits the results of his
       medical.

       The very attractive DOCTOR GREATREX looks at her notes.

                           DOCTOR GREATREX
                 Dislocated collar bone.  If any more
                 tendons snap...
                     (looks up)
                 It won't just be two weeks out of action.

                           BOND
                 I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.

       She moves to him, touches the scarred and bruised bone.

                           BOND
                 It's just a scratch.

                           DOCTOR GREATREX
                 James.  It wouldn't really be...

       His hand comes up, rests on her waist.

                           BOND
                 Ethical?  Can't we just skirt the issue?

       And he pulls down the zip on her skirt.  Flicks the clasp and
       it drops to the floor.  She shakes her head -- as he starts
       undoing the buttons on her shirt.  She's very business-like,
       despite what's happening.

                           DOCTOR GREATREX
                 ...if you showed sufficient...willpower.
                 Promised to slow down.  Cut out running,
                 jumping...shooting.  All kinds of...

       And he pulls her toward him, they kiss.

                           BOND
                 Strenuous activity?

       Her shirt drops to the floor.  She pushes him back, lies on
       him.  Just wearing knickers now.  Between kisses:

                           DOCTOR GREATREX
                 Then maybe I'd be... open to that.

                           BOND
                     (smiles)
                 Perhaps after this ... test?

                           DOCTOR GREATREX
                 ...yes?...

                           BOND
                 I could come for a second opinion?

       INT. BRIEFING ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ)- LATER

       A huge chandelier dominates the vast stone room. SEVERAL
       AGENTS listen to the debriefing.  ROBINSON and M watch TANNER
       explain things; he holds a FIFTY POUND NOTE and KING'S LAPEL
       PIN (now blackened, fused, melted to expose electronics
       beneath).

                           TANNER
                 ...The money was dipped in urea, dried,
                 and packed tight. In one note the metal
                 strip had been replaced with a
                 combustible magnesium circuit -- in
                 effect a tiny detonator. King always wore
                 a pin in his lapel, an heirloom called
                 'the Eye of the Glens'; but someone
                 switched it for a copy, a ceramic micro-
                 circuit emitting an electronic signature.

       ANGLE

       on BOND as he enters the room.  He hangs back in the shadows,
       watches Tanner mime the pin moving to the note:

                           TANNER
                 When he came within range of the money --
                 boom.  Ingenious.

       M steps forward.  Her fury controlled.

                           M
                 We've been pawns in someone's game. They
                 tricked us into bringing the money to
                 King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.

                           TANNER
                 And expensive.  Cost three million plus.

       Suddenly the chandelier darkens, the floor brightens into a
       VAST SCREEN, showing a satellite image of Central Asia and
       the Mediterranean.  M and Robinson walk onto the screen.

                           M
                 Cheap, if it achieves your aim of de-
                 stabilizing the Western World.

       She causes the desired stir.  Bond steps forward from the
       shadows to get a better view.  M sees the sling has gone.

                           M
                 007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?

                           BOND
                 Caviar capital of the world. Matchless
                 beluga. Firm, yet subtle.
                     (M looks askance)
                 Largest landlocked body of water on
                 Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it.
                 Stalin beat him to it.

                           M
                 And now it's up for grabs, a goldrush.
                 Far more oil than anyone thought.

                           ROBINSON
                 Latest estimates, six trillion dollars.
                 It'll make the Gulf look like a puddle,
                 see us right through the new century.
                 The problem is getting the oil out of
                 there.

                           M
                 There are four pipelines in the works.
                 Three to the Black Sea, shipping out
                 through the Bosphorus. All vulnerable to
                 unstable governments or Russian blockade.

                           BOND
                 So Sir Robert's goes through Turkey,
                 direct to the Med...?

                           ROBINSON
                 A huge project. The most expensive of the
                 pipelines, but the one supported by every
                 Western leader. None of the American oil
                 companies were willing to take it on.
                 But King has connections to the region.
                 He married into the Vavra family, rich
                 local industrialists. He used those
                 connections to hold it all together.

                           BOND
                 Kill the man, kill the pipeline.

                           M
                 Not necessarily.  Not with Elektra taking
                 over.

       Tanner notices a RED LIGHT start pulsing.  He moves to M:

                           TANNER
                 Your call to the PM.

       M nods grimly.  As Robinson distributes sealed envelopes:

                           M
                 Our credibility has been hit hard.  We
                 have to hit back harder. Your
                 assignments.

       They open their envelopes, but Bond received nothing.

                           M
                     (to Bond)
                 I'm waiting for the report on your
                 medical.

       She leaves.  Bond is brooding.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. RESEARCH ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - NIGHT

       An ancient nook chock full of hi-tech equipment.  Bond
       concentrates on a screen displaying PHOTOGRAPHS, NEWSPAPER
       AND TELEVISION CLIPS -- all to do with King's life and times.

       Bond touches the screen on a photo of...ELEKTRA.

       INT. SCREEN

       One story dominates -- the KIDNAPPING OF ELEKTRA KING. A
       Polaroid of Elektra savagely beaten, ear bandaged, holding a
       newspaper: beneath the photo is scrawled "$5,000,000."

                           NEWSCASTER
                 ...somehow managed to shoot two of her
                 captors and escape...

       POLICE VIDEO: Elektra interviewed; bruised, emotional.

                           VOICE
                 ... the leader, the one who escaped.  Can
                 you describe him?

                           ELEKTRA
                 He shouted.  He shouted all the time --

       Bond touches Elektra's face, freezing her tears.

       His eyes wander to the photo with the ransom demand:
       $5,000,000.  A thought forms.  He takes out his wallet,
       opening it and removing:

       THE RECEIPT FROM LACHAISE.

       E.C.U. The strange figure, in pounds: 3,030,303.03.

       Bond taps some keys. The words EXCHANGE RATE appear on the
       screen...pounds to dollars.

       He enters '3,030,303.03 POUNDS STERLING' and through
       multiplication by the exchange rate this becomes:

        '5,000,000 US DOLLARS.'  He stares at it.

                                                            CUT TO:

       Bond paces the flagstones, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING.

       INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - CONTINUOUS

       Bond opens the door on M who stands alone by the window,
       looking out at the long shadows on the moors.

                           BOND
                 Tell me about the kidnapping of Elektra
                 King.

       She turns, her brow furrowing.

                           M
                 Who told you to look at Elektra's files?

                           BOND
                 I took the initiative.

                           M
                 You haven't been given an assignment in
                 this case.

                           BOND
                 I was the one who brought that money
                 in...

                           M
                 I'm well aware of your stake in this,
                 007.
                 If you have a point, get to it.

                           BOND
                 The amount of money that killed Robert
                 King is the same amount as the ransom
                 demand for Elektra.

       He hands her a slip of paper.

                           BOND
                 Whoever kidnapped Elektra is the same man
                 who killed her father.

       M looks at the paper, a long time.

                           M
                 It's a message.  He wants us to know he's
                 back.

                           BOND
                 Who?

                     (this is serious)
                 Renard.

       INT. BRIEFING ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ)- NIGHT

       A HUGE, TRANSPARENT 3-D IMAGE OF RENARD'S SKULL floats in the
       centre of the room.  Other images of him on wall screens.

                           M
                 Sir Robert tried to deal with the
                 kidnapping with his own...resources, at
                 first. When Elektra's ear was delivered
                 to him in the post, he came to me.
                     (measured)
                 I advised against paying the ransom. I
                 knew it was Renard. I played it out as
                 long as possible to get a fix on him.

                           BOND

                 How many deaths is he responsible for?
                 How many innocent people? You may only
                 get one shot at a man like Renard. Same
                 circumstances, I'd do the same again.

       She turns to the hologram.

                           M
                 We sent 009 down to kill him.  Before he
                 could, Elektra escaped.  A week later our
                 man caught up with the target. Put a
                 bullet in his head.
                     (beat)
                 That bullet is still there.

       Bond moves toward the ghostly Renard. We now see THE BULLET
       INSIDE HIS SKULL.

                           BOND
                 He survived?

                           M
                 The doctor who saved him couldn't get it
                 out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol
                 found the x-rays, there was mild
                 jubilation. Effectively, he's a dead man.

       She presses a button, the hologram turns...

                           M
                 The bullet is moving through the medulla
                 oblongata, killing off his sense of
                 touch. He feels no pain. He can push
                 himself harder, longer than any normal
                 man.

                           BOND
                 'That which does not kill me makes me
                 stronger.'

                           M
                 Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.

                           BOND
                 He's not through yet. Renard doesn't blow
                 up five million dollars unless he knows
                 there's more coming in. He's working for
                 someone. Someone who wants to stop the
                 pipeline.  And they hired the perfect
                 killer. One with a vendetta against
                 King...and you.

       MONEYPENNY ENTERS with a file, which she hands to M.

       M looks over the file: his medical report.

                           M
                 I see the good doctor gave you glowing
                 testimonials. 'Exceptional stamina'...

                           MONEYPENNY
                 He's always been good at oral exams.

       Moneypenny disappears out the door. M is all business.

                           M
                 Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider
                 who switched the pin. If your instincts
                 are right, Renard will be back. He hasn't
                 completed the job. The pipeline is still
                 going forward, and we have Elektra to
                 thank for that.

                           BOND
                 The worm on the hook again.

       They exchange a look. A look of recognition between two
       professionals, who know the terrible price of what they do.

       INT. Q'S LAB - NIGHT

       A Scot in a kilt plays the bagpipes -- badly.  He spins
       round, drops the pipe from his mouth, simultaneously fires
       bullets from one pipe and a jet of flame from another.  The
       target is a realistic dummy -- now a molten, bullet-ridden
       mess.

       We're in Q's laboratory.  He's walking Bond through.

                           BOND
                 Scottish heavy metal, Q?

                           Q
                 Oh pipe down, 007.
                     (irritated, hands over a WATCH)
                 Your 29th. Try not to lose this one. It
                 has dual lasers and a miniature grappling
                 hook with fifty feet of high-tensile
                 micro-filament, able to support 800
                 pounds.

       In the background, we see a man in a sleek black jacket. The
       man PULLS A STRING...the jacket becomes AN AIRBAG...it
       envelopes him, he gets impossibly tangled in it.

       Q ignores it, handing Bond a new pair of GLASSES.

                           Q
                 New refinement.  Sort of X-ray vision.
                 For checking concealed weapons.

                           BOND
                 And other uses, no doubt.

                           Q
                 Abuses in your case. You destroyed my
                 hydro-boat in less than seven minutes, as
                 no doubt will be the case with this...

       He presses a button and a section of ceiling lowers to reveal
       a BMW Z7.
       A MAN in a white coat is loading A MISSILE into one of the
       headlamps, then steps off the platform.  Q gestures to him.

                           Q
                 007, my Deputy Assistant.  I'm grooming
                 him to follow me.

                           BOND
                     (to Man)
                 That would make you..."R"?

                           R
                 Ahh, the rampant 007 wit.  I, of course,
                 am laughing inside.  But I dare say
                 you've met your match in this machine.
                     (touring the car)
                 The absolute latest in intercepts,
                 surveillance and countermeasures.
                 Titanium plating and armor, a multi-
                 tasking heads-up display. Completely
                 indestructible.  All in all, rather
                 stocked.

                           Q
                 'Fully loaded' I think is the term.

       "R" pats the fender, he's pretty damned fond of his machine.

                           R
                 Do take good care of her.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

       A hot day. CAMERA soars over tall trees. We can just make out
       the sleek muscular car, beetle-black and far below, bouncing
       over rough terrain.  Bond "taking care" of his new BMW Z7.

       INT. BOND'S CAR - NR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

       We join Bond at the wheel, driving hard, loving it, pushing
       up extreme inclines, smashing through overhanging limbs.

       EXT. PERIMETER FENCE, CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS
       MOUNTAINS - DAY

       Bond reaches a PERIMETER FENCE, manned by a GUARD.  The guard
       examines Bond's PASS and waves him through.

       EXT. AIRSTRIP AREA NEAR CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS
       MOUNTAINS - DAY (OLD SC. 69)

       As Bond drives on he passes an area where HELICOPTERS
       trailing GIANT SAWS are trimming back trees.  Felled trees
       are being dragged away, being replaced by huge metal sheets.
       An incredibly fast and well-oiled operation -- but why?

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

       Bond pulls up at the CONSTRUCTION SITE, teeming with ultra-
       modern robotic construction machines and vehicles.

       He gets out, and is immediately surrounded by men with guns.
       A man in a suit steps forward.  DAVIDOV is tall, blonde, with
       a dangerous charm Bond instantly recognizes as ex-KGB.

       He turns Bond around, hands on the car.  Pats him down.
       Pulls out an ID, checks it:

                           DAVIDOV
                     (excellent English)
                 Bond. A government man. I'm afraid since
                 you English got the boss killed we've
                 been a little...jumpy.

       Bond stares ahead, watches a PRIVATE JET swoops past...

       OMITTED

       EXT. AIRSTRIP AREA NEAR CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS
       MOUNTAINS - DAY

       The jet lands on a runway of the metal sheets Bond saw being
       laid as he passed...

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

       Davidov pulls out Bond's gun.

                           BOND
                     (re:  gun)
                 I'd rather you didn't play with that.

       Davidov ignores him, looking the gun over.

                           DAVIDOV
                 Nice.

                           BOND
                 Quite stunning.

       Bond turns to watch a LIFTING HELICOPTER swoop in and drop
       down an air-conditioned office.  Military precision.

       Davidov's radio crackles out a message and he tosses the gun
       back to Bond.  They start walking:

                           DAVIDOV
                     (pleasant)
                 Sorry about all that, comrade. Old habits
                 die hard. I am Head of Security.
                 Davidov.

       Bond eyes him, but is distracted by a jet coming to a halt
       ahead of them.

       Stairs swing down and out steps ELEKTRA KING.  Beautiful,
       elegant.  So out of place in this world of men.  She surveys
       the worksite.

       Impressed, Bond takes his ID back from Davidov.

       INT. OFFICE, CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

       Bond and Davidov step into a fully functioning office.
       Everything Elektra requires is here. Computer, phones, drinks
       cabinet. She is in the middle of a group of workmen and
       secretaries, looking at plans, talking, pouring herself a cup
       of coffee.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to Foreman)
                 ...they should have been in place two
                 days ago. That is the target my father
                 set.

                           FOREMAN
                 We've had some trouble with the villagers
                 at Ruan. Some sacred burial plot...

                           DAVIDOV
                 Miss King...James Bond here to see you.

       She looks up...a brief moment of RECOGNITION...then back to
       business.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Find me the research on the limestone
                 deposits, go ahead and place these
                 orders, and get the jeep ready. I will go
                 to Ruan myself...

                           DAVIDOV
                 Miss King, I wouldn't recommend...

                           ELEKTRA
                 I said, I will go.

       She signs some documents and the men file out. She gets up,
       turning her back to Bond, hands on her hips.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Would you excuse us, Davidov?

       Davidov nods and leaves. Elektra still keeps her back turned,
       but he can see her physically change, her shoulders sag, her
       arms cross in front of her. When she finds her voice, it has
       a gravelly sound of emotion.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I met you at my father's funeral.

                           BOND
                 Yes.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I haven't been able to recall a single
                 moment of that day...until now.

                           BOND
                 Funerals aren't exactly memorable.

                           ELEKTRA
                 God no. All those horrible loved ones and
                 relatives. I don't want to talk to those
                 people. I just want to...talk to my
                 father.
                     (beat)
                 I loved him.  I'm not sure he knew that.

                           BOND
                 Is that why you want to finish the
                 pipeline?

                           ELEKTRA
                 Partially, yes.

       Her muscleman BODY GUARD appears, says briefly:

                           GABOR
                 The jeep is ready, Ma'am.  Will I be
                 driving with you?

                           ELEKTRA
                 No, Gabor. We have a guest.

       Gabor glares at Bond before he leaves.

                           BOND
                 Who is he?

                           ELEKTRA
                 My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere.
                 He's decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an
                 excellent omelette.

                           BOND
                 How long has he been with you?

                           ELEKTRA
                 Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?

       Bond takes something out of his pocket, he opens his palm,
       shows it to her.

                           BOND
                 Does this look familiar to you?

                           ELEKTRA
                 It's my father's pin. He wore it everyday
                 of his life.

       She swallows back emotion. Looks in his eyes, with a sad half-
       smile that unsettles him.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Are you trying to break my heart? Or is
                 it just your way with women?

                           BOND
                 It's not the pin your father wore. It's
                 an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny
                 electrical detonator. We have reason to
                 believe the assassin had an inside
                 accomplice, someone who worked at this
                 company.

                           ELEKTRA
                 If you've come here to look after me, Mr.
                 Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I
                 have two bodyguards, I don't need a
                 third...

       She starts to walk out.  He follows her...

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

                           BOND
                 The killer doesn't want to see this
                 pipeline continue, doesn't want to see
                 you take over...

                           ELEKTRA
                 That's every man within a five mile
                 radius.  Including you.
                     (off his look)
                 That's why you're here, isn't it? You
                 think I can't do it. You think I'm going
                 to screw up. Or get myself killed.

                           BOND
                 I think running this pipeline would be a
                 difficult job for anyone. Especially
                 King's daughter.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am
                 the only person who can do it.

       EXT. JEEP, TRAVELING - OILFIELDS - DAY

       Elektra drives the all-terrain jeep with casual assurance.
       Bond is beside her, cold-weather gear in the back.  They're
       following a huge pipeline, passing a blighted petrified
       forest of twisted iron:  derelict oil derricks.

       Elektra gestures at the oil fields they're now leaving
       behind.  Receding into the distance, a DELTA OF ROADWAYS
       perched on rusting stilts juts out into the sea.

                           ELEKTRA
                 My mother's people discovered oil here
                 ninety years ago.  The Bolsheviks
                 slaughtered them for it.
                     (beat)
                 Some say oil is in my family's blood.  I
                 say our blood is in the oil. This is the
                 very heart of the planet.  Up here in the
                 hills was Eden, literally.  Look what the
                 Russians did to it.  Now we have a second
                 chance and this time we'll do it right.
                 When the other wells have all dried up,
                 she'll still be pumping her lifeblood to
                 the world.  And this
                     (proudly, of pipeline)
                 Will be one of the main arteries...

       EXT. POV FROM HELICOPTER - DAY

       Bond and Elektra travel beside the vast pipe through
       dramatic, beautiful, scenery...

       INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

       Davidov and Gabor, in the helicopter, watch the jeep below.

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION CAMP, FOOTHILLS OF THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS
       (CAPPADOCIA, THE VILLAGE OF ZELVE) - DAY

       The jeep reaches a break in the pipe: a SURVEY CAMP, flags,
       strings.  The SURVEY CREW cower behind a 4WD, local tribesman
       are stoning them from a village carved into the rock.  A lot
       of SHOUTING.

       Before Bond can stop her, Elektra gets out, moves toward the
       tribesmen.  The stoning ceases. They know who she is.  She
       begins to speak quietly -- in their own tongue.

       INT. CHAPEL, ZELVE - DAY

       A stunning pre-Byzantine chapel hewn from the rock.  Flames
       illuminate beautiful mosaics and paintings on the cavern
       wall.  A COPTIC PRIEST proudly shows Elektra about, jabbering
       in his mother tongue.  She answers in his language.

       Bond watches her, impressed.

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION CAMP - DISTORTED ELECTRONIC POV, FROM
       ABOVE:

       We hear the click of high-powered electronic binoculars,
       zeroing in on Bond and Elektra as they return to the survey
       team.  This can't be Davidov's view, as the helicopter has
       settled down below.

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION CAMP, FOOTHILLS OF MOUNTAINS - DAY

       Bond is edgy.  Someone is out there.  He's sure of it.  He
       sees Davidov and Gabor scanning the area as well.  Elektra
       speaks to the foreman.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Send the pipe around.

                           FOREMAN
                 It will take weeks, cost millions.
                 Your father approved this route.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Then my father was wrong.

       The first time Elektra has asserted her own authority. The
       foreman is surprised, angry. But he doesn't question her.

       She moves toward the helicopter, says to Bond:

                           ELEKTRA
                 I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor
                 will drive you back.

                           BOND
                 Always wanted to see the upper lines.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You don't take no for an answer, do you?

                           BOND
                 No.

       She shrugs, mischief in her eyes.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Alright then. Do you ski?

       Bond just smiles.

                           BOND
                 I've been known to.

       INT/EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY

       The chopper swoops over SNOWY WASTES.  It reaches a mountain
       peak, hovers.  The wind is strong, buffeting.

       Elektra and Bond are both now in ski suits, Bond wearing a
       sleek black jacket.

                           PILOT
                 Can't land.  Wind's too strong!

                           ELEKTRA
                 Just hold her steady.
                     (to Bond)
                 You wanted to see it.

       She steps into her skis, opens the door.  Wind rushes in.

       EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

       Without a moment's hesitation, Elektra leaps out of the
       chopper and falls fifteen feet, landing on the move.

       INT/EXT.  HELICOPTER - DAY

       Unbelieving, Bond quickly dons skis and leaps after her.

       EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

       Below him on the mountain, she is already a way ahead.  Her
       skiing is fearless.  Bond likes a challenge...

       They wind down the slope, competitive, testing one another,
       enjoying it.

       EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

       After an exhilarating run, she stops on the edge of a huge
       drop.  Bond joins her.  They look down at the snowy valley
       below.  A line of survey FLAGS visible through the middle.

                           ELEKTRA
                 We're building from both ends.  This is
                 where they'll meet.  Fifteen hundred
                 miles from the Caspian to the
                 Mediterranean.

       Bond and Elektra stand on the mountainside, feeling like the
       only two people in the world, when they hear: THE DISTANT HUM
       OF A PLANE.

       EXT. SKY - DAY

       They see FOUR OBJECTS falling out the back of the aircraft.
       As the objects plummet silently toward the earth, they POP
       PARACHUTES, their fall slows and then, as Bond and Elektra
       watch in disbelief...

       GUNFIRE echoes out from the black shapes, now visible as
       PARASKIS, low-flying, sleek, deadly snow vehicles.

       EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

       Bond turns to Elektra, he has to yell over the sound of the
       approaching machines.

                           BOND
                 Head for that gully, I'll lure them into
                 the trees!

       He points her off to one side, where a shallow gully offers
       cover...she skis off to shelter and he skis OUT...INTO THE
       OPEN...where the paraskis trail after him...

       He streaks toward the trees as the vehicles gain on him,
       firing...

       EXT. FOREST

       He makes it to the woods, finding cover in the trees,
       whipping in and out of sight as PARASKI #1 tries to follow,
       sinking lower and lower until...

       HIS SKIDS catch on some over hanging branches...the Paraski
       is CATAPULTED into a tree and EXPLODES...

       EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

       Coming in to pick up the pursuit of Bond is Paraski #2,
       firing down at Bond, dropping bombs which explode just behind
       him in the snow.  The other two paraskis LAND and eject their
       chutes, now RACING THROUGH THE WOODS on the ground.

       Bond looks behind him, sees them gaining...he zigzags through
       the trees and suckers Paraski #3 to glance off one tree, hit
       another and wipe out behind.

       But the remaining predator on the ground, Paraski #4, is
       gaining on him...Bond bursts out of the trees and finds
       himself heading toward...

       THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE...

       He cranks himself right, narrowly avoiding a tumble over the
       edge.  Paraski #4 isn't so lucky and SAILS OFF THE CLIFF to a
       hundred and fifty foot drop.

                           BOND
                     (smiling)
                 Should have stuck to snowboarding.

       But the smile is wiped off his face as...AN EMERGENCY
       PARACHUTE deploys from the back...

       The Paraski does a climbing turn and heads straight back for
       him...

       Bond skis for his life, away from Paraski #4 when PARASKI #2
         appears in front of him...guns blazing...

       One ahead and one behind, Bond turns back...he has nowhere to
       go but...

       OVER THE EDGE

       He sails through the air and lands on the Paraski #4,
       slashing the parachute with his ski pole before bouncing off
       and doing an amazing tumbling hundred foot fall to the snow,
       where he lands on his skis... Paraski four, the chute
       tangling in the rotors of its propeller, struggles to
       maintain control, his vehicle inexorably hurtling toward
       PARASKI #2: both of them having set their course for Bond,
       they are now on a collision course with EACH OTHER...

       IN THE GULLY BELOW

       Bond meets up with Elektra as above them...

       The two Paraskis collide, crashing into the snowy hill above
       and tumbling down, end over end.

       Bond and Elektra huddle together as shards and debris rain
       down on them.

       Then...silence.  An eerie silence.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Are they gone? All of them?

       Bond nods, ripping from his pole a PIECE OF THE PARACHUTE he
       slashed and wiping his face with it...he looks at the piece
       of fabric in his hand.  He sees:

       CYRILLIC LETTERS...undecipherable to us...but there is a look
       on his face, a look of recognition as...

       AN EARTH RATTLING RUMBLE grows above them.

       Bond stuffs the parachute fragment in his ski-suit as he
       turns...

       The exploding Paraskis have triggered AN AVALANCHE on the
       slope above.

       EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/AVALANCHE AREA - DAY

       They try to outrun it -- riding the sliding hill -- but they
       haven't a hope... the rest of the snow is catching them,
       they're going to get swallowed.

       EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/AVALANCHE AREA - DAY

       The ground shudders, the THUNDER CLOSING...  Their ankles are
       soon covered, Elektra falls.  Bond stops, pulls her up.
       They're about to die.  He pulls her to him.

                           BOND
                 Hold on to me.

       She's confused and frightened but does as she's told.

       They hold one another tight as -- here it comes -- the white
       fury hurtles over them, burying them...  At the last moment,
       just as their heads vanish from view...

       CLOSE ON BOND PULLING THE Q GADGET ON THE JACKET.

       The AIRBAG slams open.  The snow covers it and them.  More
       and more snow slides over...

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. SNOW HOLE - MOMENTS LATER

       Darkness.  The RUMBLING CEASES...

       Light emanates from Bond's watch.  In the shadows he pulls a
       knife, punctures the air bag. It deflates, leaving them
       cocooned in an icy tomb.  Elektra looks around, staring,
       unbelieving.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Oh my God...we're buried alive...

                           BOND
                 We're alright.

       But her breath is coming in short, irregular bursts.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I can't stay here.

                           BOND
                 You're not going to.

       Bond takes a knife from a sheath around his ankle.  Flicks
       open the small blade.  He starts to cut a hole in the snow
       above their heads. She stops him.

                           ELEKTRA
                 No!  It will cave in!

                           BOND
                 It's the only way out...

       The snow CREAKS eerily, she gasps, terror mounting.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I can't breathe, I can't breathe...

       Bond grabs her, holds her tight.  She resists, bucks.

                           BOND
                 Elektra, look at me, look in my eyes!

                     (she does)
                 You're alright. Everything will be
                 alright.  Trust me.

       Finally, arrested by the strength in his eyes, she calms...

       EXT. MOUNTAINS - MOMENTS LATER

       A beautiful expanse of smooth virgin snow.  All is quiet.
       CLOSER

       Bond's fist PUNCHES through the white.  He pulls the snow
       away, climbs out.  Leans in, lifts Elektra out.

       Bond and Elektra stand, lone figures in the perfect white.
       They hear a sound...HELICOPTER ROTORS.  Rescue on its way.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - DAY

       An establishing shot of Bond's BMW parked outside the ornate
       villa on the shore of the golden Caspian.

       INT. ENTRANCE HALL, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - DAY

       Palatial.  Hallway dominated by a LARGE PAINTING of a bearded
       man in traditional Turkish garb, sitting proudly on a horse.

       Davidov, Gabor, waiting, pacing.

       Bond is sits in a chair, ON EDGE, writing something over and
       over on a small pad of paper...THE CYRILLIC LETTERS on the
       parachute fragment.

       A DOCTOR comes down the grand staircase. The men stand.

                           DOCTOR
                 She's fine. Contusions. A slight strain
                 to her ankle, but otherwise, fine.
                     (to Bond)
                 She wants to see you.

       INT. ELEKTRA'S BEDROOM - SUNSET

       Bond enters. Elektra is standing by the window watching the
       golden ball of the sun sink into the sea. She wears nothing
       but a silk embroidered robe; the sun shows through it,
       outlining her naked body in soft, shadowy curves.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Are you alright?

       He nods.  He is wound tight, she senses it.

                           BOND
                 I can't stay.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I know.

       A moment.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I need to ask you something.  And I need
                 you to tell me the truth.

       He waits.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Who is it? Who is trying to kill me?

       Bond looks at her; vulnerable, fragile, trying to be strong.
       He cannot tell her the truth.

                           BOND
                 I don't know. But I will find him.

       She stares at him, sensing he is withholding something. She
       turns back to the window.

       He approaches behind her.

                           ELEKTRA
                 After the kidnapping...I was afraid to go
                 outside, to be alone, to be in a crowd,
                 to do anything at all, until I
                 realized...
                     (pause)
                 There's no point in living if you
                 can't...feel alive.

       She looks out at the fading sun.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I can't huddle in the shadows. I can't
                 let fear run my life.  I won't.

       She turns to him.

                           ELEKTRA
                 The way I acted, in the snow...you must
                 think I'm a coward.

                           BOND
                 I think you're one of the bravest people
                 I've ever met.

       She looks up at him, into his eyes; they are so close. All
       she has to do is tilt her mouth upward...she kisses him.  His
       hands come up across her back, pressing her toward him, her
       body melting into his, and then...

       He pulls back. Has to physically step away from her.

                           ELEKTRA
                 What is it?

                           BOND
                 ...you should rest.

       That was exactly the wrong thing to say. He sees the
       rebellion flair in her eyes.

                           ELEKTRA
                 James...

                           BOND
                 I have to go.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Then take me with you.

                           BOND
                 No. You'll be safe here.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I don't want to be safe!

                           BOND
                 I have to go to work.

       He starts toward the door.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Now who's the coward?

       He stops, his back up...then heads out the door.

       IN THE HALLWAY

       He passes Gabor, standing faithfully outside.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EST. SHOT - EXT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT

       Elegant, mysterious.  A modern day Casablanca.

       INT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT

       Bond in evening dress in the sumptuous casino. He takes out
       the Q glasses, slips them on, surveys the room --

       HIS X-RAY POV

       He can see all the WEAPONS carried by the players.  All sizes
       of pistol, even the odd grenade.  The obvious side-effect of
       this view -- he can see through clothes.

       His eyes alight on two girls walking away from him.  One of
       them turns to look back, unaware that she is on display.  She
       returns Bond's smile.  Her friend turns to look.  Bond's
       smile grows:  she has a small pistol concealed over one
       breast.

       INT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT

       He looks over the lenses -- and spies someone on the fringes.
       His old adversary, ex-KGB, VALENTIN ZUKOVSKY, talking to some
       suspicious types. Zukovsky looks across. Bond walks toward
       him.

                           BOND
                 Valentin Zukovsky.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 BondJamesBond. What brings you here?

                           BOND
                 You, of course. I need some information.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Bond, I'm a civilian. This is my place.
                 Used to be the royal family's, now it's
                 mine. I run my little business, I stay
                 out of trouble...

                           BOND
                     (looking about)
                 Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies,
                 consortiums from every country in the
                 world.  A nice little rat's nest.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                     (offering hors d'ouevres)
                 Have some of the rat's nest caviar.  From
                 my own fishery.  They buy my caviar,
                 drink my champagne, lose to my House.

       He turns to a suspicious-looking Heavy.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Let me introduce you to a former
                 colleague of mine at the KGB. Dmitri
                 Palov, you may know him as...the Boa.

       The Boa is completely bald, muscular; huge, deadly hands.

                           BOA
                 The great 007. For years I have dreamed
                 of closing my hands around your neck.

                           BOND
                 Boa. Have you had any therapy since
                 Perestroika?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Why am I suddenly worried I'm not
                 carrying enough insurance?

       The Boa leaves, glaring all the while.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 See?  You're upsetting my customers.
                 What do you want?

                           BOND
                 How does a terrorist like Renard supply
                 his men with state-of-the-art Russian
                 Army weapons?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 What?  This is not possible.

       Bond takes from his pocket the fragment of the PARACHUTE.
       Zukovsky examines the letters.

                           BOND
                 If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st
                 airborne division.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Where did you get this?

                           BOND
                 Off a high-powered Paraski that was
                 trying to kill me.

       Zukovsky shakes his head. Sighs.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 The Russian Army, they spend millions on
                 flying skis, but they cannot afford to
                 pay the soldiers. The men, they do what
                 they have to do to feed their families.
                 In this country, for the right price and
                 a pack of cigarettes, you can get
                 anything you want.

       He notices Bond watching THE HOSTESS BAR...a dark alcove of
       the casino, where slinky HOOKERS flatter the guests.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 That too. Everyone does what they can to
                 survive.

                           BOND
                 How high up does this...arms dealing go?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is
                 Renard. Our government has nothing to
                 gain by killing you.

                           BOND
                 But you would have something to gain by
                 killing Robert King. And stopping his
                 pipeline.

       This hits Zukovsky. He closes down. A chill between them.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Poor Bond. The cold war is over.  What
                 have you got left? Economic espionage.
                 Murder in the boardroom.  So dull.

       Bond's eyes catch something, someone entering the casino.

       HIS POV:  ELEKTRA...more vibrant than we have ever seen her,
       living up to her name. She is impossibly glamorous in a
       sparkling dress that fits like second skin.  Her hair is full
       and tumbling, her eyes are fiery and wild.

                           BOND
                 Oh, you'd be surprised.

       Bond starts toward her, but she tosses her head, defiant, and
       turns away, making her way to the Roulette tables.

       Bond follows her across the casino. They are like two cats,
       moving through this neon jungle, their energy dangerous and
       sexy, all eyes on them. He takes note as she passes...MINIMUM
       $100, then $500, $1000...

       She finally stops at the 'No limit' table.  Crowded with the
       nastiest and richest of the high rollers, Armenians, Turks,
       South Americans, a computer nerd American and a Russian
       industrialist's wife, heavy with jewelry and drink.

       ZUKOVSKY is suddenly there, pulling out a seat for her in the
       center.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 We've kept your father's chair free.

                           ELEKTRA
                 And his account?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 You have a credit line of a million and a
                 half.

       He gestures to the Dealer, who pushes ten towering stacks of
       CHIPS toward her. A WAITRESS is right there to take her
       order.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Vodka martini.

                           BOND
                 Two. Shaken not stirred.

       He leans in, smiling his charming smile as he says:

                           BOND
                 What the hell are you doing here?

                           ELEKTRA
                     (smiling right back)
                 Someone wants to kill me, I'd rather die
                 looking him straight in the eye.
                     (lightly)
                 What are you doing here?  Looking for a
                 woman a little more your type? How about
                 that one?

       She points to a SHOW GIRL in a feather headdress and pasties.

                           BOND
                 If this little show is for my benefit,
                 I'll take you home right now.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You had your chance, James. Now I'm
                 looking for a bigger thrill.

       She pushes half her chips back onto the table, letting them
       stand on her bet.  The whole table exhales. Then, it starts:
       bets are placed, gamblers energized by her arrival.

       Bond scans the room, vigilant, nervous...

       HIS P.O.V.  He zeroes in on Davidov, sidling off, away from
       the table, trying to look nonchalant, his eyes shifting this
       way and that...he looks suspicious as hell.

       Bond watches, his blood running, and then...

       Davidov slips into the HOSTESS BAR.  A HOOKER is soon
       wrapping herself around him. After a few words, she leads him
       off toward the back.

       Bond returns to the game, shaking his head.  He watches as
       THE DEALER DEALS FROM THE SHOE.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. SALON PRIV - NIGHT

       A small room.  Lit by sconces that sport LIVE FLAMES.  Tacky-
       luxurious, a refracted Eastern reflection on an old west
       whore house.

       Davidov undresses in the little bathroom alcove.  He faces a
       small ornate mirror over the sink, in which he can see THE
       HOOKER behind him, on the bed.

                           HOOKER
                 You want to be...on top, or not on top?

                           DAVIDOV
                 On top.

       She slowly pulls a pair of SILK ROPES out from her bra and
       DANGLES THEM.

                           HOOKER
                 Tied up, or not tied up?

       Davidov smiles, struggling with his belt.  He looks down,
       gets it, looks up...his heart stops...it is not the hooker in
       the mirror but...

       RENARD'S FRIGHTENING FACE.

       Davidov spins.

       HIS P.O.V.  Renard's henchman stands by the door, an
       automatic rifle cocked at Davidov.

                           RENARD
                 Dead, or not dead?

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. CASINO - THE BLACK JACK TABLE

       Elektra with black king showing. A seven beneath.

                           BOND
                 I understand it's normally good practice
                 to get the feel of the cards before going
                 off the deep end.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Really?

       And with a smile she scratches her cards on the table for a
       hit.  The Dealer gives her an eight.  She reveals her cards.

                           DEALER
                 Bust.

       He rakes in her chips. But Elektra is undeterred.  She pushes
       another pile forward as the next deal commences.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I like the deep end, James.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. SALON PRIVE

       The HENCHMAN holds Davidov against the wall with his huge
       fist around his neck.  Near his head, the live flame of a
       SCONCE hisses, burning blue and yellow, drawing their fuel
       from the glass basin of hot oil attached beneath it.

       The HOOKER, obviously one of Renard's gang, has finished
       donning her khaki pants and combat boots and straps a gun
       onto her shoulder.

       Renard looks distastefully at the room.

                           RENARD
                 Is this how you spend the money I pay
                 you? And with the rest you hire fools who
                 shoot like blind men?

                           DAVIDOV
                     (croaks out)
                 Bond...

                           RENARD
                 Should be dead as well. Your failure
                 today is astonishing.  It is a disgrace.

       He approaches close to him, stopping at the flaming SCONCE
       near his head.

                           RENARD
                 Do you know why the color is blue at the
                 wick?

       Davidov starts to sweat.

                           RENARD
                 Because that is where the flame is the
                 hottest.

       Renard touches the glass well of oil.

                           RENARD
                 The temperature is close to five hundred
                 degrees.

       Renard uses his knife and POPS the seal from the lamp,
       removing the well of oil...a DROP of the hot oil FALLS ON HIS
       HAND and SINGES IT BLACK in an instant...

       Renard does not even flinch.  Davidov starts talking, trying
       to placate...

                           DAVIDOV
                 The plane...it's all been arranged...

                           RENARD
                 Then you are completely unnecessary...

       Renard raises the container of oil over Davidov's head:

                           DAVIDOV
                 I have the documents, the landing
                 authorizations, the security passes...

       Renard stops, the oil tilted, just ready to pour...

       His dead eye...has it drooped further since we last saw
       him?...seems to glitter in the light...

                           RENARD
                 Bond is suspicious. We are moving sooner,
                 tonight.  We understand each other?

                           DAVIDOV
                 Yes...yes...

       Renard lets a TRICKLE OF OIL drop onto Davidov's head...

       HE SCREAMS as his hair smokes and singes...

       Renard makes a motion, the THUG releases Davidov, who falls
       to the floor, clutching his head.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. CASINO - THE BLACK JACK TABLE

       Another deal. ZUKOVSKY and others watch, as Elektra stakes
       even more.  People move closer for a view.  The Dealer shows
       a five. Elektra shows Bond her cards.

       Elektra is holding two eights. Dealer's up-card is a six.

                           BOND
                 Stand or split them.

       She smiles. He holds her gaze.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Surely you believe in living dangerously.

                           BOND
                 Not at that price. Time to surrender.

       They eye one another a long while -- sex firmly in the air.
       She smiles.  She moves ALL HER CHIPS forward.

       Bond catches a look between the Dealer and Zukovsky:

                           DEALER
                 The House has no limit.

       General kerfuffle.  Bond looks back toward THE HOSTESS
       BAR...no sign of Davidov's return...

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to Dealer)
                 Hit me.

       The Dealer scoops a card from the shoe.  Tension.  Everyone
       holds their breath...as he turns over...  -- a six.  Bust.
       The audience inhale as one AS THE DEALER TAKES ALL HER CHIPS
       AWAY.

       Elektra stands.  She has dignity in defeat. She turns to
       Bond, holding out a hand.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Time to surrender.

       EXT. CASINO - NIGHT

       Bond, Elektra, Gabor outside, Davidov soon joining them,
       trying to look like he hasn't been through hell.  Bond
       notices the burn on his head. Davidov touches it self-
       consciously.

                           DAVIDOV
                 A little accident.

                           BOND
                 A night of burning passion?

       Davidov scowls at him. Bond leads Elektra away...

                                                            CUT TO:

       A DISTANT P.O.V. FROM HIGH ABOVE.

       Someone watches Bond and Elektra move toward his BMW.

                           HENCHMAN (V.O.)
                 What about Bond?

       EXT. CASINO ROOF

       RENARD and his henchmen, watching. Renard seems mesmerized by
       the sight of Bond's HAND on the small of Elektra's back,
       their easy sensuality as they both get into the car.

                           HENCHMAN
                 Sir?  Sir?

                           RENARD
                     (seething)
                 I will take care of Mister Bond.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT

       Bond and Elektra emerge from the BMW.  Behind them, Gabor and
       Davidov get out of her car. Bond watches as Davidov slams his
       door and marches off, angry, toward the SECURITY QUARTERS at
       the side of the house.

       Bond and Elektra walk to the front door, anticipation thick
       in the air.  Gabor opens the door. Elektra sweeps through...

       INT. ENTRANCE HALL, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT

       Bond pauses just inside the open doorway.

       HIS P.O.V.  Two figures in the cavernous entrance hall,
       Elektra having a brief word with Gabor, before he turns and
       exits, leaving only...

       ELEKTRA AND BOND.

       She starts upstairs, Bond's eyes locked on her body, and
       then:

       SHE LOOKS BACK...just once.  But it says everything. She
       continues upward.

       Bond taps the front door closed with his foot.

       INT. BEDROOM, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT

       Half-light.  They're entwined between the sheets.  This is
       something slow, languorous, not to be rushed.  We can't make
       out the mechanics, but they're beaded with sweat.

       Her fingers trace the contours of his torso.  Linger on his
       bruised collar-bone.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You knew when you first saw me.  You knew
                 it would be like this.

                           BOND
                 Shush.

       Her hand dips in an ice bucket beside the bed.  She rubs a
       slither of ice down her chest, shudders with pleasure.  It's
       a move Bond hasn't seen before.

       Now she brings the ice to his shoulder.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Poor shoulder. Looks painful...

       She kisses his purple flesh.  Licks.

                           BOND
                 ...needs constant attention...

       She slides her tongue back and fore along the groove above
       the tendon.  And he pulls the ice from her hand:

                           BOND
                 Enough ice for one day.

       Tosses it across the room as passion takes over...

       INT. BEDROOM, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - LATER

       A puddle of water where the ice fell.

       Post-sex on the bed. He traces a hand down her naked back.
       The sweat glistens off the curve of her spine.  She turns.
       The light glints off her jewelled earlobe...he touches it.

                           BOND
                 You never take this off?

       Elektra looks at him.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Why do men always want to undress the one
                 part of a woman's body she doesn't want
                 to reveal?

       She reaches to the large, diamond-encrusted earring and
       gently plucks it away. Pulls her lush hair back...

       The lower half of her ear is gone, reduced to a misshapen
       clump of scar tissue. It is the only mark on her perfect
       body. A physical reminder of her ordeal. It breaks his heart.

                           BOND
                 How did you survive?

                           ELEKTRA
                 I used my body on the guards.  It gave me
                 control. I got to a gun and I took my
                 chance.
                     (beat)
                 I've never told anyone that.

       They are looking at each other, both suddenly feeling
       something dangerously close to real connection.  It is not
       what Bond expected.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Do you ever stop, James?  Do you ever
                 think about...another kind of life?

       He holds her gaze for a long time before he looks away.

                           BOND
                 I can't afford to.

       She frowns, slightly.  Settles into his chest.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Don't worry. I know who you are.

       He holds her, eyes full of conflict, staring into the dark.

       EXT. VILLA - NIGHT - LATER

       The lights of a car pulling up at the security office by the
       perimeter wall of the property.

       EXT. SECURITY QUARTERS - SAME

       Bond's car, several of Elektra's vehicles, all parked around
       the security office.  They have been joined by:

       A WHITE ECONOMY CAR, a Russian make, with a familiar SEAL
       painted on the door...we've seen it before, the seal on top
       of the stolen report at the beginning...Miratom.

       Out of the driver's seat steps...DAVIDOV.  He carries a
       briefcase from the car to the front door of the security
       office. He looks around furtively before he disappears
       inside.

       The parking area is dark and silent and then:

       JAMES BOND sits up in the driver's seat of his BMW.

       INT. BMW - SAME

       Bond sticks his key in the ignition and activates the car's
       various systems.

       HIS P.O.V.  Davidov is a shadow in the office window.

       Bond flicks a switch.  A NEEDLE-THIN BEAM is directed from
       the BMW to the window of the office.  He can HEAR a synthesis
       of Davidov's voice...

                           DAVIDOV (V.O.)
                 I'm running late...no, no, I'll make
                 it...how will they know I'm your
                 man?...romashka...romashka...alright.

       Bond hears the click of a phone hanging up.  He flicks
       another switch in his car, an infra-red tracking system
       activates in his WINDSCREEN...

       He can now see Davidov perfectly as he comes out of the
       security quarters, carrying a briefcase and a large DUFFLE
       BAG which he carries to the car and loads into the TRUNK.

       He goes back inside.

       BOND gets out of the BMW.  He moves stealthily to the Russian
       vehicle and, using the laser beam on his watch, opens the
       lock on the trunk.  It pops open.

       Bond sees the briefcase, and the dufflebag, and...SOMETHING
       ELSE...something beneath them...he moves the objects aside:

       A MAN is folded into the back of the trunk, his head slumped
       forward, dark hair on the back of his head slightly wet
       ...blood? Bond tips the head back, revealing GLASSY DEAD
       EYES.

       Bond leans in and plucks a BADGE from his white shirt pocket.

       It has a photo of the dead man and reads, in English and
       Cyrillic: LEONID TASHKA - FIELD INSPECTOR.  On the corner of
       the badge...THE RUSSIAN SEAL...Miratom. The one from the
       report.  Bond touches it with his thumb, recognizing it.

       AT THE OFFICE

       Davidov is coming out...

       Bond LOWERS THE TRUNK DOOR and crouches behind the car.

       AT THE OFFICE ENTRANCE

       Davidov pauses to lock the door. He walks toward the Russian
       car...he is actually WHISTLING a happy tune and then...

       HE STOPS. He has heard something. He draws his gun. He walks
       AROUND the entire car.  When he gets to the rear...

       THE TRUNK IS CLOSED.  Bond is not there.  No evidence he ever
       was.

       Davidov gets in the driver's seat and starts the car.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. AIR STRIP - NIGHT

       The Russian car drives onto the grounds of a small, deserted
       AIRPORT consisting of one outbuilding and a crudely cleared
       airstrip.

       INT. CAR

       Davidov pulls off the road and parks his car in a wooded
       area.

       EXT. CAR

       Davidov's feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and
       opens the trunk.

       He removes the briefcase.  Then the duffle bag.  He looks
       down at the dead body,  head slumped forward, as before...but
       something is different, the clothes not quite right and then:

       THE DEAD BODY MOVES, the head turns, Davidov gasps...

       It IS JAMES BOND.

                           BOND
                 Problem, comrade?

       Davidov pulls his HAND GUN from inside his coat, but Bond is
       quicker.  With a silenced pistol he shoots Davidov in the
       head. One little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes
       go wide and he crumbles, dead.

       Bond climbs out of the trunk.  Crouches to examine Davidov.

                           BOND
                 Old habits die hard.

       He straightens.  Picks up the briefcase.  It is locked.  He
       searches Davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket.  He
       opens the lock.

       INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE:  FOUR STACKS OF MONEY.  Documents
       headed with the official crest of Miratom.  A new security
       tag, it looks just like the dead guy's, but has Davidov's
       name and picture...some hologrammed (blank) security tags --
       and a polaroid-type camera.

       He picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the
       camera.  Points at himself, takes a shot.  Punches in
       'Davidov' on the KEYPAD.  Out comes a brand new pass.

       Bond goes to look in the dufflebag but...

       A PLANE is approaching...HE LOOKS UP.

       HIS P.O.V.  A Russian military jet appears over the trees,
       flying low, its red landing lights blinking.

       EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT

       A door opens on the sinister-looking plane.  A hydraulic step
       unit folds out of it.  A BIG SOLDIER with a machine gun waits
       in the doorway.

       BOND, standing at the edge of the runway, clips on his badge
       and picks up the briefcase.  He has NO IDEA what he's walking
       into.

                           BOND
                 Here goes nothing.

       He hoists the dufflebag over his shoulder and walks out to
       the plane.  He starts up the steps:

       THE SOLDIER POINTS HIS GUN DOWN AT HIM. Says something to him
       IN RUSSIAN.

       Bond pauses.  And then, thinking, says:

                           BOND
                 Romashka.

       The soldier looks at him, then lowers his weapon.

       INT. PLANE

       Four soldiers. The first guy and a moustachioed PILOT and two
       young men, a nasty-looking private, cadaverously thin, and a
       big, thick-necked tough.

       They all look at Bond, expectantly, waiting for him to say or
       do...what? He decides to take the lead. He opens the
       briefcase and hands over the STACKS OF MONEY.

       The Pilot passes it out. But that isn't the end. They still
       stare at him.  The Pilot says something IN RUSSIAN that
       sounds like..."where's the rest?"

       Bond swallows.  Thinks, without showing it.  He decides to
       OPEN THE DUFFLE BAG.  He looks inside. Pauses, then reaches
       in and takes out...A BOX OF NIKE SHOES.

       The thin soldier smiles. That's the ticket. Bond hands out
       shoes to the rest of the guys.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN

       A red dawn.  Dominating the landscape, a valley of weirdly-
       shaped rocks. To one side, an airstrip.  The plane
       approaching.

       INT. PLANE - LANDING

       The three soldiers wear their new shoes and smoke and chat
       amongst themselves.

       Bond sits in the rear of the plane, which is dominated by
       heavily buffered receptacles, clearly awaiting some deadly
       cargo. There is Russian writing everywhere, and one symbol he
       clearly recognizes:  DANGER - RADIOACTIVE.

       Bond looks out of the window.  Beneath a huge MESA, a huddle
       of low buildings.

       They come to a stop near the end of the runway.  A SMALL JEEP
       is driving out to them.

       One of the soldiers throws something to Bond. An ORANGE
       JUMPSUIT that says Miratom on the breast.  He catches it.

                           PILOT
                     (subtitles)
                 You have fifteen minutes.

       EXT. AIRSTRIP/VALLEY/TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN

       Bond, in the orange overalls and wearing his ID tag, is
       driving with a Russian soldier through the weird rock valley -
       -

       KABOOM!

       A cloud of dust from a detonation rises up on the other side
       of the hill.

       EXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY

       They turn the corner and see trucks marked IDA, several
       Kazakhstan army personal carriers, soldiers dotted around,
       IDA (International Decommissioning Agency) scientists and
       personnel quietly going about their business.  A vast
       protective 'bubble' is inflated at the front of the building.

       INT. 'BUBBLE' - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY
       (CHRISTMAS JONES') POV:

       The sound of breathing LOUD, we're looking from inside the
       visor of a protective suit.  It's hard to tell what's going
       on, but our hands are removing a sphere of cobalt blue
       plutonium from inside a corroding WARHEAD...

       EXT. FACILITY - SAME

       An officer eyes Bond's pass.

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                     (subtitles)
                 You are late. The transport documents?

       Bond shows him the case.  Akakievich examines the documents.

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                     (subtitles)
                 They are waiting for you below.  It
                 should be ready. Check with the IDA
                 physicist.

       He points toward the "bubble."

       Inside the transparent bubble, a protective-suited FIGURE
       finishes placing a blue PLUTONIUM CORE into a box.

       As Bond and the Colonel walks toward the bubble, the FIGURE
       steps out, still enveloped in the white protective suit.

       Moving fast, off comes the helmet to reveal a BEAUTIFUL
       AMERICAN GIRL.  CHRISTMAS JONES is mid-twenties, shortish
       hair, hot right now.  In one movement she unzips and steps
       out of the suit, revealing a khaki sports bra, cut-off
       shorts, heavy duty boots.  A nasty-looking hunting knife
       strapped around her hips.  She has a deep tan and an
       incredible figure.

       She grabs a bottle of water, guzzles.

       Bond tosses an arched brow to Akakievich, who nods bitterly,
       also unable to take his eyes off her.  He spits on the floor
       and speaks in ENGLISH, so Christmas can hear.

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                 Not interested in men. Take my word for
                 it.

       Akakievich isn't exactly what you'd call a looker.  Bond
       offers a disappointed tut as Akakievich walks away.

       Christmas approaches.  He notices her IDA tag -- and an
       incongruous PEACE TATTOO just above her hip. She's checking
       him out as well.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 You new?

                           BOND
                     (Russian accent)
                 Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones.
                 No jokes, I've heard them all.

                           BOND
                 Don't know any doctor jokes.

       She is wary.  It's been a long time since a man this
       attractive stepped onto her beat. They walk toward the
       building.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What happened to Len Tashka?

                           BOND
                 Couldn't make it. Splitting headache.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 The soldiers may give you a hard time.
                 Whatever. If we weren't around, they'd
                 have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by
                 the roadsides, rotting in the sun.

       Bond looks at the ominous radiation WARNING SIGNS.

                           BOND
                 Will I need protection?

       She squints at him, taken aback.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 There's no radiation danger down there.

       Bond turns to go, knowing he misstepped.  Christmas then
       speaks to him, asking a question, IN RUSSIAN.

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (subtitles)
                 Where is this stockpile going?

       Bond turns, answers IN PERFECT RUSSIAN.

                           BOND
                     (subtitles)
                 To the nuclear facility at Penza 19.

       She nods. Watches him disappear into the building.

       INT. TEST CHAMBER MAIN ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

       Bond descends, going down deep.

       INT. TEST CHAMBER ELEVATOR/CORRIDOR - LATER

       The elevator creaks to a halt.  He slides the elevator doors
       OPEN revealing...

       TWO SOLDIERS waiting for the elevator. Bond shows them his
       ID.

                           SOLDIER
                     (subtitles)
                 See the corporal, at the end of the
                 chamber.

       The soldiers get into the elevator and disappear, leaving
       Bond completely ALONE.

       Dead silence in the shadows.  Bond's in his element, that
       alert glint in his eye as he takes in his surroundings.

       HIS P.O.V.  A long, dark corridor...leading off to a more
       open circle in the distance, lights and an ominous humming
       there.

       Bond starts down the passageway.

       INT. TEST CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

       Ahead of Bond, like a deadly spider at the centre of a web, a
       NUCLEAR BOMB suspended over a pit.

       Blast openings range around to channel its fury to measuring
       equipment.

       Bond is alone with the bomb. An eerie moment. Then, he comes
       to notice a figure, across the expanse of the pit, on the
       opposite side of the catwalk, a man, with his back to him, in
       Russian Army fatigues.

                           BOND
                 Corporal?

       The man turns...

       IT IS RENARD.

       He smiles.

                           RENARD
                 I see my friend Davidov ran into some
                 difficulty.

                           BOND
                 Indeed.

       Renard starts toward him.  Bond draws his gun.

                           BOND
                 Don't come any closer.

                           MAN
                 You can't kill me. I'm already dead.

       He and Bond face off, the malevolent bomb between them, a
       ROBOT DEVICE beginning to lower it into the pit.

                           RENARD
                 Go ahead.  Shoot.  My men will still
                 steal the bomb, and the shot will bring
                 them directly to you.

       Renard gestures into the pit.

       BOND'S P.O.V.  TWO OF RENARD'S MEN in the pit, unaware of
       what is happening above, working directly with the bomb. One
       of them is using a manual...IT IS JUST LIKE THE STOLEN
       REPORT, the Miratom seal in the corner.

       Bond aims his gun at Renard's head.

                           BOND
                 Who's paying you to destroy the pipeline?

       Renard resumes walking, around the catwalk at the edge of the
       pit, toward Bond, slowly, surely, totally fearless.

                           RENARD
                 To die by a man who can't even grasp what
                 he's caught up in...

       Bond, out of the corner of his eye, sees Renard's man remove
       a SMALL DEVICE from inside the bomb.  It is the size and
       shape of a credit card, black, with shiny transistors on
       it...the man slips it into his pocket.

                           BOND
                 Revenge isn't so hard to fathom. What's
                 clever is getting someone else to pay for
                 it.

                           RENARD
                 Not many people in this world have that
                 kind of fortune.

       Bond cocks the pistol.

                           BOND
                 Who is it?

                           RENARD
                 You think I fear death? I welcome it. I
                 get on my knees and pray for it. You, on
                 the other hand, you have something to
                 live for, no?
                     (closer now)
                 She's beautiful isn't she? You should
                 have seen her before. Flawless, and still
                 so innocent, not such a whore in bed...

       Bond's eyes flare in fury.  He shoves Renard into the wall
       and presses the gun to his temple.

                           BOND
                 You will never touch her. You will never
                 get near her.

                           RENARD
                 Have you forgotten who saved your life in
                 Geneva?

                           BOND
                 Consider me ungrateful.

                           RENARD
                 It's I who should thank you -- for taking
                 that money back to MI-6.  So distressing
                 for M.  An explosion inside her lair.

                           BOND
                 She'll get over it.

                           RENARD
                 You even brought the plane for us.  We
                 really couldn't have done it without you.

       Bond strikes him across the temple with his pistol.  Renard
       drops to his knees.  He touches his temple, looks at the
       blood curiously, feeling no pain.

                           RENARD
                 A man tires of being executed.

       As Bond screws a silencer onto the muzzle of his gun:

                           RENARD
                 But then again...There is no point in
                 living if you can't...feel alive.

       Bond knows that, he's heard it somewhere before...IT FREEZES
       HIM, just a beat, but it is enough...

       SUDDENLY, the noise of footsteps -- CHRISTMAS JONES, with
       COLONEL AKAKIEVICH and two armed soldiers.

       We're with them as they turn the corner of the passageway and
       see Bond with silenced pistol aimed at the kneeling Renard --
       classic execution stance:

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                     (to Bond)
                 Drop your gun.

                           BOND
                 Keep away, Colonel.

       The soldiers' guns are trained on Bond.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 He is an impostor.
                     (clutching a printout)
                 There's no Davidov at Miratom.

                           BOND
                 Here's your imposter. He's paid off the
                 men on the plane outside.  They're not
                 taking the bomb to any Russian facility,
                 they're flying it wherever he tells them.

       Christmas is listening, but Akakievich cocks his rifle.

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                     (to Bond)
                 I said drop it.

       And he means business.  Bond delays ... but has no choice.
       He pulls the clip from his gun, tosses it down.

                           RENARD
                     (to Christmas)
                 Well done -- he would have killed us all.
                 I suppose you
                     (to Akakievich)
                 were you the one who allowed him down?

       Colonel Akakievich looks suitably stung.  But Renard is
       looking past him now, as with a quiet WHIRR, the BOMB raises
       into view on a trolley.  Renard's team is ready to move.

                           RENARD
                     (to Akakievich)
                 Take him away, I don't want him around as
                 we move the bomb.
                     (whispered, to Bond)
                 You had me.  I knew you couldn't shoulder
                 the responsibility...

       And Renard jams his hand onto Bond's shoulder, squeezing his
       collar-bone hard...  Pain jolts through Bond, he drops to his
       knees in agony. He shoves Bond down.  Bond's hand goes to his
       shoulder, his mind now racing -- how did he know to hurt him
       there?

       Renard's men start to maneuver the bomb toward the curving
       passageway.  It's all too much for Colonel Akakievich:

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                 No -- the bomb does not go anywhere until
                 I am satisfied.  All of you to the
                 surface, now...

       Renard stops and turns.  Bond sees him nod to two of his men:
       one quietly slopes off down the tunnel.  The other innocently
       opens a container...

       INT. CONTAINER

       Camera shows the INSIDE of the container's lid; the man
       releases a false lining to reveal several MACHINE GUNS...

       INT. TEST CHAMBER - DAY

                           RENARD
                     (urgent now)
                 Very well, Colonel. We will all go up.

       One of Colonel Akakievich's men gestures with his gun that
       Bond should get up.  Knowing it's now or never, Bond PUSHES
       him away, yanks a PISTOL from his holster, GRABS Christmas,
       LEAPS down into the bomb PIT just as

       RENARD'S MEN open fire...  Akakievich dies straight away.  So
       do two of his men.  The gunfire RICOCHETS around the chamber
       and ceases.

       Renard hangs back.  His radio crackles a message:

                           RENARD
                     (nods, into radio)
                 Shut them.

       THE GUY ON THE OTHER END OF THE RADIO

       Right next to the ELEVATOR.  He turns a switch that activates
       two sets of red buttons and two sets of green.

       He punches one green button...

       INSIDE TEST CHAMBER

       Heavy doors close all exits but that to the tunnel.

       INT. THE PIT

       Bond and Christmas know they are being sealed in.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Melt-down doors.  If he gets them closed,
                 they won't be opened again for forty-
                 eight years.

       Bond peers over the edge -- sees Renard and his men working
       the nuclear device into THE PASSAGEWAY.

       INT. THE PIT

       If Bond doesn't get through now, they're trapped forever.  He
       points his wrist watch toward the cat walk above and presses
       a button...THE TINY GRAPPLING HOOK shoots out, Q's super
       filament wire that can hold up to 800 pounds is
       attached...Bond uses the rope to RAPPEL UP THE SIDES OF THE
       PIT and into

       INT. TEST CHAMBER

       Where he LEAPS ON TOP OF Renard's last man.  They fall
       THROUGH THE IRIS, it SHUTS behind them.  The man swings his
       machine gun at Bond -- it hits the wall next to him, breaks
       apart.  Bond grabs a broken section and kills him with one
       strike.

       He pauses at his dead body and reaches into his jacket,
       retrieving...THE CARD-LIKE DEVICE.

       INT. PIT

       Christmas looks around, desperate to help.  Using Bond's
       wire, she climbs up to the CLOSED IRIS DOOR.  She pries open
       a panel next to it and reveals complex WIRING...

       INT. PASSAGEWAY

       Up ahead of Bond, the bomb disappears down the passageway. He
       can see it is attached to A PULLEY above, helping the men to
       move quickly, Renard, pulling, the two men pushing

       Renard signals one of them to drop back to cut off Bond...

       Machine-gun fire turns the wall next to Bond to dust -- Bond
       dives to a recess.  An overhead LIGHT SHATTERS.  His section
       of the tunnel darkens.

       INT. PASSAGEWAY - BOND'S END

       Bond looks up at the broken LIGHT.  Takes careful aim at the
       next one along.  BLAM.  It disintegrates.  Again...

       INT. PASSAGEWAY - RENARD'S END

       The other guy answers with another spray of bullets.  Watches
       uneasily as Bond takes out light after light.  A funnel of
       darkness coming to swallow him -- concealing Bond's approach.
       Nervous, he fires, muzzle flash and sparks illuminating the
       void.  To keep it lit, he keeps firing...

       INT. PASSAGEWAY

       WITH BOND as the bullets cease with a loud CLICK...  What
       Bond was waiting for.  He moves.  The gunman frozen in the
       light, grappling to fit another clip --

       BLAM!  He goes down.  Bond not wasting bullets.

       INT. OTHER END OF PASSAGEWAY

       Renard is loading the bomb it into the ELEVATOR. He flicks a
       switch on the panel by the elevator.  The IRIS starts closing
       on Bond...

       INT. PASSAGEWAY

       Bond rushes for the door -- but he's shocked as the man he
       shot lunges.  Clings to him.

       Bond hits him away, he LEAPS for the cart blocking his way
       and SHOVES IT INTO THE IRIS DOOR just as it almost closes...

       Bond squeezes through...

       INT. OTHER SIDE OF IRIS

       Renard is getting in the ELEVATOR.  Sees Bond made it, fires.
       Bond rolls into a corner.

                           RENARD
                 We have our fireworks.  Now you can have
                 yours.

       And he machine-guns some barrels.  Rocket fuel spills out.
       He digs a finger into one of the holes, effortlessly rips the
       metal so more fuel cascades out.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. CATWALK ABOVE PIT

       Christmas cuts some wires together and with a hum, her IRIS
       DOOR OPENS...

       AT THE ELEVATOR

       Bond fires at Renard, hitting his shin...

       WITH RENARD

       looking down at his shin, noticing the blood.  Inconvenienced
       but not in pain.  He shuts the cage doors.  Pauses only to
       fire off half a clip at the SWITCH PANEL.  Shreds it.

       Bond leaps to his feet, racing forward, firing -- gets to the
       elevator as Renard disappears upwards with a smile. He POINTS
       DOWN...underneath him...

       Bond looks down.

       HIS P.O.V.  BENEATH THE ELEVATOR...A makeshift explosive
       device...sticks of dynamite wrapped around a detonator, set
       to explode

       Eyes wide, Bond looks back to the doors -- then to the switch
       panel -- now just a chaos of sparking wires.

       INT. LIFT SHAFT

       The pipe bomb ticking...

       INT. PASSAGEWAY BY ELEVATOR

       Bond is trapped.  He looks up...

       THE PULLEY HOOK HANGS DOWN...

       He jumps up, grabbing it, just as...

       KABOOM!

       The bomb ignites the spilled oil, A FIREBALL shoots along,
       scorching after Bond, who is SAILING THROUGH THE PASSAGE WAY,
       the force of the blast sending him hurling down the
       passageway ON THE PULLEY...heading straight for:

       A CLOSED IRIS DOOR which miraculously begins to OPEN as he
       SHOOTS THROUGH...

       Ahead, the next door is OPEN as well. He sees CHRISTMAS on
       the other side...

       HER P.O.V.  Bond hurtling toward her, ahead of a MASSIVE
       FIREBALL...

                           BOND
                 Close the door!  Close the door!

       But before she can, two of the FUEL BARRELS HURTLE through
       the closing iris, clattering into the pit, starting a fire
       below.

       Flames licking up the sides of the pit toward them.

       Bond looks up, sees the ARM OF THE ROBOT LIFTER, stretching
       upward toward an old SHAFT t the top of the ceiling...

       He and Christmas scramble up the robot arm, walk along the
       spider-like web that supported the bomb and find...

       AN OLD ELEVATOR...powered by a hydraulic system...

       They get in...hear the rumbling of the fire below...the old
       elevator moves slowly...the rumbling grows louder...

                           BOND
                 Shame you had to spot I wasn't the real
                 thing.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 So who are you?

                           BOND
                 Bond --

       Bond FIRES HIS GUN at the hissing hydraulic pulleys and...

       THE ELEVATOR shoots through the shaft at breakneck speed as

       BELOW THEM...THE PIT EXPLODES...

       INT. ELEVATOR

       Fire shoots up. Bond lunges to cover Christmas. As the smoke
       clears:

                           BOND
                     (finishing)
                 James Bond.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. MESA - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - CONTINUOUS

       Christmas and Bond climb out of the duct.  Through a cloud of
       dust he can see people running about, panicked.  There's been
       some shooting -- fresh corpses litter the ground.

       Bond looks past them to a plane coming this way.  The plane.
       It roars past, level with them.  He follows it with his eyes,
       helpless as it gets smaller and smaller...

                           CHRISTMAS
                 They won't get far. Every warhead has a
                 locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a
                 high-pitched signal on Russian emergency
                 frequencies. We can track the bomb.

                           BOND
                 With this?

       Bond removes the locator card from his jacket and shows it to
       her.  It flashes in the sun.

       Christmas shakes her head, disgusted.

       OMITTED 170 - 172

       INT. BRIEFING ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - DAY

       Busy.  Analysts huddle over monitors showing satellite
       images, trying to track the plane.

                           M
                 Do we have the range of Renard's plane?

                           TANNER
                 Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq,
                 Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...

                           M
                 Marvellous.

       Moneypenny enters...

                           MONEYPENNY
                 Elektra King is calling from Baku.

       M is surprised.

                           MONEYPENNY
                 It's a video line.

                           M
                 Put her on the wide screen.

       The face of ELEKTRA materializes on a large WALL MONITOR.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I'm sorry. I would never call you
                 except...Bond's disappeared. He...he left
                 my villa, some time in the middle of the
                 night and...

       M exchanges a look with Tanner.

                           ELEKTRA
                 My head of security has been found near a
                 local airstrip, murdered...

       M leans on the console in front of her.

                           M
                 I'll send someone out.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Could...could you come?

       M looks up.

       ELEKTRA, on the monitor, looks about as lost as she ever has.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I just can't help thinking...I'm next.

       M stares at the girl's face, her whole sordid history written
       there.  M turns away from the screen and says to Tanner...

                           M
                 Get me out there.


       OMITTED:174 - 201

       EXT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA, BAKU - STORM APPROACHING

       Elektra's villa against blue-black storm clouds, the Caspian
       choppy, wind blowing.

       INT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - BAKU - DAY

       Elektra works in her father's STUDY, illuminated by a halo of
       light from a single desk lamp. Pictures of her grandfather
       and father stare down at her from the walls. The wind BLOWS A
       WINDOW open.

       She gets up, crosses the room, shutting the window.  She
       stands there, listening to the silence and then...

       SHE HEARS A THUD. A strange, unsettling thud.

       She listens, a long time, to the silence.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Gabor...?

       She goes to the door, opens it...it whines on its hinges.
       She steps into...

       INT. LIBRARY

       A big room lined with books. Three french doors lead out to a
       balcony.  She walks a few paces in...

       THE DOOR SHUTS BEHIND HER, she whirls...

       GABOR, propped up behind the door, stares, wide-eyed, before
       he FALLS TO THE FLOOR.

       Elektra gasps, she turns again...

       A DARK FIGURE LOOMS, a shadow against the windows.  He moves
       forward, his face becoming visible...IT'S BOND.

                           ELEKTRA
                 James!

       She stares at him, shocked, hesitant.

                           BOND
                 You look surprised.

       She moves to Gabor, gets down to help him.  He stirs, he is
       alive, but unconscious. Elektra looks up at Bond.

                           ELEKTRA
                 What's wrong with you?  Are you crazy?

                           BOND
                 A little. Does it matter? After all,
                 what's the point of living if you can't
                 feel alive?  Isn't that right, Elektra?
                 Isn't that your motto?

                           ELEKTRA
                 What are you talking about?

                           BOND
                 Or did you steal it from your old friend
                 Renard?

                           ELEKTRA
                 ...what?

                           BOND
                 We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about
                 us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew
                 exactly where to hurt me...

       Elektra stands...she begins to tremble.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Are you saying...Renard is the man who's
                 trying to kill me?

                           BOND
                 You can drop the act, it's over.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I don't know what you're talking about!

                           BOND
                 I think you do.

       He walks toward her, threatening...

                           BOND
                 At MI-6 we call it Stockholm Syndrome.
                 It's common in kidnappings.  A young
                 impressionable victim. Sheltered,
                 sexually inexperienced. A powerful
                 kidnapper skilled in torture, in
                 manipulation. Something snaps in the
                 victim's mind. The captive falls in love
                 with her captor.

       At the word "love," Elektra explodes.  She SLAPS an
       unsuspecting Bond hard across the face.

                           ELEKTRA
                 How dare you!  How dare you! That
                 animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me!
                 You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt
                 you, is that it? You had a sling on your
                 arm at the funeral! I didn't have to
                 sleep with you to find that out.

                           BOND
                 He used your exact words.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You knew.  You knew all the time, that he
                 was out there, that he was coming for me,
                 and you lied. You used me, you used me as
                 bait. You made love to me -- what, to
                 pass the time as you waited for him to
                 strike?

       He has no answer.  He can't deny what she says.

       The phone rings, cuts through the tension.  Bond and Elektra
       staring at one another.  She lets it ring...  Then picks up.
       Listens, looks to Bond.

                           ELEKTRA
                 He's struck again.
                     (beat)
                 Five men are dead at the pipeline.

       He moves toward her.

                           BOND
                 I'm coming with you.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You do what you have to do, but I've
                 called in M.  She's en route from London
                 even now.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - DAY

       The MI-6 chopper lands.  We can see M through the window.
       Face set hard.

       EXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - MOMENTS LATER

       SCIENTIFIC, MILITARY and TURKISH POLICE VEHICLES parked
       around a medium-sized industrial plant.

       Bond accompanies M and Tanner toward a clutch of offices.
       All around, SOLDIERS, IDA personnel, POLICE scour the area.

                           M
                     (to Bond)
                 Glad to see you've turned up.

       He is moving fast, talking fast -- a sense of urgency.

                           BOND
                 They hit about 90 minutes ago. There's a
                 scientist here from the International
                 Decommissioning Agency, Dr. Jones.  She
                 has ten crews combing the area.

       They step out of the bright sunlight and into

       EXT.\INT. CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS

       FIVE BODY BAGS are being carried out by soldiers.  M surveys
       the scene; in an unlit corridor CHRISTMAS JONES and several
       men sweep the area with CLICKING Geiger counters.

       ELEKTRA is a distance away, listening to a Turkish policeman
       explain what's happening.  She nods acknowledgement to M.

       Tanner senses that Bond wants to talk to M alone:

                           TANNER
                 I'll see how they're coming with the
                 power...

       They watch him go.  M turns to Bond:

                           M
                 You had your hand on the bomb and you let
                 Renard get away with it.

       He draws her away, to a small alcove.  Takes something out of
       his jacket...THE LOCATOR CARD.

                           BOND
                 The report King bought. It's a manual.
                 Renard's men used it to remove this radio
                 tracking device from the warhead.

                           M
                 Then Robert was right about a Russian
                 connection.

                           BOND
                 They're getting their weapons from the
                 Russians, but where are they getting the
                 money to buy the weapons?  I can't help
                 thinking...the person close to King, the
                 one who switched that pin...

                           M
                 The inside man?

                           BOND
                 Is maybe...the inside woman.

       NOW THE LIGHTS POWER UP, disrupt the intimacy and intensity
       of their exchange.  The room is lined with MONITORS and a
       huge SATELLITE MAP of the pipeline's meandering path.

                           M
                 A woman?

       But before he can speak, ELEKTRA calls out, gesturing to A
       DIM LIGHT flashing on a console in front of her.

                           ELEKTRA
                 That's not right.

       A Technician comes over.  Tanner too, followed by Bond and M.

                           TANNER
                 What is it?

                           ELEKTRA
                 It's an observation and repair rig.
                 Travels along the pipe, checks for broken
                 seals.  But it's not supposed to be
                 there.

                           BOND
                     (thinks)
                 Stop it.

       The Technician flicks two switches.  The light continues to
       flash.  Confused, he tries others.  No change.

                           TECHNICIAN
                 I don't understand...

                           M
                 Where is the rig?

       Harried, the Technician activates the wall schematic of the
       pipeline.  A pulse of light travels along the line. And with
       it, a sense of horror descends...

                           M
                 The parcel's in the post.

                           TANNER
                 It's heading for the oil terminal.

                           M
                 Where it can do the most damage.

                           ELEKTRA
                 My God.
                     (to one of her men)
                 Have the terminal evacuated.

       The man gets on the phone...

                           BOND
                     (to Tech)
                 Speed?

                           TECHNICIAN
                 Full on.  Seventy miles an hour.

       He punches buttons. Christmas has come, stands next to Bond.

                           TECHNICIAN
                 One hundred and six miles from the
                 terminal.

                           BOND
                     (quick)
                 It'll reach the other end in seventy-
                 eight minutes.
                     (to Tech)
                 Any more of these rigs?

       The Technician checks his records, looks up, nods.

                           TECHNICIAN
                 There's one parked in the passageway
                 ahead of it.

       Decisive, Christmas heads for the door, turns to her team:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 I'll need some help...

       Her IDA colleagues look sheepish.  Bond moves to her.

                           BOND
                 Come on.

       For just a moment, Christmas looks wary:

                           BOND
                 Unless you'd like to see my ID first.

       She almost smiles.

       M nods to Tanner to follow them.  Bond doesn't look at
       Elektra.  But she watches him go...

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY

       The MI-6 helicopter swoops along the pipeline...

       Tanner is beside the pilot.  Bond and Christmas in the back.

       They look at one another, the danger ahead melting the frost
       between them.

       INT. PIPELINE - LATER

       Bond and Christmas climb through an access hatch down onto
       the electric RIG.  Its lights blaze fifty yards into the
       tunnel.  Then darkness.

       Christmas takes the driver's spot, Bond the rear, nearest to
       the approaching BOMB.  Tanner leans in:

                           TANNER
                     (sealing them in)
                 Good luck.

       Bonds nods, checks his watch.  Christmas looks nervously down
       the pipe.

                           BOND
                 Be one along any minute.

       And she starts the machine off...

       INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING)

       It quickly picks up speed, its lights flooding the seemingly
       endless pipe before them.

       Christmas looks behind, apprehensive.  Waiting for the lights
       of the explosive rig.

       It's tense.  They travel along, expectant...

                           BOND
                 When this is over we should bury the
                 hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?

                           CHRISTMAS
                 When this is over our bodies may be blown
                 to smithereens.

                           BOND
                 Alright then, brunch.

       His lightness relaxes her, she appreciates it.


       INT. COMMAND ROOM - PIPELINE CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS

       Elektra, M, and others. The room is crowded with concerned
       personnel.  M watches the two blips on the schematic getting
       closer together. One of her MEN approaches, a radio in his
       ear.

                           RADIO MAN
                 Tanner reports Bond is headed for the
                 rendezvous.

                           M
                 Excellent. Evacuate Miss King and the
                 others.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You can evacuate my workers, but I'm not
                 going anywhere.

       M looks at her, then nods, impressed by her courage.

       INT. PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY

       Bond and Christmas waiting expectantly.  Tense silence.

       Finally, a WHOOSHING NOISE, GETTING LOUDER.  Lights appear
       behind, reflecting on a bend, then... here it comes, the rig
       tearing through the pipe.

       Bond looks over his shoulder at Christmas'
       speedometer...she's only at fifty...

                           BOND
                 Faster! Get our speed up!

       Christmas presses forward...Bond turns, his feet OUT toward
       the approaching rig...the lights getting closer... closer...

       Bond's rig jolts as the other makes contact.  He cushions the
       blow with his feet.  Both rigs moving together now, he CLIMBS
       ONTO THE BOMB RIG...Puts out a hand, helps Christmas across.

       The bomb sits there, daunting, deadly.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Tactical fission device.  Low yield.

       They look at one another, then set straight to work.

       INT. COMMAND ROOM - PIPELINE CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS

       The room is quiet, tense.  M and her two men, Elektra, Gabor,
       the King TECHNICIAN and three armed security guards at the
       doors. They are the only ones left.  Going down with the
       ship...if it goes.  M and Elektra watch the two lights now
       together on the console.  A tense silence.  Everyone's edgy.
       Elektra perhaps a little more than the rest.  She exchanges a
       glance with Gabor.

       INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY

       CLOSE INSIDE THE BOMB:  the timer.  1:45 MINUTES.

       Bond's face betrays the difficulty of what they're
       attempting.  The digital clock ticks down... 1:30, 1:29...

       OMITTED 217-218

       INT. PIPELINE - DAY

       The rigs speed through the tunnel. Nothing to see.  But
       WHOOSH!  As the rigs hurtle past...

       INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY

       The pipe suddenly dips.  They cling on as the machine bucks
       like a rollercoaster.  Back on a straight...

       Her brow furrows.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 The plutonium is missing.  They've taken
                 the core!

                           BOND
                 Then it's no longer a bomb?

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (back to work, urgent)
                 It's a bomb alright. We're still dead if
                 the trigger charge goes off...

       Bond's mind races in the ghostly light of the tunnel.

       He stares at the timer:  0:44, 0:43...  Makes a decision.

                           BOND
                 Let it blow.

       Christmas shoots a look, astonished.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 But we can stop it.

       Taking her arm...

                           BOND
                 Let it blow.

       She can't believe what he's saying. His eyes shoot to an
       INSPECTION HATCH the lights illuminate up ahead.

                           BOND
                 Trust me.  Leave it.

       He grabs her, wrenches her away from the bomb.

       INT. PIPELINE - DAY

       The rig zooms past the exit hatch -- Bond leaps off, taking
       her with him.  They tumble along the pipe.  Agile, Bond
       springs to his feet, pulls her up.  They run like hell for
       the hatch, into the darkness...

       EXT. PIPELINE - DAY

       The pipeline.  A long beat, then...

       KABOOM!!  A section of the pipe explodes, debris rocketing in
       every direction.

       As the smoke clears we see a fifty yard section of pipe has
       been destroyed.

       OMIT 223

       INT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER - SAME

       On the consoles, red concentric circles pulse outward from
       the point of impact, emitting one, monotone BEEP....

       The watchers are frozen, stunned, shocked. Gabor, a radio
       earpiece in his ear, reports information.

                           GABOR
                 It wasn't nuclear...the bomb was a dud.
                 The trigger charge blew out a fifty yard
                 section of pipeline...

                           M
                 And Bond?

       An agonizing beat. The alarm beep sputters and dies.

                           GABOR
                 Nothing.

       M and Elektra share a look.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Do you think he's dead?

       M can't answer.  She shakes her head.

                           M
                 We just have to wait.

       M shifts. The hi-tech room is eerily lit by the pulsing red
       lights on every screen, showing the explosion.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to M)
                 I have a gift for you.  Something that
                 belonged to my father. He would have
                 wanted you to have it.

       M feels uneasy.

                           M
                 Perhaps this isn't the time...

                           ELEKTRA
                 Please.

       She hands M a small box.  M unties the ribbon.

                           ELEKTRA
                 He often spoke of how...compassionately
                 you advised him on the best course of
                 action during my kidnapping.

       M opens the box.  It is THE EYE OF THE GLENS...the heirloom
       pin, the original.

                           ELEKTRA
                 It's very valuable, you know. I just
                 couldn't let it explode with the rest of
                 him.

       M looks up, horrified, when:

       GABOR AND ANOTHER SECURITY MAN SHOOT M'S TWO GUARDS IN THE
       HEAD...point blank, cold blood.  The men fall.

       M looks back at Elektra, a blood-curdling glare.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to her men)
                 Take her to the chopper.

       EXT. PIPELINE - DAY

       From on high we follow the snaking pipeline ... until it
       disappears in a VAST, SMOULDERING BOMB CRATER.  Beyond, the
       pipeline continues unperturbed.

       Two TINY FIGURES on the banks of the crater.

       CLOSE ON THEM

       Bond and Christmas, very much alive.  She's angry.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What the hell were you doing?  You nearly
                 killed us!

                           BOND
                 I did kill us. She thinks we're dead.
                 And she thinks she got away with it.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What the hell are you talking about?

                           BOND
                 It's part of some plan. She dresses it up
                 like a terrorist attack.  The explosion
                 covers up the theft of the plutonium.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Who's she?

                           BOND
                 Elektra King.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is
                 her pipeline.

                           BOND
                 Makes her look even more innocent.

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (skeptical)
                 What would she want with weapons grade
                 plutonium?

                           BOND
                 I was hoping you could tell me.

       Christmas stares at him.  Wheels turning.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 You steal an old bomb, small by today's
                 standards, about the size of the one that
                 destroyed Nagasaki, take the plutonium
                 core out of it, intending to use it...
                     (beat)
                 To make a bigger, better bomb.

       They're both chilled by the thought.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 I have to get after that core.  This is
                 my ass.

       She starts fiddling with the radio. Suddenly there's a
       CRACKLE.

                           TANNER
                 Tanner to 007, do you read?

       Bond grabs the radio.

                           BOND
                 Loud and clear.  I have to speak to M.

                           TANNER
                 She's gone.

                           BOND
                 What?

                           TANNER
                 She's disappeared.  And two of our men
                 have been killed.

       It impacts on Bond.  His eyes harden.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What is it?

                           BOND
                 She just upped the stakes. All her chips
                 are on the table now.  And M's life is
                 part of the bet.

       He looks out at the long stretch of pipeline, like a deadly
       snake with the world for its bed.

                           BOND
                 I know I promised you champagne, but
                 would you settle for caviar?

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - ISTANBUL - TWILIGHT

       A boat puts in at an ancient tower in the middle of a vast
       body of water (in fact, the Bosphorus).

       Renard disembarks with several of his retinue, heavily laden
       with bags and cases.  They enter the tower...

       INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - CONTINUOUS

       A fantastic space:  stained glass windows cast myriad
       patterns over elaborate tile and marble surfaces.  Pillars,
       iron lattices, velvet drapes and flowers embroider the huge
       room.

       As they enter, Elektra swoops across the floor and into
       Renard's arms.  He holds her.  She pushes him away.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You're hurting me.

       He senses something different between them.  She tries to
       hide it.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Brought me something?

       He smiles, grabs a case off one of his men, opens it up,
       pulls out a sphere of cobalt blue metal.

       She looks at it with wary fascination.

                           RENARD
                 Go on.  It's safe.  Touch your destiny.

       She traces a finger along the metal.  A flicker of wonder:

                           ELEKTRA
                 Warm.

                           RENARD
                     (pointed)
                 Is it?

       She's sensitive to his buried frustration:

                           ELEKTRA
                 I've brought something for you as well.

       INT. ROOM - MAIDEN'S TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

       Elektra opens a heavy door, she and Renard past through to...

       A SMALL ROOM...a window set in the stone on one side.  The
       other side is divided off by a WALL OF BARS, creating a cell
       which now contains: M

       The cell is bare, except for a camp bed in the corner. M
       betrays no fear.  A quiet defiance burns in her.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Just as I promised.

       Renard steps forward.  Bars separate him from M.

                           RENARD
                 My executioner.

                           M
                 Over-praise, I'm afraid.  But my people
                 will finish the job.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Your people? Your people will leave you
                 here to rot just like you left me. You
                 and my father. He didn't think my life
                 was worth the chump change he spent on a
                 day at the stock market.

                           M
                 Your father...

                           ELEKTRA
                 Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my
                 mother. The kingdom I will rightly take
                 back.

       Elektra leaves.  Renard is left alone with M.

                           M
                 She's insane.  Is that what you did to
                 her?

                           RENARD
                 No. I'm afraid it is what you did.

       He crosses close to the bars.

                           RENARD
                 When I took her she was...promise itself.
                 So clever, so vibrant, so...full of life
                 force. And you left her there, at the
                 mercy of a man like me. You ruined her.
                 For what?  To get to me? She is worth
                 fifty of me.

                           M
                 For once, I agree with you.

       He shakes his head, amused by her pluck.

                           M
                 So she used all that brilliance to get
                 revenge on her father, on me.

                           RENARD
                 No. I wanted you. I wanted you for
                 myself.

       He takes something out of his pocket.  A small TRAVEL CLOCK.
       He sets it.

                           RENARD
                 Since you sent your man to kill me, I
                 have been watching time tick slowly away,
                 marching inevitably toward my own death.
                 Watch these hands, M. At noon tomorrow,
                 your time is up. And I guarantee you...I
                 will not miss.  You will die. Along with
                 everyone in this city and the future of
                 the West.

       He places the clock on a tall stool, just out of reach
       through her bars.  He leaves.  We hold on the clock:

       Eight p.m.


       EXT. CITY OF WALKWAYS - BAKU - DUSK (OLD SC. 174)

       Valentin Zukovsky in the back of his chauffeured Rolls
       Royce...  We PULL BACK, to take in an amazing sight:  the car
       is on a network of raised walkways and platforms that extends
       as far as the eye can see.  A decaying legacy of the Soviet
       years.

       EXT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS - DUSK (OLD SC.175)

       Zukovsky limps purposefully away from his Rolls along a
       walkway leading to a Beluga fishery built over the water.

       INT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS - DUSK (OLD SC.176)

       Nailed on the battered old door, the lid of a caviar jar, a
       label illustrated with a LINE DRAWING OF ZUKOVSKY. Zukovsky
       opens the door and finds himself...

       Staring straight down Bond's pistol.  Bond and Christmas are
       silhouetted by the gold dusk light.  At their feet lies one
       of Zukovsky's workers.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress
                 this innocent thing?

                           BOND
                 She's no innocent.  This is my nuclear
                 consultant.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic
                 relationship.

       Hands held clear of his body, Zukovsky enters, his evening
       dress decidedly out of place here.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Really Bond, couldn't you find a nice
                 Russian scientist with hair growing out
                 of his ears?

                           BOND
                 What's your business with Elektra King?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 I thought you were the one in her
                 business.

                           BOND
                 She dropped a million and half dollars to
                 the House -- your House. And you didn't
                 even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you
                 off.  What for?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 As ever you are the spy who has to see a
                 plot wherever he looks.

       Bond SLAMS Zukovsky hard against a vat of caviar.  Wood
       splits, roe spills onto the floor.  Zukovsky is appalled.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!

                           BOND
                 You are out of your league.  She's
                 working with Renard.

       Christmas moves in, intense but firm:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 They've stolen a nuclear device.

       A subtle change in Zukovsky's countenance.

                           BOND
                 Tell us what you know, Zukovsky.  Tell
                 us, before its too late.

       But it may be already:

       The SOUND OF A HELICOPTER.  Zukovsky frowns, the SOUND
       GETTING LOUDER --

       Bond is the first to move as --

       INT. CAVIAR FISHERY - NIGHT (OLD SC. 177)

       -- wood suddenly splinters everywhere -- the wall and roof
       tear open behind them - GIANT VERTICALLY-SUSPENDED SAWS RIP
       THROUGH, just missing them.

       THE SPINNING TEETH (OLD SC. 178)

       The blades churn through the corrugated roof, spraying CAVIAR
       everywhere.

       EXT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS (OLD SC. 179)

       Bond BURSTS OUT OF THE BUILDING...Zukovsky and his guards and
       even the chauffeur are firing at the chopper...

       EXT. RAMP TO LOWER WALKWAY (OLD SC. 180)

       Bond makes for his BMW, running down a flight of steps, onto
       a lower walkway when...THE SECTION AHEAD OF HIM
       EXPLODES...the second chopper above hitting its mark with a
       thrown grenade.  Bond is trapped by the fire and smoke, the
       only way out is ALONG THE PIPELINES...he runs along a narrow
       section of pipe and then JUMPS DOWN to another walkway.  The
       PIPES are now above him...the chopper's relentless saws CUT
       THROUGH THE PIPE...GAS JETS OUT...Bond HURLS HIMSELF up a
       stairway.

       INT. CAVIAR FISHERY

       Zukovsky and Christmas watch in horror as Chopper One blades
       away more roof above them.

       EXT. LOWER WALKWAY

       Bond takes something out of his pocket, a remote control
       device...he presses some buttons...HIS CAR COMES TO
       LIFE...lights on, it drives toward him.

       He rushes to meet it. Chopper Two follows behind Bond,
       slicing up the walkway just behind him.  Bond gets to the car
       and JUMPS IN as the chopper veers away.

       INT. CAR

       Bond activates his missile device as he watches Chopper Two
       pass behind the factory.  Suddenly there's a huge roar behind
       him as the blades from Chopper One RIP THROUGH THE ROOF,
       SLICING HIS CAR IN HALF.

       But Bond is undeterred.  He sets off the missile toward the
       disappearing Chopper One.

       EXT. CHOPPER

       A DIRECT HIT. Chopper One explodes and falls onto the walkway
       setting the scene ablaze.

       EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME

       Zukovsky and Christmas see the explosion, then see Chopper
       Two dropped FOUR ARMED MEN onto a nearby walkway.  The men
       make their way toward the factory, firing at the guards.
       Zukovsky and Christmas are forced inside.

       ANGLE ON BOND

       Who sees the danger to the others and runs off along the
       walkways back to the factory.  The Chopper follows him,
       shooting.

       Bond outruns it, until, ahead of him A GRENADE EXPLODES,
       destroying the walkway and hurling Bond into the water.

       EXT. FACTORY

       The gunfight continues as the armed men take out Zukovsky's
       guards. Then, two of the assailants follow ZUKOVSKY and
       CHRISTMAS into...

       INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

       The chauffeur is shot and killed.  The gunmen then turn their
       attention to Zukovsky and Christmas, when suddenly BOND
       APPEARS through a trap door in the floor boards.

       Bond shoots one of the gunmen, then fires on the other...
       Zukovsky grabs Christmas and they make their escape  Bond
       sees a third gunman firing from the basement and takes him
       out.

       EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME

       Zukovsky and Christmas make a dash for Zukovsky's Rolls.
       They dive in...Zukovsky rams the car into reverse...behind
       him, A CHOPPER SLICES the walkway to smithereens...Zukovsky
       can't stop it as the car leaps backward and into THE WATER
       BELOW....

       INT. FACTORY

       Bond finishes off the remaining two armed men in a furious
       gunfight and exits.

       EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME

       Bond sees Zukovsky and Christmas swimming to safety.  The
       chopper bears down on him.  He leaps back to what's left of
       the building, picks up a flare gun.  He jumps down to a
       walkway at water level and cranks open a rusted GAS JET...he
       then waits for the Chopper to line up over it as it
       approaches Bond for the kill....

       Bond fires the flare gun...

       THE GAS EXPLODES!

       The Chopper tries to pull away, but it's too late.  The
       flames engulf it, igniting a fireball.

       IN THE WATER

       Zukovsky pulls himself back onto a walkway and heads for the
       factory, but speeding at him are to FREE-FLYING SAW BLADES
       from the chopper that has just exploded!

       OMITTED 231S to 231Z

       EXT. WALKWAY

       Zukovsky dives away -- into a CAVIAR PIT.  The saws embed in
       the cabin behind him.

       The caviar pit is like sinking sand, deep -- he's going
       under.  Flounders, trying to cling to a crate blown in there
       by the explosion.  Then he looks in horror:

       EXT. SIDE OF CAVIAR PIT (OLD SC. 199)
       POV ZUKOVSKY:

       Bond appearing at the edge of the caviar pit, dragging
       himself up, soaking wet.  He's holding another harpoon gun.
       Points it directly at Zukovsky.  This time he really means
       business.

       EXT. CAVIAR PIT/SIDE (OLD SC. 200)

       Zukovsky, on the point of being swallowed by the caviar,
       clawing at the crate.  Bond, steely eyed, cold:

                           BOND
                 Now...where were we?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 A rope!

                           BOND
                 No.  The truth!
                     (beat)
                 She thought I was dead -- those blades
                 were meant for you.  What do you know
                 that she would kill you for?

       Zukovsky is sinking.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 I don't know what you're talking --

       Zukovsky sees Christmas appear beside Bond:

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Help me, don't let me drown.

       She looks to Bond -- sees he's serious.

                           BOND
                     (to Zukovsky)
                 You're in this thing up to your neck.

       Zukovsky sinks alarmingly -- he talks rapidly, staccato:

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle
                 machinery for her.  Russian stuff.

                           BOND
                 And the payoff on the tables?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 A special job.  A...a...a submarine.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is
                 Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.

                           BOND
                 Where's the sub going?!

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 No!  Get me out!

                           BOND
                 This is too big for even you.  Where is
                 it?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 This is a family matter! If my nephew is
                 in danger, we do it my way, or nothing!
                 Now get me out!

       But he looks more worried than ever as Bond takes aim with
       the harpoon gun -- squeezes the trigger.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 No! Bond!

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (alarmed)
                 Bond!

       Bond fires.  Zukovsky YELLS as the HARPOON SHOOTS TOWARD HIM.

       It takes him a moment to realize he hasn't been hit -- the
       harpoon splintering the crate, just missing him.  He clings
       to the crate, exhausted, as Bond and Christmas drag him to
       safety.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Commander Bond, you are dangerous,
                 unpredictable, and a hothead.

       He just looks at her.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 But then again, explosive devices are my
                 specialty.

       Zukovsky scowls, wet, angry, looking from his ruined suit to
       the devastation that was once his caviar factory as, behind
       him, walkways CREAK, teeter, and CRASH into the sea.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just
                 you, me and my people.

                           BOND
                 Where?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Istanbul.

       INT/EXT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - NIGHT

       Beyond iron balustrades we see one of the most fabulous views
       in the world -- on one side the still waters of the Golden
       Horn, on the other, the dancing waves of the unsheltered
       Bosphorus -- and in between, the tumbling roofs, soaring
       minarets and crouching mosques of the Pera district.

       RENARD scans the water with night-vision binoculars.

       EXT. BOSPHORUS - NIGHT - HIS GREEN POV:

       A SUPERTANKER churns along...

       ADJUST ANGLE

       The CAMERA SINKS BENEATH THE WAVES, steals through the gloom -
       - eventually comes upon something sitting just beneath the
       belly of the tanker.  The silhouette of a SUBMARINE, hugging
       the tanker's shadow, creeping undetected into the
       Bosphorus...

       INT. M'S CELL - NIGHT

       M paces her cell.  Looks out, at the clock:

       It is MIDNIGHT.  Twelve hours to go.

       She crosses her arms.  Returns to pacing.  Puts her hands in
       her coat pockets:

       She feels something.  Takes it out.

       THE LOCATOR CARD.  Black and shiny, with two copper terminals
       on one end.

       M taps it on her hand. She looks back out.  TO THE CLOCK.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. BEDROOM - MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - NIGHT

       Renard and Elektra.  She is on the bed, Renard stroking her,
       worshipping her skin.

                           RENARD
                 So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.

                           ELEKTRA
                 How would you know?

       It stings him. Elektra sits up, pulling a robe around her.

                           RENARD
                 Why are you like this?  Because Bond is
                 dead?  It's what you wanted.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (beat)
                 Of course...

       Renard gets up.  Paces the floor.

                           RENARD
                 He was a...good lover?

                           ELEKTRA
                 What do you think?

       Renard leans against her desk, closing his eyes, squeezing
       out the images.  After a moment, he SMASHES HIS FIST through
       the hand-painted wood.  Elektra looks up.

       HER P.O.V.  A huge splinter of wood juts out of Renard's
       hand.

       Renard looks at it, curious, unfazed.

                           RENARD
                 Nothing.

       Elektra comes to him. Leads him to the bed.  Sits. Gently
       removes the splinter.  Then, she takes an icecube from the
       bucket.  Runs it along his wound.

                           ELEKTRA
                 What about this?

       And she runs the ice down his cheek.  He shakes his head.
       Tormented.

                           RENARD
                 Nothing.

       Now she runs the ice down her neck...

                           ELEKTRA
                 But surely...

       ...her fingers becoming wet, she runs the ice down between
       her breasts, leaving a trail.  Teasing...

                           ELEKTRA
                 ...You can feel this?

       She's moving the ice lower on herself... We see her lips
       open, enjoying the sensation.  A beat, then his smile slowly
       grows.  As she does something else.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (sensual)
                 Remember ... pleasure?

       INT. M'S CELL - SAME

       M is at the door of her cell.  Her arm is stretched out
       through the bars.  She is using her high-heeled shoe to try
       to HOOK the leg of the stool and drag it toward her.  She can
       only jut tap the leg with the tip of the heel.  She swipes
       out at the little three-legged stool, tapping it, tapping
       it...

       It scoots toward her a little...she taps it again, gets her
       shoe HOOKED on the leg of the stool and starts to drag it
       when...

       The rickety stool hits a bump on the ancient stone floor and
       SPILLS OVER...the clock HITS THE GROUND and SKIDS across the
       stones, coming to rest ACROSS THE ROOM, on the floor near the
       window.

       M leans against the bars. SHE HEARS HER THE OUTER DOOR
       CLANKING OPEN...

       She hurries to her cot and lies down.

       GABOR ENTERS...a burly shadow in the light from the hall.  He
       walks in.  Looks at M.  Picks up the clock and sets it ON THE
       WINDOW SILL.

       He leaves, shutting the door behind him.

       M sits up. Looks out to the clock, glowing in the dark.

       IT READS TWO A.M.

       She drops her head back on the wall.  She will not sleep
       tonight.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

       ESTABLISH the vast city astride the Bosphorus.

       EXT. ISTANBUL STREETS - SAME

       The sun starting to rise.  Street vendors are the only people
       about, moving their carts into place, getting ready to place
       out their wares.  We hold on a BUILDING.

       INT. DYE FACTORY - SAME

       A multi-levelled, rickety old building full of colourful
       fabrics drying high overhead; the light shafts through them
       casting pools of different coloured light.

       It is a working factory, bolts of fabric and vats of dye, but
       it is also:

       AN OLD KGB SURVEILLANCE CENTER

       Pushed to one end of the large room are stacks of radio
       equipment, old consoles, audio equipment and radar screens.
       Once a high-tech surveillance center, it has gone to seed.
       There are men and women here, smoking, using the equipment,
       slightly dissolute, very sinister, where the only membership
       card is an old KGB ID.  Zukovsky is here, leaning behind a
       RADIO OPERATOR.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Any luck reaching Yevgeny?

                           OPERATOR
                 Negative, comrade.

       He moves to CHRISTMAS AND BOND, pouring over a large MAP OF
       ISTANBUL spread out on a table.

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (to Zukovsky)
                 What is this place?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye
                 Factory was just a front; now it turns a
                 good profit.

       Bond notices THE BOA in the corner with some others.

                           BOND
                 Your old friend Dmitri.

       Zukovsky nods to his old friend.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Today, you are glad to have the Boa  on
                 your side.

       Zukovsky looks at the map.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 In the good old days, the KGB had three
                 or four spots where our submarines could
                 surface without anyone knowing. But
                 Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What class sub does your nephew run?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 C-class.

                           BOND
                 Nuclear.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear
                 reactor.
                     (the penny drops)
                 He's not loading any cargo. They want the
                 sub. The sub itself.
                 Put weapons grade plutonium inside the
                 sub's reactor: Instant, catastrophic
                 meltdown.

                           BOND
                 Made to look just like an accident.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Mother of God.

                           BOND
                 The right kind of explosion in the right
                 spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut
                 off the Black Sea.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 But why? Eight million people would die,
                 the land irradiated for a hundred years.
                 A cloud of radiation the size of
                 Europe...

                           BOND
                     (chilled)
                 Because an explosion like that would kill
                 all the other pipelines. There would be
                 only one way to get the oil out of the
                 Caspian and pump it to the world...

                           CHRISTMAS
                 The King pipeline.

                           BOND
                 Elektra would control it all.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 If what you say it true...it may be too
                 late for Yevgeny.

       INT. SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - ISTANBUL - DAY

       The ancient arched underbelly of a waterside building.

       Something is disturbing a large expanse of water.  A black
       shadow looms beneath the waves.  A SUBMARINE SURFACES.

       INT. SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - ISTANBUL - DAY

       Waiting at the newly excavated quay:  Renard and his men.

       The submarine's hatch opens.  A YOUTHFUL CAPTAIN EMERGES,
       vaguely resembling his uncle, Zukovsky.

                           RENARD
                 Captain...

                           YEVGENY
                 Sir. We are ready to load your cargo.
                 We only have a few hours before we'll be
                 missed.

                           RENARD
                 You came with a skeleton crew?

                           YEVGENY
                 That's all we can afford these days.

                           RENARD
                 Of course. We are grateful for your
                 efforts.

       One of his men comes forward with several bottles of brandy
       and other food.

                           RENARD
                 We have brandy and other refreshments for
                 your men.

       The Captain nods, pleased.

       INT. DYE FACTORY

       Bond and Christmas and Zukovsky watch as the radio operators

                 If we're not in time and something has
                 happened to him... you must let me kill
                 them.

       Bond stares hard at him.  A long beat.

                           BOND
                 Whoever gets there first, Zukovsky.  They

       Eerie, dark, the lights inside green and sickly.

       CLOSE ON

       A half-eaten sandwich. An empty glass of brandy on the floor,
       just near the hand it fell from...

       PULL BACK TO SEE

       The dead face of Yevgeny, poisoned.  Others of his crew
       around, also dead.

       Renard and his men tour the grisly scene.

                           RENARD
                 Take them up and throw them in the sea.

       As they drag Yevgeny away, his HAT falls on the ground.
       Renard picks it up and PUTS IT ON HIS HEAD.

                           RENARD
                 We'll be underway in two hours.  Use that
                 time to re-familiarize yourselves with
                 your stations. Then ponder how rich
                 you'll be.  The re-breathers for the
                 escape are already on board.

       A man appears holding a heavy lead box containing the
       plutonium.  Renard takes the box as if it weighs nothing.
       Stronger then ever.

                 Now you know how it feels.  To be locked
                 away, to wonder if they're coming for
                 you, if anyone will ever come for you.

                           M
                 Someone will come.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.

       Elektra walks to the window.  She looks out.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Somehow, I find that strangely
                 ...disappointing.

       M watches her, her heart beating.

                           M
                 Elektra. What time is it?

       Elektra picks up the little clock. Walks over to the cell
       bars.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Time for you to die.

       And she reaches through the bars and HANDS M THE CLOCK.

       The two women's eyes meet.

                           RENARD
                 The reactor is secured.

       She turns, sees RENARD in the doorway.  She crosses to him
       and SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT behind her.

       INT. OUTSIDE DOOR - MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY

       Their eyes lock.

                           RENARD
                 This is the end.

                           ELEKTRA
                 No.  It is the beginning. The world will
                 never be the same.

       He lays the Captain's hat down. Tries to mask his sorrow.

                           RENARD
                 It will be yours, and yours alone. Have
                 fun with it.

       Forces himself to leave, heads down the stairs.

       INT. M'S CELL - SAME

       M works quickly.  She pops open the back of the clock and

       He writes the coordinates down.  Bond picks them up.

                           BOND
                 The locator card. It's M.

       He takes the coordinates over to the map and DRAWS A
       CORRESPONDING LINE across it.

                 The rest?

       Bond draws another line across the map. At the point at which
       the intersect...a small island in the Bosphorus.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 The Maiden's Tower.

                           BOND
                 How appropriate.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 I'd heard there were some renovations
                 there...no one would look for a sub in
                 that place in a million years.

       Suddenly Bond's instinct are aroused.  Out of the corner of
       his eye, he sees THE BOA set something on the ground and move
       slowly UP THE STAIRS.

       Bond looks at the pack he left on the ground...

       He grabs Christmas and HURLS HER TO THE FLOOR.

       KABOOM!

       A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rips the place apart.  In half a second
       the air is thick with coloured dust and drifting clumps of
       burning silk.

       Bond stands.  Christmas is stunned, but okay.  He looks
       around at the others - few dead, all out for the count, among
       them, Zukovsky.

       Bond heads for the door after the Boa.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Zukovsky...

                           BOND
                 If I don't get to the Boa before he gets
                 to Maiden's Tower, M is dead.

       Bond runs out, into

       EXT. STREET - DAY

       Teeming with people, his eyes scanning, he spots...THE BOA
       climbing a ladder alongside a building to A ROOF.

       Bond chases after him, clambering up, but when he gets to the
       top of the roof...

       Boa has now been joined by THREE THUGS.  One attacks Bond as
       the Boa and the others move away...

       Bond fights with the thug, they stumble across the roof,
       gripping each other, until Bond gets the upper hand and
       THROWS HIM DOWN through a thatched roof where he falls...

       EXT. BAZAAR

       Into the market below.

       Christmas, just coming into the square, sees the body
       falling...she runs to the thug, thinking it might be Bond...

       But the thug raises up, smiling at her, blood on his teeth.

       She turns and runs...the thug gives chase...

       ON THE ROOFS ABOVE

       Bond is following Boa and the other two men as they LEAP from
       roof to roof. He sees them jump off onto the roof of...

       EXT. MOVING BUS

       Motoring rapidly away from him.  He makes a spectacular leap
       to a wobbly FLAG POLE that swings him toward the bus,
       dropping him on the roof before it SNAPS BACK, into the
       overhead TRAM WIRES ABOVE and setting off sparks.

       ON THE BUS

       Bond barely gets to his feet before Thug #2 is upon him.
       They grapple, struggling to maintain their footing as the bus
       speeds through the rickety old streets. He throws the guy
       over...

       The thug desperately CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF THE BUS...

       Bond now takes on the third thug, unaware that number two has
       climbed back on and is about to WHACK HIM ON THE HEAD with
       his gun when...

       THE BUS TURNS onto a new street...THE WIRES AGAIN...Thug
       Two's gun is caught up in them...he is instantly
       ELECTROCUTED.

       Thug three watches his friend's horrible death, giving Bond
       time to slug him hard across the face and THROW HIM FROM THE
       BUS...

       EXT. STREET

       Thug two's body goes SLAMMING INTO THE WINDSHIELD of a fast
       moving van...BURSTS OUT through the back doors of said van
       and tumbles out onto the street where it is HIT BY A CAR.

       ON THE BUS

       Bond turns back toward...BOA. Now it is just the two of them.

       The bus is hissing to a stop.

       The Boa leaps on to the bed of a passing truck.  Bond rushes
       forward and leaps on to the top of a passing taxi.  The taxi
       jams on his breaks and Bond rolls across the bonnet and on to
       the street.  He springs to his feet.

       Fifty yards ahead the truck carrying the Boa has stopped for
       traffic.  The Boa jumps out and darts into an alley.

       EXT. ISTANBUL - ALLEY - DAY

       The Alley leads into a small CAFE where PATRONS smoke water
       pipes and drink coffee.  The Boa is nowhere to be seen.

       Bond slips out his gun holding it out of sight close to his
       leg so as not to alarm the civilians.  He steps into the
       cafe.

       EXT. ISTANBUL - CAFE - DAY

       Bond makes his way through the tables to the doorway in the
       back.  He looks inside - just a few children  at play.  Bond
       is suddenly blind-sided by a vicious kidney punch which
       brings him to his knees.  He struggles to bring up his gun -
       but the Boa knocks it out of his hand.

       The Boa locks Bond's head in an unbreakable choke hold from
       behind.  Bond pulls on the massive arms - but to no avail.
       He glances down to his right - HIS GUN - just out of reach.

       Bond reaches out for it - his fingers just graze it.
       Suddenly the Boa's foot kicks out, knocking the gun across
       the room.  He tighten his grip and speaks in Bond's ear.

                           BOA
                 For years I was told I could never take
                 the great James Bond and his Walther PPK.
                 What good is your gun now, Bond?

       Bond can't breathe, his eyes start to dim.  He slumps
       forward, his left hand touches something hot.  It's the iron
       basket of coals used to keep the water pipes lite.  Bond's
       fingers touch the wire handle that arches across the top.  He
       grabs it and with his last reserves -

       Swings it at the back of his head hitting the Boa on the side
       of the head with the SOUND OF RAW BACON HITTING A HOT
       SKILLET.

       The Boa drops Bond and leaps to his feet holding the side of
       his face.  Bond falls forward fighting for breath and trying
       to clear his head.

       The Boa runs out the back door.  Bond finds his gun, holsters
       it and follows.

       EXT. ISTANBUL - SIDE STREET - DAY

       Bond comes out into a side street crowded with VENDERS AND
       SHOPPERS.  Bond sees the Boa pushing his way through the
       crowd to...

       EXT. ISTANBUL - FERRY TERMINAL - DAY

       RUSSIAN TRAMP STEAMER taking on cargo.  Bond enters square in
       time to see the Boa making a Bee line for the Russian
       steamer.

       As the Boa, much the worse-for-ware, starts up the gangway to
       the top deck of the steamer, Bond hitches a ride on a cargo
       net that is being hoisted aboard by the ship's boom.

       EXT. RUSSIAN STEAMER - DAY

       Boa, breathing hard gets to the deck.  He lumbers across it
       but before he can reach the other side he is tripped up by
       Bond who has been waiting for him by the side of the deck
       house.  The Boa goes sprawling.  As Bond comes for him he
       scrambles to his feet, grabs a nearby bailing hook, and
       swings at Bond.  But Bond is ready for him.  He wards off the
       blow with a small wooden cover from a shipping crate.  He
       traps the Boa's arm and gives him two quick devastating kicks
       in the solar plexus.  He Boa stages back to the railing.  A
       final kick from Bond sends him over the side...

       THE BOA FALLS, LANDING ON HIS BACK ON THE DECK BELOW WITH A
       SICKENING THUD.

       Bond looks down, sees the Boa's body at a horrible angle, his
       neck broken.

       Bond sighs, turns...

       GABOR is there. Gun trained on him.

                           GABOR
                 Welcome aboard, Mr. Bond.

       BOND'S P.O.V.  A thug steps into sight below, holding
       CHRISTMAS hostage as well.

       EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY

       A magnificent ornate tower in the centre of the Bosphorus.

       An innocent-looking launch coasts up to it.  A tarp is raised
       and Bond and Christmas are revealed, hands bound.  They are
       helped out, led inside by a number of henchmen.

       INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY

       Elektra crosses the hallway as the doors open.  Kisses Bond
       on the cheek as she eyes Christmas.

                           ELEKTRA
                 James Bond and his amazing resurrection.
                 If only you'd kept away, we might have
                 met again in a few years, become lovers
                 once more.

       Christmas eyes Bond anew as Elektra leads him to an ornately
       carved chair, covered in silk.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to guards)
                 Take her to Renard.

       Bond and Christmas exchange a look as the guards start her
       towards some steps.

       Elektra indicates for him to sit.  Behind him, the whole of
       Istanbul is visible through a large curved window.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Pretty thing.  You had her too?

       Bond ignores her.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I could have given you the world.

                           BOND
                 Not interested.

       This cuts. She casually reaches behind his neck, flips up a
       wooden arm to which is attached a metal collar.  A GAROTTE.

                           ELEKTRA
                 They were digging near here and they
                 found some very pretty vases.  They also
                 found this...
                     (meaning the garotte)
                 I think we ignore the old ways at our
                 peril, don't you?

       Bond recoils as she fastens the collar...  She steps back.

                           BOND
                     (ignoring her)
                 Where's M?

                           ELEKTRA
                 Soon she'll be everywhere.

       Bond keeps his cool:

                           BOND
                 All this, because you fell for Renard?

                           ELEKTRA
                 Five more turns and your neck will break.

       She moves to the back of the chair, twists the screw ONE
       NOTCH.  The effect on Bond is instantaneous as a bolt jolts
       into the back of his neck, tilts his head back.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Since I was a child, I've always had a
                 power over men. When I realized my father
                 wouldn't rescue me from the kidnappers, I
                 knew I had to form a new alliance.

                           BOND
                     (realizing)
                 You turned Renard.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (smiling)
                 Just like you...only you were even
                 easier.

       She pulls the jewel from her ear, reveals the ugly scar:

                           ELEKTRA
                 I told him he had to hurt me, he had to
                 make it look real. When he refused I told
                 him I would do it myself.

       She turns the screw again.

                           BOND
                 So you killed your father.

                           ELEKTRA
                 He killed me! He killed me the day he
                 refused to pay my ransom.

       A flicker of emotion.  Bond is getting to her.

                           BOND
                 Was this all about the oil?

                           ELEKTRA
                 It is my oil!  Mine and my family's!

       Her eyes are shining.  She moves toward the view, gazing out
       at this spectacular cradle of civilization.  Bond works his
       wristbinds feverishly.

                           ELEKTRA
                 It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.
                 I'm going to redraw the map.
                 And when I am through the whole world
                 will know my name, my grandfather's name,
                 the glory of my people.

                           BOND
                 No-one will believe this melt-down was an
                 accident.

       She eyes him, impressed that he's worked out her plan.
       Tightens the screw again.  Her confidence amazing.

                           ELEKTRA
                 They will believe.  They will all
                 believe.

       Tightening the screw again:

                           ELEKTRA
                 You understand? Nobody can resist me.

       Now she straddles him.  She puts the jewel back on her ear.
       All the time, he's working that wristbind.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Know what happens when a man is
                 strangled?

                           BOND
                 Elektra, it's not too late.  Eight
                 million people needn't die.

       She smiles, twists the screw again.  A nasty, grinding sound.
       Sweat trickles from his brow.  She licks it away.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You should have killed me when you had
                 the chance.  But you couldn't. Not me.  A
                 woman you've loved.

       She pushes her hips into his.  Turns the screw.  The bolt is
       jammed right into the back of his neck.  His face is angled
       upwards.  Breathing is difficult.  He glares up:

                           BOND
                 You meant ... nothing ... to me.

       She fingers the bolt.  Prepares to turn it the last
       time...His hand strains at its binding...

                           BOND
                 One... last... screw?

                           ELEKTRA
                     (kissing his ear)
                 Oh James.

       She begins to turn the screw...

       ... when SEVERAL GUNSHOTS are heard outside.

       Bond is on the edge of consciousness.

       Elektra freezes.  Gets off him.  Moves to a window.

       EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY
       HER POV:

       Big, battered and bloody, Valentin Zukovsky is leaving a
       boat, moving over the rocks toward the entrance with three of
       his men.  Two bodies in his trail.  He's on course for
       Elektra and nothing is going to stop him, even as his
       henchmen are cut down by ferocious fire.

       INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

       Elektra moves to her gun.  Just then, Gabor crashes through a
       stained glass window, neck broken.

       TWO ELEKTRA HENCHMEN appear from below stairs as the doors
       burst open.  Zukovsky stands there.  A bloody giant.

       They open up with machine guns, but two shots from Zukovsky
       take them out, though he takes one in the shoulder.  Right
       now, he's unstoppable.

       A shocked silence after the shooting.  He eyes Bond in the
       chair.  To the room:

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 I'm looking for a submarine.  It's big
                 and black, and the driver is a friend of
                 mine.

       Then his eye falls on the HAT Renard had brought up from
       below.  He knows at once what it means.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Bring it to me.

       She picks it up, walks to him (surreptitiously sliding a gun
       beneath it).  She proffers the hat...

                           ELEKTRA
                 What a shame.  You just missed him.

       BLAM BLAM BLAM -- she fires through the hat.

       He staggers back.  Stares.  Slumps down.  Lowers his head to
       the ground.

       She walks over, puts her heel on his gun arm, presses down,
       smiling a half-psychotic smile.  The gun is pinned.

       Zukovsky is dying.

       But he dredges up every last ounce of energy to raise his gun
       a millimetre off the ground, his outstretched arm already
       pointing at Bond. Elektra looks surprised, then amused as
       Zukovsky's finger begins to squeeze the trigger:  he's going
       to shoot Bond!

       Bond stares back.  Zukovsky's eye narrows -- trying for
       extreme accuracy...

       BLAM! The SHOT hits the binding at Bond's wrist.  Splinters
       the wood there.

       ELEKTRA stares at Zukovsky.  She didn't see where the bullet
       went, just that it missed Bond.  She watches his head slump
       further, staring at Bond...

       A look passes between the two men.  Comrades in arms.  The
       merest of smiles.  Then the light fades from his eyes.  Dead.

       ELEKTRA

       turns back to Bond.  Smiles.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Excuse me.

       She picks up a walkie-talkie, speaks into it:

                           ELEKTRA
                 Everything's under control up here.  Are
                 you ready?

                           RENARD
                     (filtered)
                 Yes.  Au revoir...

       Lost for a moment, she breathes heavily.  She glances at
       Zukovsky's corpse.  Slightly puzzled, to Bond:

                           ELEKTRA
                 Zukovsky really hated you.
                     (beat)
                 Time to say goodnight.

       And she kisses him -- reaches behind to deliver the killer
       twist...

       One super-fast movement:

       Bond's hand breaks free, grabs her throat, tight.  He holds
       her, their faces close together, disdain in his eyes -- hurls
       her backwards, her hand scratching at his face.

       Ripping the collar from his neck, he gets to his feet.  Moves
       to Zukovsky, checks his pulse, takes the bloody gun from his
       fingers.

       Turns back, to see Elektra disappearing upstairs.  A moment's
       dilemma:  should he race below to the sub -- or up to
       Elektra?

       He takes off after Elektra, grabs the radio handset.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. SUBMARINE - SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - DAY

       The submarine's engines roar to life.

       INT. TOWER - CONTINUOUS

       ELEKTRA rises up one of the triple spiral stairways leading
       to the various balconies of the minaret tower.

       INT. TOWER/M'S CELL - DAY

       Bond stalks up after her.  THEIR VOICES ECHO through the
       intertwined stairs:

                           ELEKTRA
                 James.  You can't kill me.  Not in cold
                 blood.

       But Bond isn't wavering.  Clutches Zukovsky's bloody wet gun.

       He heads up in the semi-darkness -- and suddenly swings to
       his right, at an unexpected but familiar Voice:

                           M
                 Bond --

       Bond kicks open a door and enters...

       M'S PRISON ROOM

       He fires at the lock on her cell door and frees her. Turns to
       go, heading upward, after Elektra.

                           M
                 Go after the submarine, forget the girl.
                 Bond!

       INT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

       Elektra has reached a balcony.  It affords a spectacular view
       of Istanbul.  Bond appears, has her cornered.

                           BOND
                 Call him off.

       He holds the walkie-talkie to her mouth.

                           BOND
                 I won't ask again.  Call him off!

       She looks at him seriously.  He's giving her a last chance,
       willing her to save herself and the city.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (into walkie-talkie)
                 Renard.

       Bond waits...

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to Bond)
                 You wouldn't kill me.  You'd miss me.

       And her face breaks into a perverted grin and --

                           ELEKTRA
                     (into walkie-talkie)
                 Dive!  Bond --

       BLAM!  Bond shoots her.

       She staggers back, shocked at her own mortality.

                           BOND
                 I never miss.

       He looks out:

       EXT. BOSPHORUS - DAY

       Sees the nose of the sub heading into the Bosphorus, half
       submerged.  The hatch is still open.

       INT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

       He stares at her dead body a beat. And then, he crouches. He
       touches her cheek, just once, before he goes.

       Behind him, unbeknownst, M has seen it all.

       EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

       He moves to the ledge. Composes himself -- and

       DIVES ONE HUNDRED FEET to the water.  Amazing.

       EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - DAY

       He surfaces close to the exiting sub.  Grabs a ladder, pulls
       himself up.

       The hatch is closing...  He splashes through the water
       flooding over the sub, appears in front of the amazed sailor
       shutting the hatch.  WHACKS him with the hatch.  Gets inside.
       Closes it.  Milliseconds before the hatch slides under the
       water.

       INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Bond down below. Renard's crew are spread throughout the sub.
       He creeps through...

       Approaches one man working some levers, smoking.  Bond holds
       his gun to his head.

                           BOND
                 How do you want to die?
                     (re:  cigarette)
                 That?
                     (re:  gun)
                 Or this?

       INT. CABIN, SUBMARINE - MOMENTS LATER

       A few SOLID BANGS on the metal of Christmas' door.  It opens
       and Bond lets the now unconscious man hit the deck.  That was
       his head banging.

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (stunned)
                 James!...

       He takes her by the hand, they move through the shadows of
       the sub.

       INT. SUBMARINE - MOMENTS LATER

       A man is operating the tanks.  Through the intercom:

                           RENARD
                     (filtered)
                 Flood tanks 4 and 5...

       The man does as told.  When he's finished -- Bond knocks him
       out with the butt of his gun.

       INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Several men occupy the central control room, Renard at their
       centre.  Beyond, on the other side, the outer chamber of the
       reactor.

       INT. OTHER END OF CONTROL ROOM - SUBMARINE - DAY

       From the other end of the control room, Bond and Christmas,
       so near and yet so far -- they can't get to the reactor
       because there are so many men in there.

       Keeping behind cover:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Is there another way?

                           BOND
                 We go down to the torpedo bay.

       INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE LOWER DECK - MOMENTS LATER

       Bond and Christmas get attacked.  A vicious, silent fight...
       Then the radio set sparks into life --

                           RENARD
                 Open the tanks.

       Bond is throttling the man with the cable.  Speaks into the
       handset.

                           BOND
                     (disguising voice)
                 Tanks open.

       But the man has stretched his hand to a fire alarm:

       The KLAXON RESOUNDS.

       INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Renard looks up.

                           RENARD
                     (to self)
                 Bond...

       He flicks a switch;

                           RENARD
                     (into mic)
                 Bond! You have decided to join me on this
                 historic voyage.  Welcome to my nuclear
                 family.

       INTERCUT:

       BOND ON AN INTERCOM:

       His voice fills the control room.

                           BOND
                 You're really going to commit suicide for
                 her?

       Renard responds, into the microphone.

                           RENARD
                 In case you've forgotten.  I'm dead
                 already.

                           BOND
                 Haven't you heard the news?  So is she.

       Renard's face screws up in pain more searing than any he
       could feel in his skin...he SCREAMS...

       INT. SUBMARINE...

       The scream, like a wounded animal, echoes throughout the
       doomed craft.

       BACK ON RENARD, gasping, spent.

                           RENARD
                 You will die for this.

       He strides through to the

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

       Jams shut the hatch behind him.  Now moves through to the

       INT. CHAMBER BEYOND REACTOR

       Where he picks up the PLUTONIUM. Moves back into the

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

       Sealing the other door behind him.  And now he opens up the
       cover of the glaring REACTOR...

       INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Christmas sees a panel light up:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 The cover is off the reactor.

       Bond reads off more lights...

                           BOND
                 He's sealed himself in.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 He's going to insert the plutonium.

       Thinking fast, Bond moves to some controls.  Hits switches.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Do you know what you're doing?

                           BOND
                 Like riding a bike.

       INT. AIR TANKS, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       The air tanks immediately filling with water.

       INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Christmas and Bond shift to the side.  Everything not screwed
       down starts sliding...

       EXT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS - LONG SHOT

       The submarine is tilting, further and further, the nose
       dropping down and down...

       Pretty soon we have the strange and incredible sight of a
       submarine hanging vertically, nose down.

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Renard hangs on, swings, until he can get a footing on the
       nearest wall.

       INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Bond and Christmas hang on too, get a grip.  He helps her up.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What kind of bikes did you ride?

                           BOND
                 Just wanted to put him on edge...

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Renard is disturbed by the sub's position, but only
       momentarily.

       He moves to an intercom:

                           RENARD
                 Open the torpedo tubes.

       INT. TORPEDO ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Bond hears a creak, turns to see the tubes open -- water
       gushes up toward them at an incredible rate.

                           BOND
                 Climb!

       He pulls Christmas up and they ascend to the next level.  No
       chance to seal the chamber though, the water is already
       through the hatch.

                           BOND
                 Keep moving.

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

       Renard now struggles back up to the reactor, stares into the
       violet blue heat...

       He hits a button.  A ROD slowly rises out of the reactor.

       INT. LOWER SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Bond and Christmas are ahead of the water.  They have reached
       a level where various systems are operated from.

                           BOND
                 There's one chance.

       He punches buttons.

       EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - CONTINUOUS

       High up on the sub, a hatch opens.  Water floods into an
       escape hatch.  An inner door stops it getting into the
       submarine itself.

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

       Renard slowly inserts the plutonium rod.  Immediately the
       light around him becomes a deeper blue, a horrible
       luminescence.  The staccato click of a distant Geiger counter
       intensifies.

       INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       As Bond opens the inner door of an ESCAPE HATCH, he points
       out a cabinet on the wall to Christmas.

                           BOND
                 Re-breathers.

       She opens the box to find the RE-BREATHERS are ripped to
       shreds.  No-one was ever meant to get off the sub.  She shows
       Bond.

                           BOND
                 Never liked those things anyway.

       He climbs into the escape chamber.

                           BOND
                 Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty
                 open the hatch.  It can only be opened
                 for a few seconds or we'll sink.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 But what if...

                           BOND
                 Count to twenty.  I'll be there.

       She moves over and seals the door, wrenches a lever which
       immediately floods the chamber with water.

       INT. ESCAPE HATCH - CONTINUOUS

       Inside the chamber, Bond holds his breath as water seeps in.
       The most claustrophobic thing you've ever seen.

       INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       A green light comes on and Christmas punches a button...

       EXT. SUBMARINE, ESCAPE HATCH - CONTINUOUS

       The OUTER DOOR opens...  Bond burst out and starts the long
       swim up the OUTSIDE OF THE SUBMARINE...

       INT. SUBMARINE - SAME

       Christmas is counting.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 One, one thousand, two, one thousand...

       EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER

       It's dark out here.  It would be very easy for Bond to get
       disoriented.

       He peers around, trying to get his bearings against the vast
       vertical whale he's swimming up.

       Passes the conning tower.

       INT. SUBMARINE

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Fourteen, one thousand, fifteen, one
                 thousand...

       EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER

       Bond is running out of air...

       And then he sees it -- the open hatch of the rear escape
       door.

       He gets inside, yanks it closed...

       INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Christmas, shivering in the rising water.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Twenty.

       She presses a button...

       INT. CHAMBER BEYOND (NOW ABOVE) REACTOR - CONTINUOUS

       The hatch opens and Bond collapses out in a gush of water.
       The hatch closes.

       The whole world is at a crazy angle here. Bond looks down at
       the sealed door of the reactor chamber, curses.

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

       Bathed in the horrible light of the over-heating reactor,
       Renard looks upwards, aware of sounds on the other side of
       the door...

       KER-BLAM!  A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.

       The door shoots off its hinge, blasted by Bond.

       Bond drops down into the chamber, takes one look at Renard,
       now a crumpled heap in the corner.

       Bond moves down to the next door, opens it:

                           BOND
                 Christmas!

       And there she is, struggling, the water level way below still
       rising...

       He lowers an arm, pulls her up.

       They clamber up to the reactor:

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

       BOND'S POV: in the intense glow inside -- the overheating
       rod, protruding slightly.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 We have to get the rod out of the
                 reactor!

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

       Bond looks at the gauges from behind a thick GLASS SHIELD.
       Christmas comes up level with him:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Melting down.  4000 degrees, the
                 Zirconium casings on the rods crack.
                 5000, the plutonium melts.  In ten
                 minutes, a hydrogen explosion.

       THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE READS 4500 AND RISING...

       He starts toward the reactor when suddenly

       RENARD IS BEHIND BOND, THROTTLING HIM.

       CHRISTMAS grabs at him, is flung back, nearly falls through
       the hatch but manages to grab a pipe, hangs on for dear life.

       THE GAUGE HITS 4700


       BOND AND RENARD

       struggle...  Both slamming into switches and buttons.

                                                            CUT TO:

       OMITTED 314-316

       INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       THE GAUGE IS PASSING 4900, EDGING TOWARDS THE NO-WAY-BACK
       5000 MARK.  Meltdown imminent...

       He looks down the sub -- more water racing upward...

       Back to the pile.  Scans the scene, searching for an idea.
       Sees a HOSE, compressed air escaping from a fissure.  Thinks
       fast.  Grabs the hose, snaps it free...

       RENARD

       is recovering, has found a FLARE GUN near him.  Raises it to
       Bond...

       BOND'S POV

       in the reflection of the gauge (which is millimeters from
       5000), we see Renard approaching from behind us...

       BOND jams the hose into the reactor, ducks down -- as the air
       blows the rod out - narrowly missing him as it shoots past --
       impales Renard in the heart, just before he could shoot.

       Renard stares at Bond in horror.  Bond calmly takes the flare
       gun off him.

                           BOND
                 She's waiting for you.

       And he lets him fall past Christmas, through consecutive open
       hatches of the sub, crashing into the rising water.

       Christmas looks down at the floating corpse.

       Bond watches the gauge -- as it edges DOWN from 5000.

       The nuclear disaster looks like it's averted.  But suddenly
       water is gushing in from above, through splits in the sub's
       shell; it's going to sink.

                           BOND
                 We're sinking.

       But she won't come.  As water courses over them:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Help me.  We have to seal it.

       She moves to the reactor, closing the cover.  Bond uses his
       strength to push the heavy locking mechanism into place.

       Bond climbs upwards, dragging Christmas with him.

                           BOND
                 We've got to get out.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 We can't.

       INT. CHAMBER BEYOND REACTOR - CONTINUOUS

       They clamber into the next chamber up...

       EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - CONTINUOUS

       The submarine is slowly sinking, nose down.  Air is escaping
       from the many seams that are creeping apart.  We can hear the
       metallic GROANS through the water.

       INT. TORPEDO ROOM

       Bond and Christmas crawl into TORPEDO CHAMBERS...

       Bond reaches out, setting a timer to FIRE...

       The clock ticks down...

       EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER BOSPHORUS - DAY

       The Torpedo doors open and Bond and Christmas are SHOT OUT
       INTO THE WATER, streaking through, as behind them...

       THE SUBMARINE EXPLODES in spectacular fashion.

       EXT. SURFACE, BOSPHORUS - DAY

       Bond and Christmas reach the surface...  Look around them.
       No boats coming to the rescue.  They wave to a tourist boat
       passing.

       The boat heads over to pick them up...

                                                          DISSOLVE:

       OMIT 324

       EST. SHOT - MI-6 - NIGHT

       The damaged wing is being repaired.

       INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME

       Tanner overseeing things, and then...

       M walks in.  Efficient and steely as ever.  All eyes turn to
       her.  She looks at everyone...makes the briefest of nods.
       That is all the sentiment allowed as business resumes.

       She scans the machines:

                           M
                 Any word from him?

                           TANNER
                 Still no contact yet.

       EXT. ROOF, ISTANBUL - NIGHT

       A magnificent rooftop garden looking out over Istanbul.
       Christmas and Bond alone with some Bollinger.

       FIREWORKS explode above. They clink glasses.  He looks out at
       the cityscape.

                           BOND
                 I love Christmas in Turkey.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 So isn't it time you unwrapped your
                 present?

       INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

       Tanner and Q look at a SATELLITE THERMAL IMAGE OF ISTANBUL.

                           TANNER
                 That's strange.

       The satellite image zooms in one particular car parked in a
       side street.  We can just make out Bond's ASTON MARTIN.

                           TANNER
                 He must be nearby.

       M comes over.

       The image moves from the car, closes on the garden rooftop.
       The thermal image is multi-coloured, difficult to decipher.

                           M
                 Where?

                           Q
                 This picks up body heat.  Humans should
                 be orange.
                     (searching)
                 There.

       And he points to ONE orange figure lying on the rooftop.

                           M
                     (to Tanner)
                 I thought you said he was with Doctor
                 Jones?

       They all look back to the image.  The figure is turning RED,
       almost glowing.

                           M
                 It's getting redder.

       Tanner, Q and M realize as one that this is an image of two
       people, one atop the other.  And getting hotter.

                           M
                 Bond.

       Q switches the screen off, clears his throat.

                           Q
                 Could be a premature form of the
                 Millennium Bug.

       EXT. ROOF, ISTANBUL - CONTINUOUS

       It's dark, we can't really see them.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 You know James...  I think Christmas is
                 coming early this year.

                                                           FADE OUT

       THE END

     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE
     NUMBERS, AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE
     BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY.




     FADE IN:


     EXT. SNOWSCAPE

     A BLINDING WHITE SCREEN, under which we hear an ominous
     low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. We're not in 19"
     television land anymore, Toto. As the rumble builds, TWO
     BLACK FIGURES appear on what now has resolved into a
     distant horizon. From their movements we can shortly see
     that the figures are men. Moving along a windswept ice
     sheet in an otherwise featureless land.

     A LEGEND appears: NORTH TEXAS, 35,000 B.C.


     CLOSER ON THE TWO MEN

     Continuing toward us, we can now see that they are
     dressed in crude garments made of animal skins. If we
     squint we can see their hair is long, their jutting
     foreheads significant of primitive Homo Sapiens. They
     continue toward us, the wind beating against them,
     CAMERA IS CRANING DOWN to the snow that lies before
     them. To LARGE THREE-TOED TRACKS.


     FOLLOWING THE PRIMITIVES

     As they track the three-toed prints to a rocky crevice in
     the hard-pack ice. The prints stop here, and so do the
     men. Dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their
     quarry.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. ICE CAVE

     Dark in here, except where the sunlight penetrates the
     thick, glassy ice walls. The silhouettes of the
     Primitives stark against the glistening cavern. The
     sound of flint being struck, then A TORCH CATCHES FIRE,
     illuminating their faces. And:

     A CREATURE

     Deeper in the cave. Fleeing the light and the men. We
     get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light,
     seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray,
     dinosaur-like skin. And large black eyes. But it moves
     quickly enough away that any other identifying feature
     is lost in the deeper shadows.

     THE PRIMITIVES

     Removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under
     their thick fur garments, and scrabbling into the
     constricting cavern, giving chase.

     Following them as they moves with animal-like agility
     through the tightening space. Predatory hunters. Their
     torchlight catching:

     THE CREATURE

     As it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller
     crevice leading off the main one. The Primitives
     entering frame after a moment, only a few steps behind.
     The LEAD PRIMITIVE dropping to the cave floor,
     pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit.
     Splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on
     the run.


     INT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - HIGH ANGLE DOWN

     The fiery torch comes through first, held by the lead
     man. Throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what
     appears to be a box cavern.

     CLOSE ON LEAD PRIMITIVE

     Rising quickly to his feet. Not seeing what the torch
     illuminates just behind him: The face of a dead
     Primitive Man, his body frozen into the ice. He does
     finally notice this, turning to see it, when he's
     ATTACKED VICIOUSLY FROM BEHIND.

     The torch falls to the floor so that the fight is
     difficult to see, but it is loud and cruel. The creature
     squealing wildly as the grunts of the Primitive now turn
     to the sounds of painful struggle. Until:

     THE SECOND PRIMITIVE MAN

     Suddenly appears, driving his bone weapon into the body
     of the Creature. Again and again, until the Creature is
     driven away into the shadows.

     The Second Man grabs the torch now, not to see if his
     hunting mate has survived, but in pursuit of the
     Creature. In the light we see that he and his weapon are
     covered with spatters of OILY BLACK BLOOD. As is the
     First Primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor.

     The Second Primitive stepping over his hunting mate,
     stalking the Creature into the shadows, where it has
     collapsed. The torch finally landing, for the first
     time, on its face.

     When the torchlight hits its face, the Creature attacks.
     But the Primitive prevails. He drops his torch and
     dispatches the already wounded Creature with strong
     hard stabs of his weapon, one of which penetrates the
     Creature's eye.


     LOW ANGLE ON THE DEAD CREATURE

     The torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the
     dead creature's face. Its wounds are flowing with the
     oily black blood, which, oddly now, BEGINS TO POOL. As
     if it has intelligence, sentience. Pooling and traveling
     into a fissure in the cave floor. And disappearing.


     ANGLE ON THE SECOND PRIMITIVE

     Watching this, unknowing. His chest heaving from the
     fight, as the spots of Oily Black Blood which have
     spattered onto him begin to crawl. Crawling toward his
     eyes and mouth. Causing him to let out grunts of fear.

     Which are the sounds we hear as the CAMERA SLOWLY CRANES
     UP past the struggling Primitive to the roof of the
     cave, where the dancing shadows of the torch FADE AWAY
     with the sounds of struggle. Moving into darkness and
     silence. But only for a moment. Until:


     SUNSHINE BREAKS THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE CAVE - PRESENT
     DAY

     Along with the spade of a shovel. And then -- the
     earthen cave ceiling gives way and A BOY wearing Nikes
     and an old t-shirt falls through it. Falling PAST
     CAMERA. We hear a YELL, then a THUD, and a CLATTERING of
     the shovel that's fallen in with him. Then a pained
     GASPING.

     Then SEVERAL HEADS appear in the opening. These are BOYS
     of ten to eleven, staring down into the cave. Hot
     sunlight blazing in. We have traveled far, far forward
     in time.

                            2ND BOY
               Hey, Stevie. You okay?


     INT. CAVE - PRESENT DAY

     THEIR POV OF STEVIE

     On the floor below covered with dirt, in his nose and
     mouth. Spitting out. (All these boys have Texas in their
     voices.)

                            STEVIE
               I got...I got....I got....
                      (straining)
               ....the wind knocked out of me.

     This draws no sympathy from above, only LAUGHTER.

     THE BOYS UP ABOVE

     Staring excitedly.

                            3RD BOY
               Looks like a cave or something.

                            2ND BOY
               What's down there, Stevie? Anything?

     OVER THE BOYS ABOVE

     Stevie has gotten up, moving out of the patch of
     sunlight. Disappearing from view for a moment. Then
     reappearing, still spitting out dirt. But holding:

                            STEVIE
               Human skull.

     One side partially missing from the cranium. But it
     brings WHOOPS of delight from the boys above.

                            3RD BOY
               Toss it up here, dude.

                            STEVIE
               No way, buttwipe. I found it. It's
               mine.

     ANGLE UP ON STEVIE

     The other boys looking down at him. Stevie looking at
     the skull. Strangely, the light shines through it. It is
     milky, opaque, as if it's bone that's turned somehow
     glassy in places. Then:

                            STEVIE
               Anyways, there's bones all over the
               place down here.

     Stevie looks down at his feet. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIS LOOK
     DOWN to where there are indeed more human bones. And
     something else. He takes a couple of steps in place,
     standing in a familiar BLACK, OILY substance -- which is
     climbing up his tennis shoe from the rock floor, over
     the edge of the shoe and down into the shoe itself. Then
     the SKULL drops in the frame, clattering on the hard
     floor of the cave.

     CAMERA SLOWLY RISING UP FROM STEVIE'S SHOES

     Following SUBCUTANEOUS WORMS which have begun locomoting
     aggressively up his legs. As his whole body is WRACKED
     by a shivering seizure of some kind.

     CAMERA RISES, following the path of the worms as they
     move up the legs of his shorts. Some appearing on his
     bare arms, but the great majority continuing up to
     Stevie's neck, toward his face. Stevie stands paralyzed.
     Letting out guttural sounds not dissimilar to when the
     wind was knocked out of him.

                            3RD BOY (O.S.)
               Hey, Stevie....

     But Stevie cannot answer him. CAMERA CONTINUING UP to
     the boys above. Looking down at their friend. Their eyes
     go wide.

                            2ND BOY
               You okay?

     But what they see next answers that question for them.

     THEIR POV OF STEVIE

     His face suddenly alive with the subcutaneous worms.
     Moving toward his eyes which begin filling with BLACK
     OIL. Looking much now like ALIEN EYES.

     CLOSE ON THE BOYS ABOVE

     Freaked by what they see. And doing what any kid would
     do now.

                            3RD BOY
               Hey, man. Let's get outta here.

     And they do. Bolting from the hole in the top of the
     cave. CAMERA PUSHING UP THROUGH THIS HOLE to REVEAL we
     are:


     EXT. SMALL DIRT FIELD - NORTHERN TEXAS - DAY

     In a dirt hole that was being dug by the three kids.
     RISING UP out of the hole to REVEAL the parched dirt
     patch where THREE KIDS are running away from us, as fast
     as their feet will take them. Toward A NEW HOUSING TRACT
     (five floorplans to choose from, including the model
     home.) Disappearing into the neighborhood. A LEGEND
     appears: NORTH TEXAS, 1998.

     CAMERA CONTINUES RISING ABOVE THE ROOFTOPS to see the
     surrounding expanse of empty Texas flatland. And in the
     distance, the DALLAS SKYLINE.

     As CAMERA SETTLES, there are a few moments of nothing
     but the sound of the wind gently whistling across the
     landscape. In which we bury a short TIME CUT.


     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NORTHERN TEXAS - DAY

     Then we HEAR it, before we see it: FIRE ENGINES pulling
     into the neighborhood, sirens WAILING. CAMERA DROPPING
     AGAIN as the lead engine pulls up. FIREMEN are hopping
     off, moving to the hole the boys dug.

     LOW ANGLE UP FROM BELOW GROUND LEVEL, IN THE DUGOUT
     HOLE

     TWO firemen carrying a ladder clamber down PAST CAMERA,
     THREE OTHERS appearing on their heels. The other two
     firemen clamber down, too. THE CAPTAIN at the edge of
     the hole watching them. Holding a radio.

                            FIRE CAPTAIN
               This is Captain Miles Cooles...we've
               got a rescue situation in progress...


     INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS

     As the LEAD FIREMAN steps down the ladder into the cave.
     He scans the darkness, illuminated only by the shaft of
     light permitted by the hole above. As the 2ND FIREMAN
     drops down next to him. The both stand motionless now,
     as if sensing something.

     THEIR POV

     Stevie's feet are just visible on the floor of the cave,
     a short distance away.

     RESUME FIREMEN - LOW ANGLE

     They start cautiously toward Stevie. CAMERA FINDING
     their feet. Tracking through the same OILY, BLACK
     SUBSTANCE we saw bleeding from the creature thirty five
     thousand years ago. As they move into the shadows, we
     HOLD ON THE SUBSTANCE....and see it MOVE. It's alive.

                                             TIME CUT TO:


     EXT. DIRT FIELD - SHORT TIME LATER

     CAMERA RISES out of the dirt hole, finds A GROUP OF
     NEIGHBORS:

     Concerned PARENTS, KIDS, including Stevie's friends.
     They're held at a distance by the remaining firemen.
     Everyone turning their concerned gazes skyward. Looking
     at:

     A MED-EVAC CHOPPER

     Coming off the sun-setting horizon. Moving toward us at
     high speed. The WHOP, WHOP of its blade soon shaking the
     neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just
     over the dirt field. Landing gently on the parched hard
     scrabble.

     The side door flies open and FIVE HAZ-MAT RESCUE
     PARAMEDICS jump out carrying a bubble litter. CAMERA
     PANS THEM to the dirt hole past THE FIRE CAPTAIN. The
     Haz-Mat Paramedics moving down into the hole. The Fire
     Captain watches this, then stares toward --

     DR. BEN BRONSCHWEIG (in shirtsleeves, tie), exiting the
     chopper, following up the rear. The Captain meeting him
     in route.

                            BRONSCHWEIG
                      (over the chopper)
               Keep those people back. Get them out
               of here.

                            FIRE CAPTAIN
                      (to his men)
               Move them all back.
                      (dogging Bronschweig)
               I sent four men down after the boy.
               They're not responding.

     Dr. Bronschweig's focus is elsewhere, though. He's
     making a bee line to the earthen hole where young Stevie
     is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed
     QUARANTINE BUBBLE LITTER by the rescue squad.
     Bronschweig watches with great concern. Getting a good
     look now at Stevie's paralyzed body as it passes him.

     ANGLE ON CHOPPER

     As Stevie's body is loaded aboard, the side door is slid
     shut. The engine throttles up and the chopper takes
     flight again, almost as quickly as it arrived. The prop
     wash blowing:

     DR. BRONSCHWEIG

     And the gathering crowd. Bronschweig watches the chopper
     bank away, then turns his look to:

     THE NEIGHBORHOOD

     Where A SERIES OF UNMARKED CARGO VANS, TRUCKS are
     rolling in. A fleet of vehicles, driven by what looks
     like MILITARY PERSONNEL. Most conspicuously TWO WHITE
     UNMARKED TANKER TRUCKS. (There are NO MARKINGS on these
     vehicles.)

     RESUME BRONSCHWEIG

     As the Fire Captain moves around to face him off.

                            FIRE CAPTAIN
               What about my men?

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
                      (brusquely)
               We're doing all we can.

     And he moves off toward the approaching trucks where the
     MILITARY PERSONNEL are pulling out tents, tent poles,
     scientific equipment. Leaving the Captain to wonder what
     the hell's going on. Watching the first of many
     REFRIGERATION UNITS being unloaded. The personnel
     carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him.
     Moving RIGHT TO CAMERA and plunging us into BLACK.

     HOLD. Then OVER BLACK, a familiar sound again. The
     sound of a chopper auguring in. As we FADE UP, revealing
     we are:


     EXT. TOP OF A SKYSCRAPER - DAY

     The chopper is banking over the side of the building,
     preparing to touch down on the rooftop where FIFTEEN FBI
     AGENTS in dark ID windbreakers are standing. A LEGEND
     appears: FEDERAL BUILDING, DALLAS, TEXAS. ONE WEEK
     LATER.

     The chopper touches down and, again, the side door is
     thrown open. But now only one man exits: SPECIAL AGENT
     IN CHARGE (S.A.C.) DARIUS MICHAUD.

     Michaud moves with the measured pace of authority,
     approaching the waiting FBI Agents. One of whom steps
     up.

                            FBI AGENT
               We've evacuated the building and been
               through it bottom to top. No trace of
               an explosive device or anything
               resembling one.

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               Have you taken the dogs through?

                            FBI AGENT
               Yes, sir.

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               Well, take them through again.

     This is given as a non-negotiable order, to the somewhat
     weary FBI man. Who turns back to his charges, Michaud
     does not register this attitude, though. Something else
     has caught his attention. Causing him to walk to the
     edge of the building. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM, seeing what
     he sees now.

     On an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be AN FBI
     AGENT in an ID windbreaker exiting onto the roof. CAMERA
     CONTINUING AROUND into A CLOSE UP PROFILE of S.A.C
     Michaud. Staring at this, his jaw set. He doesn't like
     what he sees. And what he sees is:


     EXT. ROOFTOP OPPOSING SKYSCRAPER - DAY - CONTINUOUS

     Special Agent Dana Scully is coming out the door leading
     onto the roof. The door slams shut behind her. She, too,
     is dressed in an FBI windbreaker. She's dialing her
     cell phone as she moves around the rooftop looking for
     something. Dialing the number of:

                            SCULLY
               Mulder -- it's me --

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               Where are you, Scully?

                            SCULLY
               I'm on the roof.

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               Did you find something?

                            SCULLY
                      (impatiently)
               No. I haven't.

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               What's wrong, Scully?

                            SCULLY
               I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm
               hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to
               be honest, what I'm doing here.

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               You're looking for a bomb.

                            SCULLY
               I know that. But the threat was called
               in for the Federal Building across the
               street.

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               I think they have that covered.

     WE ARE TRACKING WITH SCULLY.

                            SCULLY
                      (impatience)
               Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat
               is called in, the logical purpose of
               providing this information is to allow
               us to find the bomb. The rational
               object of terrorism is to promote
               terror. If you'd study model
               behavioral pattern in virtually every
               case where a threat has turned up an
               explosive device. If we don't act in
               accordance with that data -- if you
               ignore it as we have done -- the
               chances are great that if here
               actually is a bomb we might not find
               it. Lives could be lost --

     Scully, engrossed in her own argument, realizes she's
     been the only one speaking for the last short while. She
     stops walking.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder...?

                            MULDER
               What happened to playing a hunch?

     Scully almost JUMPS out of her own skin. The voice has
     come not over the phone, but from two feet away where:

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE AGENT MULDER

     Standing in the shadow of a large air conditioning unit.
     Cracking a trademark sunflower seed between his teeth.
     Clicking his cell phone off. Moving out.

                            SCULLY
               Jesus, Mulder...

                            MULDER
               The element of surprise, Scully.
               Random acts of unpredictability. If we
               fail to anticipate the unforeseen or
               expect the unexpected in a universe of
               infinite possibilities, we find
               ourselves at the mercy of anyone or
               anything that cannot be programmed,
               categorized or easily referenced...

     Mulder has moved to the edge of the building where he
     sails his sunflower seeds into the air. Dusting his
     hands off as if lost in a wistful through for just a
     moment.

                            MULDER
               What are we doing up here? It's hotter
               than hell.

     And he's on the move. Scully moving to catch up.

     NEW ANGLE

     Mulder is moving toward the stairs, Scully catching him.
     Mulder allowing her to lead him up the steps.

                            SCULLY
               I know you're bored in this
               assignment, but unconventional
               thinking is only going to get you into
               trouble now.

                            MULDER
               How's that?

                            SCULLY
               You've got to quit looking for what
               isn't there. They've closed the
               X-Files. There's procedure to be
               followed here. Protocol.

                            MULDER
               What do you say we call in a bomb
               threat for Houston. I think it's free
               beer night at the Astrodome.

     Scully gives him a look. It's no use. She reaches the
     door first, grabs the knob but... it won't open. Turning
     to Mulder.

                            SCULLY
               Now what?

                            MULDER
                      (suddenly nervous)
               It's locked?

     She wiggles the knob again.

                            SCULLY
               So much for anticipating the
               unforeseen...

     Scully squints into the sun, staring at Mulder. But he's
     quick on the draw, and realizes what she's up to. He
     grabs for the door and... it opens. Looking to Scully
     whose hard look of mock-scolding has become a smirking
     smile.

                            SCULLY
               Had you.

                            MULDER
               No you didn't.

                            SCULLY
               Oh yeah. Had you big time.

     And that's how it continues as they re-enter the
     stairwell, the door slamming shut behind them.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

     As an elevator DINGS and the doors open. Scully and
     Mulder exit into the lobby where people move in and out.
     Heads turn due to their FBI jackets. (Included
     atmosphere: a GROUP OF KIDS on a field trip, being led
     into an elevator by THEIR TEACHER.)

                            SCULLY
               I saw your face, Mulder. There was a
               moment of panic.

                            MULDER
               Panic? Have you ever seen me panic,
               Scully?

                            SCULLY
               I just did. You're buying.

     Mulder fishes for change, but more out of
     sportsmanship.

                            MULDER
               Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi?
               A saline IV?

                            SCULLY
               Something sweet.

     Scully flashes a thin victory smile, as Mulder heads
     off.


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder moving to a door with a small shingle above it
     which says SNACKS/BEVERAGES. As he approaches, sorting
     through the change he's fished up, the door opens and A
     MAN IN A VENDOR'S UNIFORM appears. He makes casual and
     ever-so-brief eye contact with Mulder as he brushes past
     him. Mulder making no note of this as he moves to catch
     the door before it closes.

     INT. SNACK AREA AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY

     Mulder takes a few steps down into the windowless room.
     Moving past the snack machines to a LIGHTED soda
     machine.

     Finding the correct change and plunking it in. Hitting a
     button, but... nothing comes out.

                            MULDER
               Oh, come on.

     He beats his fist a couple of times on the front of the
     machine.

     Nothing. He finds more change. Plunking it in. Hits the
     button. Nothing. He stares at the machine a minute, then
     BEATS IT HARD with his fist. Nothing.

     Moving around to the back of the machine, looking for:


     ANGLE ACROSS BACK OF MACHINE

     Mulder's face peering in on the slim space between the
     machine and the wall. Reaching down and lifting the PLUG
     on the end of the electrical cord. It isn't plugged in.
     Realizing now why the machine hasn't spit out his
     sodas.

     RESUME FRONT ANGLE ON MACHINE

     As Mulder appears, stepping very lightly in front of the
     machine that he was just pounding away on. Looking at
     it, then moving quickly to the door he entered through.
     Grasping the knob, but finding it... LOCKED. He jiggles
     the knob, pulls on it. But there's no two ways about it,
     he's locked in.

     INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

     Scully stands looking at her watch. Wondering where
     Mulder is. When her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She
     answers it.

               Scully...

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               Scully, I found the bomb.

                      (thinks he's joking)
               Where are you, Mulder?

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               I'm in the vending room.

     Scully is on the move, but she doesn't believe him for a
     second.


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Scully appears, heard A POUNDING. Following this noise
     to the door Mulder is obviously on the other side of.
     Tries the door.

                            SCULLY
               Is that you pounding?


     INT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY

     Mulder holds his phone to his ear, using his other hand
     to pound.

                            MULDER
               Scully, get somebody to open this
               door.

                            SCULLY (FILTER)
               Nice try, Mulder.

     CAMERA FOLLOWING MULDER as he steps back, revealing now
     that he's gotten the hinged front of the coke machine
     open. But we can't yet see what's inside.

                            MULDER
               Scully -- listen to me. It's in the
               coke machine. You've got about
               fourteen minutes to get this building
               evacuated.


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Scully is shaking her head. Tries the door again.

                            SCULLY
               C'mon. Open the door.

     His response to this is MORE HARD POUNDING.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty
               eight, thirteen fifty seven...

     As he is doing this, Scully is bending to see:

     THE KEYHOLE

     It's been freshly soldered over.


     INT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY

     Mulder stands pacing in front of:

     AN ELABORATELY ENGINEERED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE

     Wired with circuit boards, electric belts and generally
     looking like it would take an expert a good long time to
     figure out where to even start. A lot longer than the
     13:58 that reads on the digital read-out.

                            MULDER
               ...thirteen fifty six...

               Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of
               there.

     The line goes dead. And off Mulder's deepening anxiety,

     Barking at the security guards who sit behind their

               I need this building evacuated and
               cleared out in ten minutes! I need you
               to get on the phone and tell the fire
               department to block off the city
               center in one mile radius around the

     And she's moving, dialing her cell phone now.

                      (into phone)
               This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I
               need to speak to S.A.C. Michaud. He's
               got the wrong building --

     EXT. BUILDING - DAY

     UNMARKED FBI VANS, CARS are pulling up out front.
     Agents in windbreakers are exiting, moving at a run to
     the building. Among them S.A.C. Darius Michaud. Moving
     to:


     ANGLE ON SCULLY

     Exiting the building. Behind her, WORKERS are beginning
     to stream out of the building, as well as the young
     FIELD TRIPPERS. Michaud meeting up with Scully
     mid-plaza. As the windbreaker Agents move past them,
     entering the building.

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               Where is it?

     MOVING WITH THEM now, back toward the building. As FIRE
     TRUCKS are pulling up out in the street out front.
     Suddenly this has the distinct feel of a situation
     veering out of control.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder found it in a vending machine.
               He's locked in with it.

     MULDER staring at it. If he wasn't sweating enough on

     phone RINGS. Answering it.

               Mulder. Move away from the door. We're
               coming through it.

     No sooner is this said than the CAMERA WHIPS OFF MULDER
     to the door, where A GAS PLASMA TORCH FLAME is sizzling
     along the hinges.

               Go.

     The other Agents kick the metal door in sending it
     crashing to the floor. Mulder stands on the other side.

     Scully right behind him. Along with the Agents, Bomb
     techs.

     As Michaud steps in next to him, sizing up the time on
     the ticking digital readout: 4:07. And just exactly what
     kind of defusing work he's got cut out for him.

                            MULDER
               Tell me this is just soda pop in those

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               No. It's what it looks like. A big
               I.E.D. - ten gallons of astrolite.
                      (studying the bomb)
               Okay, get everybody out of here and

               Can you defuse it?

     Setting his tool kit down, opening it. As the other
     Agents heed his word, exiting the room.

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               I think so.

               You've got about four minutes to find
               out if you're wrong.

     Michaud turns on him with unexpected intensity.

               Let's go, Mulder.

     Scully starts out. Mulder stares at Michaud for a
     moment, but Michaud's focus is on the bomb now. He won't
     meet Mulder's look. Finally Mulder moves off, following
     Scully.

     CAMERA HOLDS ON MICHAUD, just staring at the bomb. Just
     staring.

     The last of the building occupants are being hauled off

     positioned themselves out front. And the police squad
     cars. As Mulder and Scully exit the front door. Moving
     quickly, until Mulder hits mid-plaza and slows. Scully
     not realizing this for a few steps, then turning.

     One last windbreakered Agent is exiting. Moving past
     them to the last cop car other than the car waiting for
     Mulder and Scully.

                            LAST AGENT OUT
               All clear.

     Mulder has stopped and is looking back to the building
     now as Scully hustles back the few steps separating
     them.

               Something's wrong.

               What's he doing?

     INT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY

     CLOSE ON BOMB. The seconds ticking off now, as it passes
     the :30 mark. CAMERA PULLING BACK, ADJUSTING to Michaud.
     His tool chest is closed up, and he is sitting on it
     improbably. Still staring at the bomb, then pulling his
     head down in what appears to be resignation. As the
     seconds tick away.

     EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE BOMB BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder has relented now, against his better instincts.
     Moving with Scully to the car, faster as they go. The
     Windbreaker Agent standing in the open door of the
     driver's side. Getting in behind the wheel...

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     INT. VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Sitting motionless in front of the bomb as the seconds

     EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE BOMB BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder and Scully getting in the car. TRACKING BACKWARDS
     with them now as the Agent driving pulls away, getting
     only thirty, maybe forty yards when: the BOMB DETONATES
     and the building EXPLODES. And this is no fatwa symbolic
     little terror strike. This is Oklahoma City. Or do we
     say, Independence Day.


     REVERSE ANGLE ON CAR

     As all the windows blow out and the car is lifted up,
     slamming into the corner of a parked car. The air so
     quickly full of debris that it would seem the whole city
     has been destroyed.

     RESUME BUILDING

     As the debris starts to clear somewhat, much of it still
     floating to the ground, though. We see the fires raging
     on every floor. That most of the front of the building
     has been torn away and we can see right into many
     floors.


     RESUME ANGLE ON CAR

     Where it sits half cocked against a parked car. The air
     is full of debris, particulated matter. The rear door of
     the squad car opens now and Mulder gets out, covered with
     glass. Moving to the front passenger door, opening it
     for Scully.

                            MULDER
                      (with darkest irony)
               Next time you're buying.


     EXT. AERIAL SHOT OF WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

     HIGH ABOVE the U.S. capital, the entire beltway. With a
     LEGEND, to establish.

     LOWER AND TIGHTER NOW

     On the J. Edgar Hoover Building, FBI Headquarters.
     Descending low on the three-sided monolith and its large
     interior courtyard. As another LEGEND appears, under:

                            WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
               In light of Waco, and Ruby Ridge...

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. FBI OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW - DAY

     A formal hearing. Several ASSISTANT DIRECTORS sit at a
     head table, going over documents. NAME PLACECARDS in
     front of them.

     PANNING the group, the sound of papers shuffling, the
     occasional clearing of a throat creating a stale air of
     importance, under:

                            WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
               ...there is a heightened need at the
               Attorney General's office to place
               responsibility as early as possible.

     CAMERA LANDING ON ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JANA CASSIDY

     A no-nonsense 40 year-old lawyer cum FBI Agent.

                            CASSIDY
               ...for the catastrophic destruction of
               public property and the loss of life
               due to terrorist activities...

     Next to Cassidy is Assistant Director WALTER SKINNER,
     Mulder and Scully's former superior on the X-Files.
     Looking ruefully at:

     AGENT SCULLY

     At a small table, the chair next to her conspicuously
     empty.

                            CASSIDY
               Many details are still unclear; some
               agents' reports have not been filed,
               or have come in sketchy, without a
               satisfactory accounting of the events
               that led to the destruction in Dallas.
               But we're under some pressure to give
               an accurate picture of what happened
               to the Attorney General, so she can
               issue a public statement.

     The door to the room opens behind Scully now, and Mulder
     enters, his manner that of a man who knows he's late to
     a function.

     RESUME A.D. CASSIDY

     She looks up at Mulder and Scully with a stern glare.

                            CASSIDY
               We now know that five people died in
               the explosion. Special Agent in Charge
               Darius Michaud who was trying to
               defuse the bomb that had been hidden
               in a vending machine. Three firemen
               from Dallas, and a young boy.

     OVER MULDER AND SCULLY

     Mulder pulls out his chair to sit down, but remains
     standing. They trade a look. This is new news to them.

                            MULDER
               Excuse me -- the firemen and the boy
               -- they were in the building?

                            CASSIDY
               Agent Mulder, since you weren't able
               to be on time for this hearing, I'm
               going to ask you to step outside so
               that we can get Agent Scully's version
               of the facts. So that she won't have
               to be paid the same disrespect.

                            MULDER
               We were told the building was clear.

                            CASSIDY
               You'll get your turn, Agent Mulder.
               Please step out.

     Mulder trades looks with:

     A.D. SKINNER

     Who stares at him evenly, but not unsympathetically.
     He's been here with Mulder on many occasions. Seen
     Mulder run up against the Bureau and its stiff
     conventions. Always in the middle.

                            MULDER
               It does say there in your paperwork
               that we were the ones who found the
               bomb...

                            CASSIDY
               Thank you, Agent Mulder. We'll call
               you in shortly.

     RESUME MULDER, SCULLY

     As Mulder slides his chair in. Scully watching him
     exit.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OPR HEARING ROOM - DAY

     Mulder sits by himself in a chair, head down. When the
     door to the hearing room opens. Mulder rising as A.D.
     Skinner exits.

                            SKINNER
               Sit down, they're still talking to
               Agent Scully.

                            MULDER
               About what?

                            SKINNER
               -- They're asking her for a narrative.
               They want to know why she was in the
               wrong building.

                            MULDER
               She was with me.

     Skinner studies Mulder, shaking his head.

                            SKINNER
               You don't see what's going on here, do
               you?
                      (off Mulder's look)
               There's four hundred million dollars
               in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives
               have been lost. No suspects have been
               named. So the story being shaped is
               this could have been prevented. That
               the FBI didn't do its job.

                            MULDER
               And they want to blame us?

                            SKINNER
               Agent Mulder -- we both know that if
               you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the
               initiative to search the adjacent
               building, you could have multiplied
               the fatalities by a hundred --

                            MULDER
                      (grasping the irony)
               But it's not the lives we saved. It's
               the lives we didn't.

                            SKINNER
                      (reciting the dictum)
               -- if it looks bad, it's bad for the
               FBI --

                            MULDER
               -- if they want someone to blame,
               they can blame me. Agent Scully
               doesn't deserve this.

                            SKINNER
               She's in there right now saying the
               same thing about you.

                            MULDER
               I breached protocol. I broke contact
               with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary
               tactical rule and left him alone with
               the device.

                            SKINNER
               Agent Scully says it was she who
               ordered you out of the building. That
               you wanted to go back.

     Mulder doesn't get to respond, because the door opens
     again and Agent Scully exits. She looks like she's been
     through it.

                            SCULLY
                      (to Skinner)
               They're asking for you, Sir.

     Skinner gives one last look to Mulder, then re-enters.
     Leaving Mulder and Scully alone. Scully wearing a pained
     look.

                            MULDER
               Whatever you told them in there, you
               don't have to protect me.

                            SCULLY
               All I told them was the truth.

                            MULDER
               They're trying to divide us on this,
               Scully. We can't let them.

                            SCULLY
               They have divided us, Mulder. They're
               splitting us up.

                            MULDER
                      (beat)
               What? What are you talking about?

                            SCULLY
               I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow
               for remediation and reassignment...

                            MULDER
               Why?

                            SCULLY
               I think you must have an idea. They
               cited a history of problems relating
               back to 1993.

                            MULDER
               They were the ones that put us
               together.

                            SCULLY
               Because they wanted me to invalidate
               your work, your investigations into
               the paranormal. But I think this goes
               deeper than that.

                            MULDER
               This isn't about you, Scully. They're
               doing this to me.

                            SCULLY
               They're not doing this, Mulder.
                      (off his look)
               I left behind a career in medicine
               because I thought I might make a
               difference at the FBI. When they
               recruited me they told me women made
               up nine percent of the bureau. I felt
               this was not an impediment, but an
               opportunity to distinguish myself. But
               it hasn't turned out that way. And
               now, if I were to be transferred to
               Omaha, or Wichita or some field office
               where I'm sure I could rise, it just
               doesn't hold the interest for me it
               once did. Not after what I've seen and
               done.

                            MULDER
               You're... quitting?

                            SCULLY
               There's really no reason left for me
               to stay anymore.
                      (off his look)
               Maybe you should ask yourself if your
               heart's still in it, too.

     The door opens to the hearing room again now. A.D.
     Skinner steps part way out, gesturing to him.

                            SKINNER
               Agent Mulder. You're up.

                            SCULLY
                      (regretfully)
               I'm sorry. Good luck.

     Mulder rises. Scully studying his poorly disguised hurt.
     Before he turns and goes into the room.

     Scully watching the door close behind him. Her feelings
     poorly disguised, too.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON A SHOOTER OF TEQUILA being poured. CAMERA
     ADJUSTING to reveal the ATTRACTIVE BARMAID tipping the
     bottle. Pushing it across the bar to where TWO EMPTY
     SHOOTERS sit, making the exchange.

                            BARMAID
               I'd say this about exceeds your
               minimum daily requirement.

     The person she's talking to us:

     MULDER

     He sits by himself on a stool, staring down at the bar.
     Staring at the shooter which he spins with his fingers.

                            BARMAID
               Gotta train for this kind of heavy
               lifting.

     Mulder tosses back the shooter anyway. She watches him
     as she retrieves the small shot glass, intrigued by his
     dark silence.

                            BARMAID
               Poopy day?

                            MULDER
               Yup.

                            BARMAID
               A woman?
                      (Mulder shakes his head no)
               Work.

     Mulder nods, pointing to the tequila bottle again. The
     Barmaid agrees to pour another one, reluctantly.

     ANGLE OVER TO A MAN AT THE END OF THE BAR

     Staring at Mulder intently. He's older than Mulder,
     dressed in an old Brooke Brothers light summer suit.
     Mulder notices him, feels his gaze, but doesn't give it
     thought.

     RESUME BARMAID, MULDER

                            BARMAID
               What do you do?

                            MULDER
               What do I do.
                      (off her curious look)
               I'm a key figure in an ongoing
               government charade. An annoyance to my
               superiors. A joke among my peers.
               "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder.
               Whose sister was abducted by aliens
               when he was a kid. Who now chases
               little green men with a badge and a
               gun, shouting to the heavens and
               anyone who'll listen that the fix is
               in. That our government's hip to the
               truth and a part of the conspiracy.
               That the sky is falling and when it
               hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of
               all time.

     She stares at him for a moment, startled by his drunken
     screed. She pulls back the shooter she's just poured
     Mulder.

                            BARMAID
               I think that about does it, Spooky.

                            MULDER
               Does what?

                            BARMAID
               Why don't you go home to the old lady
               --

                            MULDER
               Sorry. Don't have one.

     Mulder slides off his stool, noticing:

     MULDER'S POV

     The Watchful Man is gone.

     RESUME MULDER

     He feints toward the door, then reverses direction.
     Heads to the back of the place.


     INT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder appears, moving to the bathroom door. Only to
     find an OUT OF ORDER sign on it. He moves to the woman's
     room, but it's locked. Gathering what's left of his
     wits, Mulder does what any red-blooded man would do in
     this situation. He goes to the back door of the bar and
     exits into the alley.


     EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - NIGHT

     Mulder has found a place against a wall, between two
     dumpsters. Jerking around in surprise at the sound of a
     VOICE.

                            WATCHFUL MAN'S VOICE
               That official FBI business?

                            MULDER
                      (startled)
               What?


     ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE MAN FROM THE BAR

     He's not far from Mulder. His name is KURTZWEIL.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Bet the Bureau's accusing you of the
               same thing in Dallas.

     Mulder's weirded out as the stranger moves to him un-
     threateningly.

                            MULDER
               How's that?

                            KURTZWEIL
               Standing around holding your yank
               while bombs are exploding.

     Kurtzweil enjoys a little laugh over this.

                            MULDER
               Do I know you?

                            KURTZWEIL
               No. I've been watching your career for
               a good while. Back when you were just
               a promising young agent -- before
               that.

     Mulder stares at this man as he finishes, zipping up.

                            MULDER
               You follow me out here for a reason?

                            KURTZWEIL
               Yeah, I did.

     Kurtzweil unzips his own pants now. There is a moment;
     one of those awkward moments where Mulder's not sure
     what's about to happen. But Kurtzweil's just relieving
     himself, too. Shuffling up to the wall, Mulder takes
     this as an opportunity to head back toward the bar. But
     Kurtzweil hails him again.

                            KURTZWEIL
               My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin
               Kurtzweil.

                            MULDER
               I know the name. Why?

                            KURTZWEIL
               Old friend of your father's.

     Kurtzweil continues peeing. Knows this got Mulder's
     attention.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Back at the Department of State. We
               were what you might call fellow
               travelers, but his disenchantment
               outlasted mine.
                      (beat)
               I never believed in the Project.

     Mulder stares at Kurtzweil now. He's being toyed with.
     He turns, opens the door into the bar. As Kurtzweil gets
     a little louder.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Oh, come on. Don't pretend you don't
               know about the Project. Your father
               died for it. Your sister was taken
               because of it.

     Kurtzweil finishes nature's call. Zips up. Heads after
     Mulder.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT

     Mulder is coming from the back. Kurtzweil moving to
     catch up. And he does, at the coat stand. The place has
     pretty much cleared out, except for the Barmaid and some
     help.

                            MULDER
               How'd you find me?

                            KURTZWEIL
               Heard you come here now and again.
               Figured you'd be needing a little
               drinky tonight.

                            MULDER
               You a reporter?

                            KURTZWEIL
               I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned
               that. OB-GYN.

                            MULDER
               Who sent you?

                            KURTZWEIL
               I came on my own. After reading about
               the bombing in Dallas.

                            MULDER
               Well, if you've got something to tell
               me, you've got as long as it takes me
               to hail a cab...

     Mulder starts out the door, but Kurtzweil grabs his
     arm.

                            KURTZWEIL
               They're going to pin Dallas on you,
               Agent Mulder. But there was nothing
               you could've done. Nothing anyone
               could've done to prevent that bomb
               from going off. Because the truth is
               something you'd never have guessed;
               never have predicted.

     Mulder pulls away from Kurtzweil, but Kurtzweil dogs him
     to:


     EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT

     The street is empty, the hour is late. Mulder moves to
     the curb.

                            MULDER
               And what's that?

                            KURTZWEIL
               S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or
               intended to defuse the bomb.

                            MULDER
                      (rhetorical disbelief)
               He just let it explode.

                            KURTZWEIL
               What's the question nobody's asking?
               Why that building? Why not the Federal
               Building?

                            MULDER
               The Federal Building was too well
               guarded.

                            KURTZWEIL
               No. They put the bomb in the building
               across the street because it DID have
               federal offices. The Federal Emergency
               Management Agency had a provisional
               medical quarantine office there. Which
               is where the bodies were found. But
               that's the thing...

     Mulder's got his hand up for a taxi coming. It's pulling
     over as Mulder steps from the curb, stepping away from
     Kurtzweil.

                            KURTZWEIL
               ...the thing you didn't know. That
               you'd never think to check.

     Mulder's got the taxi door open, turning to Kurtzweil.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Those people were already dead.

                            MULDER
               Before the bomb went off?

                            KURTZWEIL
               That's what I'm saying.

     Mulder stares at Kurtzweil for a moment.

                            MULDER
               Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran
               of the bureau --

                            KURTZWEIL
               Michaud was a patriot. The men he's
               loyal to know their way around Dallas.
               They blew that building to hide
               something. Maybe something even they
               couldn't predict.

                            MULDER
               You're saying they destroyed an entire
               building to hide the bodies of three
               firemen...?

                            KURTZWEIL
               And one little boy.

     Mulder gets in the cab, closes the door. Rolls down the
     window.

                            MULDER
               I think you're full of shit.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Do you?

     Kurtzweil raps the top of the roof and steps away from
     the car. As the taxi takes off. WE STAY WITH KURTZWEIL,
     watching Mulder's cab speed away. (NOTE: This should
     also be covered from inside the cab with Mulder, to play
     the scene out on him.)

     INT. AGENT SCULLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Scully is in bed, lying awake. Staring at the ceiling.
     When she reacts to a POUNDING AT HER DOOR.

     INT. SCULLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON THE FRONT DOOR. Scully peeks in the peephole.
     Then she removes the safety chain, opening the door.

                            MULDER
                      (strangely intense)
               I wake you?

                            SCULLY
               No.

                            MULDER
               Why not? It's three AM.

     Scully gets a whiff of his breath. As he moves past her
     into the apartment. Radiating a kind of manic
     intensity.

                            SCULLY
               Are you drunk, Mulder?

                            MULDER
               I was until about an hour ago.

                            SCULLY
               Is that before or after you got the
               idea to come here?

     Mulder looks at her curiously.

                            MULDER
               What are you implying, Scully?

                            SCULLY
                      (frowning)
               I thought you may have gotten drunk
               and decided to come here to talk me
               out of quitting.

                            MULDER
               Is that what you'd like me to do?

     Scully hesitates. Long enough to indicate her own
     wavering heart.

                            SCULLY
               Go home, Mulder. It's late.

                            MULDER
               Get dressed, Scully.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder -- what are you doing?

                            MULDER
               Just get dressed. I'll explain on the
               way.

     EXT. TEXAS FLATLAND - NIGHT

     The moon is rising over the horizon, across the
     curvilinear distance of endless scrub and sagebrush.
     When FLYING OBJECTS cross between it and us, their forms
     unidentifiable in the rising heat waves off the earth.
     But they are moving towards us, SILHOUETTES in the
     background of the moon.

     They move silently, their size INCREASING as they move
     closer. And then we hear them, moments before they
     arrive at our position, UNMARKED HELICOPTERS just
     overhead. Hugging the ground as they blast across the
     dark Texas night.


     INT. UNMARKED BLACK HELICOPTERS - NIGHT

     Flying at dangerously low altitude over the almost
     featureless night landscape. Heading for something that
     we see ahead in the distance. What looks like a LARGE
     GLOWING DOME surrounded by the lights of a residential
     area we've already seen, on the edge of suburban Dallas
     sprawl.

     EXT. SMALL DIRT FIELD - CENTRAL TEXAS - NIGHT

     The field where the kids had been digging has been
     transformed into some kind of worksite.

     A LARGE WHITE DOMED TENT has been erected over almost
     the entire patch of ground, surrounded by the CARGO
     TRUCKS that we saw earlier, and more unmarked vans and
     trucks. There are men in black fatigues moving about,
     and scientists in haz-mat suits.

     As the UNMARKED BLACK HELICOPTERS bank overhead. Coming
     in for a landing in the glow cast from the tents. CAMERA
     MOVING TOWARD one of the helicopters as it lightly
     touches down and its black door swings open. A man
     stepping out, and as CAMERA PUSHES UP INTO HIS FACE we
     recognize him as The Cigarette Smoking Man.

     The figure that we've come to know as an assassin and a
     model of modern self-interest and amorality. One of the
     central protagonists in the conspiracy to keep the truth
     from the American people about the existence of
     extraterrestrial life.

     Something known only as: "The Project."

     He walks out from under the whirring prop, just far
     enough to get a flame from his lighter, to get a
     cigarette lit. As we:

     INT. LARGE WHITE TENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     A SCIENTIST in a haz-mat suit is moving through the maze
     of clear plastic tubing that divides work areas within
     the tent. Areas where scientists are working at tables
     doing what appears to be some kind of high-tech
     archeological work. It is a hive of activity within, as
     the Scientist leads us past the REFRIGERATION UNITS to
     the earthen hole where Dr. Bronschweig (we've met him
     earlier, coming out of a med-evac chopper that landed
     when the tent city was erected) appears out of the
     earthen hole, which is reason for all this excitement.
     Climbing out A CLEAR HATCH which has been fashioned to
     cover the hole. Seeing:

     THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

     Now suited up himself. Bronschweig approaches him.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               You've got something to show me.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
                      (nervous excitement)
               Yes.

     INT. ICE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

     What we originally established as icy, and what later
     became the unfrozen Texas field where the boys
     discovered the human skull, has been turned to its
     previously icy state. Thanks to two large vents that Dr.
     Bronschweig is pointing at:

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               We brought the atmosphere back down to
               freezing in order to control the
               development, which is nothing like
               we've ever seen.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Brought on by what?

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Heat, I think. The coincident invasion
               of a host, the fireman, and an
               environment that raised his basic body
               temperature above ninety eight point
               six.

     They step over to a section of the cave which has been
     draped with more plastic, the lights from inside this
     are giving off a cool blue light (passing by TWO
     PORTABLE DRILLING RIGS which have been erected, their
     pumps moving up and down like rocking horses.)
     Bronschweig pushes away the plastic, revealing A MAN
     lying on a gurney draped in plastic. he is hooked up to
     various and sundry machines which are monitoring his
     life signs.

     His skin has turned almost translucent, the veins and
     capillaries now clearly visible, as is his pulse. His
     heartbeat sending life-sustaining blood and energy
     through his body.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               This man's still alive.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Technically and biologically, though
               he'll never recover.

     The CSM is shaking his head in nervous, uneasy wonder.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               How can this be?

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               The developing organism is using his
               life energy, digesting bone and
               tissue. We've just slowed the
               process.

     Bronschweig redirects a light so that it shines hard
     into the man's face and; then we see it. Movement.

     CLOSE ON MAN'S FACE

     Though the man's eyes still blink occasionally, we can
     actually see through his tissue and the bones in his
     skull to see something IS LIVING INSIDE HIM.

     ANGLE UP ON CSM AND BRONSCHWEIG

     The Cigarette Smoking Man's mind is working intently on
     all the possibilities, and consequences.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Do you want me to destroy this one,
               too? Before it gestates?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               No. No...we need to try our vaccine on
               it.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               And if it's unsuccessful?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Incinerate it. Like the others.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               This man's family will want to see the
               body laid to rest.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Tell them he was trying to save the
               young boy's life, and that he died
               heroically like the other firemen.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Of what?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               They seemed to buy our story about the
               Hanta virus. You'll make sure the
               families are taken care of
               financially, along with a sizeable
               donation to the community.
                      (beat)
               Maybe a small roadside memorial.

     He watches the CSM exit, then back to the prostrate
     fireman.

     There is more movement within his body. Within his chest
     and neck, as if the creature gestating inside is
     continuing to stretch and grow. So that now we can see
     one of its BLACK EYES staring from through the clear

     INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Mulder and Scully appear at the end of a long hall.
     Moving TOWARD CAMERA where a YOUNG NAVAL GUARD sits in
     f.g. As a LEGEND appears, to establish.

     Mulder and Scully moving the long distance to the
     Guard's station. Where the Guard looks up at them with
     military scrutiny.

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
               ID and floor you're visiting.

     They both show their FBI IDs.

                            MULDER
               We're going to the morgue.

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
               That area is currently off limits to
               anyone other than authorized medical
               personnel.

                            MULDER
               On whose orders?

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
               General McAddie's.

     Mulder doesn't miss a beat.

                            MULDER
               General McAddie is who requested our
               coming here. We were awakened at three
               AM and told to get down here
               immediately.

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
               I don't know anything about that.

                            MULDER
               Well, call General McAddie.

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
               I don't have his number.

                            MULDER
               They can patch you in through the
               switchboard.

     The Guard is nervous about this, checking his watch. He
     picks up the phone, going through a large directory.

                            MULDER
               Hey! We don't have time to dick around
               here watching you demonstrate your
               ignorance in the chain of command. The
               order came direct from General
               McAddie. Call him. We'll conduct our
               business while you confirm
               authorization.

     Mulder is already directing Scully past the Naval Guard
     who tentatively picks up the phone again.

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
                      (to their backs)
               Why don't you go on ahead head and
               I'll confirm authorization.

                            MULDER
               Thank you.

     LEADING Mulder and Scully, moving they've pulled off a
     con.

                            MULDER
               Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on
               orders of a general?

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - MORGUE FREEZER - NIGHT

     TRACKING TABLE HEIGHT across gurneys where white
     sheet-wrapped bodies lie. CAMERA LANDING ON Scully.
     Standing next to Mulder who is undoing the peculiar
     ropey stitching on the sheet used to secure the bodies.

                            SCULLY
               This is one of the firemen who died in
               Dallas?

                            MULDER
               According to this tag.

                            SCULLY
               And you're looking for?

                            SCULLY
               I can tell you that without even
               looking at him.
                      (off Mulder's look)
               Conclusive organ failure due to
               proximal exposure to source and flying
               debris.

     Scully pulls out an autopsy report that was laid on the
     gurney under the body of the sheet-wrapped corpse.

                            SCULLY
               This body has already been autopsied,
               Mulder. You can tell from the way it's
               been wrapped and dressed.

     Undeterred, Mulder works to get the sheet off. The first
     thing we notice is that he's still in his fireman's
     uniform. His face looks familiar to us, not because we
     know him, but because of the translucency of skin we saw
     in the other fireman. (We will also notice he's
     missing an arm, a leg and large part of his torso.)

                            MULDER
               Does this fit the description you just
               read me, Scully?

     Scully comes around, reacting to what she sees.

                            SCULLY
               Oh my God. This man's tissue...

     Scully is quickly removing a pair of latex gloves,
     stretching them on to palpate the man's tissue.

                            MULDER
               It's like jelly.

                            SCULLY
               There's some kind of cellular
               breakdown. It's completely edematous.

     She palpates the spongy skin on the man's face, neck.
     Unbuttoning the uniform now, seeing:

                            SCULLY
               And there's been no autopsy performed.
               There's no Y incision here; no
               internal exam.

                            MULDER
               You're telling me the cause of death
               on the report is false. That this man
               didn't die from an explosion, or from
               flying debris.

                            SCULLY
               I don't know what killed this man. I'm
               not sure if anybody else could claim
               to either.

     Off Mulder's reaction to this:

     INT. MORGUE - PATHOLOGY LAB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

     The gurney with the fireman is pushed through a pair of
     swinging doors into the darkened lab. Scully flips the
     lights on, looking around at the giant facility.

                            SCULLY
                      (pushing him)
               You knew this man didn't die at the
               bomb site before we got here.

                            MULDER
               I'd been told as much.

                            SCULLY
               You're saying the bombing was a
               cover-up. Of what?

                            MULDER
               I don't know. But I have a hunch what
               you're going to find here isn't
               anything that can be categorized or
               easily referenced.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder, this is going to take some
               time, and somebody's going to figure
               out soon enough we're not even
               supposed to be here.
                      (beat)
               I'm in serious violation of medical
               ethics.

                            MULDER
               We're being blamed for these deaths.
               Scully, I want to know what this man
               died of. Don't you?

     Scully stares at Mulder, then back down at the body. How
     can she refuse, given the finality and the personal
     appeal of the request? After a moment's hesitation, she
     turns to the body, and to the tray table of tools
     nearby. Resigned, if not resolved.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

     A LEGEND appears: WASHINGTON D.C., DUPONT CIRCLE. 4:00
     AM. The street is fairly empty, save for a garbage truck
     picking up the stacks of green garbage bags laid out on
     the sidewalks. Then A TAXI turns off a main street,
     MOVING TOWARDS US.


     INT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - TAXI - NIGHT

     OVER MULDER to the street: Where the taxi is moving
     forward toward a spot where two ARLINGTON PD cruisers
     are pulled up to the curb. Mulder checks the address he
     has written down.

                            MULDER
                      (to the Cabbie)
               I think this is it up here.


     EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

     The taxi pulls over and Mulder exits, starting up the
     steps of a walk up where the door is open.


     INT. KURTZWEIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     There are UNIFORMED OFFICERS inside, and a DETECTIVE.
     Mulder steps into an office. FOUR PAIRS of eyes give him
     the once over. The Detective stepping over to him.

                            MULDER
               Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?

                            DETECTIVE
                      (suspiciously)
               You got some kind of business with
               him?

                            MULDER
               I'm looking for him.

                            DETECTIVE
               Looking for him for what?

     Mulder pulls out his ID, flashes it at the Detective.

                            DETECTIVE
                      (to his partners)
               Feds are looking for him, too.
                      (turns to Mulder)
               Real nice business he's got, huh?

                            MULDER
               What's that?

                            DETECTIVE
               Selling naked pictures of little kids
               over his computer.

     Mulder nods, though this is news to him. He steps in a
     little further, noticing a shelf lined with books. Their
     spines all have the author's name written large: DR.
     ALVIN KURTZWEIL.

     Mulder picks up one of these books, with the title: THE
     FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE GLOBAL DOMINATION CONSPIRACY.

                            DETECTIVE
               You looking for him for some other
               reason?

                            MULDER
               Yeah, I had an appointment for a
               pelvic examination.

     They stare at Mulder like he's a sicko. He smiles and
     they break into RAUCOUS LAUGHTER.

                            DETECTIVE
               You want a call if we turn up
               Kurtzweil?

                            MULDER
               No. Don't bother.

     Mulder puts the book back among the others on the shelf.
     And exits. Onto:


     RESUME EXT. KURTZWEIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Mulder starting up the street when he notices:

     MULDER'S POV

     Kurtzweil has stepped from between two apartments. He's
     staring at Mulder, nodding furtively to him. Then
     stepping back.

     RESUME MULDER

     Slows, then speeds up.


     EXT. SPACE BETWEEN TWO APARTMENTS - NIGHT

     Mulder appears at the end of the narrow walkway, finding
     Kurtzweil tucked a few yards in.

                            KURTZWEIL
               See this bullshit...? Somebody knows
               I'm talking to you.

                            MULDER
               Not according to the men in blue.

                            KURTZWEIL
               What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual
               battery of a patient? I've had my
               license taken away in three states.

                            MULDER
               They want to discredit you -- for
               what?

                            KURTZWEIL
               For what? Because I'm a dangerous man.
               Because I know too much about the
               truth.

                            MULDER
               You mean that apocalyptic trash you
               write? I knew your name was familiar.
               I just didn't know why.

                            KURTZWEIL
               You know my work?

                            MULDER
                      (pointedly)
               Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in
               bigoted ideas about race or genocide.
               I don't believe in the Elders of Zion,
               the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg
               Group or in a oneworld Jew run
               government --

                            KURTZWEIL
               I don't either, but it sure sells
               books.

     He says it with an ironic smile. Causing Mulder to turn
     and start off. But Kurtzweil hurries to grab him, to
     prevent this.

                            KURTZWEIL
               I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I,
               Agent Mulder?

                            MULDER
               How?

                            KURTZWEIL
               I picked up the historical document of
               the venality and hypocrisy of the
               American government. The daily
               newspaper.

                            MULDER
               You said the firemen and the boy were
               found in the temporary offices of the
               Federal Emergency Management Agency.
               Why?

                            KURTZWEIL
               According to the newspaper, FEMA had
               been called out to manage an outbreak
               of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar
               with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?

                            MULDER
               It was a deadly virus spread by field
               mice in the Southwest U.S. several
               years ago.

                            KURTZWEIL
               And are you familiar with FEMA? What
               the Federal Emergency Management
               Agency's real power is? FEMA allows
               the White House to suspend
               constitutional government upon
               declaration of a national emergency.
               To create a non-elected government.
               Think about that.
                      (beat)
               What is an agency with such broad
               sweeping power doing managing a small
               viral outbreak in suburban Texas?

                            MULDER
               Are you saying it wasn't such a small
               outbreak?

     Kurtzweil is getting intense now.

                            KURTZWEIL
               I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus.

     They are both given a start when a POLICE CRUISER rolls
     by on the street, giving a burp of its siren. It rolls
     past as the two men tuck in tighter.

                            MULDER
               What was it?

                            KURTZWEIL
               When we were young men in the
               military, your father and I were
               recruited for a project. They told us
               it was biological warfare. A virus.
               There were rumors about its origins.

                            MULDER
               What killed those men?

                            KURTZWEIL
               What killed them I won't even write
               about. I tell you, they'd do more than
               just harass me. They have the future
               to protect.

                            MULDER
               I'll know soon enough.

                            KURTZWEIL
                      (worked up)
               What killed those men can't be
               identified in simple medical terms. My
               god, we can't even wrap our minds
               around something as obvious as HIV.
               We have no context for what killed
               those men, or any appreciation of the
               scale in which it will be unleashed in
               the future. Of how it will be
               transmitted; of the environmental
               factors involved.

                            MULDER
               A plague?

                            KURTZWEIL
               The plague to end all plagues, Agent
               Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet
               war. The systematic release of an
               indiscriminate organism for which the
               men who will bring it on still have no
               cure. They've been working on this for
               fifty years. While the rest of the
               world was fighting gooks and commies
               these men have been secretly
               negotiating a planned Armageddon.

                            MULDER
               Negotiating with whom?

                            KURTZWEIL
               I think you know. The timetable has
               been set. It will happen on a holiday,
               when people are away from their homes.
               When our elected officials are at
               their resorts or out of the country.
               The President will declare a state of
               emergency, at which time all federal
               agencies, all government will come
               under the power of the Federal
               Emergency Management Agency. FEMA,
               Agent Mulder. The secret government.

                            MULDER
               And they tell me I'm paranoid.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Something's gone wrong -- something
               unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and
               dig. Or you're only going to find out
               like the rest of the country, Agent
               Mulder. When it's too late.

     Kurtzweil turns, starts off. Mulder stares after him.
     Then:

                            MULDER
               How can I reach you?

                            KURTZWEIL
               You can't.

     Mulder moves to catch up to Kurtzweil, pulling out his
     cell phone. Kurtzweil stops, turns. Truly and intensely
     paranoid. Mulder makes him take the cell phone.

                            MULDER
               No calling Hawaii.

     Mulder turns and moves back out onto the street.

     Where Scully stood moments ago, there is now just an
     unattended gurney. A sheet over the fireman's body.
     Scully is gone.

     CHIRPING of her cell phone breaks the tense silence. She
     pats frantically at her coat, trying to get it answered
     before it rings again. Unsuccessfully. Finally getting
     a hold of it and hitting the send button. Scully sits
     breathing heavy, nervous breaths -- waiting for the
     Young Naval Guard to come running in.

                            MULDER'S VOICE (FILTER)
               Scully...?

     She puts the phone slowly up to her face.

               Why are you whispering?

                            SCULLY
               I can't really talk right now.

                            SCULLY
               Evidence of a massive infection.

                            MULDER
               What kind of infection?

                            SCULLY
               I don't know.

                            MULDER

               home, then I'm booking a flight to
               Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket,
               too.

                            MULDER
               I need you there with me. I need your
               expertise on this. The bomb we found
               was meant to destroy those bodies and
               whatever they were infected by.

                            SCULLY
               I've got a hearing tomorrow --

               Maybe with evidence that could blow
               that meeting away.

                            SCULLY

     with the Naval Guard's feet as they pass by the rolling
     carts on which bodies are laid. TRACKING to find SCULLY,
     where she hides under one of the carts. Huddled and

     The Guard's feet stop near here. He stands motionless
     for a moment, then moves off. HOLD her until the door
     slams shut.


     INT. FBI OFFICE - DALLAS - MORNING - MULDER

     enters a forensics lab with a FIELD AGENT. A LEGEND
     reads: FBI FIELD OFFICE, DALLAS : 11:20 AM.

                            FIELD AGENT
               You're looking for what amounts to a
               needle in a haystack. I'm afraid the
               explosion was so devastating there
               hasn't been a whole lot we've been
               able to put together just yet.

     They are walking amid BOXES of evidence. STACKS of
     debris. There are FORENSIC TECHS sorting through this
     material. It looks like the most tedious and painstaking
     job in the world.

                            MULDER
               I'm looking for anything out of the
               ordinary. Maybe something from the
               FEMA offices where the bodies were
               found.

                            FIELD AGENT
               We weren't expecting to find those
               remains, of course. They went right
               off to Washington.

                            MULDER
               Was there anything in those offices
               that didn't go to D.C.?

                            FIELD AGENT
               Some bone fragments came up in the
               sift this morning. We thought there'd
               been another fatality, but we found
               out FEMA had recovered them from an
               archeological site out of town.

                            MULDER
               Have you examined them?

                            FIELD AGENT
               No. Just fossils, far as I know.

     Mulder is nodding, when both men look off at something
     that's caught their attention o.s.

                            MULDER
               I'd like this person to take a look,
               if you don't mind.

     THEIR POV - AGENT SCULLY

     Standing in the doorway to the lab. She looks at Mulder
     as if she's come in spite of her misgivings. Moving
     toward them now.

                            FIELD AGENT
               Let me just see if I can lay my hands
               on what you're looking for.

     The Field Agent nods to Scully as he passes, exiting
     deeper into the room. Leaving Mulder and Scully by
     themselves momentarily.

                            MULDER
               You said you weren't coming?

                            SCULLY
               I wasn't planning on it. Particularly
               after spending a half hour in cold
               storage this morning. But I got a
               better look at the blood and tissue
               samples I took from the firemen.

                            MULDER
               What did you find?

                            SCULLY
                      (voice lowering pointedly)
               Something I couldn't show to anyone
               else. Not without more information.
               And not without causing the kind of
               attention I'd just as soon avoid right
               now.
                      (off Mulder's look)
               The virus those men were infected with
               contains a protein coat I've never
               seen before. What it did to them it
               did extremely fast. And unlike the
               AIDS virus or any other aggressive
               strain, it survives very nicely
               outside the body.

                            MULDER
               How was it contracted?

                            SCULLY
               That I don't know. But if it's through
               simple contact of blood to blood, and
               if it doesn't respond to conventional
               treatments, it could be a serious
               health threat.

     Mulder's reaction is postponed, or at least subdued by
     the reappearance of the field agent.

                            FIELD AGENT
               Like I said, these are fossils, and
               they weren't near the blast center, so
               they aren't going to tell you much.

                            SCULLY
               May I?

     He offers Scully the small glass vials in which the bone
     fragments have been separated. She takes them, looking
     at them on her way over to the microscope. Tapping out a
     tiny fragment onto the viewing bed. She puts her eyes
     down to the stereoscope eyepieces, then almost
     immediately looks up at Mulder who translates this look
     almost instantly.

                            MULDER
               You said you knew the location of the
               archeological site where these were
               found.

                            FIELD AGENT
               Show you right on a map.

     Off Mulder and Scully's traded looks:

     EXT. SMALL PUBLIC PARK - WEST TEXAS - DAY

     The domed white tent is still in place, the fleet of
     trucks and equipment surrounding it unmanned. Several
     large sound-dampened generators still hum away, but the
     work being done here would be a mystery to anyone who
     didn't have access to the tent.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. DOMED TENT - DAY

     An electric Bobcat-like bulldozer maneuvers a very high
     tech-looking CLEAR CONTAINER to the edge of the earthen
     hole. The container has monitors and gauges on it,
     oxygen tanks and what looks like a circulation
     refrigeration unit. A self-contained life support
     system. The inside of the container is covered with a
     thin layer of frost.

     When the small bulldozer gets the container over near
     the hole, several technicians lift it down off the
     shovel, hand carrying it toward the hole opening. As Dr.
     Bronschweig APPEARS, moving to a ladder that leads down
     into the hole. He's dressed in a haz-mat suit, with the
     hood off.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               I need to have those settings checked
               and re-set. I need a steady minus two
               Celsius through the transfer of the
               body, after I administer the vaccine.

     The men nod to Bronschweig, begin checking the settings
     as Bronschweig puts his hood on, starts down into the
     hole, through the clear hatch.


     INT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - DAY

     The refrigeration vents are still pumping in arctic air
     when Dr. Bronschweig appears descending a fixed ladder.
     It is dark in here, save for the ice blue glow of light
     coming from the plastic draped area where we saw the
     fireman acting as an incubator/host for some kind of
     organism growing inside him.

     Bronschweig steps over to this area, moves aside the
     plastic drapery to enter.


     ANGLE INSIDE, PLASTIC LINED AREA

     Where the body of the fireman is still inside the
     quarantine bubble litter in f.g. Bronschweig takes out of
     his pocket a SYRINGE and an AMPULE. Turning now to the
     body. Stepping to it. Moving a work light, as he had
     done for the Cigarette Smoking Man, so that it shines on
     the face of the fireman. But when he does this,
     Bronschweig nearly JUMPS, his breath stolen away.
     Reacting to:

     ANGLE ON FIREMAN'S BODY

     The chest and torso have imploded. It has been turned
     into a muddy mass of blood-stained jelly; bone and
     tissue melted into an oozing mass which has sunken due
     to the fact that the creature which was inside is now
     gone.

     CAMERA WHIPS from Bronschweig to the wall. To the
     temperature gauge which reads about 6 degrees Celsius.
     WHIPPING BACK to Bronschweig who is now panicked.

     INT. DOMED TENT - DAY

     ANGLE DOWN ON EARTHEN HOLE, where the Technicians
     Bronschweig was speaking to minutes ago react to
     Bronschweig's MUFFLED VOICE. He's down below them in the
     cave, looking up.

     Pulling his haz-mat hood off. Yelling up to them.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               It's gone!

                            TECHNICIAN
               It's what?

     OVER THE TECHNICIANS TO BRONSCHWEIG DOWN BELOW

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               It's left the body. I think it's
               gestated --

     Bronschweig is starting up the ladder when something
     stops him.


     RESUME INT. ICE CAVE

     CREATURE'S POV OF BRONSCHWEIG

     He stands frozen on the ladder, squinting into the
     darkness.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Wait -- I see it --

     BRONSCHWEIG'S POV

     In the shadows there is movement, the creature edging
     into the light cast from the draped area. We see it is
     fully formed -- a replica of the Creature we saw at the
     opening of our story. Though it does not make any kind
     of aggressive move. As if, newborn, it is tentative.

     RESUME BRONSCHWEIG - CREATURE'S POV

     He remains standing on a rung of the ladder for a
     moment, then takes a gentle step back down to the
     ground.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
                      (nervous wonder)
               Oh my god. Oh my god.

                            TECHNICIAN
               You see it?

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Yes. It's...amazing. You want to get
               down here --
                      (sotto to himself)
               Jesus Lord...so much for little green
               men.

     Dr. Bronschweig moves shakily to put the syringe in the
     ampule again...when, suddenly, the Creature STRIKES.
     CAMERA RUSHING FORWARD TO BRONSCHWEIG.

     OVERHEAD ANGLE - OVER THE TECHNICIANS

     As the Creature slams into Bronschweig, knocking him out
     of the line of sight from the top of the earthen hole.

     There are SCREAMS OF PAIN from Bronschweig, then they
     abate.

     RESUME INT. ICE CAVE

     Bronschweig can be heard, but not clearly seen. He is in
     the shadows himself now.

     Trying to pick himself up, and when he manages to do
     this, teetering back into the light we see that he is
     bloodied. He is hurt, injured. Making his way back
     toward the patch of light that comes from the hole
     above. Hoping to see that help is on its way, while
     keeping a watchful, wary and worried eye on the shadows,
     for another attack by the Creature.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Hey -- I need help.

     But the Technicians looking down on him offer him
     nothing of the sort. All they do is quickly close the
     clear hatch that seals Bronschweig inside the cave.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Hey!

     But he gets no answer, climbing the ladder shakily. A
     moment later the first Bobcat shovel-full of dirt falls
     onto the clear hatch and partially obscures the light.
     They are burying Bronschweig alive.


     INT. DOMED TENT - DAY

     ANGLE DOWN ON BRONSCHWEIG through the glass hatch. His
     SCREAMS continue. ADJUSTING to the small bulldozer which
     is quickly hauling the mound of excavated earth into the
     hole from which it came. While, all around, there is a
     hive of activity. Men running everywhere.

     Bronschweig reacts in silent horror now, only to turn in
     further horror when he feels the impending attack of:

     THE CREATURE

     Right behind and just below him. Its grotesque features
     in momentary high resolution, BEFORE IT ATTACKS CAMERA.
     Over and over, savaging Bronschweig in a violent fury.
     Its hideous teeth tearing at his flesh - AT CAMERA -
     driving him off the ladder where the attack continues in
     momentary glimpses of teeth, of bloody flesh, and of
     OILY BLACK BLOOD being spattered about. At the
     height of the violence we hear Bronschweig SCREAM.
     Matching the wound of this, as we:

     EXT. ESTATE SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE LONDON - EARLY EVENING

     A CHILD'S SCREAM OF JOY. ENGLISH CHILDREN are playing
     tag or some kind of children's game in the
     well-manicured garden of a man who the CAMERA FINDS IN
     F.G. -- the man we have come to know as THE
     WELL-MANICURED MAN. He is also a member of the syndicate
     running "The Project", though his venality is cloaked in
     civility and statesmanship. Right now he's watching the
     children from the back steps of his mansion, charmed by
     their game. When he is called by someone o.s.

                            VALET'S VOICE
               Sir -- you have a call.

     The Well-Manicured Man turns to see:

     HIS VALET

     Holds the door. After a moment the W.M.M. enters past
     the Valet. As the screams of the children continue to
     rise and fall.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. SUBURBAN LONDON ESTATE - A BEAUTIFUL STUDY -
     EVENING

     The Well-Manicured Man enters, picks up a blinking line.
     Through a window he can still see the children playing.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Yes.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
                            (FILTER)
               We have a situation. The members are
               assembling.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Is it an emergency?


     INTERCUT WITH TIGHT CSM AT INT. KENSINGTON BUILDING
     (NEXT LOC.)

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Yes. A meeting is set. Tonight in
               London, to determine a course.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Who called this meeting?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane
               in Tunis.

     This pronouncement has the power of ending any further
     questions. An immediate sense of gravity of the
     situation. The W.M.M. hangs up, moves to the window
     where he sees some of the HELP is running from the
     house. The children have all gathered around a BOY who
     seems to have hurt himself. He's lifted and being
     carried by the man who's called the W.M.M. into the
     house.

     Off the Well-Manicured Man's concern, we:

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT

     A discreet Town Car pulls up out front an understated
     building in a better West End neighborhood. A driver
     exits coming around for the Well-Manicured Man who is
     already exiting, moving to the building. As a LEGEND
     appears: KENSINGTON, LONDON: 8:01 PM.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. KENSINGTON BUILDING - NIGHT

     The Well-Manicured Man is admitted by a Valet. The
     interior has the well-heeled look of money, or a finely
     appointed residence that no one lives in. The Valet
     takes the W.M.M.'s coat.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Has Strughold arrived?

                            VALET
               They're in the library.

     He leads the W.M.M. down a hall, to:


     INT. LARGE STATELY LIBRARY - NIGHT

     A GROUP OF MEN are standing, looking at something on a
     TV monitor. A surveillance video. They turn when the
     W.M.M. enters. CAMERA FAVORING A SMALL LEAN MAN with
     close-cropped hair.

     He is at once elegant and imposing with eyes that hold
     you with laser-like acuity. He is CONRAD STRUGHOLD.

     The others are of various ethnicities, tailored and
     dignified. This might be a collection of U.N. delegates.
     Indeed some are.

     Their business here, however, doesn't represent anyone's
     interests but their own. As tipped by the attendance of
     a GROUP ELDER from the U.S. who we've come to know.

     But, more importantly, by the Cigarette Smoking Man who
     holds the VCR remote. He pauses the picture.

                            STRUGHOLD
               We began to worry. Some of us have
               traveled so far, and you are the last
               to arrive.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke
               his leg.

     The non-response to this has the same effect as a
     reprimand. But the W.M.M. will not apologize of kowtow.

                            STRUGHOLD
               While we've been made to wait, we've
               watched surveillance tapes which have
               raised more concerns.

     The Well-Manicured Man glances to the TV, sees the
     frame paused.

     HIS POV OF TV MONITOR

     Where Mulder and Scully's faces are seen in a hallway
     that we recognize as the Bethesda Naval Hospital.

     RESUME WELL-MANICURED MAN

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               More concerns than that?

                            STRUGHOLD
               We've been forced to reassess our role
               in Colonization by new facts of
               biology which have presented
               themselves.

                            GROUP ELDER
                      (speaking up)
               The virus has mutated.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               On its own?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Its effect on the host has changed.
               The virus no longer just invades the
               brain as a controlling organism. It's
               developed a way to modify the host
               body.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Into what?

                            STRUGHOLD
               A new extraterrestrial biological
               entity.

     It takes a moment to sink in. The weight of this fact.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               My god...

                            STRUGHOLD
               The geometry of mass infection
               presents certain conceptual
               re-evaluations for us. About our place
               in their Colonization.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               This isn't Colonization, it's
               spontaneous repopulation. All our
               work... if it's true, then they've
               been using us all along. We've been
               laboring under a lie!

                            2ND ELDER
               It could be an isolated case.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               How can we know?!

                            STRUGHOLD
               We're going to tell them what we've
               found. What we've learned. Turn over a
               body infected with the gestating
               organism.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               In hope of what? Learning that it's
               true?! That we are nothing more than
               digestives for the creation of a new
               race of alien lifeforms?!

                            STRUGHOLD
               Let me remind you who is the new race.
               And who is the old.
                      (beat)
               What could be gained by withholding
               anything from them; By pretending to
               ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall
               their plans to step up the timetable.
               To start Colonization early.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               And if it doesn't? By cooperating now
               we're but beggars to our demise! Our
               ignorance was in cooperating with the
               Colonists at all.

                            STRUGHOLD
               Cooperation is our only chance of
               saving ourselves.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               They still need us to carry out their
               preparations.

                            STRUGHOLD
               We'll continue to use them as they do
               us. If only to play for more time, to
               continue work on our vaccine.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Our vaccine may have no effect!

                            STRUGHOLD
               Well, without a cure for the virus,
               we're nothing more than digestives
               anyway.

     All eyes go to the Well-Manicured Man. He is respected,
     if not the odd man out in this room. But he is all
     restrained anger now.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               My lateness may have well been
               absence. A course has already been
               taken.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               There are complications.

     He turns back to the TV monitor where Mulder and Scully
     remain frozen on the screen.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Do they know?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Mulder was in Dallas when we were
               trying to dispose of evidence. He's
               gone back there again. Someone has
               tipped him.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Who?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Kurtzweil, we think.

                            STRUGHOLD
               We've allowed this man his freedom.
               His books have actually helped us to
               facilitate plausible denial. Has he
               outlived his usefulness to us?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               No one believes Kurtzweil or his
               books. He's a toiler. A crank.

                            STRUGHOLD
               And Mulder?

                            ELDER
               Our new situation makes us vulnerable.
               If he learns information as we do, he
               could jeopardize the Project's
               secrecy.

                            2ND ELDER
               Control of information means control
               of Mulder.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               I can control Mulder. I've always
               controlled Mulder.

                            STRUGHOLD
               This may take another approach.

     He says this, casting his look toward the Well-Manicured
     Man. A look of cold malevolence. The W.M.M.'s reaction
     is disdain.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               You can't kill Mulder. He's got too
               much light on him.

                            STRUGHOLD
               You need not kill a man to destroy
               him.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
                      (personalizing the
                      inference)
               No, you need only take away what is
               most precious to him.

                                             HARD CUT TO:


     EXT. SMALL PUBLIC PARK - CENTRAL TEXAS - DAY

     AGENT SCULLY

     She stands against a backdrop of Texas flatland,
     squinting into the sun. Shaking her head.

                            SCULLY
               I don't know, Mulder...

     We are:

     WIDE ANGLE REVERSE, TO INCLUDE MULDER, standing in the
     middle of a park, replete with jungle gyms, playground
     equipment. All brand spanking new. They are standing
     right where there had once been a hard scrabble, parched
     and barren little field. Where the earthen hole had been
     dug by the young boys. And what had later been the site
     of so much activity by the group of scientists. But
     where there's now a park, thick green grass covering the
     parch of ground, including the spot where the hole had
     been.

                            SCULLY
               He didn't mention a park.

                            MULDER
               This is where he marked on the map,
               Scully. Where he says those fossils
               were unearthed.

                            SCULLY
               I don't see any evidence of an
               archeological or any other kind of
               digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm
               drain.

     Mulder scans the area, confounded. Shaking his head as
     they walk.

                            MULDER
               You're sure the fossils you looked at
               showed the same signs of deterioration
               you saw in the fireman's body in the
               morgue?

                            SCULLY
                      (nodding)
               The bone was porous, as if the virus
               of the causative microbe were
               digesting it.

                            MULDER
               And you've never seen anything like
               that?

                            SCULLY
               No.  It didn't show up on any of the
               immunohistochemical tests --

     Mulder is listening to all this while looking down at
     his feet:

                            MULDER
               This looks like new grass to you?

                            SCULLY
               It looks pretty green for this
               climate.

     Mulder stops, kneels, touches the thick green carpet of
     turf. He digs around, lifting up a corner of a new
     square.

                            MULDER
               Ground's dry about an inch down.
               Somebody just laid this down. Very
               recently, I'd say.

                            SCULLY
                      (looking off)
               All the equipment is brand new.

                            MULDER
               No irrigation system. Somebody's
               covering their tracks.

     They both turn, looking at something that's caught their
     attention on the street where their rental car is
     parked. Three kids, all of whom we recognize from
     earlier. Stevie's "friends".

     Tooling down the street on new BMX bikes. Reacting to
     Mulder's loud WHISTLE. This stops them, staring at
     Mulder blankly across the distance.

                            MULDER
               Hey!

     They don't answer. Just keep staring, squinting into the
     sun. Mulder and Scully start walking toward them.

                            SCULLY
               Do you live around here?

                            2ND BOY
               Yeah.

     As the Agents approach.

                            MULDER
               You see anybody digging here?

     The kids don't answer quickly.

                            2ND BOY
               Not supposed to talk about it.

                            SCULLY
               You're not supposed to talk about it?
               Who told you that?

                            3RD BOY
               Nobody.

                            MULDER
               Nobody. Same nobody who put this park
               in? That new equipment...
                      (off the boys guilty looks)
               They buy you these bikes?

     The kids shift uncomfortably.

                            SCULLY
               I think you better tell us.

                            2ND BOY
               We don't even know you.

                            SCULLY
               Well, we're FBI agents.

                            2ND BOY
               You're not FBI agents.

                            MULDER
               How do you know?

                            2ND BOY
               Cause FBI agents wear like suits and
               goofy ties. And dresses like my mom
               wears to church. Like on that one
               show.

     Mulder and Scully pull their badges. The kids' mouths
     drop.

                            MULDER
               Maybe you've been watching too much
               TV.

                            3RD BOY
               They all left twenty minutes ago.

                            4TH BOY
               Going that way.

     The kids all pointing in the same direction.


     EXT. CENTRAL TEXAS HIGHWAY - LATE DAY

     As Mulder and Scully's rental car RACES by at high
     speed.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. MULDER AND SCULLY'S RENTAL CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder at the wheel, foot to the floor. Scully's got a
     map out. The mood is urgent, tense.

                            MULDER
               Unmarked tanker trucks... what are
               archaeologists hauling out in tanker
               trucks?

                            SCULLY
               I don't know, Mulder.

                            MULDER
               And where are they going with it?

                            SCULLY
               That's the first question to answer,
               if we're going to find them.

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     EXT. CENTRAL HIGHWAY - LATE DAY

     Mulder slows down to a stop. They've come to a three-way
     intersection in the middle of absolutely nowhere that
     offers them three choices. The car sits idling for
     several beats.


     RESUME INT. RENTAL CAR

     Mulder's got his hand on his face rubbing his eyes.

                            MULDER
               What are my choices?

                            SCULLY
               About a hundred miles of nothing in
               each direction.

                            MULDER
               Where would they be going?

                            SCULLY
               We've got two choices. One of them is
               wrong.

     They are both looking in different directions. The car
     idling.

                            MULDER
               You think they went left?

                            SCULLY
               I don't know why I think they went
               right.

     A few moments of silence. Then Mulder steps on the gas
     and goes straight. Heading out onto the only unpaved
     road. Accelerating away.

     Scully looks at him, wondering. As they bump along at
     speed. Mulder won't look at her for a few moments. Then,
     turning to her:

                            MULDER
               Five years together -- how many times
               have I been wrong.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     HEADLIGHTS appear in the distance on a long, dusty
     stretch of road. GROWING as they approach, then coming
     to a stop in a cloud of dust as they move into f.g.

     Where a LINE OF FENCEPOSTS, BARBWIRE blocks their path.

     As the car brakes, the passenger door opens and Scully
     exits. A hot Texas wind blows. A dog is BARKING
     somewhere. Scully walks into the headlight wash, looking
     at a sign on the fence.

     After a moment, the driver's door opens and Mulder
     exits.

                            MULDER
               Hey, I was right about the bomb,
               wasn't I?

                            SCULLY
               This is great. This is fitting.

     REVERSE ON SCENE

     On the fence sign, painted in crude letters, are the
     words: SOME HAVE TRIED, SOME HAVE DIED. TURN BACK -- NO
     TRESPASSING.

                            MULDER
               What?

                            SCULLY
               I've got to be in Washington D.C. in
               eleven hours for a hearing -- the
               outcome of which might possibly affect
               one of the biggest decisions of my
               life. And here I am standing out in
               the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing
               phantom tanker trucks.

                            MULDER
               We're not chasing trucks, we're
               chasing evidence --

                            SCULLY
               -- of what exactly?!

                            MULDER
               That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go
               off, to hide something: bodies
               infected with a virus you detected
               yourself.

                            SCULLY
               They haul gas in tanker trucks, they
               haul oil in tanker trucks -- they
               don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.

                            MULDER
               Yeah, well they may this one.

                            SCULLY
               What do you mean by haul?
                      (off his reaction)
               What are you not telling me here?

                            MULDER
               This virus -- it...
                      (afraid to say)

                            SCULLY
               Mulder --

                            MULDER
               It may be extraterrestrial.

                            SCULLY
               I don't believe this. I don't fucking
               believe this.
                      (reaching her limit of
                      impatience)
               Y'know, I've been here... I've been
               here one too many times with you,
               Mulder.

                            MULDER
               Been where?

                            SCULLY
               Pounding down some dirt road in the
               middle of the night. Chasing some
               elusive truth on a dim hope, only to
               find myself standing right where I am
               right now: at another dead end --

     As she says this A BELL starts to sound. A flashing
     light hits Mulder and Scully. They both turn to see:

     HIGH ANGLE OVER A RAILROAD CROSSING SIGN

     Sitting all by its lonely self. No swinging arms or
     gate. Just one little sign between Mulder and Scully and
     their car.

     CAMERA PANNING to the light of a locomotive speeding
     toward us.

     WIDE ANGLE OVER TRACKS TO MULDER AND SCULLY

     They move toward their car, but the train is coming
     fast. Mulder and Scully stop and wait, watching the
     train. As the engine breaks frame, eclipsing Mulder and
     Scully from view. And as it passes by we see TWO VERY
     FAMILIAR WHITE TANKERS loaded piggyback atop flat bed
     cars.

     The train, which is not much longer than this, passes.
     And Mulder and Scully make a mad dash for their car. The
     lights come on and Mulder swings the vehicle into a hard
     accelerating turn, taking the spoke of the intersection
     that parallels the tracks. As the car hauls ass after
     the train, we:

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. OPPOSITE END OF MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT

     The rails come up a grade where they appear out of a
     long bending turn. Exiting the mountain pass near the
     summit of the mountain. And now HEADLIGHTS appear,
     bouncing toward us. It's Mulder and Scully's rental
     chugging up the grade.

     And now pulling to a stop as it REACHES CAMERA. Then the
     car doors open and Mulder and Scully exit. Putting
     jackets against the cold desert night. Running over the
     gravel on the rail bed into sharp f.g.

                            SCULLY
               What do you think it is?

                            MULDER
               I have no idea.

     They start out toward it anyway, whatever it is. But the
     image that we see next might cause us to ask the same
     question.

     REVERSE ANGLE -- MULDER AND SCULLY'S FORMER POV

     The Agents are moving off the tracks now, picking their
     way toward the horizon where, at the edge of the great
     plateau that lays out before them, there are TWO GIANT
     GLOWING WHITE DOMES.

     It is otherwise pitch dark out, almost giving the
     impression that the domes are floating.

     It would give the distinct impression of
     otherworldliness, if we hadn't seen a similar, smaller
     glowing dome over the dirt field where the boys found
     the skull. And if we could not see the lights of the
     TRAIN rolling to a stop near the mysterious domes.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. GREAT PLATEAU - NIGHT - HIGH WIDE ANGLE

     SLOWLY CRANING DOWN as Mulder and Scully move through
     the low scrub of the high desert. Moving towards us as
     CAMERA CONTINUES ITS SLOW CRANE DOWN, REVEALING in f.g.
     the tops of CORN STALKS (yes, corn stalks.) What is the
     perimeter edge of:

     REVERSE CRANE DOWN (TO MATCH)

     Acres and acres of corn fields, laying out before us in
     the dark night. Running all the way to the WHITE DOMED
     TENTS in the b.g.

     Mulder and Scully enter the perimeter edge, disappearing
     into:


     EXT. ACRES OF CORN - NIGHT

     TRACKING WITH Mulder and Scully as they move through the
     field.

                            SCULLY
               This is weird, Mulder.

                            MULDER
               Very weird.

                            SCULLY
               Any thoughts on why anybody'd be
               growing corn in the middle of the
               desert?

                            MULDER
               Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop
               containers out there.

     CONTINUE TRACKING as they move through the tall uniform
     rows.

     ANGLE BEHIND THE AGENTS

     Shooting down the long straight rows. CRANING UP to
     REVEAL DOMES once again. Like space ships that have
     landed.

                                             CUT TO:


     OPPOSITE PERIMETER OF THE FIELD OF CORN

     The Agents exit the edge of the crop field. They have
     come upon the glowing tents now. Tall and pillowy
     against the dark sky.

     There is no evidence of anyone about. No sound, no
     signs.

     Mulder and Scully stand at the edge of the field for a
     moment. Then move cautiously across an open area to one
     of the domes.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. WHITE DOME TENT - NIGHT

     Mulder pulls open the steel door leading in. It opens
     with a SUCKING SOUND which suggests the interior is
     pressurized. And as he and Scully step in -- they both
     JUMP when LARGE FANS just overhead hit them both with
     hard blasts of air.

     Stepping quickly out of the downward blasting air, into
     the still silence of the space beyond.

                            SCULLY
               Cool in here. Temperature's being
               regulated.

                            MULDER
               For the purpose of what?

     HIGH OVERHEAD ANGLE

     Our view is down through the crosswires and cables that
     create the tension support. The effect is a combination
     of simplicity and perfect function. Stark and high tech.
     The flooring is gray and flat, featureless. But we don't
     yet see from this angle exactly what the white domed
     tent houses.

     Though the air is still and there is no movement of any
     kind, there is a sound that permeates the interior. A
     STEADY HUM. Almost electrical hum, but different.

     Mulder and Scully move together toward the middle of the
     space.

     WIDE ON TENT - MULDER AND SCULLY'S POV

     Laid out in a grid, low to the ground, are what look
     like BOXES. Fixed in place like roof vents, except these
     are on the floor, no more than three feet tall, and
     about the same measure square.

     NEW ANGLE - TRACKING WITH MULDER AND SCULLY

     As they continue to move cautiously, walking out into
     the grid of box-shaped objects. Coming to the center of
     the capacious, arena-sized space. Standing over one of
     the mysterious boxes, which we now see have LOUVERED
     TOPS. The louvers, however, are shut so that whatever is
     inside the boxes cannot be seen.

                            SCULLY
               I think we're on top of something. I
               think these are some kind of venting.

     Mulder lays his head and ear to the top of the box.

                            MULDER
               You hear that?

                            SCULLY
               I hear the humming. Like electricity.
               High voltage maybe.

                            MULDER
               Maybe. Maybe not.

     Scully looks skyward.

                            SCULLY
               What do you think those are for?

     Mulder takes his ear off the box, looking up now, too.

     THEIR POV

     At the top of the dome are two LARGE corresponding
     LOUVER VENTS.

     RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY

     Looking up at these vents.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. WHITE DOME TENT - NIGHT

     HIGH WIDE ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY, staring up JUST
     PAST CAMERA at the louvered vents at top center of the
     tent. When A LOUD METALLIC NOISE makes them jump.

     AGENTS POV THE LOUVERED VENTS ABOVE THEM

     One of the vents is opening automatically, its large
     metal louvers straining from their flat closed position
     into an up-and-down open position. When this is
     complete, the SECOND LOUVER does the same.

     The straining sound of galvanized metal-on-metal.

     LOW ANGLE ON MULDER AND SCULLY

     As Mulder turns his look from the ceiling back down to
     the mysterious box they're standing next to. Something
     occurs to him. Something frightening.

                            MULDER
               Scully....?

                            SCULLY
               Yeah...?

                            MULDER
               Run.

     Mulder grabs her hand, pulling her along. Though she
     doesn't know why. Or what's about to happen. TRACKING
     FAST WITH THEM as Mulder leads her back toward the door
     they entered, which is a good hundred yards away.

                            SCULLY
                      (yelling, on the run)
               What are you doing?

                            MULDER
                      (yelling back)
               Come on!

     When the LOUVERED VENTS on all the low grid-arranged
     boxes OPEN IN DOMINO-LIKE SUCCESSION -- out of them
     pouring THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF BEES, rapidly filling
     the atmosphere of the domed space.

     As if the insects are being shot out of non-stop
     cannons.

     HIGH ANGLE

     THICK STREAMS of bees head RIGHT AT CAMERA, flying for
     the open louvers at the top of the dome. As Mulder and
     Scully run for it down below.

     TRACKING WITH MULDER AND SCULLY

     Scully's hand slipping from Mulder's as she pulls her
     jacket up over her head. Mulder doing the same now,
     ducking his head inside his own jacket. The Agents are
     slowed by the bees but still make their zigzag way
     toward the door -- bees clinging to their clothes. But
     motion seems to be the key.

     As Mulder RUNS TOWARD CAMERA -- where the downward blast
     of air knocks all the bees off him. In the b.g., we see
     that Scully has fallen behind. Still running, but losing
     her way in the process, losing her bearings as the
     thickening swarm of bees descends.

     CLOSE ON SCULLY

     When Mulder enters frame, jacket pulled over his head
     again. Taking Scully by the back of her coat and
     swinging her toward the direction of the door.
     Whipsnapping her the rest of the distance to the
     doorfans. Following right behind her as the fans
     BLASTING them and the Agents continue right out the
     doors. To:


     EXT. WHITE DOMED TENT - NIGHT

     Scully and Mulder comes blasting out themselves now, but
     they haven't even had time to catch their breaths when
     they react to MOVEMENT. Something coming at them in the
     night.

     THEIR POV'S - STRAIGHT DOWN THE ROWS OF DOMED TENTS

     Where BRIGHT BEAMS BLAST ON, moving fast toward them.
     The RUSHING WHIR of the turbine engines of the unmarked
     choppers. The bright beams skimming across the ground
     toward Mulder and Scully, traveling right along the
     edges of ends of the white domed tents. Threatening to
     spot the Agents, unless they -- RUN.

     And they do -- bolting just as the beams and the
     helicopters blast over the spot they held just moments
     before. Running to:


     EXT. ACRES OF CORN - NIGHT - MULDER AND SCULLY - VARIOUS
     HANDHELD

     Running flat out now, knocking away the stalks and
     leaves that block their way.

     Following and leading shots.

     POVs and Tracking shots.

     And chasing angles, as the Agents run through the only
     cover they've got. As:

     ANGLE JUST OVER THE TOP OF CROPS

     The unmarked helicopters swoop right overhead, their
     BRIGHT SPOTLIGHTS searching and cutting through the
     cornrows. As the Agents zig and zag just out of the
     discovering beams. As the choppers zoom right over their
     heads.

     REVERSE ON CHOPPERS

     Traversing the field, then doing sharp banking turns and
     swooping back over the field now in low drifting hovers.
     The wash from the blades knocking the corn stalks down
     so as to reveal anything hidden within.

     The bright spots making sure that nothing might escape
     detection.

     LOW ANGLE - CAMERA SEARCHING AND FINDING SCULLY

     as she runs up INTO FRAME. She's lost sight of:

                            SCULLY
               Mulder?!


     ANGLE ELSEWHERE ON MULDER

     As he too runs to a stop. Hearing his name.

                            MULDER
               Scully?!


     RESUME SCULLY

     Reacting to the sound of her name, but there's no time
     to find her bearings on Mulder. Not before she has to
     take flight again. As one of the choppers appears
     overhead, hovering into view. Knocking the corn down in
     a path moving straight toward her.

     CAMERA LEADING HER as she runs from the oncoming craft.
     PASSING CAMERA to the left, as the chopper passes CAMERA
     RIGHT.

                                             CUT TO:


     TRACKING FAST WITH MULDER

     Beating his way through the corn like Bomba through the
     jungle.

     Matching this action, as Mulder runs toward us. When one
     of the unmarked helicopters BREAKS INTO FRAME in an
     intersecting path, its BEAM passing right over Mulder
     and ILLUMINATING HIM. But while it doesn't slow Mulder
     down, the helicopter maneuvers into a hard banking turn,
     sweeping over the far end of the corn field and heading
     RIGHT BACK AT MULDER - AT US.

                                             CUT TO:


     NEW LOW ANGLE ON EDGE OF CORN FIELD

     Where Mulder bursts out of the perimeter, turning on a
     quick dime and running an out pattern, just before the
     chopper BURSTS into frame overhead, its search beam
     narrowly missing Mulder.

     NEW ANGLE ON MULDER

     Running the corner of the field, looking frantically
     down each corn row until he comes to a stop. No sign
     of:

                            MULDER
               Scully?!

     Mulder reacting to the sound of her response:

                            SCULLY
                      (distant o.s.)
               Mulder!


     NEW ANGLE ON SCULLY

     She's exiting the field behind him. Running toward him,
     and when she gets to him they both break into a run
     across the desert. CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM as they sprint
     away.

     FOLLOWING THEM until they both start to slow. Slowing to
     a stop in the darkness. Turning to see:

     THEIR POV

     The helicopters have disappeared.

     RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY

     Reacting to this.

                            SCULLY
               Where'd they go?

                            MULDER
               I don't know.

     Then they both turn again and continue running. As fast
     as their feet will take them. Back towards the bluff
     where their car is parked.


     EXT. BLUFF OVERLOOKING CORN FIELDS - NIGHT

     Where Mulder and Scully's car is parked. Stillness,
     until Mulder and Scully's heads appear as they climb up
     from the direction of the corn fields. They get in their
     car and start it quickly. Mulder turns the ignition, but
     the car doesn't start immediately. He turns it over and
     over but it won't kick.

     As he does this, unbeknownst to the agents ONE OF THE
     BLACK HELICOPTERS rises up from below the bluff,
     appearing in their rear windshield. Hovering just behind
     the car like a giant bumblebee. Just as...

     ...Mulder gets the car started, throwing the
     transmission in gear and spinning the tires. As they
     head off back in the direction they came, without their
     lights on. As they do this, the black chopper continues
     to hover for a moment, then BANKS OFF AND AWAY. Into the
     night.

     Mulder and Scully speed off in the opposite direction.
     As we:

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. FBI OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW - DAY

     CLOSE ON A FILE

     Being leafed through by a woman's hands. CAMERA TILTING
     UP to Special Agent Cassidy, the woman we met earlier
     running the OPR hearing. She takes a quick glance at her
     watch, looking up when:

     THE DOOR TO THE ROOM

     opens. A beat, then Skinner enters with a wearied look.

                            SKINNER
               She's coming in.

     Skinner ducks his head back out to look at:

                                             INTERCUT WITH:


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OPR HEARING ROOM - DAY

     Where Scully stands looking into the glass of a display
     case, trying to put her hair and clothes and person
     together. She's still in the same clothes we saw her in.
     Seeing Skinner now moving toward him.

     RESUME OPR HEARING ROOM

     Scully enters past Skinner. Though she has straightened
     them, and her hair, there is no mistaking that she's
     been to the dust bowl and back to get here. Her manner
     is chastened.

     Scully tries to keep her eyes on the table where she'll
     be sitting. Venturing only a brief, polite look to:

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE CASSIDY AND THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS

     They reshuffle their papers, pulling up their chairs.
     Ready to get down to business now.

                            CASSIDY
               Special Agent Scully --

                            SCULLY
               I apologize for making you wait --
               I've brought some new evidence with me
               --

                            CASSIDY
               Evidence of what?

     CLOSE PROFILE ON SCULLY

     Reaching into her satchel, pulling out an evidence bag.
     Whatever she's reaching for she's reluctant to present
     with confidence.

                            SCULLY
               These are fossilized bone fragments
               I've been able to study, gathered from
               the bomb site in Dallas...

     As Scully speaks we see A BEE crawl out from under the
     collar of her suit jacket, crawling toward the back of
     her neck. Crawling slowly, as if stretching its legs
     from its long journey. CAMERA DOLLYING around Scully as
     the bee does, moving into an OVER to:

                            CASSIDY
               You've been back to Dallas?

                            SCULLY
               Yes.

                            CASSIDY
               Are you going to let us in on what
               exactly you're trying to prove --

                            SCULLY
               That the bombing in Dallas may have
               been to destroy the bodies of those
               firemen, so their deaths and the
               reason for them wouldn't have to be
               explained --

                            CASSIDY
                      (challenging)
               -- those are very serious allegations,
               Agent Scully --

                            SCULLY
               Yes. I know.

     There is a hush of murmured responses to this, the panel
     members speaking to one another. Assistant Director
     Skinner shifts uneasily in his chair. He's been here
     before with Agents Mulder and Scully. He's sensing
     something outrageous.

                            CASSIDY
               And you have conclusive evidence of
               this? Something to tie this claim of
               yours to the crime --

                            SCULLY
                      (grudgingly)
               Nothing completely conclusive --

     We have returned to the OVER ANGLE on Scully, where we
     see the BEE just below her jacket collar on the back of
     her neck.

     It CRAWLS back under her collar, DISAPPEARING from
     sight.

                            SCULLY
               I hope to. We're working to develop
               this evidence --

                            CASSIDY
               Working with?

                            SCULLY
               Agent Mulder.

     Off Cassidy's knowing nod, a general shifting in chairs,
     we:

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - LATE DAY

     Mulder pushes through the front, scanning the room for:

     ANGLE ON KURTZWEIL

     Sitting at a booth at the dark rear of the
     establishment. Mulder enters frame, sitting down across
     from him. Kurtzweil is jumpy, but he sees from Mulder's
     expression that something's up.

                            KURTZWEIL
               You found something?

                            MULDER
               Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of
               experiment. Something they excavated
               was brought there in tanker trucks.

                            KURTZWEIL
               What?

                            MULDER
               I'm not sure. A virus --

                            KURTZWEIL
               -- You saw this experiment?

                            MULDER
               What did it look like?

                            MULDER
               There were bees. And corn crops.

     Kurtzweil smiles at Mulder, laughs with nervous
     excitement. Mulder doesn't quite realize it yet, but
     this is news to him.

                            MULDER
               What are they?

     Kurtzweil slides from his seat, rising.

                            KURTZWEIL
               What do you think?

                            MULDER
               A transportation system. Transgenic
               crops. The pollen genetically altered
               to carry a virus.

                            KURTZWEIL
               That would be my guess.

                            MULDER
               Your guess?

     But Kurtzweil doesn't respond to this. He's moving
     toward the back of the bar. Mulder slides out, pursuing
     him.

     ANGLE ON BARMAID

     The few PATRONS sitting at the bar, all turning in
     reaction to this sudden flurry of activity.


     INT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     Near the bathrooms. Mulder catches up to Kurtzweil.

                            MULDER
               What do you mean, your guess?

     Kurtzweil doesn't stop. So Mulder must physically stop
     him.

                            MULDER
               You told me you had answers.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Yeah, well I don't have them all.

                            MULDER
               You've been using me --

                            KURTZWEIL
               I've been using you?!

                            MULDER
               You didn't know my father --

                            KURTZWEIL
               I told you -- he and I were old
               friends --

                            MULDER
               You're a liar. You lied to me to
               gather information for you. For your
               goddamn books. Didn't you?

     Mulder is getting heated, rough with Kurtzweil. When,
     unexpectedly A MAN suddenly exits the bathroom. REACTING
     to this scene. Kurtzweil uses the moment to break from
     Mulder. Slipping out the back door. Mulder takes a beat,
     then goes after him.

     Pushing out the back door into the blinding brightness.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - DAY

     Mulder busts out the back door, chasing Kurtzweil.

                            MULDER
               Kurtzweil!

     Kurtzweil turns to him. With restrained ferocity.

                            KURTZWEIL
               You'd be shit out of luck if not for
               me. You saw what you saw because I led
               you to it. I'm putting my ass on the
               line for you.

                            MULDER
               Your ass? I just got chased across
               Texas by two black helicopters.

                            KURTZWEIL
               And why do you think it is you're
               standing here talking to me? These
               people don't make mistakes, Agent
               Mulder.

     And with that he turns now, striding off. Leaving Mulder
     to deal with the excellent logic of this. When suddenly
     Mulder reacts to A NOISE. Somewhere above him.

     MULDER'S POV

     Up on a fire escape, A MAN is moving. Mulder can only
     see his feet and legs from this angle, but it is clear
     he has been watching Mulder. Upon being spotted, the
     figure slides away and disappears.

     ANGLE FROM INSIDE FIRE ESCAPE BUILDING

     We get a glimpse of the man who was watching him. A face
     we recognize as that of the man who brushed past Mulder
     coming out of the vending room, not long before the
     building in Dallas blew. He is moving quickly now,
     disappearing into the shadows. CAMERA TILTING DOWN to
     find:

     MULDER. He stands staring up, but only for a moment
     until he turns and hurries off in the opposite direction
     Kurtzweil disappeared in.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - MAGIC HOUR

     ANGLE OVER MULDER'S DESK at the far end of the living
     room. The sound of keys in the door, then Mulder enters
     his apartment in a hurry. Moving to the desk and going
     at this pace through the drawers. Looking for... A
     PICTURE ALBUM.

     Which he takes now, leafing through it. Flipping the
     pages, looking for:

     ANGLE OVER MULDER

     Finding old pictures of young Fox Mulder with his
     SISTER, Samantha. With his father and mother. The
     plastic-covered page is peeled back and one of these
     photos is removed. It is an old family snapshot. A
     picnic possibly.

     Mulder stares at the picture.

     INSERT PHOTO - In the b.g. of the picnic, his head
     turned to camera, is a young KURTZWEIL.

     Mulder studies the photo intensely, when there's a KNOCK
     at his door. Mulder turning to see:

     SCULLY

     In his haste, Mulder had neglected to lock his door.
     Scully is pushing it open. She's still in the same
     clothes. She looks beat. Her eyes meeting Mulder's. A
     gaze that says bad news.

                            MULDER
               What? What's wrong?

                            SCULLY
               Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer
               effective immediately.

     Mulder is shaking his head. Not wanting to hear this.

                            SCULLY
               I already gave Skinner my letter of
               resignation.

                            MULDER
               You can't quit, Scully.

                            SCULLY
               I can, Mulder. I debated whether or
               not to even tell you in person,
               because I knew --

                            MULDER
               We're close to something here -- we're
               on the verge --

                            SCULLY
               You're on the verge, Mulder -- please
               don't do this to me --

                            MULDER
               After what you saw last night -- after
               all you've seen -- you can't just walk
               away --

                            SCULLY
               I have. I did. It's done.

                            MULDER
               Just like that --

                            SCULLY
               I'm contacting the state board Monday
               to file medical reinstatement papers
               --

                            MULDER
               I need you on this, Scully --

                            SCULLY
               You don't Mulder -- you've never
               needed me. I've only held you back.
                      (beat)
               I've got to go.

     And with that she exits his apartment, the argument too
     painful, and her ability to be persuaded too clear to
     herself.


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     WIDE ANGLE FROM END OF HALL where we see Scully,
     leaving Mulder's apartment. Moving at a hurried clip to
     the elevator -- TOWARD CAMERA. As if anticipating her
     own impulse to turn around and go back. As she moves
     into f.g. Mulder exits his apt. door.

                            MULDER
               You're wrong --

     He hurries to catch her. As she turns on him.

                            SCULLY
               Why was I assigned to you? To debunk
               your work. To reign you in. To shut
               you down.

                            MULDER
               You saved me, Scully.
                      (off her look)
               As different and frustrating as it's
               been sometimes, your goddamn strict
               rationalism and science have saved me
               a thousand times; have kept me honest
               and made me whole. I owe you so much,
               Scully, and you owe me nothing.
                      (beat)
               I don't want to do this without you. I
               don't know if I can. If I quit now,
               they win.

     She is silent, moved. In spite of all her desire not to
     be. She moves to Mulder, holds him. They break slightly
     and she looks up at Mulder with deep respect, admiration
     and... kisses him on the forehead. When...

     ...suddenly a physical intimacy we've never seen. A
     heat and passion that can't be denied. The opportunity
     for the inevitable has presented itself.

     The moment of truth has arrived. Mulder is staring at
     Scully as she's looking back at him. His head moves
     slightly toward hers -- as one of his hands moves up to
     her neck, drawing her to him. Where there is hesitation
     on her part, there is also desire. When:

                            SCULLY
               OUCH!!!

     Scully pulls away from Mulder, RUBBING at her neck where
     his hand had been.

                            MULDER
               What? What happened?

                            SCULLY
               I think... something stung me.

     Scully's hand comes out with THE SQUIRMING BEE, which
     she holds in her hand while Mulder moves around her,
     checking her neck.

                            MULDER
               It must...

     But he doesn't finish his sentence before he has to
     catch Scully from falling. Her head bobs and she has to
     catch it.

                            MULDER
               Scully...

                            SCULLY
               Something's wrong...
                      (fighting for clarity)
               I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my
               chest. My... motor functions are being
               affected. I'm...

     Mulder lays her down on the floor during this. Scully
     continues to speak, though her eyes are not focusing.
     She is limp in Mulder's arms.

                            SCULLY
               ...my pulse feels thready and I've
               got a funny taste in the back of my
               throat.

                            MULDER
               I think you're in anaphylactic shock
               --

                            SCULLY
               No -- it's --

     Her voice is getting thin now, too.

                            MULDER
               Scully --

                            SCULLY
               I've got no allergy. Something...
               this... Mulder... I think... I think
               you should call an ambulance.

     And Mulder is on his feet in a flash, running for:

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     CLOSE OVER PHONE as Mulder races into the apartment,
     dashing TOWARD CAMERA, picking up the receiver, dialing.
     HOLDING ON THE PHONE during this action. TILTING UP
     for:

                            MULDER
               This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I
               have an emergency -- I have an agent
               down --


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     SCULLY - HANDHELD

     Picked up and one-two-three loaded on a gurney by TWO
     PARAMEDICS.

                            1ST PARAMEDIC
               Can you hear me? Can you say your
               name?

     Scully is trying, but the words won't come out.

                            1ST PARAMEDIC
               She's got constriction in the throat
               and larynx -- are you breathing okay?

     He lays his head down to her mouth.

                            1ST PARAMEDIC
               Passages are open. Let's get her in
               the van --

     NEIGHBORS are in the hall now, along with Mulder. Who is
     moving beside the Paramedics as they hustle the gurney
     down the hall.

                            1ST PARAMEDIC
               Coming through people -- here we go.
               Coming through --

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUED HAND HELD

     The Paramedics bang out the front door, stutter-stepping
     the gurney down to the walk, to their EMT VAN which sits
     at the curb with the LIGHT BAR FLASHING. Mulder
     following close by.

                            MULDER
               She said she had a taste in the back
               of her throat -- there was no
               pre-existing allergy to bee-stings --
               the bee that stung her may have been
               carrying a virus --

                            2ND PARAMEDIC
               A virus?

                            1ST PARAMEDIC
               Get on the radio, tell them we have a
               cytogenic reaction, we need an advise
               and administer --

     They get her to the back of the vehicle, guiding the
     gurney in with experienced hands. Scully's eyes are on
     Mulder as she's slid into the brightly lit interior.

     The 1st Paramedic blocks Mulder somewhat as he steps
     toward the van, anticipating that he's going with them
     to the hospital. But the doors are closing on him before
     he gets an opportunity.

     FOLLOWING MULDER around to the driver's side of the van
     now, moving to the driver's window where THE DRIVER can
     be seen in the rear view mirror, his eyes watching
     Mulder.

     ON MULDER

     A moment of vague recognition -- a catch in his step.

     RESUME

     As Mulder's momentum carries him to the driver's window
     where se see again the man from the vending room, who
     was also surveilling Mulder. And he has a HANDGUN
     pointed at Mulder, which he FIRES THROUGH THE WINDOW.
     The glass shattering.

     RESUME MULDER

     Throwing himself away backward, but the bullet catches
     him in the head. Blood and glass spraying onto the side
     of the van. He goes down to the ground -- as the
     paramedic van accelerates fast away.

     LOW ANGLE REVERSE ON MULDER

     Lying in the street, his head bleeding profusely. While
     in the b.g., A SECOND AMBULANCE IS SPEEDING TO THE
     SCENE. As it skids to a stop and TWO NEW PARAMEDICS jump
     out, we:

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

     A MEDIUM SIZED PRIVATE JET is taxiing down an alley off
     the main runway where a 747 is speeding toward takeoff.
     The private jet turning TOWARD CAMERA and nosing into
     f.g.

     NEW ANGLE ON TARMAC

     Where MEN IN FAMILIAR BLACK FATIGUES are unloading
     something from an unmarked cube truck that is also
     familiar: the very high tech-looking CLEAR CONTAINER,
     with its monitors and gauges, its oxygen tanks and
     refrigeration unit. A self-contained life support
     system. The inside of the container is covered with a
     thin layer of frost, through which we can see AGENT
     SCULLY.

     She lies as if in a state of paralysis, but a blink of
     her eyes is enough to tell us that she is... alive.

     TRACKING WITH THE MEN moving the container. As they
     hustle it to the waiting jet. As The Cigarette Smoking
     Man is descending the steps of the plane onto the
     tarmac. Watching as the container is moved to the cargo
     hold and loaded inside.

     The hold is closed and the jet engines wind back up. As
     the Cigarette Smoking Man reboards the aircraft and it
     taxis away.

     FADE SLOWLY TO BLACK


     INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Voices fade in slowly, inaudible at first. For regular
     viewers of the show, they will recognize the voices of
     the Lone Gunmen.

     Three nerdish paranoiacs who publish a magazine which
     charts and cataloged conspiracies past and present,
     among other government malfeasance. They are Langly,
     Byers and Frohike.

                            BYERS
               I think he's coming out --

                            LANGLY
               He's coming to.

                            FROHIKE
               Hey, Mulder...

     FADE UP, as if our eyes are blinking open. We are in
     Mulder's POV, and the face right above us is Frohike's.

                            FROHIKE
               Mulder...?

     Behind Frohike, looking down at Mulder, are Byers and
     Langly.

     REVERSE ON MULDER

     Staring at the diminutive Frohike, the long-haired
     Langly and the courtly Byers with dawning recognition.

                            MULDER
               Oh god...

                            LANGLY
               What's wrong?

                            MULDER
                      (to Byers, then Langly)
               Tin Man. Scarecrow.
                      (to Frohike)
               Toto.

     Mulder sits up now, rubbing his face, feeling the
     BANDAGE he's got on his head.

                            MULDER
               What am I doing here?

                            BYERS
               You were shot in the head. The bullet
               broke the flesh on your right brow and
               glanced off your temporal plate.

                            MULDER
                      (woozy)
               Penetration but not perforation.

                            LANGLY
               Three centimetres to the left and we'd
               be playing the harp.

     Mulder is still shaking out the cobwebs.

                            BYERS
               They gave you a craniotomy to relieve
               the pressure from a subdural hematoma.
               But you've been unconscious since they
               brought you in.

                            MULDER
               When was that?

                            FROHIKE
               Two days ago. Your guy Skinner's been
               here with you around the clock.

                            LANGLY
               We got the news and made a trip to
               your apartment. Found a bug in your
               phone line.

                            FROHIKE
               And one in your hall.

     Byers holds up the first small device. Frohike holds up
     a vial containing A BEE. Mulder realizing:

                            MULDER
               Scully had a violent reaction to a bee
               sting --

                            BYERS
               You called 911. Except the call was
               intercepted.

                            MULDER
                      (sitting up)
               They took her --

     Mulder pushes the covers off. Swinging his legs to the
     ground. As A.D. Skinner enters the room. Surprised to
     see Mulder up.

                            SKINNER
               Agent Mulder --

                            MULDER
               Where's Scully?!

     As he says this he loses his balance slightly, has to
     hold onto one of the Gunmen. Struggling with his
     faculties.

                            SKINNER
               She's missing. We've been unable to
               locate her or the vehicle they took
               her in.

                            MULDER
               Whoever they are -- this goes right
               back to Dallas -- it goes right back
               to the bombing --

                            SKINNER
               I know.
                      (off Mulder's reaction to
                      this)
               Agent Scully reported your suspicions
               to OPR. On the basis of her report, I
               sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's
               apartment. They picked up PSTN
               residues on his personal effects
               consistent with the construction of
               the vending machine device in Dallas.

                            MULDER
                      (reeling)
               How deep does this go?

                            SKINNER
               I don't know.

     Mulder sees A MAN IN A SUIT passes by the small window
     in the door, casting a furtive glance in, then moving
     off. He turns his look back to Skinner.

                            MULDER
               Are we being watched?

                            SKINNER
               I'm not taking any chances.

     Mulder nods. Pulling now at the bandage on his head.
     Peeling it away and revealing the wound beneath.

                            MULDER
               I need your clothes, Byers.

                            BYERS
               Me?

                            SKINNER
               What are you doing?

                            MULDER
               I've got to find Scully.

                            FROHIKE
               Do you know where she is?

                            MULDER
               No. But I know someone who might have
               an answer. Who better.

     Mulder is undoing his hospital gown now, his white buns
     gracing the screen for the first time in history. As he
     ducks into the bathroom. As the men left standing in the
     room all look to Byers, reluctantly removing his duds.
     Off this:

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

     ANGLE OVER MAN IN A SUIT standing with his back to
     Mulder's room, reading a section of a newspaper (the
     rest of the paper sitting on a chair, as if the man's
     possibly set up here.) As the door to Mulder's room
     opens in the b.g. and Frohike appears.

     Frohike keeps his eyes on the Man as Langly appears now,
     followed by...Byers? We can't see clearly as the other
     two block our POV and the third man out doesn't show us
     his face. The threesome starts down the hall, their
     footsteps drawing the attention of the Man in a Suit.

     ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE OTHER GUNMEN

     As they head TOWARD CAMERA. Walking at a pace. In the
     b.g. the Man in the Suit is drifting toward Mulder's
     hospital room.

     ANGLE ON MAN IN SUIT

     Suspicious. He moves to the door, looks in the little
     glass window. Seeing...Byers, the sheets pulled up to
     his nose to hide his beard and mustache. Skinner
     standing next to him, talking on the phone.

     The Man in the Suit looking down to the end of the hall
     again.

     RESUME ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE GUNMEN

     As Mulder and his two flankers MOVE RIGHT TO CAMERA.
     Mulder is taking a cell phone being handed to him by
     Frohike. Dialing on the move.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY BEHIND DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT

     A FIGURE appears at the end of the alley, moving toward
     us. It could be Mulder from this distance, but as the
     figure comes closer we recognize him as Kurtzweil.
     Moving into the f.g., checking behind him, ahead of him.
     Jumpy.

     He takes a cautious beat, then moves to the door leading
     into the bar (established), reaching for the knob.
     Opening it, finding the Well-Manicured Man standing
     there.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Dr. Kurtzweil, isn't it? Dr. Alvin
               Kurtzweil?

                            KURTZWEIL
               Jesus Christ.

     Kurtzweil is shaken by the sight of this man.
     Backpedaling a bit, looking around and behind him for an
     ambush.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               You're surprised. Certainly you've
               been expecting some response to your
               indiscretion.

     The W.M.M. steps out of the doorway, following
     Kurtzweil.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               I'm quite sure whatever you told Agent
               Mulder, you have your good reason.
               It's a weakness in men our age; the
               urge to confess.
                      (stopping his walk)
               I forgive you that.

     Kurtzweil is thrown by the words, and the delivery.
     Stopping his backward progress. Studying this upright
     and civil man.

                            KURTZWEIL
               What are you doing here? What do you
               want from me?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               You must try to understand, what I'm
               here to do is only to protect my
               children. You and I have but short
               lives left. I can only hope the same
               isn't true for them.

     On this note, Kurtzweil turns and hoofs it back in the
     direction from which he came. TRACKING BACK WITH HIM
     until HEADLIGHTS hit his face.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     A TOWN CAR has pulled into the alley behind him.
     Accelerating fast down the narrow corridor. Effectively
     trapping Kurtzweil in. As he squints into its
     headlights, then turns back with fear in his eyes to the
     W.M.M.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT

     Where a figure is coming down the street toward us.

     Running, it's Mulder, going balls out. Running to the
     entrance of the bar and yanking open the door.


     INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT

     Moderately crowded as Mulder enters, stopping to catch
     his breath. Moving to the back of the bar. Looking for:

     THE BOOTH WHERE HE MET KURTZWEIL EARLIER

     It's empty.

     RESUME MULDER

     Moving through the bar -- real panic in his expression.
     He heads to the back.


     INT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder passing the bathrooms, moving to the door where
     we saw the Well-Manicured Man standing just a short bit
     ago. But there is no one back here now. Mulder moves to
     the back door, the one leading to the alley, pushing it
     open and finding:

     The Well-Manicured Man stands with HIS DRIVER closing
     the trunk on the idling Town Car (which has been turned
     around.) The W.M.M. turns to see:

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Mr. Mulder.

                            MULDER
               What happened to Kurtzweil?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               He's come and gone.

     The W.M.M. moves to Mulder, who doesn't trust him for a
     second. Mulder is still breathing hard, sizing up this
     scene.

                            MULDER
               Where's Scully?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               I have answers for you.

                            MULDER
               Is she alive?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Yes.

     Mulder stares at the W.M.M. - measuring him.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               I'm quite prepared to tell you
               everything, though there isn't much
               you haven't guessed.

                            MULDER
               About the conspiracy?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               I think of it as an agreement. A word
               your father liked to use.

                            MULDER
               I want to know where Scully is.

     The Well-Manicured Man suddenly reaches into his jacket
     pocket, without warning or explanation. Mulder tensing
     slightly. He removes a thin felt envelope.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               The location of Agent Scully. And the
               means to save her life.
                      (off Mulder's look)
               Please...

     He gestures toward the car where the Driver stands with
     the back door open. Mulder hesitates, then steps from
     the doorway. Moving past the W.M.M., sliding in. The
     W.M.M. gets in after him, closes the door. The car pulls
     away.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     WE SEE MULDER in the back seat, reflected in the
     rear-view mirror. Where we also see the eyes of the
     DRIVER watching him. Mulder is handed the felt envelope
     by the W.M.M.

                            MULDER
               What is it?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               A weak vaccine against the virus Agent
               Scully has been infected with. It must
               be administered with ninety six
               hours.

                            MULDER
                      (beat)
               You're lying.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               No. Though I have no way to prove
               otherwise. The virus is
               extraterrestrial. We know very little
               about it, except that it is the
               original inhabitant of this planet.

                            MULDER
                      (dubious, to say the least)
               A virus?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What
               is a virus but a colonizing force that
               cannot be defeated? Living in a cave,
               underground, until it mutates. And
               attacks.

                            MULDER
               This is what you've been conspiring to
               conceal? A disease?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               No! For God sake you've got it all
               backwards.

     This outburst comes suddenly, unexpectedly.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Aids, the ebola virus -- on the
               evolutionary scale they are newborns.
               This virus walked the planet long
               before the dinosaurs.

                            MULDER
               What do you mean, walked?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little
               green men, first landed here millions
               of years ago. Those that didn't leave
               have been laying dormant underground
               since the last Ice Age. In the form of
               an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be
               reconstituted when the alien race from
               which it came returns to colonize the
               planet. Using us as hosts. Against
               this we have no defense. Nothing but a
               weak vaccine.
                      (beat)
               Do you see why it was kept secret? Why
               even the best men -- men like your
               father -- could not let the truth be
               known?

     The force and conviction of his delivery leave Mulder
     shaken.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Until Dallas, we believed the virus
               was simply a controlling organism.
               That mass infection would make us a
               slave race.

                            MULDER
               That's why you bombed the building.
               The infected firemen, the boy --

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Imagine our surprise when they began
               to gestate. My group has been working
               cooperatively with the alien
               colonists, facilitating their
               programs. To give us access to the
               virus. In false hope we might be able
               to secretly find a cure. So that we
               might save ourselves, as the last of
               the species.
                      (beat)
               Your father wisely refused to believe
               this, choosing hope over selfishness.
               Hope is the only future he had: his
               children,
                      (beat, then self-revealing)
               The only future any of us have.

     This draws a look back in the mirror from the Driver.

                            MULDER
               But... he sacrificed his own daughter.
               My sister, Samantha.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               The only true survivors of the viral
               holocaust will be those immune to it:
               those vaccinated against it and
               human/alien hybrids. Your father
               arranged for your sister's abduction.
               He allowed her to be taken to an alien
               hybrid program, so that she would
               survive. As a clone.
                      (beat)
               He had different hopes for you. That
               you would uncover the truth about the
               Project. That you would stop it. That
               you would fight the future.

     Mulder sits stunned by this. As if somehow his destiny
     has been validated, if not pre-ordained. Or maybe just
     justified.

                            MULDER
               Why are you telling me this?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               I thought it only fair you should
               know, given how hard you've worked.

                            MULDER
               What happened to Kurtzweil?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               As your father knew, things need to be
               sacrificed to the future.

                            MULDER
               Where is he?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.

     Mulder stares at the W.M.M., at his cold-blooded
     expression.

                            MULDER
               Let me out. Stop the car.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
                      (motioning)
               Driver.

     Mulder reaching to this as the limo pulls to a stop.
     Trying the door, but the door is locked. When he turns
     back to the W.M.M. he has produced a handgun, which is
     now pointing at Mulder. Laid casually across a folded
     arm. Mulder reacts on seeing it.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               The men I work with will stop at
               nothing to clear the way for what they
               believe is their stake in the
               inevitable future. I was ordered to
               kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action to
               protect my grandchildren's lives.
                      (beat)
               I might just as easily kill you.

     Mulder is recoiling as he says this. Then, without
     hesitation in one quick move, he SHOOTS the Driver in
     the head.

     The blood spattering on the front windshield -- and on
     Mulder who has barely had a chance to react.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Trust no one, Mr. Mulder.

     Mulder looks at The Well-Manicured Man, expecting to be
     next. And for a moment, we do too. But the W.M.M. simply
     opens the door and steps out of the car. Holding the
     door open for Mulder who is still frozen by the actions
     that went just before.


     EXT. DESOLATE D.C. STREET - NIGHT

     Mulder steps out of the car, holding the felt envelope.
     The Well-Manicured Man stands with a sober, intense
     look.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
                      (with quiet force)
               You have precious little time. What
               I've given you the alien colonists
               have no idea exists. You hold in your
               hand the power to end the project.

                            MULDER
               How?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               The vaccine you hold is the only
               defense against the virus. Its
               introduction into an alien environment
               may have the power to destroy the
               delicate plans we've so assiduously
               protected for the last fifty years.
                      (beat)
               Or it may not.

                            MULDER
               What alien environment?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her
               science can save the future.

                            MULDER
               What about you?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               My life is over.
                      (beat)
               Go.

     Mulder stands speechless for a moment. Until the W.M.M.
     points the weapon he's still holding at him.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Go now!

     And Mulder does. Moving away from the car, looking back
     over his shoulder. As the Well-Manicured Man gets back
     into the limousine, closes the door. A moment later...
     THE CAR EXPLODES INTO FLAMES, knocking Mulder to the
     ground.

     ANGLE ON MULDER

     The felt envelope has been jarred from his grasp. Its
     contents loosed from inside: a piece of paper with
     COORDINATES on it and an AMPULE and SYRINGE.

     Mulder gets up, looks back. Then he picks up the
     envelope and its contents -- and begins to run. Running
     as fast as he can go. Until, far down the block, he
     disappears.

     As the SCREEN DISSOLVES TO WHITENESS -- under which we
     hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. The
     same sound that opened our story.

     Then there is movement, as the curvilinear line of a
     horizon becomes visible, bi-secting the screen between
     the white of the earth and the white of the sky. We
     are:


     EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA

     Across the expanse of whiteness, a DARK IMAGE appears on
     the long flat horizon. Moving toward us. As a LEGEND
     appears, to establish.

     CLOSER ON A SNOW TRACTOR

     Crawling across the harsh frozen land like a domed
     insect.


     INT. SNOW TRACTOR

     Agent Mulder sits behind the controls of the enclosed
     cabin, several days growth on his face. Dressed in
     thick, bundled outerwear. He maneuvers the vehicle to a
     stop. Reaching for a handheld GPS monitor to check his
     position. Catching his breath for a moment -- all
     movement is exertion in this climate. Mulder stares hard
     out the front window, the wipers beating time, but there
     is nothing out there but whiteness. He wipes the fog
     from a side window with his gloved hand, seeing nothing
     but more whiteness. Checking the GPS device again, then
     reaching for the door latch.

     RESUME WIDE EXTERIOR

     Agent Mulder exits the vehicle, hopping down onto the
     snowscape crust. Setting out on foot with the GPS device
     held before him. In this forbidding environment he might
     as well be taking a space walk -- without the security
     of a lifeline. Which is the impression we get as his
     tiny figure trudges across the ice, increasing the
     distance between himself and the snow tractor.

     MOVING WITH MULDER

     Up a gentle grade, the snow tractor now behind him.
     Moving into tight f.g. where he stops, seeing something
     now which allows him to pocket the GPS device. Dropping
     instinctively to his knees, so as to avoid being seen
     by:

     MULDER'S POV

     In the distance is an ICE STATION. A row of
     interconnecting WHITE DOME TENTS, whose design is now
     familiar to us. There are what look like snow tractors
     and other snow vehicles parked alongside the
     structures.

     RESUME MULDER

     Pulling a compact pair of binoculars from one of his
     deep jacket pockets. Training them on:

     THE ICE STATION - BINO MATTE

     PANNING across the domes and vehicles, where there is no
     sign of personnel -- until MULDER PANS off the building,
     finding in his field glasses AN APPROACHING SNOW
     TRACTOR. Moving across the landscape toward the ice
     station. When it pulls to a stop, A MAN exits out of one
     of the domes: THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN. Moving to the
     vehicle and getting in.

     The vehicle reverses now, transporting the CSM back
     away from the ice station.

     CLOSE ON MULDER

     Taking the field glasses away from his eyes. The
     excitement he feels expressed now in his breathing,
     which has become harder and shallower. Mulder rises,
     beginning to move the still great distance between
     himself and the ice station.

                                             CUT TO:


     WIDE ON SCREEN

     Mulder moving slowly across the white horizon toward the
     domed tents.


     LOW ANGLE ON MULDER'S FEET

     Moving cautiously, and with effort on the snowscape
     crust. CAMERA RISING up to Mulder's face, determined and
     watchful.


     FOLLOWING MULDER

     The ice station still several hundred yards in the
     distance, when MULDER SUDDENLY FALLS OUT OF FRAME,
     disappearing into a hole in the snowscape crust that
     just moments earlier had been stable footing.

                                             HARD CUT TO:


     INT. SNOW ICE BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS

     Where Mulder's body falls through a ceiling of snowscape
     crust, landing on his back with a THUD on a hard
     surface. It takes him a moment to catch his breath,
     somewhat reminiscent of Stevie at the beginning of the
     picture. Wincing through the pain. Until he turns over,
     regaining his wits, and his bearings.

     NEW ANGLE

     Mulder has fallen on a hard, narrow metallic structure.
     Its dull black color a stark contrast to the white ice
     it's encased in. The bubble has been created by air
     coming out of vents in the structure, carving out
     corresponding patterns in the ceiling; softening the ice
     and snow above.

     CLOSER ON MULDER

     rising to his knees, the AIR from one of these vents
     blowing onto his face. Pulling off the hood of his
     jacket, looking deep into the vent which is open,
     ungrated.

     And big enough for a man to crawl into. Which, after
     considering the hole he's fallen through high above him,
     is really Mulder's only choice.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. RIBBED CORRIDOR DUCT - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder pulls himself forward through the ribbed corridor
     duct with his elbows, moving lizard-like into the
     constricted darkness.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

     Above a frozen ice lith, Mulder's head appears,
     squeezing his shoulders and body out of a venting. With
     effort, Mulder slides out of the small space, using some
     architecture above as a handhold. Pulling his legs free
     and dropping onto the floor.

     MULDER'S POV

     It is dark in here, the features of the corridor
     ill-defined.

     RESUME MULDER - WIDER

     Mulder pulls a flashlight from a pocket in his parka,
     snicks it on. Its beam reflecting off tall frozen liths
     of ice regularly spaced on both sides of the corridor.

     NEW ANGLE ON MULDER

     Training the light down the corridor, which curves away
     in both directions. Then pointing it at something right
     in front of his nose: something that gives him a start.

     Reaching up with his hand to brush away frost from the
     lith. Finding A MAN FROZEN IN ICE. Naked, his eyes
     staring into some long-forgotten distance. His hair is
     dark, his flat features familiar to us. He is the
     prehistoric hunter from the opening scenes of the movie.
     His flesh has the opaque, see-through quality that we've
     seen before. Inside of which, frozen along with the man,
     is an EMBRYONIC CREATURE.

     REVERSE ON MULDER

     Reacting to this sight, then moving off down the
     corridor, his pace quickened.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA

     LOW ANGLE on the great white expanse. Across which a
     snow tractor is moving. PANNING with the vehicle to...

     Mulder's snow tractor, where the first tractor stops,
     its headlights trained on Mulder's ride.

     A beat, then the discovering machine moves out again,
     following the tracks that Mulder has left, which brings
     it STRAIGHT TOWARD CAMERA. As it passes us, we can see
     the DRIVER and the Cigarette Smoking Man sitting in the
     cabin. As we:

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

     MULDER comes to the end of the dim ice corridor where
     soft light is penetrating through several low, arched
     openings.

     Mulder has to drop down to his knees to see into the
     openings.

     ANGLE FROM OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BALCONY PASSAGEWAY

     Where Mulder is seen looking TOWARD CAMERA. The Balcony
     passageway is short. Mulder drops to his stomach again,
     pulling himself through, toward us. When he reaches the
     opposite end, Mulder pokes his head out, looking up in
     wonder at:


     INT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON
     A STADIUM-SIZED DOME -- (CGI SET EXTENSION)

     Imagine a domed sports arena -- this is the scope and
     scale of the space that Mulder has penetrated. We see
     him as only a small speck on a balcony midway between
     floor and ceiling. Pulling himself out of the balcony
     passageway, which is like countless other passageways.
     Which are actually ventilation ports.

     ANGLE OVER MULDER

     Pulling himself to his feet. Beholding the space before
     him. Looking down to the center floor where a large
     central theater gives off a light different from
     elsewhere in the dome. An icy, bright glow. Leading down
     to the central theater far below are several LARGE
     TUBULAR SPOKES. (One of which leads up right next to
     Mulder's position.)

     ANGLE ON MULDER

     Reacting to this. Then something captures his
     attention.

     MULDER'S POV

     There on the floor, far down below, is THE BUBBLE LITTER
     Scully was transported in. (NOTE* Scully's clothes are
     still in the bubble litter.) Standing out as a rather
     human artifact against the otherwise dull gray bulwarks
     and architecture surrounding it.


     INT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON
     MULDER

     looks beside him where the joint that connects two
     sections of one of the long tube spokes is designed with
     an allowance -- a separation that might allow a man to
     slip through the joint into the tube. Which is what
     Mulder does here.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. TUBULAR SPOKE - CONTINUOUS

     WIDE ANGLE FROM INSIDE TUBE TERMINUS

     Mulder squeezing through into the tube, looking down
     past what looks like a chair lift-like track, on which
     the chairs are actually empty cryopod mechanisms; the
     same structures Mulder saw in the ribbed corridor in
     which bodies were encased in ice. Except these cryopods
     are empty.

     Mulder begins to creep down TOWARD CAMERA, picking his
     way around the empty cryopods.

     REVERSE ANGLE ON MULDER

     Creeping away from us. Heading toward:


     INT. LOWER CRYOPOD CORRIDOR

     Where Mulder pops out at the lower tube terminus. Which
     leads into this bulwarked corridor at the base of the
     large stadium structure. Where:

     REVERSE ON THIS CORRIDOR

     Where Mulder is walking past frozen CRYOPODS hanging on
     a track. Each icy pod containing a HUMAN BODY frozen
     within. Partially visible behind clear blue ice. But
     these are modern men, and women. Their expressions a
     confused horror, as if they have been somehow frozen
     alive. They are slowly tracking.

     Walking along the slowly moving carousel of frozen
     humanity. Stopping, turning, almost as if having
     sensed:

     NEW ANGLE OVER OPPOSITE CRYOPOD

     PUSHING IN ON MULDER'S FACE. Recording the horror and
     fear he's experiencing, on seeing:

     CAMERA RISING UP A FROSTY WALL OF BLUE ICE

     Where a woman's body is encased, its naked features
     hidden behind the opacity of the newly frozen blue
     crust. But whose face is unmistakable as that of Agent
     Scully's. Frozen in a similar expression of far-away
     horror, her eyes cast slightly heavenward.

     MULDER

     hurries to get his jacket unzipped. Removing the FELT
     ENVELOPE, removing the syringe body, the needle and the
     AMPULE.

     Hastily putting the syringe together, getting the needle
     poked into the soft rubber cap of the ampule. Bleeding
     the syringe now, the substance inside squirting out of
     the end of the needle onto the floor of the ship.

     And the moment it does, the whole floor SIZZLES like
     water being dropped onto a hot skillet. Spreading out
     from Mulder in every direction. A VIOLENT CHEMICAL
     REACTION, as predicted by the man who gave him this
     substance. A moment later the entire structure Mulder is
     in SHUNTS. Shuddering violently and setting up a low-end
     RUMBLE. Causing Mulder to accidentally drop the
     syringe.

     LOW CLOSE ANGLE

     on the floor, where the syringe hits and bounces, but
     does not break or leak. Mulder scrambling into frame to
     re-collect it. Seeing the floor where the liquid from
     the syringe hit -- where it has been ETCHED AWAY by the
     substance.


     EXT. HULL OF SPACESHIP/ICY BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS

     Where Mulder crawled into the duct. Condensed air is
     streaming out of all the ducts now. The ice and snow
     above beginning to melt from the force and heat of the
     blasting all.

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     EXT. ICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

     We can hear low end rumble and vibration. TWO DOZEN MEN
     are streaming out of the dome tents. Moving to their
     carious snow tractors and starting the vehicles.

     A small exodus, the tractors pulling out of camp in a
     rush. Heading off in various directions.

     CAMERA FINDING THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN moving to his
     tractor, with THE MAN WHO SHOT MULDER. Taking the last
     drag of his cigarette before throwing it into the snow.
     He stares down at it a moment, as if caught in the grip
     of some emotion conflicting with duty.

     The Man who shot Mulder inside the tractor now, throwing
     open the door for the CSM.

                            MAN WHO SHOT MULDER
               C'mon. It's all going to hell.

     He climbs up onto the vehicle, gets in and closes the
     door. And the vehicle pulls away as we:

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     INT. LOWER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS - AGENT MULDER

     Back on his feet, SMASHING now at the crust of brittle
     blue-ice that encases Scully. BASHING, SMASHING and then
     finally breaking through the hard outer later, its inner
     slushy contents spilling out of the puncture that
     exposes Scully's face and shoulder. Watery aqua-tinted
     liquid drains from her mouth and nose. But Scully is not
     conscious, and there is no indication she is even alive,
     her face frozen in a blank, almost beatific expression.

     OVER MULDER TO SCULLY

     As he plunges the needle into Scully's arm at the front
     of her shoulder. To which there is an immediate reaction
     -- as if given a shot of adrenalin. Her eyes blinking
     away the cold moisture.

                            MULDER
               Scully --

     Scully's lips move goldfish-like as she tries to suck in
     air, an almost fearful expression overcoming her like a
     swimmer who's been held under too long. But no words are
     coming out yet.

                            MULDER
               Breathe -- can you breathe?!

     Scully is straining to do just that -- when liquid
     suddenly SPEWS from Scully's mouth. And she begins to
     cough and gag -- taking big gulps of air as her eyes
     focus on Mulder as if on a phantom, or a miracle.

     Finally faint words ushering forth, whispering breaths
     that Mulder cannot discern.

                            MULDER
               What?

     CLOSE ON MULDER AND SCULLY

     As he leans into her, putting his ear up to her mouth.
     As the softest sound comes out in Scully's frosty
     breath.

                            SCULLY
               Cold...

                            MULDER
               Hang on. I'm going to get you out of
               here.

     As she continues to suck air.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. HULL OF SPACESHIP/ICE BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS

     The hot air blasting from the ducts is causing the ice
     pack above to melt and collapse.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. ICE STATION - CONTINUOUS - WIDE

     As the ice tractors head away in all directions from the
     domed structures. A misty fog now emanating from the
     seams of the domes. Heat and condensation.

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS

     Filling with misty condensation, too. The small beams of
     light that lighted Mulder's way earlier are now small
     shafts piercing the gathering interior cloud.
     Illuminating:


     THE PREHISTORIC MAN

     Frozen in his icy pod, the hard semi-translucent surface
     of which is now etched with small streams of water
     running to the floor. Everything is melting and in
     motion.

     Including the CREATURE which is vaguely visible inside
     the frozen man. It TURNS slightly inside the body, like
     an animal in utero. Its eyes now looking at us,
     blinking. As it presses against its own fleshy
     container, the body of its human host.

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     INT. LOWER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

     It, too, is filling with misty condensation.

     VARIOUS SHOTS

     Of the ice encasing the human forms sweating and
     melting.

     CAMERA ADJUSTING UP TO REVEAL Mulder pulling Scully
     along in a fireman's carry. She is dressed now in
     Mulder's snow parka and the outer nylon pants he was
     wearing. Scully's legs are weak beneath her. Her body
     limp, but not lifeless. Mulder laboring to get her up
     the INTERIOR of the steep curving cylinder spoke, as the
     air fills with mist.


     INT. LONG TUBE TERMINUS

     NEW ANGLE ON MULDER AND SCULLY - LOOKING DOWN THE TUBE

     Moving toward along the now-halted cryopod carrier
     hanging from the transport track. Mulder struggling
     against his own fading energy, pulling Scully up
     toward:


     ANGLE ON BALCONY/CATWALK

     Mulder pushing Scully up, though she seems to have at
     least some limited ability to do this on her own. The
     DEEP, LOW RUMBLE we heard in the open frames of the
     movie reaching full volume now. The whole environment
     vibrating as Mulder boosts Scully up on the catwalk.
     Climbing up over the prostrate body. Picking her up from
     the floor, pulling her back into the fireman's carry.


     INT. LOWER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

     Where the bodies are all beginning to melt.

     VARIOUS SHOTS of rivulets of water forming on the
     icy liths that encase the bodies. The water from them
     seeping onto the circular central floor. The condensing
     mist thick and swirling.

     CLOSE ON PODS

     Where the body it houses seems to move. Though AS CAMERA
     PUSHES IN we see that it is the creature inside this
     body moving, as if the heat and the defrosting are
     bringing the embryos to life.


     INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE DOWN
     CORRIDOR

     Scully's head pokes through now, as she's pushed through
     the opening that Mulder used earlier to get into the
     vaulted arena. Pushed in fits and starts until she's all
     the way through. Mulder now straining and squeezing to
     do the same on his own.

     The corridor is filled with heavy condensed mist now as
     Mulder finally slips out of the low passageway, trying
     to get his bearing now as he huddles low over Scully.
     Turning his attention to her as she COUGHS HOARSELY --
     in some kind of acute spasm of pain -- but alive.

                            MULDER
               We've got to keep moving.

                            SCULLY
                      (weakly)
               Where are we?

                            MULDER
               You got me. But I think I know what
               they did with Jimmy Hoffa.

     Scully is struggling now as Mulder tries to pull her to
     her feet again. In real physical pain.

                            SCULLY
               I can't...

     Scully can't finish speaking, her voice becoming a
     hoarse cough.

                            SCULLY
                      (barely a whisper)
               I can't go any farther.

                            MULDER
               Yes you can. You're going to make it,
               Scully.

     Mulder hauling Scully up off the floor AWAY FROM CAMERA
     now.


     NEW ANGLE ON RIBBED CORRIDOR

     CAMERA MOVING THROUGH SPACE in the empty corridor,
     moving at a speed equal to Mulder and Scully's as they
     round the semi-circular ribbed corridor to meet us.
     Coming out of the mist, Scully back in the fireman's
     carry. Approaching the place where Mulder slipped down
     into the corridor.

     Mulder stopping and seeing:

     THE BODY IN THE MELTING ICE LITH

     As it too moves, the embryonic creature inside it
     turning slightly, as if coming awake.

     REVERSE ON MULDER

     Reacting to this -- and then to Scully who suddenly
     starts GASPING FOR BREATH.

     Falling now from Mulder's grasps as her legs buckle and
     she goes down.

     LOW ANGLE ON SCULLY

     Her face is going red, straining for air. Her eyes
     rolling, seeking relief. As Mulder drops down beside
     her.

                            MULDER
               Shit --

     But she is unable to answer. Mulder hastening to unzip
     her/his jacket. To get to her neck and find a pulse.

                            MULDER
               Scully --

     Mulder cannot find a pulse. Scully straining harder now
     as Mulder reaches his fingers into her mouth, clearing
     her passageway. Moving on top of her now, and pumping
     forcefully on her chest -- trying to get air into her.
     One - two - three.

     And putting his mouth down to hers (FINALLY!), breathing
     his life into her. Pulling away from her to see that he
     is unsuccessful at this -- that Scully is continuing to
     strain. Pumping her chest again --

                            MULDER
               You're not dying on me now -- godammit
               godammit godammit --

     As he pumps her chest. Placing his mouth over hers again
     and BREATH - BREATH -- BREATH.

     Lifting his mouth from hers, feeling for a pulse again,
     putting his eat down to her mouth, praying he'll feel
     the breeze of a breath. Nothing. While:


     ANGLE OVER HIM TO THE CREATURE IN THE ICY POD

     As it moves again, MORE VIOLENTLY NOW. As the ice around
     it continues to melt and fissure.


     RESUME MULDER

     His hands going to a pocket on the inside of the jacket
     Scully is wearing -- his jacket -- finding again the
     syringe that he used on Scully. It is still partially
     full of vaccine. Mulder finding this, getting ready to
     use it when --

     -- Scully's body suddenly comes back to life beneath
     him. Labored breaths which turn into a coughing spasm.
     Mulder breaths relievedly for a moment, watching Scully
     coughing, coming back to life. Her eyes trying to focus
     on him, finding him. Seeing his labored relief. The
     panic melting away.

                            SCULLY
                      (weakly, pained whisper)
               Mulder...

     She wants to tell him something. He leans down next to
     her.

                            SCULLY
                      (continued weak)
               Had you big time.

     Mulder has but a moment to savor this weary victory
     though when he REACTS to something, that causes him to
     WHIP HIS HEAD AROUND.


     MULDER'S POV DOWN RIBBED CORRIDOR

     Through the condensed mist he can see CREATURES
     BEGINNING TO HATCH, sprouting from the melted
     ice-encased bodies they have gestated in. Their THREE
     FINGERED HANDS beating at the soft ice. Their powerful
     feet kicking at it, too.


     RESUME MULDER

     Looking the other way down the corridor, seeing --

     MORE CREATURES

     The slushy material that makes up the inner core
     spilling out with them as the creatures KICK out of
     their tombs.

     RESUME MULDER

     Lifting Scully up with all his strength he has left in
     him. He's got to get her overhead now, back up the
     venting that he slipped down from. She is weak and of
     little help.

     Mulder gets her propped up on his strength so that he
     can use the power of his legs to boost her toward the
     opening. Which puts him face to face with THE EMBRYONIC
     CREATURE. Its eye looking directly at him, blinking,
     before it goes into another FITFUL SPASM inside its host
     body.


     ANGLE DOWN FROM VENT

     Where Scully is boosted up TOWARD CAMERA. Her hands
     reaching feebly for something to grab onto. Finding a
     handhold.

                            MULDER
               Keep breathing, Scully.

     She utters something guttural, unintelligible as the
     next thrust up from Mulder gets her head and shoulders
     into the opening of the vent.


     RESUME MULDER

     Beneath her, pushing with all his might. His hands under
     her shoes now, forcing her up into the vent like a
     rolled carpet into the rafters.


     RESUME SCULLY

     Struggling with her arms and elbows, barely conscious,
     but somehow able to manage herself forward.


     RESUME MULDER

     Pushing Scully up the last little way. Then reaching up
     to find a handhold for himself. Grabbing hold and
     lifting himself as one of his feet kicks at the ice --
     where the creature he was just face to face with BURSTS
     from its icy pod. One hand, then the other shooting out
     of the ice where they have broken through the host.
     Ripping open the front of the body, including the man's
     face. Making a slimy, gaping tear in what was formerly
     flesh.

     Its hands grabbing at Mulder as he thrashes to free
     himself from it getting a grip.

     As Mulder struggles to pull himself up, fighting off the
     creature which he cannot see beneath him.


     RESUME CREATURE

     As it emerges from the ice, still grasping and TEARING
     at Mulder's legs with its claws. But as it BURSTS
     COMPLETELY from its place, Mulder is able to pull
     himself up and into the vent in one athletic movement.


     ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE VENT - SCULLY

     lies motionless in the ducting, her body forced forward
     by Mulder's in this last surging move.

     TIGHT ANGLE ON MULDER

     Drawing his legs up quickly inside. Not wasting a moment
     shoving Scully's butt forward in front of him.

                            MULDER
               Scully -- you breathing?

     RESUME SCULLY

     Letting out another low, guttural sound -- which STRAINS
     out of her with each push forward.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. SNOW/ICE BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS

     Scully's head and arms push up through the vent where
     Mulder first entered. The ice and snow surrounding it,
     which had created the bubble structure, have melted and
     fallen. So that above Scully's larger hole has opened up
     to the surface. The air is full of condensation,
     swirling around them.

     ANGLE FROM ABOVE - THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ICE

     Where, through the swirling steam we see Mulder push
     Scully clear of the vent. Climbing free himself now.
     When the surface they are upon SHUDDERS AND QUAKES. As
     if it has come unloosed, destabilized.

     And with this comes A MIGHTY FORCE OF STEAM from the
     vent Mulder and Scully just crawled from. Blasting up
     past them with terrible HISSING FORCE. Causing Mulder to
     throw Scully away from its superheated energy.

     Pulling her up the now climbable embankment created by
     the melting snow; pulling her toward the surface of the
     ice sheet.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA - WIDE

     Where a wide radius of steam rises from similar and
     regularly spaced holes in the ice sheet, defining a
     circular structure beneath. The White Domed Tents of the
     ice station are in the center of this, dwarfed by the
     enormity of the melting radius.


     RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY

     Mulder pulling her up the softened and collapsed snow.
     The hot steam blasting up with hideous force behind
     them. The sound DEAFENING.

     NEW ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY

     Pulling her to the surface of the ice sheet where behind
     them in the distance the ICE STATION can be seen through
     the atmosphere of condensed air. When suddenly the ice
     beneath it gives way and the ice station falls away,
     caving in to the center of the radius. Which is what
     begins to happen to the rest of the ice sheet that
     spreads out to where Mulder and Scully are standing.
     Causing Mulder to realize:

                            MULDER
                      (over the din)
               We've got to run!

     She is weak, but is able to find her footing. Dragged
     behind Mulder as the ice behind them begins to break
     away, falling down into an ever-expanding center and
     sending up magnificent geysers of steam created by the
     superheated surface below.


     WIDE ON SCENE

     Mulder and Scully running AT CAMERA just ahead of the
     collapsing center. The mass of ice around them beginning
     to break up. Steam vents erupting instantaneously
     everywhere.

                                             CUT TO:


     HIGH ANGLE ON SCENE

     A black dome is becoming visible through the giant
     circle of steam, in the ever-widening center hole that
     Mulder and Scully are running from. Which is chasing
     them to the edge of the radius.

                                             CUT TO:


     ANGLE FOLLOWING MULDER AND SCULLY

     As Mulder struggles to pull Scully fast enough to
     outrace the icy debris that is tumbling away just behind
     them. Large chunks falling and bouncing off the
     superheated surface below, blown back up like water
     being dropped onto a hot skillet.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXTREMELY HIGH AND WIDE

     The Agents mere specks fleeing the circle of churning
     ice and steam. As it cascades away in three hundred and
     sixty degrees. From here the deafening sound if absorbed
     into the vastness, tricking us of the reality of the
     massive movement of frozen material down below.

                                             CUT TO:


     ANGLE LEADING MULDER AND SCULLY

     As Scully loses her footing, falling to the ground.
     Mulder dragging her back up to her feet, though,
     maintaining forward momentum. While behind them the
     thundering force of the superheated melting snow and ice
     is moving in on them.

     And then suddenly -- MULDER AND SCULLY are gone!

     The radial edge of the falling snow continuing only a
     few feet beyond where they disappeared. The violent
     upheaval of snow abating but slightly. Beat, beat...

     THEN THE AGENTS APPEAR AGAIN. Thrust upward by a RISING
     BLACK PRECIPICE which catapults them off its leading
     edge. As they fall the distance to the sheet of ice
     below.

                                             CUT TO:


     LOW ANGLE ON ICE SHEET

     Where the Agents hit hard on the ice sheet. The rain of
     ice chunks pounding all around them. As the monolithic
     wall of the craft continues to rise.

     Mulder trying to get to Scully in this hail of debris
     which he shields his face from.


     WIDE ON LEADING EDGE

     Rising faster now out of the earth as it begins to
     increasingly shed and break free of the frozen weight it
     carried. Until the bottom of the edge of the wall
     appears, lifting clear of the ice sheet and the crater
     that held it.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE ON SPACE SHIP

     Where now we see the scope and shape of the ship, which
     is breathtaking. The domed center sloping off to a
     gentle gradient, which is the surface that Mulder and
     Scully were running on. The ship is now slowly rotating
     as it moves upward in a gently rising hover.

     Mulder and Scully are on the ice sheet below.


     RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY

     Scully face down on the ice. Mulder lifting his head
     when THE HEAVY SHADOW of the ship comes over them.
     Looking up from this position to see:

     THE SPACE SHIP

     Moving slowly, laterally just overhead. Thunderously
     rumbling. The dark detail of its underside visible in
     this angle. As it continues to rise, the shadow passing
     over Mulder and Scully.

                                             CUT TO:


     NEW ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY

     Scully is still face down on the ice, as Mulder watches
     the ship's shadow cast over Mulder's SnowCat which is
     still parked in the distance. Moving up and off.

     The ship continues up into the Antarctic sky where it
     rises toward the sky where it begins to get WHITEHOT.
     Transforming itself into pure energy. It is visible for
     several moments during transformation. Then it
     disappears completely. As it does the RUMBLE, which
     dopplers across the white, barren landscape. Then it is
     gone.


     MULDER

     Watches this then lays his head down on Scully's back.
     He is spent, at the brink of complete exhaustion. His
     whole body heaving. But now starting to shiver, and to
     lose consciousness.

     Scully's body is motionless beneath him, for a moment we
     might believe that this is the way it might end. Out
     here on the ice with Mulder and Scully freezing to
     death. A chill wind blows off the Antarctic plain, the
     same LOW RUMBLE, the only taint of silence in vastness
     of this literal end of the world.

     Then Scully coughs -- the same hoarse cough. She's
     alive. Struggling to consciousness. Her head lifting
     slightly, TURNING TO CAMERA. Her eyes blink open and she
     coughs again. Feeling Mulder's weight on top of her,
     unaware of his condition or even where she is.

                            SCULLY
                      (weakly)
               Mulder...

     There is no answer. Scully struggling to pull herself
     out from under the weight of his body. Rolling over so
     that her face is opposite Mulder's now. Seeing that he
     has lost consciousness. Finding the strength to roll him
     over, so that she can cradle him and warm him.

     HIGH WIDE ANGLE ON THIS SCENE

     With the Snowcat a short distance away, Mulder and
     Scully in each others arms. The way it should end.

     FADE TO BLACK

     Silence. Longer than we would like. Long enough to make
     us nervous, then certain, then angry. Then...we FADE UP
     a prelap of the sound of a CRACKLING FIRE.

     FADING UP ON:


     EXT. ACRES OF CORN - MAGIC HOUR

     TRACKING LOW WITH MEN IN FATIGUES, moving along the
     perimeter of the corn field as they set fire to the corn
     stalks with small handheld butane burners. While other
     Men in Fatigues are moving between the rows dousing the
     furrows with accelerant.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DALLAS - NIGHT

     The large room filled with the evidence and debris from
     the bombing. It is dark. Until A FLASHLIGHT BEAM pricks
     the blackness, moving toward us into f.g. Carried by the
     man we now recognize as The Man Who Shot Mulder. He
     moves with directness, purpose. Finding what he's
     looking for amid the cataloged material, he finds on a
     work bench. Next to the microscope Scully had used. It
     is the BONE FRAGMENTS, held in an evidence container.

     He pockets them and exits as quiet and directly as he
     entered.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. ACRES OF CORN - WIDE - CGI PLATE

     The sky aglow with orange flames as the crops burn to
     the ground. We hold on this shot, PRELAPPING the sound
     of:

                            JANA CASSIDY'S VOICE
               ... in light of the report I've got
               before me; in light of the narrative
               I'm now hearing...


     INT. FBI OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW - DAY

     Jana Cassidy sits at the head of the desk, just as when
     we first met her.

     She is flanked by the other members of the review board,
     including A.D. Skinner who sits at the end of the
     table.

     Cassidy flips through a file she's referred to before
     she continues. Looking up with consternation as she
     resumes.

                            CASSIDY
               ... my official report is incomplete
               pending these new facts I'm being
               asked to reconcile. Agent Scully...

     AGENT SCULLY

     Sitting where she last sat, at the small table. The seat
     next to her conspicuously empty. Her face bears the
     signs of slight frostbite, somewhat healed. Her
     expression is even, her attitude composed, but her eyes
     are filled of dark, restrained defiance.

                            CASSIDY
               ...while there is direct evidence now
               that a federal agent may have been
               involved in the bombing... the other
               events you've laid down here seem too
               incredible on their own, and quite
               frankly implausible in their
               connection.

     PANNING THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS - curious, bemused like
     Cassidy. Skinner shifts uncomfortably.

                            SCULLY
               What is it you find incredible?

                            CASSIDY
               Well...where would you like me to
               start? Antarctica is a long way from
               Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very
               well submit a report to the Attorney
               General that alleges the links you've
               made here. Bees and corn crops do not
               quite fall under the rubric of
               domestic terrorism.

                            SCULLY
               No, they don't.

                            CASSIDY
               Most of what I find in here is lacking
               a coherent picture of an organization
               with an attributable motive. I realize
               you're very lucky to be alive Agent
               Scully. The ordeal you've endured has
               clearly affected you -- though the
               holes in your account leave this panel
               with little choice but to delete these
               references from our final report to
               the Justice Department. Until which
               time hard evidence becomes available
               that would give us cause to pursue
               such an investigation.

     Scully has her hand in her coat pocket now. Moving
     around the table and approaching Cassidy. Removing
     something which she puts on the desk in front of her. A
     small vial.

                            SCULLY
               I don't believe the FBI currently has
               an investigation unit qualified to
               pursue the evidence in hand.

     Cassidy picks up the vial, studying the contents of this
     vial: the dead bee that stung Scully. Studying it as
     Scully turns and moves to the door, without permission,
     no further adieu.

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE A.D. SKINNER

     Watching Scully exit.

                            CASSIDY (O.S.)
               Mr. Skinner....?

     CAMERA PIVOTING TO INCLUDE CASSIDY. Looking at him.

                           CASSIDY
               Please ask Agent Scully to come back
               to this hearing. We're not quite
               finished.

     As Skinner rises, unsure of the intent behind this
     directive, we:

     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

     We are JUST ABOVE THE TREETOPS. The Capitol Dome is in
     the far distance. CAMERA CRANING DOWN to find Mulder
     sitting by himself on a park bench. We are WIDE. There
     is no one else around.

     Until the Cigarette Smoking Man appears. Walking through
     the otherwise deserted park. Joining Mulder on the park
     bench.

     CLOSER ON MULDER, THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

     They do not speak for several moments. A quite tension
     as the CSM lights up a trademark smoke. Inhaling,
     exhaling. Then:

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Congratulations on your survival. Your
               life is worthless now, I hope you know
               that.

                            MULDER
               And yours?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
                      (derisive)
               You think you've stopped it. What I've
               worked for fifty years to create. You
               haven't stopped it. You can't stop
               it.
                      (takes a drag)
               You're just one man.

                            MULDER
               You're wrong.

     WIDE ANGLE

     Mulder rises from the bench heading TOWARD CAMERA. The
     CSM rising, watching him.

     As Mulder continues toward us. ADJUST TO REVEAL Agent
     Scully in the f.g. Mulder moving to her as the CSM
     watches from the distance. Their eyes meet, an unspoken
     restored bond exchanged in this moment. Before Mulder
     takes Scully by the arm, leads her off. Leaving the CSM
     standing alone in the distance. As we:

     EXT. CORN FIELDS/WHITE DOMES - TUNISIA - DAY

     TRACKING LOW WITH A PAIR OF FEET

     The wearer of them sporting peasant sandals. We realize
     shortly that while the feet are moving across sandy
     ground, that the foliage in the near b.g. is corn. And
     that the person we are tracking with is passing row
     after row of stalks.

     CAMERA RISING AS IT TRACKS

     REVEALING A TUNISIAN MAN dressed in peasant clothes. He
     is carrying a piece of paper. Moving with hasty purpose.
     Stopping at the end of one of the long rows of corn
     where CONRAD STRUGHOLD is coming toward him. Making his
     way between rows of stalks. The Peasant waits patiently
     as Strughold approaches, handing him the piece of
     paper.

     Strughold reads it, his otherwise steely countenance
     reflecting a disturbance seen only in the slight
     narrowing of his eyes.

     He looks up at the Peasant and says something to him in
     Tunisian Arabic. Said as command, which causes the
     Peasant to nod dutifully and move off as he came.

     Strughold stands for a moment, then crumples the paper
     slightly and drops it. Moving off down the same corn row
     in which he approached.

     CAMERA DROPPING TO THE GROUND where we find the paper on
     which we see a flat section that is not so crumpled we
     cannot read the words: X-FILES RE-OPENED. STOP. PLEASE
     ADVISE. STOP.

     CAMERA RISING NOW. Rising up past the stalks. Where we
     can still see Strughold walking. RISING UP AND UP to
     reveal ACRES AND ACRES OF CORN. Many times more than we
     had seen previously. Stretched out across the Tunisian
     Desert, ending only where THREE WHITE DOMES stand on the
     distant horizon.

     Off this image we FADE OUT.

     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE
     NUMBERS, AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE
     BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY.




     FADE IN:


     EXT. SNOWSCAPE

     A BLINDING WHITE SCREEN, under which we hear an ominous
     low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. We're not in 19"
     television land anymore, Toto. As the rumble builds, TWO
     BLACK FIGURES appear on what now has resolved into a
     distant horizon. From their movements we can shortly see
     that the figures are men. Moving along a windswept ice
     sheet in an otherwise featureless land.

     A LEGEND appears: NORTH TEXAS, 35,000 B.C.


     CLOSER ON THE TWO MEN

     Continuing toward us, we can now see that they are
     dressed in crude garments made of animal skins. If we
     squint we can see their hair is long, their jutting
     foreheads significant of primitive Homo Sapiens. They
     continue toward us, the wind beating against them,
     CAMERA IS CRANING DOWN to the snow that lies before
     them. To LARGE THREE-TOED TRACKS.


     FOLLOWING THE PRIMITIVES

     As they track the three-toed prints to a rocky crevice in
     the hard-pack ice. The prints stop here, and so do the
     men. Dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their
     quarry.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. ICE CAVE

     Dark in here, except where the sunlight penetrates the
     thick, glassy ice walls. The silhouettes of the
     Primitives stark against the glistening cavern. The
     sound of flint being struck, then A TORCH CATCHES FIRE,
     illuminating their faces. And:

     A CREATURE

     Deeper in the cave. Fleeing the light and the men. We
     get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light,
     seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray,
     dinosaur-like skin. And large black eyes. But it moves
     quickly enough away that any other identifying feature
     is lost in the deeper shadows.

     THE PRIMITIVES

     Removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under
     their thick fur garments, and scrabbling into the
     constricting cavern, giving chase.

     Following them as they moves with animal-like agility
     through the tightening space. Predatory hunters. Their
     torchlight catching:

     THE CREATURE

     As it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller
     crevice leading off the main one. The Primitives
     entering frame after a moment, only a few steps behind.
     The LEAD PRIMITIVE dropping to the cave floor,
     pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit.
     Splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on
     the run.


     INT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - HIGH ANGLE DOWN

     The fiery torch comes through first, held by the lead
     man. Throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what
     appears to be a box cavern.

     CLOSE ON LEAD PRIMITIVE

     Rising quickly to his feet. Not seeing what the torch
     illuminates just behind him: The face of a dead
     Primitive Man, his body frozen into the ice. He does
     finally notice this, turning to see it, when he's
     ATTACKED VICIOUSLY FROM BEHIND.

     The torch falls to the floor so that the fight is
     difficult to see, but it is loud and cruel. The creature
     squealing wildly as the grunts of the Primitive now turn
     to the sounds of painful struggle. Until:

     THE SECOND PRIMITIVE MAN

     Suddenly appears, driving his bone weapon into the body
     of the Creature. Again and again, until the Creature is
     driven away into the shadows.

     The Second Man grabs the torch now, not to see if his
     hunting mate has survived, but in pursuit of the
     Creature. In the light we see that he and his weapon are
     covered with spatters of OILY BLACK BLOOD. As is the
     First Primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor.

     The Second Primitive stepping over his hunting mate,
     stalking the Creature into the shadows, where it has
     collapsed. The torch finally landing, for the first
     time, on its face.

     When the torchlight hits its face, the Creature attacks.
     But the Primitive prevails. He drops his torch and
     dispatches the already wounded Creature with strong
     hard stabs of his weapon, one of which penetrates the
     Creature's eye.


     LOW ANGLE ON THE DEAD CREATURE

     The torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the
     dead creature's face. Its wounds are flowing with the
     oily black blood, which, oddly now, BEGINS TO POOL. As
     if it has intelligence, sentience. Pooling and traveling
     into a fissure in the cave floor. And disappearing.


     ANGLE ON THE SECOND PRIMITIVE

     Watching this, unknowing. His chest heaving from the
     fight, as the spots of Oily Black Blood which have
     spattered onto him begin to crawl. Crawling toward his
     eyes and mouth. Causing him to let out grunts of fear.

     Which are the sounds we hear as the CAMERA SLOWLY CRANES
     UP past the struggling Primitive to the roof of the
     cave, where the dancing shadows of the torch FADE AWAY
     with the sounds of struggle. Moving into darkness and
     silence. But only for a moment. Until:


     SUNSHINE BREAKS THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE CAVE - PRESENT
     DAY

     Along with the spade of a shovel. And then -- the
     earthen cave ceiling gives way and A BOY wearing Nikes
     and an old t-shirt falls through it. Falling PAST
     CAMERA. We hear a YELL, then a THUD, and a CLATTERING of
     the shovel that's fallen in with him. Then a pained
     GASPING.

     Then SEVERAL HEADS appear in the opening. These are BOYS
     of ten to eleven, staring down into the cave. Hot
     sunlight blazing in. We have traveled far, far forward
     in time.

                            2ND BOY
               Hey, Stevie. You okay?


     INT. CAVE - PRESENT DAY

     THEIR POV OF STEVIE

     On the floor below covered with dirt, in his nose and
     mouth. Spitting out. (All these boys have Texas in their
     voices.)

                            STEVIE
               I got...I got....I got....
                      (straining)
               ....the wind knocked out of me.

     This draws no sympathy from above, only LAUGHTER.

     THE BOYS UP ABOVE

     Staring excitedly.

                            3RD BOY
               Looks like a cave or something.

                            2ND BOY
               What's down there, Stevie? Anything?

     OVER THE BOYS ABOVE

     Stevie has gotten up, moving out of the patch of
     sunlight. Disappearing from view for a moment. Then
     reappearing, still spitting out dirt. But holding:

                            STEVIE
               Human skull.

     One side partially missing from the cranium. But it
     brings WHOOPS of delight from the boys above.

                            3RD BOY
               Toss it up here, dude.

                            STEVIE
               No way, buttwipe. I found it. It's
               mine.

     ANGLE UP ON STEVIE

     The other boys looking down at him. Stevie looking at
     the skull. Strangely, the light shines through it. It is
     milky, opaque, as if it's bone that's turned somehow
     glassy in places. Then:

                            STEVIE
               Anyways, there's bones all over the
               place down here.

     Stevie looks down at his feet. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIS LOOK
     DOWN to where there are indeed more human bones. And
     something else. He takes a couple of steps in place,
     standing in a familiar BLACK, OILY substance -- which is
     climbing up his tennis shoe from the rock floor, over
     the edge of the shoe and down into the shoe itself. Then
     the SKULL drops in the frame, clattering on the hard
     floor of the cave.

     CAMERA SLOWLY RISING UP FROM STEVIE'S SHOES

     Following SUBCUTANEOUS WORMS which have begun locomoting
     aggressively up his legs. As his whole body is WRACKED
     by a shivering seizure of some kind.

     CAMERA RISES, following the path of the worms as they
     move up the legs of his shorts. Some appearing on his
     bare arms, but the great majority continuing up to
     Stevie's neck, toward his face. Stevie stands paralyzed.
     Letting out guttural sounds not dissimilar to when the
     wind was knocked out of him.

                            3RD BOY (O.S.)
               Hey, Stevie....

     But Stevie cannot answer him. CAMERA CONTINUING UP to
     the boys above. Looking down at their friend. Their eyes
     go wide.

                            2ND BOY
               You okay?

     But what they see next answers that question for them.

     THEIR POV OF STEVIE

     His face suddenly alive with the subcutaneous worms.
     Moving toward his eyes which begin filling with BLACK
     OIL. Looking much now like ALIEN EYES.

     CLOSE ON THE BOYS ABOVE

     Freaked by what they see. And doing what any kid would
     do now.

                            3RD BOY
               Hey, man. Let's get outta here.

     And they do. Bolting from the hole in the top of the
     cave. CAMERA PUSHING UP THROUGH THIS HOLE to REVEAL we
     are:


     EXT. SMALL DIRT FIELD - NORTHERN TEXAS - DAY

     In a dirt hole that was being dug by the three kids.
     RISING UP out of the hole to REVEAL the parched dirt
     patch where THREE KIDS are running away from us, as fast
     as their feet will take them. Toward A NEW HOUSING TRACT
     (five floorplans to choose from, including the model
     home.) Disappearing into the neighborhood. A LEGEND
     appears: NORTH TEXAS, 1998.

     CAMERA CONTINUES RISING ABOVE THE ROOFTOPS to see the
     surrounding expanse of empty Texas flatland. And in the
     distance, the DALLAS SKYLINE.

     As CAMERA SETTLES, there are a few moments of nothing
     but the sound of the wind gently whistling across the
     landscape. In which we bury a short TIME CUT.


     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NORTHERN TEXAS - DAY

     Then we HEAR it, before we see it: FIRE ENGINES pulling
     into the neighborhood, sirens WAILING. CAMERA DROPPING
     AGAIN as the lead engine pulls up. FIREMEN are hopping
     off, moving to the hole the boys dug.

     LOW ANGLE UP FROM BELOW GROUND LEVEL, IN THE DUGOUT
     HOLE

     TWO firemen carrying a ladder clamber down PAST CAMERA,
     THREE OTHERS appearing on their heels. The other two
     firemen clamber down, too. THE CAPTAIN at the edge of
     the hole watching them. Holding a radio.

                            FIRE CAPTAIN
               This is Captain Miles Cooles...we've
               got a rescue situation in progress...


     INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS

     As the LEAD FIREMAN steps down the ladder into the cave.
     He scans the darkness, illuminated only by the shaft of
     light permitted by the hole above. As the 2ND FIREMAN
     drops down next to him. The both stand motionless now,
     as if sensing something.

     THEIR POV

     Stevie's feet are just visible on the floor of the cave,
     a short distance away.

     RESUME FIREMEN - LOW ANGLE

     They start cautiously toward Stevie. CAMERA FINDING
     their feet. Tracking through the same OILY, BLACK
     SUBSTANCE we saw bleeding from the creature thirty five
     thousand years ago. As they move into the shadows, we
     HOLD ON THE SUBSTANCE....and see it MOVE. It's alive.

                                             TIME CUT TO:


     EXT. DIRT FIELD - SHORT TIME LATER

     CAMERA RISES out of the dirt hole, finds A GROUP OF
     NEIGHBORS:

     Concerned PARENTS, KIDS, including Stevie's friends.
     They're held at a distance by the remaining firemen.
     Everyone turning their concerned gazes skyward. Looking
     at:

     A MED-EVAC CHOPPER

     Coming off the sun-setting horizon. Moving toward us at
     high speed. The WHOP, WHOP of its blade soon shaking the
     neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just
     over the dirt field. Landing gently on the parched hard
     scrabble.

     The side door flies open and FIVE HAZ-MAT RESCUE
     PARAMEDICS jump out carrying a bubble litter. CAMERA
     PANS THEM to the dirt hole past THE FIRE CAPTAIN. The
     Haz-Mat Paramedics moving down into the hole. The Fire
     Captain watches this, then stares toward --

     DR. BEN BRONSCHWEIG (in shirtsleeves, tie), exiting the
     chopper, following up the rear. The Captain meeting him
     in route.

                            BRONSCHWEIG
                      (over the chopper)
               Keep those people back. Get them out
               of here.

                            FIRE CAPTAIN
                      (to his men)
               Move them all back.
                      (dogging Bronschweig)
               I sent four men down after the boy.
               They're not responding.

     Dr. Bronschweig's focus is elsewhere, though. He's
     making a bee line to the earthen hole where young Stevie
     is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed
     QUARANTINE BUBBLE LITTER by the rescue squad.
     Bronschweig watches with great concern. Getting a good
     look now at Stevie's paralyzed body as it passes him.

     ANGLE ON CHOPPER

     As Stevie's body is loaded aboard, the side door is slid
     shut. The engine throttles up and the chopper takes
     flight again, almost as quickly as it arrived. The prop
     wash blowing:

     DR. BRONSCHWEIG

     And the gathering crowd. Bronschweig watches the chopper
     bank away, then turns his look to:

     THE NEIGHBORHOOD

     Where A SERIES OF UNMARKED CARGO VANS, TRUCKS are
     rolling in. A fleet of vehicles, driven by what looks
     like MILITARY PERSONNEL. Most conspicuously TWO WHITE
     UNMARKED TANKER TRUCKS. (There are NO MARKINGS on these
     vehicles.)

     RESUME BRONSCHWEIG

     As the Fire Captain moves around to face him off.

                            FIRE CAPTAIN
               What about my men?

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
                      (brusquely)
               We're doing all we can.

     And he moves off toward the approaching trucks where the
     MILITARY PERSONNEL are pulling out tents, tent poles,
     scientific equipment. Leaving the Captain to wonder what
     the hell's going on. Watching the first of many
     REFRIGERATION UNITS being unloaded. The personnel
     carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him.
     Moving RIGHT TO CAMERA and plunging us into BLACK.

     HOLD. Then OVER BLACK, a familiar sound again. The
     sound of a chopper auguring in. As we FADE UP, revealing
     we are:


     EXT. TOP OF A SKYSCRAPER - DAY

     The chopper is banking over the side of the building,
     preparing to touch down on the rooftop where FIFTEEN FBI
     AGENTS in dark ID windbreakers are standing. A LEGEND
     appears: FEDERAL BUILDING, DALLAS, TEXAS. ONE WEEK
     LATER.

     The chopper touches down and, again, the side door is
     thrown open. But now only one man exits: SPECIAL AGENT
     IN CHARGE (S.A.C.) DARIUS MICHAUD.

     Michaud moves with the measured pace of authority,
     approaching the waiting FBI Agents. One of whom steps
     up.

                            FBI AGENT
               We've evacuated the building and been
               through it bottom to top. No trace of
               an explosive device or anything
               resembling one.

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               Have you taken the dogs through?

                            FBI AGENT
               Yes, sir.

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               Well, take them through again.

     This is given as a non-negotiable order, to the somewhat
     weary FBI man. Who turns back to his charges, Michaud
     does not register this attitude, though. Something else
     has caught his attention. Causing him to walk to the
     edge of the building. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM, seeing what
     he sees now.

     On an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be AN FBI
     AGENT in an ID windbreaker exiting onto the roof. CAMERA
     CONTINUING AROUND into A CLOSE UP PROFILE of S.A.C
     Michaud. Staring at this, his jaw set. He doesn't like
     what he sees. And what he sees is:


     EXT. ROOFTOP OPPOSING SKYSCRAPER - DAY - CONTINUOUS

     Special Agent Dana Scully is coming out the door leading
     onto the roof. The door slams shut behind her. She, too,
     is dressed in an FBI windbreaker. She's dialing her
     cell phone as she moves around the rooftop looking for
     something. Dialing the number of:

                            SCULLY
               Mulder -- it's me --

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               Where are you, Scully?

                            SCULLY
               I'm on the roof.

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               Did you find something?

                            SCULLY
                      (impatiently)
               No. I haven't.

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               What's wrong, Scully?

                            SCULLY
               I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm
               hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to
               be honest, what I'm doing here.

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               You're looking for a bomb.

                            SCULLY
               I know that. But the threat was called
               in for the Federal Building across the
               street.

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               I think they have that covered.

     WE ARE TRACKING WITH SCULLY.

                            SCULLY
                      (impatience)
               Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat
               is called in, the logical purpose of
               providing this information is to allow
               us to find the bomb. The rational
               object of terrorism is to promote
               terror. If you'd study model
               behavioral pattern in virtually every
               case where a threat has turned up an
               explosive device. If we don't act in
               accordance with that data -- if you
               ignore it as we have done -- the
               chances are great that if here
               actually is a bomb we might not find
               it. Lives could be lost --

     Scully, engrossed in her own argument, realizes she's
     been the only one speaking for the last short while. She
     stops walking.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder...?

                            MULDER
               What happened to playing a hunch?

     Scully almost JUMPS out of her own skin. The voice has
     come not over the phone, but from two feet away where:

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE AGENT MULDER

     Standing in the shadow of a large air conditioning unit.
     Cracking a trademark sunflower seed between his teeth.
     Clicking his cell phone off. Moving out.

                            SCULLY
               Jesus, Mulder...

                            MULDER
               The element of surprise, Scully.
               Random acts of unpredictability. If we
               fail to anticipate the unforeseen or
               expect the unexpected in a universe of
               infinite possibilities, we find
               ourselves at the mercy of anyone or
               anything that cannot be programmed,
               categorized or easily referenced...

     Mulder has moved to the edge of the building where he
     sails his sunflower seeds into the air. Dusting his
     hands off as if lost in a wistful through for just a
     moment.

                            MULDER
               What are we doing up here? It's hotter
               than hell.

     And he's on the move. Scully moving to catch up.

     NEW ANGLE

     Mulder is moving toward the stairs, Scully catching him.
     Mulder allowing her to lead him up the steps.

                            SCULLY
               I know you're bored in this
               assignment, but unconventional
               thinking is only going to get you into
               trouble now.

                            MULDER
               How's that?

                            SCULLY
               You've got to quit looking for what
               isn't there. They've closed the
               X-Files. There's procedure to be
               followed here. Protocol.

                            MULDER
               What do you say we call in a bomb
               threat for Houston. I think it's free
               beer night at the Astrodome.

     Scully gives him a look. It's no use. She reaches the
     door first, grabs the knob but... it won't open. Turning
     to Mulder.

                            SCULLY
               Now what?

                            MULDER
                      (suddenly nervous)
               It's locked?

     She wiggles the knob again.

                            SCULLY
               So much for anticipating the
               unforeseen...

     Scully squints into the sun, staring at Mulder. But he's
     quick on the draw, and realizes what she's up to. He
     grabs for the door and... it opens. Looking to Scully
     whose hard look of mock-scolding has become a smirking
     smile.

                            SCULLY
               Had you.

                            MULDER
               No you didn't.

                            SCULLY
               Oh yeah. Had you big time.

     And that's how it continues as they re-enter the
     stairwell, the door slamming shut behind them.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

     As an elevator DINGS and the doors open. Scully and
     Mulder exit into the lobby where people move in and out.
     Heads turn due to their FBI jackets. (Included
     atmosphere: a GROUP OF KIDS on a field trip, being led
     into an elevator by THEIR TEACHER.)

                            SCULLY
               I saw your face, Mulder. There was a
               moment of panic.

                            MULDER
               Panic? Have you ever seen me panic,
               Scully?

                            SCULLY
               I just did. You're buying.

     Mulder fishes for change, but more out of
     sportsmanship.

                            MULDER
               Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi?
               A saline IV?

                            SCULLY
               Something sweet.

     Scully flashes a thin victory smile, as Mulder heads
     off.


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder moving to a door with a small shingle above it
     which says SNACKS/BEVERAGES. As he approaches, sorting
     through the change he's fished up, the door opens and A
     MAN IN A VENDOR'S UNIFORM appears. He makes casual and
     ever-so-brief eye contact with Mulder as he brushes past
     him. Mulder making no note of this as he moves to catch
     the door before it closes.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. SNACK AREA AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY

     Mulder takes a few steps down into the windowless room.
     Moving past the snack machines to a LIGHTED soda
     machine.

     Finding the correct change and plunking it in. Hitting a
     button, but... nothing comes out.

                            MULDER
               Oh, come on.

     He beats his fist a couple of times on the front of the
     machine.

     Nothing. He finds more change. Plunking it in. Hits the
     button. Nothing. He stares at the machine a minute, then
     BEATS IT HARD with his fist. Nothing.

     Moving around to the back of the machine, looking for:


     ANGLE ACROSS BACK OF MACHINE

     Mulder's face peering in on the slim space between the
     machine and the wall. Reaching down and lifting the PLUG
     on the end of the electrical cord. It isn't plugged in.
     Realizing now why the machine hasn't spit out his
     sodas.

     RESUME FRONT ANGLE ON MACHINE

     As Mulder appears, stepping very lightly in front of the
     machine that he was just pounding away on. Looking at
     it, then moving quickly to the door he entered through.
     Grasping the knob, but finding it... LOCKED. He jiggles
     the knob, pulls on it. But there's no two ways about it,
     he's locked in.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

     Scully stands looking at her watch. Wondering where
     Mulder is. When her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She
     answers it.

                            SCULLY
               Scully...

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               Scully, I found the bomb.

                            SCULLY
                      (thinks he's joking)
               Where are you, Mulder?

                            MULDER (FILTER)
               I'm in the vending room.

     Scully is on the move, but she doesn't believe him for a
     second.


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Scully appears, heard A POUNDING. Following this noise

     Tries the door.

     INT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY

     Mulder holds his phone to his ear, using his other hand
     to pound.

                            MULDER
               Scully, get somebody to open this
               door.

                            SCULLY (FILTER)
               Nice try, Mulder.

     CAMERA FOLLOWING MULDER as he steps back, revealing now
     that he's gotten the hinged front of the coke machine
     open. But we can't yet see what's inside.

                            MULDER
               Scully -- listen to me. It's in the
               coke machine. You've got about
               fourteen minutes to get this building
               evacuated.


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Scully is shaking her head. Tries the door again.

                            SCULLY
               C'mon. Open the door.

     His response to this is MORE HARD POUNDING.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.

               Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty

     As he is doing this, Scully is bending to see:

     THE KEYHOLE

     It's been freshly soldered over.


     INT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY

     Mulder stands pacing in front of:

     AN ELABORATELY ENGINEERED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE

     Wired with circuit boards, electric belts and generally
     looking like it would take an expert a good long time to
     figure out where to even start. A lot longer than the
     13:58 that reads on the digital read-out.

               I need this building evacuated and
               cleared out in ten minutes! I need you
               to get on the phone and tell the fire
               department to block off the city
               center in one mile radius around the

                      (into phone)
               This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I
               need to speak to S.A.C. Michaud. He's
               got the wrong building --

     EXT. BUILDING - DAY

     UNMARKED FBI VANS, CARS are pulling up out front.
     Agents in windbreakers are exiting, moving at a run to
     the building. Among them S.A.C. Darius Michaud. Moving
     to:


     ANGLE ON SCULLY

     Exiting the building. Behind her, WORKERS are beginning
     to stream out of the building, as well as the young
     FIELD TRIPPERS. Michaud meeting up with Scully
     mid-plaza. As the windbreaker Agents move past them,
     entering the building.

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               Where is it?

     MOVING WITH THEM now, back toward the building. As FIRE
     TRUCKS are pulling up out in the street out front.
     Suddenly this has the distinct feel of a situation
     veering out of control.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder found it in a vending machine.
               He's locked in with it.

     MULDER staring at it. If he wasn't sweating enough on

     phone RINGS. Answering it.

               Mulder. Move away from the door. We're
               coming through it.

     No sooner is this said than the CAMERA WHIPS OFF MULDER
     to the door, where A GAS PLASMA TORCH FLAME is sizzling
     along the hinges.

     Where Michaud himself, wearing a Kevlar vest now, is
     wielding the torch. Expertly cutting the metal while
     Scully and TWO AGENTS and TWO DALLAS BOMB SQUAD men look
     on. In the b.g. BUILDING EMPLOYEES are streaming out.
     Michaud finishes and shuts off the torch. Yelling:

               Go.

     The other Agents kick the metal door in sending it
     crashing to the floor. Mulder stands on the other side.
     Watching Michaud pick up a heft tool kit, stepping over
     the downed door.

     Scully right behind him. Along with the Agents, Bomb
     techs.

     ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE SODA MACHINE/BOMB

     As Michaud steps in next to him, sizing up the time on
     the ticking digital readout: 4:07. And just exactly what
     kind of defusing work he's got cut out for him.

                            MULDER
               Tell me this is just soda pop in those
               canisters.

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               No. It's what it looks like. A big
               I.E.D. - ten gallons of astrolite.
                      (studying the bomb)
               Okay, get everybody out of here and
               clear the building.

               Somebody's got to stay with you --

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               I gave you an order. Now get the hell
               out of here and evacuate the area.

                            SCULLY
               Can you defuse it?

     Setting his tool kit down, opening it. As the other
     Agents heed his word, exiting the room.

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               I think so.

                            MULDER
               You've got about four minutes to find
               out if you're wrong.

     Michaud turns on him with unexpected intensity.

                            S.A.C. MICHAUD
               Did you hear what I said?

                            SCULLY
               Let's go, Mulder.

     Scully starts out. Mulder stares at Michaud for a
     moment, but Michaud's focus is on the bomb now. He won't
     meet Mulder's look. Finally Mulder moves off, following
     Scully.

     CAMERA HOLDS ON MICHAUD, just staring at the bomb. Just
     staring.

     The last of the building occupants are being hauled off

     positioned themselves out front. And the police squad
     cars. As Mulder and Scully exit the front door. Moving
     quickly, until Mulder hits mid-plaza and slows. Scully
     not realizing this for a few steps, then turning.

     One last windbreakered Agent is exiting. Moving past
     them to the last cop car other than the car waiting for
     Mulder and Scully.

                            LAST AGENT OUT
               All clear.

     Mulder has stopped and is looking back to the building
     now as Scully hustles back the few steps separating
     them.

               Something's wrong.

     ANGLE OVER THEM TO THE WAITING CAR

     As the Last Agent Out's car zooms away. Leaving only
     their car and the man driving it: a WINDBREAKERED
     AGENT.

               What's he doing?

     The plaza is desolate now, void of life.

     Mulder and Scully getting in the car. TRACKING BACKWARDS

     only thirty, maybe forty yards when: the BOMB DETONATES
     and the building EXPLODES. And this is no fatwa symbolic
     little terror strike. This is Oklahoma City. Or do we
     say, Independence Day.


     REVERSE ANGLE ON CAR

     As all the windows blow out and the car is lifted up,
     slamming into the corner of a parked car. The air so
     quickly full of debris that it would seem the whole city
     has been destroyed.

     RESUME BUILDING

     As the debris starts to clear somewhat, much of it still
     floating to the ground, though. We see the fires raging
     on every floor. That most of the front of the building
     has been torn away and we can see right into many
     floors.


     RESUME ANGLE ON CAR

     Where it sits half cocked against a parked car. The air
     is full of debris, particulated matter. The rear door of
     the squad car opens now and Mulder gets out, covered with
     glass. Moving to the front passenger door, opening it
     for Scully.

     A formal hearing. Several ASSISTANT DIRECTORS sit at a
     head table, going over documents. NAME PLACECARDS in

     PANNING the group, the sound of papers shuffling, the
     occasional clearing of a throat creating a stale air of
     importance, under:

                            WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
               ...there is a heightened need at the
               Attorney General's office to place
               responsibility as early as possible.

     CAMERA LANDING ON ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JANA CASSIDY

     A no-nonsense 40 year-old lawyer cum FBI Agent.

               public property and the loss of life
               due to terrorist activities...

     Next to Cassidy is Assistant Director WALTER SKINNER,
     Mulder and Scully's former superior on the X-Files.
     Looking ruefully at:

     AGENT SCULLY

     At a small table, the chair next to her conspicuously
     empty.

                            CASSIDY
               Many details are still unclear; some
               agents' reports have not been filed,
               or have come in sketchy, without a
               satisfactory accounting of the events
               that led to the destruction in Dallas.
               But we're under some pressure to give
               an accurate picture of what happened
               to the Attorney General, so she can
               issue a public statement.

     The door to the room opens behind Scully now, and Mulder
     enters, his manner that of a man who knows he's late to
     a function.

     RESUME A.D. CASSIDY

     She looks up at Mulder and Scully with a stern glare.

                            CASSIDY
               We now know that five people died in
               the explosion. Special Agent in Charge
               Darius Michaud who was trying to
               defuse the bomb that had been hidden
               in a vending machine. Three firemen
               from Dallas, and a young boy.

     OVER MULDER AND SCULLY

     Mulder pulls out his chair to sit down, but remains
     standing. They trade a look. This is new news to them.

                            MULDER
               Excuse me -- the firemen and the boy
               -- they were in the building?

                            CASSIDY
               Agent Mulder, since you weren't able
               to be on time for this hearing, I'm
               going to ask you to step outside so
               that we can get Agent Scully's version
               of the facts. So that she won't have
               to be paid the same disrespect.

                            MULDER
               We were told the building was clear.

                            CASSIDY
               You'll get your turn, Agent Mulder.
               Please step out.

     Mulder trades looks with:

     A.D. SKINNER

     Who stares at him evenly, but not unsympathetically.
     He's been here with Mulder on many occasions. Seen
     Mulder run up against the Bureau and its stiff
     conventions. Always in the middle.

                            MULDER
               It does say there in your paperwork
               that we were the ones who found the
               bomb...

                            CASSIDY
               Thank you, Agent Mulder. We'll call
               you in shortly.

     RESUME MULDER, SCULLY

               Sit down, they're still talking to
               Agent Scully.

                            MULDER
               About what?

                            SKINNER
               -- They're asking her for a narrative.
               They want to know why she was in the
               wrong building.

                            MULDER
               She was with me.

     Skinner studies Mulder, shaking his head.

                            SKINNER
               You don't see what's going on here, do
               you?
                      (off Mulder's look)
               There's four hundred million dollars
               in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives
               have been lost. No suspects have been
               named. So the story being shaped is
               this could have been prevented. That
               the FBI didn't do its job.

                            MULDER
               And they want to blame us?

                            SKINNER
               Agent Mulder -- we both know that if
               you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the
               initiative to search the adjacent
               building, you could have multiplied
               the fatalities by a hundred --

                            MULDER
                      (grasping the irony)
               But it's not the lives we saved. It's
               the lives we didn't.

                            SKINNER
                      (reciting the dictum)
               -- if it looks bad, it's bad for the
               FBI --

                            MULDER
               -- if they want someone to blame,
               they can blame me. Agent Scully
               doesn't deserve this.

                            SKINNER
               She's in there right now saying the
               same thing about you.

                            MULDER
               I breached protocol. I broke contact
               with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary
               tactical rule and left him alone with
               the device.

                            SKINNER
               Agent Scully says it was she who
               ordered you out of the building. That
               you wanted to go back.

     Mulder doesn't get to respond, because the door opens
     again and Agent Scully exits. She looks like she's been
     through it.

                            SCULLY
                      (to Skinner)
               They're asking for you, Sir.

     Skinner gives one last look to Mulder, then re-enters.
     Leaving Mulder and Scully alone. Scully wearing a pained
     look.

                            MULDER
               Whatever you told them in there, you
               don't have to protect me.

                            SCULLY
               All I told them was the truth.

                            MULDER
               They're trying to divide us on this,
               Scully. We can't let them.

                            SCULLY
               They have divided us, Mulder. They're
               splitting us up.

                            MULDER
                      (beat)
               What? What are you talking about?

                            SCULLY
               I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow
               for remediation and reassignment...

                            MULDER
               Why?

                            SCULLY
               I think you must have an idea. They
               cited a history of problems relating
               back to 1993.

                            MULDER
               They were the ones that put us
               together.

                            SCULLY
               Because they wanted me to invalidate
               your work, your investigations into
               the paranormal. But I think this goes
               deeper than that.

                            MULDER
               This isn't about you, Scully. They're
               doing this to me.

                            SCULLY
               They're not doing this, Mulder.
                      (off his look)
               I left behind a career in medicine
               because I thought I might make a
               difference at the FBI. When they
               recruited me they told me women made
               up nine percent of the bureau. I felt
               this was not an impediment, but an
               opportunity to distinguish myself. But
               it hasn't turned out that way. And
               now, if I were to be transferred to
               Omaha, or Wichita or some field office
               where I'm sure I could rise, it just
               doesn't hold the interest for me it
               once did. Not after what I've seen and
               done.

                            MULDER
               You're... quitting?

                            SCULLY
               There's really no reason left for me
               to stay anymore.
                      (off his look)
               Maybe you should ask yourself if your
               heart's still in it, too.

     The door opens to the hearing room again now. A.D.
     Skinner steps part way out, gesturing to him.

                            SKINNER
               Agent Mulder. You're up.

                            SCULLY
                      (regretfully)
               I'm sorry. Good luck.

     Mulder rises. Scully studying his poorly disguised hurt.
     Before he turns and goes into the room.

     Scully watching the door close behind him. Her feelings
     poorly disguised, too.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON A SHOOTER OF TEQUILA being poured. CAMERA
     ADJUSTING to reveal the ATTRACTIVE BARMAID tipping the
     bottle. Pushing it across the bar to where TWO EMPTY
     SHOOTERS sit, making the exchange.

                            BARMAID
               I'd say this about exceeds your
               minimum daily requirement.

     The person she's talking to us:

     MULDER

     He sits by himself on a stool, staring down at the bar.
     Staring at the shooter which he spins with his fingers.

                            BARMAID
               Gotta train for this kind of heavy
               lifting.

     Mulder tosses back the shooter anyway. She watches him
     as she retrieves the small shot glass, intrigued by his
     dark silence.

                            BARMAID
               Poopy day?

                            MULDER
               Yup.

                            BARMAID
               A woman?
                      (Mulder shakes his head no)
               Work.

     Mulder nods, pointing to the tequila bottle again. The
     Barmaid agrees to pour another one, reluctantly.

     ANGLE OVER TO A MAN AT THE END OF THE BAR

     Staring at Mulder intently. He's older than Mulder,
     dressed in an old Brooke Brothers light summer suit.
     Mulder notices him, feels his gaze, but doesn't give it
     thought.

     RESUME BARMAID, MULDER

                            BARMAID
               What do you do?

                            MULDER
               What do I do.
                      (off her curious look)
               I'm a key figure in an ongoing
               government charade. An annoyance to my
               superiors. A joke among my peers.
               "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder.
               Whose sister was abducted by aliens
               when he was a kid. Who now chases
               little green men with a badge and a
               gun, shouting to the heavens and
               anyone who'll listen that the fix is
               in. That our government's hip to the
               truth and a part of the conspiracy.
               That the sky is falling and when it
               hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of
               all time.

     She stares at him for a moment, startled by his drunken
     screed. She pulls back the shooter she's just poured
     Mulder.

                            BARMAID
               I think that about does it, Spooky.

                            MULDER
               Does what?

                            BARMAID
               Why don't you go home to the old lady
               --

                            MULDER
               Sorry. Don't have one.

     Mulder slides off his stool, noticing:

     MULDER'S POV

     The Watchful Man is gone.

     RESUME MULDER

     He feints toward the door, then reverses direction.
     Heads to the back of the place.


     INT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder appears, moving to the bathroom door. Only to
     find an OUT OF ORDER sign on it. He moves to the woman's
     room, but it's locked. Gathering what's left of his
     wits, Mulder does what any red-blooded man would do in
     this situation. He goes to the back door of the bar and
     exits into the alley.


     EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - NIGHT

     Mulder has found a place against a wall, between two
     dumpsters. Jerking around in surprise at the sound of a
     VOICE.

                            WATCHFUL MAN'S VOICE
               That official FBI business?

                            MULDER
                      (startled)
               What?


     ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE MAN FROM THE BAR

     He's not far from Mulder. His name is KURTZWEIL.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Bet the Bureau's accusing you of the
               same thing in Dallas.

     Mulder's weirded out as the stranger moves to him un-
     threateningly.

                            MULDER
               How's that?

                            KURTZWEIL
               Standing around holding your yank
               while bombs are exploding.

     Kurtzweil enjoys a little laugh over this.

                            MULDER
               Do I know you?

                            KURTZWEIL
               No. I've been watching your career for
               a good while. Back when you were just
               a promising young agent -- before
               that.

     Mulder stares at this man as he finishes, zipping up.

                            MULDER
               You follow me out here for a reason?

                            KURTZWEIL
               Yeah, I did.

     Kurtzweil unzips his own pants now. There is a moment;
     one of those awkward moments where Mulder's not sure
     what's about to happen. But Kurtzweil's just relieving
     himself, too. Shuffling up to the wall, Mulder takes
     this as an opportunity to head back toward the bar. But
     Kurtzweil hails him again.

                            KURTZWEIL
               My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin
               Kurtzweil.

                            MULDER
               I know the name. Why?

                            KURTZWEIL
               Old friend of your father's.

     Kurtzweil continues peeing. Knows this got Mulder's
     attention.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Back at the Department of State. We
               were what you might call fellow
               travelers, but his disenchantment
               outlasted mine.
                      (beat)
               I never believed in the Project.

     Mulder stares at Kurtzweil now. He's being toyed with.
     He turns, opens the door into the bar. As Kurtzweil gets
     a little louder.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Oh, come on. Don't pretend you don't
               know about the Project. Your father
               died for it. Your sister was taken
               because of it.

     Kurtzweil finishes nature's call. Zips up. Heads after
     Mulder.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT

     Mulder is coming from the back. Kurtzweil moving to
     catch up. And he does, at the coat stand. The place has
     pretty much cleared out, except for the Barmaid and some
     help.

                            MULDER
               How'd you find me?

                            KURTZWEIL
               Heard you come here now and again.
               Figured you'd be needing a little
               drinky tonight.

                            MULDER
               You a reporter?

                            KURTZWEIL
               I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned
               that. OB-GYN.

                            MULDER
               Who sent you?

                            KURTZWEIL
               I came on my own. After reading about
               the bombing in Dallas.

                            MULDER
               Well, if you've got something to tell
               me, you've got as long as it takes me
               to hail a cab...

     Mulder starts out the door, but Kurtzweil grabs his
     arm.

                            KURTZWEIL
               They're going to pin Dallas on you,
               Agent Mulder. But there was nothing
               you could've done. Nothing anyone
               could've done to prevent that bomb
               from going off. Because the truth is
               something you'd never have guessed;
               never have predicted.

     Mulder pulls away from Kurtzweil, but Kurtzweil dogs him
     to:


     EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT

     The street is empty, the hour is late. Mulder moves to
     the curb.

                            MULDER
               And what's that?

                            KURTZWEIL
               S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or
               intended to defuse the bomb.

                            MULDER
                      (rhetorical disbelief)
               He just let it explode.

                            KURTZWEIL
               What's the question nobody's asking?
               Why that building? Why not the Federal
               Building?

                            MULDER
               The Federal Building was too well
               guarded.

                            KURTZWEIL
               No. They put the bomb in the building
               across the street because it DID have
               federal offices. The Federal Emergency
               Management Agency had a provisional
               medical quarantine office there. Which
               is where the bodies were found. But
               that's the thing...

     Mulder's got his hand up for a taxi coming. It's pulling
     over as Mulder steps from the curb, stepping away from
     Kurtzweil.

                            KURTZWEIL
               ...the thing you didn't know. That
               you'd never think to check.

     Mulder's got the taxi door open, turning to Kurtzweil.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Those people were already dead.

                            MULDER
               Before the bomb went off?

                            KURTZWEIL
               That's what I'm saying.

     Mulder stares at Kurtzweil for a moment.

                            MULDER
               Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran
               of the bureau --

                            KURTZWEIL
               Michaud was a patriot. The men he's
               loyal to know their way around Dallas.
               They blew that building to hide
               something. Maybe something even they
               couldn't predict.

                            MULDER
               You're saying they destroyed an entire
               building to hide the bodies of three
               firemen...?

                            KURTZWEIL
               And one little boy.

     Mulder gets in the cab, closes the door. Rolls down the
     window.

                            MULDER
               I think you're full of shit.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Do you?

     Kurtzweil raps the top of the roof and steps away from
     the car. As the taxi takes off. WE STAY WITH KURTZWEIL,
     watching Mulder's cab speed away. (NOTE: This should
     also be covered from inside the cab with Mulder, to play
     the scene out on him.)

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. AGENT SCULLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Scully is in bed, lying awake. Staring at the ceiling.
     When she reacts to a POUNDING AT HER DOOR.

     INT. SCULLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON THE FRONT DOOR. Scully peeks in the peephole.
     Then she removes the safety chain, opening the door.

                            MULDER
                      (strangely intense)
               I wake you?

                            SCULLY
               No.

                            MULDER
               Why not? It's three AM.

     Scully gets a whiff of his breath. As he moves past her
     into the apartment. Radiating a kind of manic
     intensity.

                            SCULLY
               Are you drunk, Mulder?

                            MULDER
               I was until about an hour ago.

                            SCULLY
               Is that before or after you got the
               idea to come here?

     Mulder looks at her curiously.

                            MULDER
               What are you implying, Scully?

                            SCULLY
                      (frowning)
               I thought you may have gotten drunk
               and decided to come here to talk me
               out of quitting.

                            MULDER
               Is that what you'd like me to do?

     Scully hesitates. Long enough to indicate her own
     wavering heart.

                            SCULLY
               Go home, Mulder. It's late.

                            MULDER
               Get dressed, Scully.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder -- what are you doing?

                            MULDER
               Just get dressed. I'll explain on the
               way.

     EXT. TEXAS FLATLAND - NIGHT

     The moon is rising over the horizon, across the
     curvilinear distance of endless scrub and sagebrush.
     When FLYING OBJECTS cross between it and us, their forms
     unidentifiable in the rising heat waves off the earth.
     But they are moving towards us, SILHOUETTES in the
     background of the moon.

     They move silently, their size INCREASING as they move
     closer. And then we hear them, moments before they
     arrive at our position, UNMARKED HELICOPTERS just
     overhead. Hugging the ground as they blast across the
     dark Texas night.


     INT. UNMARKED BLACK HELICOPTERS - NIGHT

     Flying at dangerously low altitude over the almost
     featureless night landscape. Heading for something that
     we see ahead in the distance. What looks like a LARGE
     GLOWING DOME surrounded by the lights of a residential
     area we've already seen, on the edge of suburban Dallas
     sprawl.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. SMALL DIRT FIELD - CENTRAL TEXAS - NIGHT

     The field where the kids had been digging has been
     transformed into some kind of worksite.

     A LARGE WHITE DOMED TENT has been erected over almost
     the entire patch of ground, surrounded by the CARGO
     TRUCKS that we saw earlier, and more unmarked vans and
     trucks. There are men in black fatigues moving about,
     and scientists in haz-mat suits.

     As the UNMARKED BLACK HELICOPTERS bank overhead. Coming
     in for a landing in the glow cast from the tents. CAMERA
     MOVING TOWARD one of the helicopters as it lightly
     touches down and its black door swings open. A man
     stepping out, and as CAMERA PUSHES UP INTO HIS FACE we
     recognize him as The Cigarette Smoking Man.

     The figure that we've come to know as an assassin and a
     model of modern self-interest and amorality. One of the
     central protagonists in the conspiracy to keep the truth
     from the American people about the existence of
     extraterrestrial life.

     Something known only as: "The Project."

     He walks out from under the whirring prop, just far
     enough to get a flame from his lighter, to get a
     cigarette lit. As we:

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. LARGE WHITE TENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     A SCIENTIST in a haz-mat suit is moving through the maze
     of clear plastic tubing that divides work areas within
     the tent. Areas where scientists are working at tables
     doing what appears to be some kind of high-tech
     archeological work. It is a hive of activity within, as
     the Scientist leads us past the REFRIGERATION UNITS to
     the earthen hole where Dr. Bronschweig (we've met him
     earlier, coming out of a med-evac chopper that landed
     when the tent city was erected) appears out of the
     earthen hole, which is reason for all this excitement.
     Climbing out A CLEAR HATCH which has been fashioned to
     cover the hole. Seeing:

     THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

     Now suited up himself. Bronschweig approaches him.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               You've got something to show me.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
                      (nervous excitement)
               Yes.

     INT. ICE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

     What we originally established as icy, and what later
     became the unfrozen Texas field where the boys
     discovered the human skull, has been turned to its
     previously icy state. Thanks to two large vents that Dr.
     Bronschweig is pointing at:

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               We brought the atmosphere back down to
               freezing in order to control the
               development, which is nothing like
               we've ever seen.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Brought on by what?

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Heat, I think. The coincident invasion
               of a host, the fireman, and an
               environment that raised his basic body
               temperature above ninety eight point
               six.

     They step over to a section of the cave which has been
     draped with more plastic, the lights from inside this
     are giving off a cool blue light (passing by TWO
     PORTABLE DRILLING RIGS which have been erected, their
     pumps moving up and down like rocking horses.)
     Bronschweig pushes away the plastic, revealing A MAN
     lying on a gurney draped in plastic. he is hooked up to
     various and sundry machines which are monitoring his
     life signs.

     His skin has turned almost translucent, the veins and
     capillaries now clearly visible, as is his pulse. His
     heartbeat sending life-sustaining blood and energy
     through his body.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               This man's still alive.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Technically and biologically, though
               he'll never recover.

     The CSM is shaking his head in nervous, uneasy wonder.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               How can this be?

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               The developing organism is using his
               life energy, digesting bone and
               tissue. We've just slowed the
               process.

     Bronschweig redirects a light so that it shines hard
     into the man's face and; then we see it. Movement.

     CLOSE ON MAN'S FACE

     Though the man's eyes still blink occasionally, we can
     actually see through his tissue and the bones in his
     skull to see something IS LIVING INSIDE HIM.

     ANGLE UP ON CSM AND BRONSCHWEIG

     The Cigarette Smoking Man's mind is working intently on
     all the possibilities, and consequences.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Do you want me to destroy this one,
               too? Before it gestates?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               No. No...we need to try our vaccine on
               it.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               And if it's unsuccessful?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Incinerate it. Like the others.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               This man's family will want to see the
               body laid to rest.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Tell them he was trying to save the
               young boy's life, and that he died
               heroically like the other firemen.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Of what?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               They seemed to buy our story about the
               Hanta virus. You'll make sure the
               families are taken care of
               financially, along with a sizeable
               donation to the community.
                      (beat)
               Maybe a small roadside memorial.

     He watches the CSM exit, then back to the prostrate
     fireman.

     CLOSE ON PROSTRATE FIREMAN

     There is more movement within his body. Within his chest
     and neck, as if the creature gestating inside is
     continuing to stretch and grow. So that now we can see
     one of its BLACK EYES staring from through the clear
     flesh of the fireman. An eye which BLINKS at us. As we:

     Mulder and Scully appear at the end of a long hall.
     Moving TOWARD CAMERA where a YOUNG NAVAL GUARD sits in
     f.g. As a LEGEND appears, to establish.

     Mulder and Scully moving the long distance to the
     Guard's station. Where the Guard looks up at them with
     military scrutiny.

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
               ID and floor you're visiting.

     They both show their FBI IDs.

                            MULDER
               We're going to the morgue.

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
               That area is currently off limits to
               anyone other than authorized medical
               personnel.

                            MULDER
               On whose orders?

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
               General McAddie's.

     Mulder doesn't miss a beat.

                            MULDER
               General McAddie is who requested our
               coming here. We were awakened at three
               AM and told to get down here
               immediately.

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
               I don't know anything about that.

                            MULDER
               Well, call General McAddie.

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
               I don't have his number.

                            MULDER
               They can patch you in through the
               switchboard.

     The Guard is nervous about this, checking his watch. He
     picks up the phone, going through a large directory.

                            MULDER
               Hey! We don't have time to dick around
               here watching you demonstrate your
               ignorance in the chain of command. The
               order came direct from General
               McAddie. Call him. We'll conduct our
               business while you confirm
               authorization.

     Mulder is already directing Scully past the Naval Guard
     who tentatively picks up the phone again.

                            YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
                      (to their backs)
               Why don't you go on ahead head and
               I'll confirm authorization.

                            MULDER
               Thank you.

     LEADING Mulder and Scully, moving they've pulled off a
     con.

                            MULDER
               Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on
               orders of a general?

     INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - MORGUE FREEZER - NIGHT

     TRACKING TABLE HEIGHT across gurneys where white
     sheet-wrapped bodies lie. CAMERA LANDING ON Scully.
     Standing next to Mulder who is undoing the peculiar
     ropey stitching on the sheet used to secure the bodies.

                            SCULLY
               This is one of the firemen who died in
               Dallas?

                            MULDER
               According to this tag.

                            SCULLY
               And you're looking for?

                            SCULLY
               I can tell you that without even
               looking at him.
                      (off Mulder's look)
               Conclusive organ failure due to
               proximal exposure to source and flying
               debris.

     Scully pulls out an autopsy report that was laid on the
     gurney under the body of the sheet-wrapped corpse.

                            SCULLY
               This body has already been autopsied,
               Mulder. You can tell from the way it's
               been wrapped and dressed.

     Undeterred, Mulder works to get the sheet off. The first
     thing we notice is that he's still in his fireman's
     uniform. His face looks familiar to us, not because we
     know him, but because of the translucency of skin we saw
     in the other fireman. (We will also notice he's
     missing an arm, a leg and large part of his torso.)

                            MULDER
               Does this fit the description you just
               read me, Scully?

     Scully comes around, reacting to what she sees.

                            SCULLY
               Oh my God. This man's tissue...

     Scully is quickly removing a pair of latex gloves,
     stretching them on to palpate the man's tissue.

                            MULDER
               It's like jelly.

                            SCULLY
               There's some kind of cellular
               breakdown. It's completely edematous.

     She palpates the spongy skin on the man's face, neck.
     Unbuttoning the uniform now, seeing:

                            SCULLY
               And there's been no autopsy performed.
               There's no Y incision here; no
               internal exam.

                            MULDER
               You're telling me the cause of death
               on the report is false. That this man
               didn't die from an explosion, or from
               flying debris.

                            SCULLY
               I don't know what killed this man. I'm
               not sure if anybody else could claim
               to either.

                      (pushing him)
               You knew this man didn't die at the
               bomb site before we got here.

                            MULDER
               I'd been told as much.

                            SCULLY
               You're saying the bombing was a
               cover-up. Of what?

                            MULDER
               I don't know. But I have a hunch what
               you're going to find here isn't
               anything that can be categorized or
               easily referenced.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder, this is going to take some
               time, and somebody's going to figure
               out soon enough we're not even
               supposed to be here.
                      (beat)

               We're being blamed for these deaths.
               Scully, I want to know what this man
               died of. Don't you?

     Scully stares at Mulder, then back down at the body. How
     can she refuse, given the finality and the personal
     appeal of the request? After a moment's hesitation, she
     turns to the body, and to the tray table of tools
     nearby. Resigned, if not resolved.

     forward toward a spot where two ARLINGTON PD cruisers
     are pulled up to the curb. Mulder checks the address he
     has written down.

                            MULDER
                      (to the Cabbie)
               I think this is it up here.


     EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

     The taxi pulls over and Mulder exits, starting up the
     steps of a walk up where the door is open.


     INT. KURTZWEIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     There are UNIFORMED OFFICERS inside, and a DETECTIVE.
     Mulder steps into an office. FOUR PAIRS of eyes give him
     the once over. The Detective stepping over to him.

                            MULDER
               Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?

                            DETECTIVE
                      (suspiciously)
               You got some kind of business with
               him?

                            MULDER
               I'm looking for him.

                            DETECTIVE
               Looking for him for what?

     Mulder pulls out his ID, flashes it at the Detective.

                            DETECTIVE
                      (to his partners)
               Feds are looking for him, too.
                      (turns to Mulder)
               Real nice business he's got, huh?

                            MULDER
               What's that?

                            DETECTIVE
               Selling naked pictures of little kids
               over his computer.

     Mulder nods, though this is news to him. He steps in a
     little further, noticing a shelf lined with books. Their
     spines all have the author's name written large: DR.
     ALVIN KURTZWEIL.

     Mulder picks up one of these books, with the title: THE
     FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE GLOBAL DOMINATION CONSPIRACY.

                            DETECTIVE
               You looking for him for some other
               reason?

                            MULDER
               Yeah, I had an appointment for a
               pelvic examination.

     They stare at Mulder like he's a sicko. He smiles and
     they break into RAUCOUS LAUGHTER.

                            DETECTIVE
               You want a call if we turn up
               Kurtzweil?

                            MULDER
               No. Don't bother.

     Mulder puts the book back among the others on the shelf.
     And exits. Onto:


     RESUME EXT. KURTZWEIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Mulder starting up the street when he notices:

     MULDER'S POV

     Kurtzweil has stepped from between two apartments. He's
     staring at Mulder, nodding furtively to him. Then
     stepping back.

     RESUME MULDER

     Slows, then speeds up.


     EXT. SPACE BETWEEN TWO APARTMENTS - NIGHT

     Mulder appears at the end of the narrow walkway, finding
     Kurtzweil tucked a few yards in.

                            KURTZWEIL
               See this bullshit...? Somebody knows
               I'm talking to you.

                            MULDER
               Not according to the men in blue.

                            KURTZWEIL
               What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual
               battery of a patient? I've had my
               license taken away in three states.

                            MULDER
               They want to discredit you -- for
               what?

                            KURTZWEIL
               For what? Because I'm a dangerous man.
               Because I know too much about the
               truth.

                            MULDER
               You mean that apocalyptic trash you
               write? I knew your name was familiar.
               I just didn't know why.

                            KURTZWEIL
               You know my work?

                            MULDER
                      (pointedly)
               Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in
               bigoted ideas about race or genocide.
               I don't believe in the Elders of Zion,
               the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg
               Group or in a oneworld Jew run
               government --

                            KURTZWEIL
               I don't either, but it sure sells
               books.

     He says it with an ironic smile. Causing Mulder to turn
     and start off. But Kurtzweil hurries to grab him, to
     prevent this.

                            KURTZWEIL
               I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I,
               Agent Mulder?

                            MULDER
               How?

                            KURTZWEIL
               I picked up the historical document of
               the venality and hypocrisy of the
               American government. The daily
               newspaper.

                            MULDER
               You said the firemen and the boy were
               found in the temporary offices of the
               Federal Emergency Management Agency.
               Why?

                            KURTZWEIL
               According to the newspaper, FEMA had
               been called out to manage an outbreak
               of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar
               with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?

                            MULDER
               It was a deadly virus spread by field
               mice in the Southwest U.S. several
               years ago.

                            KURTZWEIL
               And are you familiar with FEMA? What
               the Federal Emergency Management
               Agency's real power is? FEMA allows
               the White House to suspend
               constitutional government upon
               declaration of a national emergency.
               To create a non-elected government.
               Think about that.
                      (beat)
               What is an agency with such broad
               sweeping power doing managing a small
               viral outbreak in suburban Texas?

                            MULDER
               Are you saying it wasn't such a small
               outbreak?

     Kurtzweil is getting intense now.

                            KURTZWEIL
               I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus.

     They are both given a start when a POLICE CRUISER rolls
     by on the street, giving a burp of its siren. It rolls
     past as the two men tuck in tighter.

                            MULDER
               What was it?

                            KURTZWEIL
               When we were young men in the
               military, your father and I were
               recruited for a project. They told us
               it was biological warfare. A virus.
               There were rumors about its origins.

                            MULDER
               What killed those men?

                            KURTZWEIL
               What killed them I won't even write
               about. I tell you, they'd do more than
               just harass me. They have the future
               to protect.

                            MULDER
               I'll know soon enough.

                            KURTZWEIL
                      (worked up)
               What killed those men can't be
               identified in simple medical terms. My
               god, we can't even wrap our minds
               around something as obvious as HIV.
               We have no context for what killed
               those men, or any appreciation of the
               scale in which it will be unleashed in
               the future. Of how it will be
               transmitted; of the environmental
               factors involved.

                            MULDER
               A plague?

                            KURTZWEIL
               The plague to end all plagues, Agent
               Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet
               war. The systematic release of an
               indiscriminate organism for which the
               men who will bring it on still have no
               cure. They've been working on this for
               fifty years. While the rest of the
               world was fighting gooks and commies
               these men have been secretly
               negotiating a planned Armageddon.

                            MULDER
               Negotiating with whom?

                            KURTZWEIL
               I think you know. The timetable has
               been set. It will happen on a holiday,
               when people are away from their homes.
               When our elected officials are at
               their resorts or out of the country.
               The President will declare a state of
               emergency, at which time all federal
               agencies, all government will come
               under the power of the Federal
               Emergency Management Agency. FEMA,
               Agent Mulder. The secret government.

                            MULDER
               And they tell me I'm paranoid.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Something's gone wrong -- something
               unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and
               dig. Or you're only going to find out
               like the rest of the country, Agent
               Mulder. When it's too late.

     Kurtzweil turns, starts off. Mulder stares after him.
     Then:

                            MULDER
               How can I reach you?

                            KURTZWEIL
               You can't.

     Mulder moves to catch up to Kurtzweil, pulling out his
     cell phone. Kurtzweil stops, turns. Truly and intensely
     paranoid. Mulder makes him take the cell phone.

                            MULDER
               No calling Hawaii.

     Mulder turns and moves back out onto the street.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. MORGUE - PATHOLOGY LAB - NIGHT

     Agent Scully wears a surgical mask, latex gloves.
     Working on the body of the fireman...when she reacts to
     a NOISE. Doors opening, closing somewhere o.s. CAMERA
     MEDIUM WHIPS to a door where she and Mulder entered the
     morgue. Where...the Young Naval Guard and TWO MPs push
     through and enter. They stand looking at:

     THEIR POV

     Where Scully stood moments ago, there is now just an
     unattended gurney. A sheet over the fireman's body.
     Scully is gone.

     RESUME YOUNG NAVAL GUARD, MPs

     Tense. Listening, watchful. Moving into the room.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - MORGUE FREEZER - NIGHT

     Scully enters the space where she and Mulder found the
     fireman's body. Trying to quietly click the door shut.
     Standing now near the door, tense, listening. When the
     CHIRPING of her cell phone breaks the tense silence. She
     pats frantically at her coat, trying to get it answered
     before it rings again. Unsuccessfully. Finally getting
     a hold of it and hitting the send button. Scully sits
     breathing heavy, nervous breaths -- waiting for the
     Young Naval Guard to come running in.

                            MULDER'S VOICE (FILTER)
               Scully...?

     She puts the phone slowly up to her face.

                            SCULLY
                      (low whisper)
               Yeah.

     INTERCUT WITH:


     INT. PHONE BOOTH - WASHINGTON D.C. - MORNING

     Mulder's at the pay phone.

                            MULDER
               Why are you whispering?

                            SCULLY
               I can't really talk right now.

                            MULDER
               What did you find?

                            SCULLY
               Evidence of a massive infection.

                            MULDER
               What kind of infection?

                            SCULLY
               I don't know.

                            MULDER
               Scully -- listen to me. I'm going
               home, then I'm booking a flight to
               Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket,
               too.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder --

                            MULDER
               I need you there with me. I need your
               expertise on this. The bomb we found
               was meant to destroy those bodies and
               whatever they were infected by.

                            SCULLY
               I've got a hearing tomorrow --

                            MULDER
               -- I'll have you back for it, Scully.
               Maybe with evidence that could blow
               that meeting away.

                            SCULLY
               Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way
               past the point of common sense here
               --

     Scully hears VOICES in the hall outside the freezer.

                                             CUT TO:


     MULDER

                            MULDER
               Scully...? Hello...?

     But the line OFF, goes dead. Mulder  hangs up the
     phone, frustrated. Exits the booth in a hurry.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - MORGUE FREEZER - NIGHT

     The door opens and the Young Naval Guard steps inside,
     followed by the MPs. Moving into the room.

     LOW ANGLE - TRACKING

     with the Naval Guard's feet as they pass by the rolling
     carts on which bodies are laid. TRACKING to find SCULLY,
     where she hides under one of the carts. Huddled and
     cold.

     The Guard's feet stop near here. He stands motionless
     for a moment, then moves off. HOLD her until the door
     slams shut.


     INT. FBI OFFICE - DALLAS - MORNING - MULDER

     enters a forensics lab with a FIELD AGENT. A LEGEND
     reads: FBI FIELD OFFICE, DALLAS : 11:20 AM.

                            FIELD AGENT
               You're looking for what amounts to a
               needle in a haystack. I'm afraid the
               explosion was so devastating there
               hasn't been a whole lot we've been
               able to put together just yet.

     They are walking amid BOXES of evidence. STACKS of
     debris. There are FORENSIC TECHS sorting through this
     material. It looks like the most tedious and painstaking
     job in the world.

                            MULDER
               I'm looking for anything out of the
               ordinary. Maybe something from the
               FEMA offices where the bodies were
               found.

                            FIELD AGENT
               We weren't expecting to find those
               remains, of course. They went right
               off to Washington.

                            MULDER
               Was there anything in those offices
               that didn't go to D.C.?

                            FIELD AGENT
               Some bone fragments came up in the
               sift this morning. We thought there'd
               been another fatality, but we found
               out FEMA had recovered them from an
               archeological site out of town.

                            MULDER
               Have you examined them?

                            FIELD AGENT
               No. Just fossils, far as I know.

     Mulder is nodding, when both men look off at something
     that's caught their attention o.s.

                            MULDER
               I'd like this person to take a look,
               if you don't mind.

     THEIR POV - AGENT SCULLY

     Standing in the doorway to the lab. She looks at Mulder
     as if she's come in spite of her misgivings. Moving
     toward them now.

                            FIELD AGENT
               Let me just see if I can lay my hands
               on what you're looking for.

     The Field Agent nods to Scully as he passes, exiting
     deeper into the room. Leaving Mulder and Scully by
     themselves momentarily.

                            MULDER
               You said you weren't coming?

                            SCULLY
               I wasn't planning on it. Particularly
               after spending a half hour in cold
               storage this morning. But I got a
               better look at the blood and tissue
               samples I took from the firemen.

                            MULDER
               What did you find?

                            SCULLY
                      (voice lowering pointedly)
               Something I couldn't show to anyone
               else. Not without more information.
               And not without causing the kind of
               attention I'd just as soon avoid right
               now.
                      (off Mulder's look)
               The virus those men were infected with
               contains a protein coat I've never
               seen before. What it did to them it
               did extremely fast. And unlike the
               AIDS virus or any other aggressive
               strain, it survives very nicely
               outside the body.

                            MULDER
               How was it contracted?

                            SCULLY
               That I don't know. But if it's through
               simple contact of blood to blood, and
               if it doesn't respond to conventional
               treatments, it could be a serious
               health threat.

     Mulder's reaction is postponed, or at least subdued by
     the reappearance of the field agent.

                            FIELD AGENT
               Like I said, these are fossils, and
               they weren't near the blast center, so
               they aren't going to tell you much.

                            SCULLY
               May I?

     He offers Scully the small glass vials in which the bone
     fragments have been separated. She takes them, looking
     at them on her way over to the microscope. Tapping out a
     tiny fragment onto the viewing bed. She puts her eyes
     down to the stereoscope eyepieces, then almost
     immediately looks up at Mulder who translates this look
     almost instantly.

                            MULDER
               You said you knew the location of the
               archeological site where these were
               found.

                            FIELD AGENT
               Show you right on a map.

     Off Mulder and Scully's traded looks:

     EXT. SMALL PUBLIC PARK - WEST TEXAS - DAY

     The domed white tent is still in place, the fleet of
     trucks and equipment surrounding it unmanned. Several
     large sound-dampened generators still hum away, but the
     work being done here would be a mystery to anyone who
     didn't have access to the tent.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. DOMED TENT - DAY

     An electric Bobcat-like bulldozer maneuvers a very high
     tech-looking CLEAR CONTAINER to the edge of the earthen
     hole. The container has monitors and gauges on it,
     oxygen tanks and what looks like a circulation
     refrigeration unit. A self-contained life support
     system. The inside of the container is covered with a
     thin layer of frost.

     When the small bulldozer gets the container over near
     the hole, several technicians lift it down off the
     shovel, hand carrying it toward the hole opening. As Dr.
     Bronschweig APPEARS, moving to a ladder that leads down
     into the hole. He's dressed in a haz-mat suit, with the
     hood off.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               I need to have those settings checked
               and re-set. I need a steady minus two
               Celsius through the transfer of the
               body, after I administer the vaccine.

     The men nod to Bronschweig, begin checking the settings
     as Bronschweig puts his hood on, starts down into the
     hole, through the clear hatch.


     INT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - DAY

     The refrigeration vents are still pumping in arctic air
     when Dr. Bronschweig appears descending a fixed ladder.
     It is dark in here, save for the ice blue glow of light
     coming from the plastic draped area where we saw the
     fireman acting as an incubator/host for some kind of
     organism growing inside him.

     Bronschweig steps over to this area, moves aside the
     plastic drapery to enter.


     ANGLE INSIDE, PLASTIC LINED AREA

     Where the body of the fireman is still inside the
     quarantine bubble litter in f.g. Bronschweig takes out of
     his pocket a SYRINGE and an AMPULE. Turning now to the
     body. Stepping to it. Moving a work light, as he had
     done for the Cigarette Smoking Man, so that it shines on
     the face of the fireman. But when he does this,
     Bronschweig nearly JUMPS, his breath stolen away.
     Reacting to:

     ANGLE ON FIREMAN'S BODY

     The chest and torso have imploded. It has been turned
     into a muddy mass of blood-stained jelly; bone and
     tissue melted into an oozing mass which has sunken due
     to the fact that the creature which was inside is now
     gone.

     CAMERA WHIPS from Bronschweig to the wall. To the
     temperature gauge which reads about 6 degrees Celsius.
     WHIPPING BACK to Bronschweig who is now panicked.

     INT. DOMED TENT - DAY

     ANGLE DOWN ON EARTHEN HOLE, where the Technicians
     Bronschweig was speaking to minutes ago react to
     Bronschweig's MUFFLED VOICE. He's down below them in the
     cave, looking up.

     Pulling his haz-mat hood off. Yelling up to them.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               It's gone!

                            TECHNICIAN
               It's what?

     OVER THE TECHNICIANS TO BRONSCHWEIG DOWN BELOW

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               It's left the body. I think it's
               gestated --

     Bronschweig is starting up the ladder when something
     stops him.

     CREATURE'S POV OF BRONSCHWEIG

     He stands frozen on the ladder, squinting into the
     darkness.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Wait -- I see it --

     BRONSCHWEIG'S POV

     In the shadows there is movement, the creature edging
     into the light cast from the draped area. We see it is
     fully formed -- a replica of the Creature we saw at the
     opening of our story. Though it does not make any kind
     of aggressive move. As if, newborn, it is tentative.

     RESUME BRONSCHWEIG - CREATURE'S POV

     He remains standing on a rung of the ladder for a
     moment, then takes a gentle step back down to the
     ground.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
                      (nervous wonder)
               Oh my god. Oh my god.

                            TECHNICIAN
               You see it?

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Yes. It's...amazing. You want to get
               down here --
                      (sotto to himself)
               Jesus Lord...so much for little green
               men.

     Dr. Bronschweig moves shakily to put the syringe in the
     ampule again...when, suddenly, the Creature STRIKES.
     CAMERA RUSHING FORWARD TO BRONSCHWEIG.

     OVERHEAD ANGLE - OVER THE TECHNICIANS

     As the Creature slams into Bronschweig, knocking him out
     of the line of sight from the top of the earthen hole.

     There are SCREAMS OF PAIN from Bronschweig, then they
     abate.

     RESUME INT. ICE CAVE

     Bronschweig can be heard, but not clearly seen. He is in
     the shadows himself now.

     Trying to pick himself up, and when he manages to do
     this, teetering back into the light we see that he is
     bloodied. He is hurt, injured. Making his way back
     toward the patch of light that comes from the hole
     above. Hoping to see that help is on its way, while
     keeping a watchful, wary and worried eye on the shadows,
     for another attack by the Creature.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Hey -- I need help.

     But the Technicians looking down on him offer him
     nothing of the sort. All they do is quickly close the
     clear hatch that seals Bronschweig inside the cave.

                            DR. BRONSCHWEIG
               Hey!

     But he gets no answer, climbing the ladder shakily. A
     moment later the first Bobcat shovel-full of dirt falls
     onto the clear hatch and partially obscures the light.
     They are burying Bronschweig alive.


     INT. DOMED TENT - DAY

     ANGLE DOWN ON BRONSCHWEIG through the glass hatch. His
     SCREAMS continue. ADJUSTING to the small bulldozer which
     is quickly hauling the mound of excavated earth into the
     hole from which it came. While, all around, there is a
     hive of activity. Men running everywhere.

     in momentary high resolution, BEFORE IT ATTACKS CAMERA.
     Over and over, savaging Bronschweig in a violent fury.

     driving him off the ladder where the attack continues in
     momentary glimpses of teeth, of bloody flesh, and of
     OILY BLACK BLOOD being spattered about. At the

     A CHILD'S SCREAM OF JOY. ENGLISH CHILDREN are playing

     well-manicured garden of a man who the CAMERA FINDS IN
     F.G. -- the man we have come to know as THE
     WELL-MANICURED MAN. He is also a member of the syndicate
     running "The Project", though his venality is cloaked in
     civility and statesmanship. Right now he's watching the
     children from the back steps of his mansion, charmed by
     their game. When he is called by someone o.s.

               Sir -- you have a call.

     The Well-Manicured Man turns to see:

     Holds the door. After a moment the W.M.M. enters past
     the Valet. As the screams of the children continue to
     rise and fall.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Yes. A meeting is set. Tonight in
               London, to determine a course.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Who called this meeting?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane
               in Tunis.

     This pronouncement has the power of ending any further
     questions. An immediate sense of gravity of the
     situation. The W.M.M. hangs up, moves to the window
     where he sees some of the HELP is running from the
     house. The children have all gathered around a BOY who
     seems to have hurt himself. He's lifted and being
     carried by the man who's called the W.M.M. into the
     house.

     The Well-Manicured Man is admitted by a Valet. The

     A GROUP OF MEN are standing, looking at something on a
     TV monitor. A surveillance video. They turn when the
     W.M.M. enters. CAMERA FAVORING A SMALL LEAN MAN with
     close-cropped hair.

     He is at once elegant and imposing with eyes that hold
     you with laser-like acuity. He is CONRAD STRUGHOLD.

     The others are of various ethnicities, tailored and
     dignified. This might be a collection of U.N. delegates.
     Indeed some are.

     Their business here, however, doesn't represent anyone's
     interests but their own. As tipped by the attendance of
     a GROUP ELDER from the U.S. who we've come to know.

     But, more importantly, by the Cigarette Smoking Man who
     holds the VCR remote. He pauses the picture.

                            STRUGHOLD
               We began to worry. Some of us have
               traveled so far, and you are the last
               to arrive.

               I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke

     The non-response to this has the same effect as a
     reprimand. But the W.M.M. will not apologize of kowtow.

               We've been forced to reassess our role

               The virus no longer just invades the
               brain as a controlling organism. It's
               developed a way to modify the host
               body.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Into what?

               We're going to tell them what we've
               found. What we've learned. Turn over a
               body infected with the gestating

               digestives for the creation of a new
               race of alien lifeforms?!

                            STRUGHOLD
               Let me remind you who is the new race.
               And who is the old.

               anything from them; By pretending to
               ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall
               their plans to step up the timetable.
               To start Colonization early.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               And if it doesn't? By cooperating now
               we're but beggars to our demise! Our
               ignorance was in cooperating with the
               Colonists at all.

                            STRUGHOLD
               Cooperation is our only chance of
               saving ourselves.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               They still need us to carry out their
               preparations.

                            STRUGHOLD
               We'll continue to use them as they do
               us. If only to play for more time, to
               continue work on our vaccine.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Our vaccine may have no effect!

                            STRUGHOLD
               Well, without a cure for the virus,
               we're nothing more than digestives
               anyway.

     All eyes go to the Well-Manicured Man. He is respected,
     if not the odd man out in this room. But he is all
     restrained anger now.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               My lateness may have well been
               absence. A course has already been
               taken.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               There are complications.

     He turns back to the TV monitor where Mulder and Scully
     remain frozen on the screen.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Do they know?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Mulder was in Dallas when we were
               trying to dispose of evidence. He's
               gone back there again. Someone has
               tipped him.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Who?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Kurtzweil, we think.

                            STRUGHOLD
               We've allowed this man his freedom.
               His books have actually helped us to
               facilitate plausible denial. Has he
               outlived his usefulness to us?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               No one believes Kurtzweil or his
               books. He's a toiler. A crank.

                            STRUGHOLD
               And Mulder?

                            ELDER
               Our new situation makes us vulnerable.
               If he learns information as we do, he
               could jeopardize the Project's
               secrecy.

                            2ND ELDER
               Control of information means control
               of Mulder.

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               I can control Mulder. I've always
               controlled Mulder.

                            STRUGHOLD
               This may take another approach.

     He says this, casting his look toward the Well-Manicured
     Man. A look of cold malevolence. The W.M.M.'s reaction
     is disdain.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               You can't kill Mulder. He's got too
               much light on him.

                            STRUGHOLD
               You need not kill a man to destroy
               him.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
                      (personalizing the
                      inference)
               No, you need only take away what is
               most precious to him.

                                             HARD CUT TO:


     EXT. SMALL PUBLIC PARK - CENTRAL TEXAS - DAY

     AGENT SCULLY

     She stands against a backdrop of Texas flatland,
     squinting into the sun. Shaking her head.

                            SCULLY
               I don't know, Mulder...

     We are:

     WIDE ANGLE REVERSE, TO INCLUDE MULDER, standing in the
     middle of a park, replete with jungle gyms, playground
     equipment. All brand spanking new. They are standing
     right where there had once been a hard scrabble, parched
     and barren little field. Where the earthen hole had been
     dug by the young boys. And what had later been the site
     of so much activity by the group of scientists. But
     where there's now a park, thick green grass covering the
     parch of ground, including the spot where the hole had
     been.

                            SCULLY
               He didn't mention a park.

                            MULDER
               This is where he marked on the map,
               Scully. Where he says those fossils
               were unearthed.

                            SCULLY
               I don't see any evidence of an
               archeological or any other kind of
               digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm
               drain.

     Mulder scans the area, confounded. Shaking his head as
     they walk.

                            MULDER
               You're sure the fossils you looked at
               showed the same signs of deterioration
               you saw in the fireman's body in the
               morgue?

                            SCULLY
                      (nodding)
               The bone was porous, as if the virus
               of the causative microbe were
               digesting it.

                            MULDER
               And you've never seen anything like
               that?

                            SCULLY
               No.  It didn't show up on any of the
               immunohistochemical tests --

     Mulder is listening to all this while looking down at
     his feet:

                            MULDER
               This looks like new grass to you?

                            SCULLY
               It looks pretty green for this
               climate.

     Mulder stops, kneels, touches the thick green carpet of
     turf. He digs around, lifting up a corner of a new
     square.

                            MULDER
               Ground's dry about an inch down.
               Somebody just laid this down. Very
               recently, I'd say.

                            SCULLY
                      (looking off)
               All the equipment is brand new.

                            MULDER
               No irrigation system. Somebody's
               covering their tracks.

     They both turn, looking at something that's caught their
     attention on the street where their rental car is
     parked. Three kids, all of whom we recognize from
     earlier. Stevie's "friends".

     Tooling down the street on new BMX bikes. Reacting to
     Mulder's loud WHISTLE. This stops them, staring at
     Mulder blankly across the distance.

                            MULDER
               Hey!

     They don't answer. Just keep staring, squinting into the
     sun. Mulder and Scully start walking toward them.

                            SCULLY
               Do you live around here?

                            2ND BOY
               Yeah.

     As the Agents approach.

                            MULDER
               You see anybody digging here?

     The kids don't answer quickly.

                            2ND BOY
               Not supposed to talk about it.

                            SCULLY
               You're not supposed to talk about it?
               Who told you that?

                            3RD BOY
               Nobody.

                            MULDER
               Nobody. Same nobody who put this park
               in? That new equipment...
                      (off the boys guilty looks)
               They buy you these bikes?

     The kids shift uncomfortably.

                            SCULLY
               I think you better tell us.

                            2ND BOY
               We don't even know you.

                            SCULLY
               Well, we're FBI agents.

                            2ND BOY
               You're not FBI agents.

                            MULDER
               How do you know?

                            2ND BOY
               Cause FBI agents wear like suits and
               goofy ties. And dresses like my mom
               wears to church. Like on that one
               show.

     Mulder and Scully pull their badges. The kids' mouths
     drop.

                            MULDER
               Maybe you've been watching too much
               TV.

                            3RD BOY
               They all left twenty minutes ago.

                            4TH BOY
               Going that way.

     The kids all pointing in the same direction.


     EXT. CENTRAL TEXAS HIGHWAY - LATE DAY

     As Mulder and Scully's rental car RACES by at high
     speed.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. MULDER AND SCULLY'S RENTAL CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder at the wheel, foot to the floor. Scully's got a
     map out. The mood is urgent, tense.

                            MULDER
               Unmarked tanker trucks... what are
               archaeologists hauling out in tanker
               trucks?

                            SCULLY
               I don't know, Mulder.

                            MULDER
               And where are they going with it?

                            SCULLY
               That's the first question to answer,
               if we're going to find them.

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     EXT. CENTRAL HIGHWAY - LATE DAY

     Mulder slows down to a stop. They've come to a three-way
     intersection in the middle of absolutely nowhere that
     offers them three choices. The car sits idling for
     several beats.


     RESUME INT. RENTAL CAR

     Mulder's got his hand on his face rubbing his eyes.

                            MULDER
               What are my choices?

                            SCULLY
               About a hundred miles of nothing in
               each direction.

                            MULDER
               Where would they be going?

                            SCULLY
               We've got two choices. One of them is
               wrong.

     They are both looking in different directions. The car
     idling.

                            MULDER
               You think they went left?

                            SCULLY
               I don't know why I think they went
               right.

     A few moments of silence. Then Mulder steps on the gas
     and goes straight. Heading out onto the only unpaved
     road. Accelerating away.

     Scully looks at him, wondering. As they bump along at
     speed. Mulder won't look at her for a few moments. Then,
     turning to her:

                            MULDER
               Five years together -- how many times
               have I been wrong.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     HEADLIGHTS appear in the distance on a long, dusty
     stretch of road. GROWING as they approach, then coming
     to a stop in a cloud of dust as they move into f.g.

     Where a LINE OF FENCEPOSTS, BARBWIRE blocks their path.

     As the car brakes, the passenger door opens and Scully
     exits. A hot Texas wind blows. A dog is BARKING
     somewhere. Scully walks into the headlight wash, looking
     at a sign on the fence.

     After a moment, the driver's door opens and Mulder
     exits.

                            MULDER
               Hey, I was right about the bomb,
               wasn't I?

                            SCULLY
               This is great. This is fitting.

     REVERSE ON SCENE

     On the fence sign, painted in crude letters, are the
     words: SOME HAVE TRIED, SOME HAVE DIED. TURN BACK -- NO
     TRESPASSING.

                            MULDER
               What?

                            SCULLY
               I've got to be in Washington D.C. in
               eleven hours for a hearing -- the
               outcome of which might possibly affect
               one of the biggest decisions of my
               life. And here I am standing out in
               the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing
               phantom tanker trucks.

                            MULDER
               We're not chasing trucks, we're
               chasing evidence --

                            SCULLY
               -- of what exactly?!

                            MULDER
               That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go
               off, to hide something: bodies
               infected with a virus you detected
               yourself.

                            SCULLY
               They haul gas in tanker trucks, they
               haul oil in tanker trucks -- they
               don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.

                            MULDER
               Yeah, well they may this one.

                            SCULLY
               What do you mean by haul?
                      (off his reaction)
               What are you not telling me here?

                            MULDER
               This virus -- it...
                      (afraid to say)

                            SCULLY
               Mulder --

                            MULDER
               It may be extraterrestrial.

                            SCULLY
               I don't believe this. I don't fucking
               believe this.
                      (reaching her limit of
                      impatience)
               Y'know, I've been here... I've been
               here one too many times with you,
               Mulder.

                            MULDER
               Been where?

                            SCULLY
               Pounding down some dirt road in the
               middle of the night. Chasing some
               elusive truth on a dim hope, only to
               find myself standing right where I am
               right now: at another dead end --

     As she says this A BELL starts to sound. A flashing
     light hits Mulder and Scully. They both turn to see:

     HIGH ANGLE OVER A RAILROAD CROSSING SIGN

     Sitting all by its lonely self. No swinging arms or
     gate. Just one little sign between Mulder and Scully and
     their car.

     CAMERA PANNING to the light of a locomotive speeding
     toward us.

     WIDE ANGLE OVER TRACKS TO MULDER AND SCULLY

     They move toward their car, but the train is coming
     fast. Mulder and Scully stop and wait, watching the
     train. As the engine breaks frame, eclipsing Mulder and
     Scully from view. And as it passes by we see TWO VERY
     FAMILIAR WHITE TANKERS loaded piggyback atop flat bed
     cars.

     The train, which is not much longer than this, passes.
     And Mulder and Scully make a mad dash for their car. The
     lights come on and Mulder swings the vehicle into a hard
     accelerating turn, taking the spoke of the intersection
     that parallels the tracks. As the car hauls ass after
     the train, we:

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. OPPOSITE END OF MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT

     The rails come up a grade where they appear out of a
     long bending turn. Exiting the mountain pass near the
     summit of the mountain. And now HEADLIGHTS appear,
     bouncing toward us. It's Mulder and Scully's rental
     chugging up the grade.

     And now pulling to a stop as it REACHES CAMERA. Then the
     car doors open and Mulder and Scully exit. Putting
     jackets against the cold desert night. Running over the
     gravel on the rail bed into sharp f.g.

                            SCULLY
               What do you think it is?

                            MULDER
               I have no idea.

     They start out toward it anyway, whatever it is. But the
     image that we see next might cause us to ask the same
     question.

     REVERSE ANGLE -- MULDER AND SCULLY'S FORMER POV

     The Agents are moving off the tracks now, picking their
     way toward the horizon where, at the edge of the great
     plateau that lays out before them, there are TWO GIANT
     GLOWING WHITE DOMES.

     It is otherwise pitch dark out, almost giving the
     impression that the domes are floating.

     It would give the distinct impression of
     otherworldliness, if we hadn't seen a similar, smaller
     glowing dome over the dirt field where the boys found
     the skull. And if we could not see the lights of the
     TRAIN rolling to a stop near the mysterious domes.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. GREAT PLATEAU - NIGHT - HIGH WIDE ANGLE

     SLOWLY CRANING DOWN as Mulder and Scully move through
     the low scrub of the high desert. Moving towards us as
     CAMERA CONTINUES ITS SLOW CRANE DOWN, REVEALING in f.g.
     the tops of CORN STALKS (yes, corn stalks.) What is the
     perimeter edge of:

     REVERSE CRANE DOWN (TO MATCH)

     Acres and acres of corn fields, laying out before us in
     the dark night. Running all the way to the WHITE DOMED
     TENTS in the b.g.

     Mulder and Scully enter the perimeter edge, disappearing
     into:


     EXT. ACRES OF CORN - NIGHT

     TRACKING WITH Mulder and Scully as they move through the
     field.

                            SCULLY
               This is weird, Mulder.

                            MULDER
               Very weird.

                            SCULLY
               Any thoughts on why anybody'd be
               growing corn in the middle of the
               desert?

                            MULDER
               Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop
               containers out there.

     CONTINUE TRACKING as they move through the tall uniform
     rows.

     ANGLE BEHIND THE AGENTS

     Shooting down the long straight rows. CRANING UP to
     REVEAL DOMES once again. Like space ships that have
     landed.

                                             CUT TO:


     OPPOSITE PERIMETER OF THE FIELD OF CORN

     The Agents exit the edge of the crop field. They have
     come upon the glowing tents now. Tall and pillowy
     against the dark sky.

     There is no evidence of anyone about. No sound, no
     signs.

     Mulder and Scully stand at the edge of the field for a
     moment. Then move cautiously across an open area to one
     of the domes.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. WHITE DOME TENT - NIGHT

     Mulder pulls open the steel door leading in. It opens
     with a SUCKING SOUND which suggests the interior is
     pressurized. And as he and Scully step in -- they both
     JUMP when LARGE FANS just overhead hit them both with
     hard blasts of air.

     Stepping quickly out of the downward blasting air, into
     the still silence of the space beyond.

                            SCULLY
               Cool in here. Temperature's being
               regulated.

                            MULDER
               For the purpose of what?

     HIGH OVERHEAD ANGLE

     Our view is down through the crosswires and cables that
     create the tension support. The effect is a combination
     of simplicity and perfect function. Stark and high tech.
     The flooring is gray and flat, featureless. But we don't
     yet see from this angle exactly what the white domed
     tent houses.

     Though the air is still and there is no movement of any
     kind, there is a sound that permeates the interior. A
     STEADY HUM. Almost electrical hum, but different.

     Mulder and Scully move together toward the middle of the
     space.

     WIDE ON TENT - MULDER AND SCULLY'S POV

     Laid out in a grid, low to the ground, are what look
     like BOXES. Fixed in place like roof vents, except these
     are on the floor, no more than three feet tall, and
     about the same measure square.

     NEW ANGLE - TRACKING WITH MULDER AND SCULLY

     As they continue to move cautiously, walking out into
     the grid of box-shaped objects. Coming to the center of
     the capacious, arena-sized space. Standing over one of
     the mysterious boxes, which we now see have LOUVERED
     TOPS. The louvers, however, are shut so that whatever is
     inside the boxes cannot be seen.

                            SCULLY
               I think we're on top of something. I
               think these are some kind of venting.

     Mulder lays his head and ear to the top of the box.

                            MULDER
               You hear that?

                            SCULLY
               I hear the humming. Like electricity.
               High voltage maybe.

                            MULDER
               Maybe. Maybe not.

     Scully looks skyward.

                            SCULLY
               What do you think those are for?

     Mulder takes his ear off the box, looking up now, too.

     THEIR POV

     At the top of the dome are two LARGE corresponding
     LOUVER VENTS.

     RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY

     Looking up at these vents.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. WHITE DOME TENT - NIGHT

     HIGH WIDE ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY, staring up JUST
     PAST CAMERA at the louvered vents at top center of the
     tent. When A LOUD METALLIC NOISE makes them jump.

     AGENTS POV THE LOUVERED VENTS ABOVE THEM

     One of the vents is opening automatically, its large
     metal louvers straining from their flat closed position
     into an up-and-down open position. When this is
     complete, the SECOND LOUVER does the same.

     The straining sound of galvanized metal-on-metal.

     LOW ANGLE ON MULDER AND SCULLY

     As Mulder turns his look from the ceiling back down to
     the mysterious box they're standing next to. Something
     occurs to him. Something frightening.

                            MULDER
               Scully....?

                            SCULLY
               Yeah...?

                            MULDER
               Run.

     Mulder grabs her hand, pulling her along. Though she
     doesn't know why. Or what's about to happen. TRACKING
     FAST WITH THEM as Mulder leads her back toward the door
     they entered, which is a good hundred yards away.

                            SCULLY
                      (yelling, on the run)
               What are you doing?

                            MULDER
                      (yelling back)
               Come on!

     When the LOUVERED VENTS on all the low grid-arranged
     boxes OPEN IN DOMINO-LIKE SUCCESSION -- out of them
     pouring THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF BEES, rapidly filling
     the atmosphere of the domed space.

     As if the insects are being shot out of non-stop
     cannons.

     HIGH ANGLE

     THICK STREAMS of bees head RIGHT AT CAMERA, flying for
     the open louvers at the top of the dome. As Mulder and
     Scully run for it down below.

     TRACKING WITH MULDER AND SCULLY

     Scully's hand slipping from Mulder's as she pulls her
     jacket up over her head. Mulder doing the same now,
     ducking his head inside his own jacket. The Agents are
     slowed by the bees but still make their zigzag way
     toward the door -- bees clinging to their clothes. But
     motion seems to be the key.

     As Mulder RUNS TOWARD CAMERA -- where the downward blast
     of air knocks all the bees off him. In the b.g., we see
     that Scully has fallen behind. Still running, but losing
     her way in the process, losing her bearings as the
     thickening swarm of bees descends.

     CLOSE ON SCULLY

     When Mulder enters frame, jacket pulled over his head
     again. Taking Scully by the back of her coat and
     swinging her toward the direction of the door.
     Whipsnapping her the rest of the distance to the
     doorfans. Following right behind her as the fans
     BLASTING them and the Agents continue right out the
     doors. To:


     EXT. WHITE DOMED TENT - NIGHT

     Scully and Mulder comes blasting out themselves now, but
     they haven't even had time to catch their breaths when
     they react to MOVEMENT. Something coming at them in the
     night.

     THEIR POV'S - STRAIGHT DOWN THE ROWS OF DOMED TENTS

     Where BRIGHT BEAMS BLAST ON, moving fast toward them.
     The RUSHING WHIR of the turbine engines of the unmarked
     choppers. The bright beams skimming across the ground
     toward Mulder and Scully, traveling right along the
     edges of ends of the white domed tents. Threatening to
     spot the Agents, unless they -- RUN.

     And they do -- bolting just as the beams and the
     helicopters blast over the spot they held just moments
     before. Running to:


     EXT. ACRES OF CORN - NIGHT - MULDER AND SCULLY - VARIOUS
     HANDHELD

     Running flat out now, knocking away the stalks and
     leaves that block their way.

     Following and leading shots.

     POVs and Tracking shots.

     And chasing angles, as the Agents run through the only
     cover they've got. As:

     ANGLE JUST OVER THE TOP OF CROPS

     The unmarked helicopters swoop right overhead, their
     BRIGHT SPOTLIGHTS searching and cutting through the
     cornrows. As the Agents zig and zag just out of the
     discovering beams. As the choppers zoom right over their
     heads.

     REVERSE ON CHOPPERS

     Traversing the field, then doing sharp banking turns and
     swooping back over the field now in low drifting hovers.
     The wash from the blades knocking the corn stalks down
     so as to reveal anything hidden within.

     The bright spots making sure that nothing might escape
     detection.

     LOW ANGLE - CAMERA SEARCHING AND FINDING SCULLY

     as she runs up INTO FRAME. She's lost sight of:

                            SCULLY
               Mulder?!


     ANGLE ELSEWHERE ON MULDER

     As he too runs to a stop. Hearing his name.

                            MULDER
               Scully?!


     RESUME SCULLY

     Reacting to the sound of her name, but there's no time
     to find her bearings on Mulder. Not before she has to
     take flight again. As one of the choppers appears
     overhead, hovering into view. Knocking the corn down in
     a path moving straight toward her.

     CAMERA LEADING HER as she runs from the oncoming craft.
     PASSING CAMERA to the left, as the chopper passes CAMERA
     RIGHT.

                                             CUT TO:


     TRACKING FAST WITH MULDER

     Beating his way through the corn like Bomba through the
     jungle.

     Matching this action, as Mulder runs toward us. When one
     of the unmarked helicopters BREAKS INTO FRAME in an
     intersecting path, its BEAM passing right over Mulder
     and ILLUMINATING HIM. But while it doesn't slow Mulder
     down, the helicopter maneuvers into a hard banking turn,
     sweeping over the far end of the corn field and heading
     RIGHT BACK AT MULDER - AT US.

                                             CUT TO:


     NEW LOW ANGLE ON EDGE OF CORN FIELD

     Where Mulder bursts out of the perimeter, turning on a
     quick dime and running an out pattern, just before the
     chopper BURSTS into frame overhead, its search beam
     narrowly missing Mulder.

     NEW ANGLE ON MULDER

     Running the corner of the field, looking frantically
     down each corn row until he comes to a stop. No sign
     of:

                            MULDER
               Scully?!

     Mulder reacting to the sound of her response:

                            SCULLY
                      (distant o.s.)
               Mulder!


     NEW ANGLE ON SCULLY

     She's exiting the field behind him. Running toward him,
     and when she gets to him they both break into a run
     across the desert. CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM as they sprint
     away.

     FOLLOWING THEM until they both start to slow. Slowing to
     a stop in the darkness. Turning to see:

     THEIR POV

     The helicopters have disappeared.

     RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY

     Reacting to this.

                            SCULLY
               Where'd they go?

                            MULDER
               I don't know.

     Then they both turn again and continue running. As fast
     as their feet will take them. Back towards the bluff
     where their car is parked.


     EXT. BLUFF OVERLOOKING CORN FIELDS - NIGHT

     Where Mulder and Scully's car is parked. Stillness,
     until Mulder and Scully's heads appear as they climb up
     from the direction of the corn fields. They get in their
     car and start it quickly. Mulder turns the ignition, but
     the car doesn't start immediately. He turns it over and
     over but it won't kick.

     As he does this, unbeknownst to the agents ONE OF THE
     BLACK HELICOPTERS rises up from below the bluff,
     appearing in their rear windshield. Hovering just behind
     the car like a giant bumblebee. Just as...

     ...Mulder gets the car started, throwing the
     transmission in gear and spinning the tires. As they
     head off back in the direction they came, without their
     lights on. As they do this, the black chopper continues
     to hover for a moment, then BANKS OFF AND AWAY. Into the
     night.

     Mulder and Scully speed off in the opposite direction.
     As we:

     INT. FBI OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW - DAY

     CLOSE ON A FILE

     Being leafed through by a woman's hands. CAMERA TILTING
     UP to Special Agent Cassidy, the woman we met earlier
     running the OPR hearing. She takes a quick glance at her
     watch, looking up when:

     THE DOOR TO THE ROOM

     opens. A beat, then Skinner enters with a wearied look.

                            SKINNER
               She's coming in.

     Skinner ducks his head back out to look at:

                                             INTERCUT WITH:


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OPR HEARING ROOM - DAY

     Where Scully stands looking into the glass of a display
     case, trying to put her hair and clothes and person
     together. She's still in the same clothes we saw her in.
     Seeing Skinner now moving toward him.

     RESUME OPR HEARING ROOM

     Scully enters past Skinner. Though she has straightened
     them, and her hair, there is no mistaking that she's
     been to the dust bowl and back to get here. Her manner
     is chastened.

     Scully tries to keep her eyes on the table where she'll
     be sitting. Venturing only a brief, polite look to:

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE CASSIDY AND THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS

     They reshuffle their papers, pulling up their chairs.
     Ready to get down to business now.

                            CASSIDY
               Special Agent Scully --

                            SCULLY
               I apologize for making you wait --
               I've brought some new evidence with me
               --

                            CASSIDY
               Evidence of what?

     CLOSE PROFILE ON SCULLY

     Reaching into her satchel, pulling out an evidence bag.
     Whatever she's reaching for she's reluctant to present
     with confidence.

                            SCULLY
               These are fossilized bone fragments
               I've been able to study, gathered from
               the bomb site in Dallas...

     As Scully speaks we see A BEE crawl out from under the
     collar of her suit jacket, crawling toward the back of
     her neck. Crawling slowly, as if stretching its legs
     from its long journey. CAMERA DOLLYING around Scully as
     the bee does, moving into an OVER to:

                            CASSIDY
               You've been back to Dallas?

                            SCULLY
               Yes.

                            CASSIDY
               Are you going to let us in on what
               exactly you're trying to prove --

                            SCULLY
               That the bombing in Dallas may have
               been to destroy the bodies of those
               firemen, so their deaths and the
               reason for them wouldn't have to be
               explained --

                            CASSIDY
                      (challenging)
               -- those are very serious allegations,
               Agent Scully --

                            SCULLY
               Yes. I know.

     There is a hush of murmured responses to this, the panel
     members speaking to one another. Assistant Director
     Skinner shifts uneasily in his chair. He's been here
     before with Agents Mulder and Scully. He's sensing
     something outrageous.

                            CASSIDY
               And you have conclusive evidence of
               this? Something to tie this claim of
               yours to the crime --

                            SCULLY
                      (grudgingly)
               Nothing completely conclusive --

     We have returned to the OVER ANGLE on Scully, where we
     see the BEE just below her jacket collar on the back of
     her neck.

     It CRAWLS back under her collar, DISAPPEARING from
     sight.

                            SCULLY
               I hope to. We're working to develop
               this evidence --

                            CASSIDY
               Working with?

                            SCULLY
               Agent Mulder.

     Off Cassidy's knowing nod, a general shifting in chairs,

     Mulder pushes through the front, scanning the room for:

     ANGLE ON KURTZWEIL

     Sitting at a booth at the dark rear of the
     establishment. Mulder enters frame, sitting down across
     from him. Kurtzweil is jumpy, but he sees from Mulder's
     expression that something's up.

                            KURTZWEIL
               You found something?

                            MULDER
               Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of
               experiment. Something they excavated
               was brought there in tanker trucks.

                            KURTZWEIL
               What?

                            MULDER
               I'm not sure. A virus --

                            KURTZWEIL
               -- You saw this experiment?

                            MULDER
               What did it look like?

                            MULDER
               There were bees. And corn crops.

     Kurtzweil smiles at Mulder, laughs with nervous
     excitement. Mulder doesn't quite realize it yet, but
     this is news to him.

                            MULDER
               What are they?

     Kurtzweil slides from his seat, rising.

                            KURTZWEIL
               What do you think?

                            MULDER
               A transportation system. Transgenic
               crops. The pollen genetically altered
               to carry a virus.

                            KURTZWEIL
               That would be my guess.

                            MULDER
               Your guess?

     But Kurtzweil doesn't respond to this. He's moving
     toward the back of the bar. Mulder slides out, pursuing
     him.

     ANGLE ON BARMAID

     The few PATRONS sitting at the bar, all turning in
     reaction to this sudden flurry of activity.


     INT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     Near the bathrooms. Mulder catches up to Kurtzweil.

                            MULDER
               What do you mean, your guess?

     Kurtzweil doesn't stop. So Mulder must physically stop
     him.

                            MULDER
               You told me you had answers.

                            KURTZWEIL
               Yeah, well I don't have them all.

                            MULDER
               You've been using me --

                            KURTZWEIL
               I've been using you?!

                            MULDER
               You didn't know my father --

                            KURTZWEIL
               I told you -- he and I were old
               friends --

                            MULDER
               You're a liar. You lied to me to
               gather information for you. For your
               goddamn books. Didn't you?

     Mulder is getting heated, rough with Kurtzweil. When,
     unexpectedly A MAN suddenly exits the bathroom. REACTING
     to this scene. Kurtzweil uses the moment to break from
     Mulder. Slipping out the back door. Mulder takes a beat,
     then goes after him.

     Pushing out the back door into the blinding brightness.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - DAY

     Mulder busts out the back door, chasing Kurtzweil.

                            MULDER
               Kurtzweil!

     Kurtzweil turns to him. With restrained ferocity.

                            KURTZWEIL
               You'd be shit out of luck if not for
               me. You saw what you saw because I led
               you to it. I'm putting my ass on the
               line for you.

                            MULDER
               Your ass? I just got chased across
               Texas by two black helicopters.

                            KURTZWEIL
               And why do you think it is you're
               standing here talking to me? These
               people don't make mistakes, Agent
               Mulder.

     And with that he turns now, striding off. Leaving Mulder
     to deal with the excellent logic of this. When suddenly
     Mulder reacts to A NOISE. Somewhere above him.

     MULDER'S POV

     Up on a fire escape, A MAN is moving. Mulder can only
     see his feet and legs from this angle, but it is clear
     he has been watching Mulder. Upon being spotted, the
     figure slides away and disappears.

     ANGLE FROM INSIDE FIRE ESCAPE BUILDING

     We get a glimpse of the man who was watching him. A face
     we recognize as that of the man who brushed past Mulder
     coming out of the vending room, not long before the
     building in Dallas blew. He is moving quickly now,
     disappearing into the shadows. CAMERA TILTING DOWN to
     find:

     MULDER. He stands staring up, but only for a moment
     until he turns and hurries off in the opposite direction
     Kurtzweil disappeared in.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - MAGIC HOUR

     ANGLE OVER MULDER'S DESK at the far end of the living
     room. The sound of keys in the door, then Mulder enters
     his apartment in a hurry. Moving to the desk and going
     at this pace through the drawers. Looking for... A
     PICTURE ALBUM.

     Which he takes now, leafing through it. Flipping the
     pages, looking for:

     ANGLE OVER MULDER

     Finding old pictures of young Fox Mulder with his
     SISTER, Samantha. With his father and mother. The
     plastic-covered page is peeled back and one of these
     photos is removed. It is an old family snapshot. A
     picnic possibly.

     Mulder stares at the picture.

     INSERT PHOTO - In the b.g. of the picnic, his head
     turned to camera, is a young KURTZWEIL.

     Mulder studies the photo intensely, when there's a KNOCK
     at his door. Mulder turning to see:

     SCULLY

     In his haste, Mulder had neglected to lock his door.
     Scully is pushing it open. She's still in the same
     clothes. She looks beat. Her eyes meeting Mulder's. A
     gaze that says bad news.

                            MULDER
               What? What's wrong?

                            SCULLY
               Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer
               effective immediately.

     Mulder is shaking his head. Not wanting to hear this.

                            SCULLY
               I already gave Skinner my letter of
               resignation.

                            MULDER
               You can't quit, Scully.

                            SCULLY
               I can, Mulder. I debated whether or
               not to even tell you in person,
               because I knew --

                            MULDER
               We're close to something here -- we're
               on the verge --

                            SCULLY
               You're on the verge, Mulder -- please
               don't do this to me --

                            MULDER
               After what you saw last night -- after
               all you've seen -- you can't just walk
               away --

                            SCULLY
               I have. I did. It's done.

                            MULDER
               Just like that --

                            SCULLY
               I'm contacting the state board Monday
               to file medical reinstatement papers
               --

                            MULDER
               I need you on this, Scully --

                            SCULLY
               You don't Mulder -- you've never
               needed me. I've only held you back.
                      (beat)
               I've got to go.

     And with that she exits his apartment, the argument too
     painful, and her ability to be persuaded too clear to
     herself.


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     WIDE ANGLE FROM END OF HALL where we see Scully,
     leaving Mulder's apartment. Moving at a hurried clip to
     the elevator -- TOWARD CAMERA. As if anticipating her
     own impulse to turn around and go back. As she moves
     into f.g. Mulder exits his apt. door.

                            MULDER
               You're wrong --

     He hurries to catch her. As she turns on him.

                            SCULLY
               Why was I assigned to you? To debunk
               your work. To reign you in. To shut
               you down.

                            MULDER
               You saved me, Scully.
                      (off her look)
               As different and frustrating as it's
               been sometimes, your goddamn strict
               rationalism and science have saved me
               a thousand times; have kept me honest
               and made me whole. I owe you so much,
               Scully, and you owe me nothing.
                      (beat)
               I don't want to do this without you. I
               don't know if I can. If I quit now,
               they win.

     She is silent, moved. In spite of all her desire not to
     be. She moves to Mulder, holds him. They break slightly
     and she looks up at Mulder with deep respect, admiration
     and... kisses him on the forehead. When...

     ...suddenly a physical intimacy we've never seen. A
     heat and passion that can't be denied. The opportunity
     for the inevitable has presented itself.

     The moment of truth has arrived. Mulder is staring at
     Scully as she's looking back at him. His head moves
     slightly toward hers -- as one of his hands moves up to
     her neck, drawing her to him. Where there is hesitation
     on her part, there is also desire. When:

                            SCULLY
               OUCH!!!

     Scully pulls away from Mulder, RUBBING at her neck where
     his hand had been.

                            MULDER
               What? What happened?

                            SCULLY
               I think... something stung me.

     Scully's hand comes out with THE SQUIRMING BEE, which
     she holds in her hand while Mulder moves around her,
     checking her neck.

                            MULDER
               It must...

     But he doesn't finish his sentence before he has to
     catch Scully from falling. Her head bobs and she has to
     catch it.

                            MULDER
               Scully...

                            SCULLY
               Something's wrong...
                      (fighting for clarity)
               I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my
               chest. My... motor functions are being
               affected. I'm...

     Mulder lays her down on the floor during this. Scully
     continues to speak, though her eyes are not focusing.
     She is limp in Mulder's arms.

                            SCULLY
               ...my pulse feels thready and I've
               got a funny taste in the back of my
               throat.

                            MULDER
               I think you're in anaphylactic shock
               --

                            SCULLY
               No -- it's --

     Her voice is getting thin now, too.

                            MULDER
               Scully --

                            SCULLY
               I've got no allergy. Something...
               this... Mulder... I think... I think
               you should call an ambulance.

     And Mulder is on his feet in a flash, running for:

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     CLOSE OVER PHONE as Mulder races into the apartment,
     dashing TOWARD CAMERA, picking up the receiver, dialing.
     HOLDING ON THE PHONE during this action. TILTING UP
     for:

                            MULDER
               This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I
               have an emergency -- I have an agent
               down --


     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     SCULLY - HANDHELD

     Picked up and one-two-three loaded on a gurney by TWO
     PARAMEDICS.

                            1ST PARAMEDIC
               Can you hear me? Can you say your
               name?

     Scully is trying, but the words won't come out.

                            1ST PARAMEDIC
               She's got constriction in the throat
               and larynx -- are you breathing okay?

     He lays his head down to her mouth.

                            1ST PARAMEDIC
               Passages are open. Let's get her in
               the van --

     NEIGHBORS are in the hall now, along with Mulder. Who is
     moving beside the Paramedics as they hustle the gurney
     down the hall.

                            1ST PARAMEDIC
               Coming through people -- here we go.
               Coming through --

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUED HAND HELD

     The Paramedics bang out the front door, stutter-stepping
     the gurney down to the walk, to their EMT VAN which sits
     at the curb with the LIGHT BAR FLASHING. Mulder
     following close by.

                            MULDER
               She said she had a taste in the back
               of her throat -- there was no
               pre-existing allergy to bee-stings --
               the bee that stung her may have been
               carrying a virus --

                            2ND PARAMEDIC
               A virus?

                            1ST PARAMEDIC
               Get on the radio, tell them we have a
               cytogenic reaction, we need an advise
               and administer --

     They get her to the back of the vehicle, guiding the
     gurney in with experienced hands. Scully's eyes are on
     Mulder as she's slid into the brightly lit interior.

     The 1st Paramedic blocks Mulder somewhat as he steps
     toward the van, anticipating that he's going with them
     to the hospital. But the doors are closing on him before
     he gets an opportunity.

     FOLLOWING MULDER around to the driver's side of the van
     now, moving to the driver's window where THE DRIVER can
     be seen in the rear view mirror, his eyes watching
     Mulder.

     ON MULDER

     A moment of vague recognition -- a catch in his step.

     RESUME

     As Mulder's momentum carries him to the driver's window
     where se see again the man from the vending room, who
     was also surveilling Mulder. And he has a HANDGUN
     pointed at Mulder, which he FIRES THROUGH THE WINDOW.
     The glass shattering.

     RESUME MULDER

     Throwing himself away backward, but the bullet catches
     him in the head. Blood and glass spraying onto the side
     of the van. He goes down to the ground -- as the
     paramedic van accelerates fast away.

     LOW ANGLE REVERSE ON MULDER

     Lying in the street, his head bleeding profusely. While
     in the b.g., A SECOND AMBULANCE IS SPEEDING TO THE
     SCENE. As it skids to a stop and TWO NEW PARAMEDICS jump
     out, we:

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

     A MEDIUM SIZED PRIVATE JET is taxiing down an alley off
     the main runway where a 747 is speeding toward takeoff.
     The private jet turning TOWARD CAMERA and nosing into
     f.g.

     NEW ANGLE ON TARMAC

     Where MEN IN FAMILIAR BLACK FATIGUES are unloading
     something from an unmarked cube truck that is also
     familiar: the very high tech-looking CLEAR CONTAINER,
     with its monitors and gauges, its oxygen tanks and
     refrigeration unit. A self-contained life support
     system. The inside of the container is covered with a
     thin layer of frost, through which we can see AGENT
     SCULLY.

     She lies as if in a state of paralysis, but a blink of
     her eyes is enough to tell us that she is... alive.

     TRACKING WITH THE MEN moving the container. As they
     hustle it to the waiting jet. As The Cigarette Smoking
     Man is descending the steps of the plane onto the
     tarmac. Watching as the container is moved to the cargo
     hold and loaded inside.

     The hold is closed and the jet engines wind back up. As
     the Cigarette Smoking Man reboards the aircraft and it
     taxis away.

     FADE SLOWLY TO BLACK


     INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Voices fade in slowly, inaudible at first. For regular
     viewers of the show, they will recognize the voices of
     the Lone Gunmen.

     Three nerdish paranoiacs who publish a magazine which
     charts and cataloged conspiracies past and present,
     among other government malfeasance. They are Langly,
     Byers and Frohike.

                            BYERS
               I think he's coming out --

                            LANGLY
               He's coming to.

                            FROHIKE
               Hey, Mulder...

     FADE UP, as if our eyes are blinking open. We are in
     Mulder's POV, and the face right above us is Frohike's.

                            FROHIKE
               Mulder...?

     Behind Frohike, looking down at Mulder, are Byers and
     Langly.

     REVERSE ON MULDER

     Staring at the diminutive Frohike, the long-haired
     Langly and the courtly Byers with dawning recognition.

                            MULDER
               Oh god...

                            LANGLY
               What's wrong?

                            MULDER
                      (to Byers, then Langly)
               Tin Man. Scarecrow.
                      (to Frohike)
               Toto.

     Mulder sits up now, rubbing his face, feeling the
     BANDAGE he's got on his head.

                            MULDER
               What am I doing here?

                            BYERS
               You were shot in the head. The bullet
               broke the flesh on your right brow and
               glanced off your temporal plate.

                            MULDER
                      (woozy)
               Penetration but not perforation.

                            LANGLY
               Three centimetres to the left and we'd
               be playing the harp.

     Mulder is still shaking out the cobwebs.

                            BYERS
               They gave you a craniotomy to relieve
               the pressure from a subdural hematoma.
               But you've been unconscious since they
               brought you in.

                            MULDER
               When was that?

                            FROHIKE
               Two days ago. Your guy Skinner's been
               here with you around the clock.

                            LANGLY
               We got the news and made a trip to
               your apartment. Found a bug in your
               phone line.

                            FROHIKE
               And one in your hall.

     Byers holds up the first small device. Frohike holds up
     a vial containing A BEE. Mulder realizing:

                            MULDER
               Scully had a violent reaction to a bee
               sting --

                            BYERS
               You called 911. Except the call was
               intercepted.

                            MULDER
                      (sitting up)
               They took her --

     Mulder pushes the covers off. Swinging his legs to the
     ground. As A.D. Skinner enters the room. Surprised to
     see Mulder up.

                            SKINNER
               Agent Mulder --

                            MULDER
               Where's Scully?!

     As he says this he loses his balance slightly, has to
     hold onto one of the Gunmen. Struggling with his
     faculties.

                            SKINNER
               She's missing. We've been unable to
               locate her or the vehicle they took
               her in.

                            MULDER
               Whoever they are -- this goes right
               back to Dallas -- it goes right back
               to the bombing --

                            SKINNER
               I know.
                      (off Mulder's reaction to
                      this)
               Agent Scully reported your suspicions
               to OPR. On the basis of her report, I
               sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's
               apartment. They picked up PSTN
               residues on his personal effects
               consistent with the construction of
               the vending machine device in Dallas.

                            MULDER
                      (reeling)
               How deep does this go?

                            SKINNER
               I don't know.

     Mulder sees A MAN IN A SUIT passes by the small window
     in the door, casting a furtive glance in, then moving
     off. He turns his look back to Skinner.

                            MULDER
               Are we being watched?

                            SKINNER
               I'm not taking any chances.

     Mulder nods. Pulling now at the bandage on his head.
     Peeling it away and revealing the wound beneath.

                            MULDER
               I need your clothes, Byers.

                            BYERS
               Me?

                            SKINNER
               What are you doing?

                            MULDER
               I've got to find Scully.

                            FROHIKE
               Do you know where she is?

                            MULDER
               No. But I know someone who might have
               an answer. Who better.

     Mulder is undoing his hospital gown now, his white buns
     gracing the screen for the first time in history. As he
     ducks into the bathroom. As the men left standing in the
     room all look to Byers, reluctantly removing his duds.
     Off this:

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

     ANGLE OVER MAN IN A SUIT standing with his back to
     Mulder's room, reading a section of a newspaper (the
     rest of the paper sitting on a chair, as if the man's
     possibly set up here.) As the door to Mulder's room
     opens in the b.g. and Frohike appears.

     Frohike keeps his eyes on the Man as Langly appears now,
     followed by...Byers? We can't see clearly as the other
     two block our POV and the third man out doesn't show us
     his face. The threesome starts down the hall, their
     footsteps drawing the attention of the Man in a Suit.

     ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE OTHER GUNMEN

     As they head TOWARD CAMERA. Walking at a pace. In the
     b.g. the Man in the Suit is drifting toward Mulder's
     hospital room.

     ANGLE ON MAN IN SUIT

     Suspicious. He moves to the door, looks in the little
     glass window. Seeing...Byers, the sheets pulled up to
     his nose to hide his beard and mustache. Skinner
     standing next to him, talking on the phone.

     The Man in the Suit looking down to the end of the hall
     again.

     RESUME ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE GUNMEN

     As Mulder and his two flankers MOVE RIGHT TO CAMERA.
     Mulder is taking a cell phone being handed to him by
     Frohike. Dialing on the move.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY BEHIND DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT

     A FIGURE appears at the end of the alley, moving toward
     us. It could be Mulder from this distance, but as the
     figure comes closer we recognize him as Kurtzweil.
     Moving into the f.g., checking behind him, ahead of him.
     Jumpy.

     He takes a cautious beat, then moves to the door leading
     into the bar (established), reaching for the knob.
     Opening it, finding the Well-Manicured Man standing
     there.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Dr. Kurtzweil, isn't it? Dr. Alvin
               Kurtzweil?

                            KURTZWEIL
               Jesus Christ.

     Kurtzweil is shaken by the sight of this man.
     Backpedaling a bit, looking around and behind him for an
     ambush.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               You're surprised. Certainly you've
               been expecting some response to your
               indiscretion.

     The W.M.M. steps out of the doorway, following
     Kurtzweil.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               I'm quite sure whatever you told Agent
               Mulder, you have your good reason.
               It's a weakness in men our age; the
               urge to confess.
                      (stopping his walk)
               I forgive you that.

     Kurtzweil is thrown by the words, and the delivery.
     Stopping his backward progress. Studying this upright
     and civil man.

                            KURTZWEIL
               What are you doing here? What do you
               want from me?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               You must try to understand, what I'm
               here to do is only to protect my
               children. You and I have but short
               lives left. I can only hope the same
               isn't true for them.

     On this note, Kurtzweil turns and hoofs it back in the
     direction from which he came. TRACKING BACK WITH HIM
     until HEADLIGHTS hit his face.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     A TOWN CAR has pulled into the alley behind him.
     Accelerating fast down the narrow corridor. Effectively
     trapping Kurtzweil in. As he squints into its
     headlights, then turns back with fear in his eyes to the
     W.M.M.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT

     Where a figure is coming down the street toward us.

     Running, it's Mulder, going balls out. Running to the
     entrance of the bar and yanking open the door.


     INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT

     Moderately crowded as Mulder enters, stopping to catch
     his breath. Moving to the back of the bar. Looking for:

     THE BOOTH WHERE HE MET KURTZWEIL EARLIER

     It's empty.

     RESUME MULDER

     Moving through the bar -- real panic in his expression.
     He heads to the back.


     INT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder passing the bathrooms, moving to the door where
     we saw the Well-Manicured Man standing just a short bit
     ago. But there is no one back here now. Mulder moves to
     the back door, the one leading to the alley, pushing it
     open and finding:

     The Well-Manicured Man stands with HIS DRIVER closing
     the trunk on the idling Town Car (which has been turned
     around.) The W.M.M. turns to see:

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Mr. Mulder.

                            MULDER
               What happened to Kurtzweil?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               He's come and gone.

     The W.M.M. moves to Mulder, who doesn't trust him for a
     second. Mulder is still breathing hard, sizing up this
     scene.

                            MULDER
               Where's Scully?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               I have answers for you.

                            MULDER
               Is she alive?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Yes.

     Mulder stares at the W.M.M. - measuring him.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               I'm quite prepared to tell you
               everything, though there isn't much
               you haven't guessed.

                            MULDER
               About the conspiracy?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               I think of it as an agreement. A word
               your father liked to use.

                            MULDER
               I want to know where Scully is.

     The Well-Manicured Man suddenly reaches into his jacket
     pocket, without warning or explanation. Mulder tensing
     slightly. He removes a thin felt envelope.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               The location of Agent Scully. And the
               means to save her life.
                      (off Mulder's look)
               Please...

     He gestures toward the car where the Driver stands with
     the back door open. Mulder hesitates, then steps from
     the doorway. Moving past the W.M.M., sliding in. The
     W.M.M. gets in after him, closes the door. The car pulls
     away.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     WE SEE MULDER in the back seat, reflected in the
     rear-view mirror. Where we also see the eyes of the
     DRIVER watching him. Mulder is handed the felt envelope
     by the W.M.M.

                            MULDER
               What is it?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               A weak vaccine against the virus Agent
               Scully has been infected with. It must
               be administered with ninety six
               hours.

                            MULDER
                      (beat)
               You're lying.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               No. Though I have no way to prove
               otherwise. The virus is
               extraterrestrial. We know very little
               about it, except that it is the
               original inhabitant of this planet.

                            MULDER
                      (dubious, to say the least)
               A virus?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What
               is a virus but a colonizing force that
               cannot be defeated? Living in a cave,
               underground, until it mutates. And
               attacks.

                            MULDER
               This is what you've been conspiring to
               conceal? A disease?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               No! For God sake you've got it all
               backwards.

     This outburst comes suddenly, unexpectedly.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Aids, the ebola virus -- on the
               evolutionary scale they are newborns.
               This virus walked the planet long
               before the dinosaurs.

                            MULDER
               What do you mean, walked?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little
               green men, first landed here millions
               of years ago. Those that didn't leave
               have been laying dormant underground
               since the last Ice Age. In the form of
               an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be
               reconstituted when the alien race from
               which it came returns to colonize the
               planet. Using us as hosts. Against
               this we have no defense. Nothing but a
               weak vaccine.
                      (beat)
               Do you see why it was kept secret? Why
               even the best men -- men like your
               father -- could not let the truth be
               known?

     The force and conviction of his delivery leave Mulder
     shaken.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Until Dallas, we believed the virus
               was simply a controlling organism.
               That mass infection would make us a
               slave race.

                            MULDER
               That's why you bombed the building.
               The infected firemen, the boy --

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Imagine our surprise when they began
               to gestate. My group has been working
               cooperatively with the alien
               colonists, facilitating their
               programs. To give us access to the
               virus. In false hope we might be able
               to secretly find a cure. So that we
               might save ourselves, as the last of
               the species.
                      (beat)
               Your father wisely refused to believe
               this, choosing hope over selfishness.
               Hope is the only future he had: his
               children,
                      (beat, then self-revealing)
               The only future any of us have.

     This draws a look back in the mirror from the Driver.

                            MULDER
               But... he sacrificed his own daughter.
               My sister, Samantha.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               The only true survivors of the viral
               holocaust will be those immune to it:
               those vaccinated against it and
               human/alien hybrids. Your father
               arranged for your sister's abduction.
               He allowed her to be taken to an alien
               hybrid program, so that she would
               survive. As a clone.
                      (beat)
               He had different hopes for you. That
               you would uncover the truth about the
               Project. That you would stop it. That
               you would fight the future.

     Mulder sits stunned by this. As if somehow his destiny
     has been validated, if not pre-ordained. Or maybe just
     justified.

                            MULDER
               Why are you telling me this?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               I thought it only fair you should
               know, given how hard you've worked.

                            MULDER
               What happened to Kurtzweil?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               As your father knew, things need to be
               sacrificed to the future.

                            MULDER
               Where is he?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.

     Mulder stares at the W.M.M., at his cold-blooded
     expression.

                            MULDER
               Let me out. Stop the car.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
                      (motioning)
               Driver.

     Mulder reaching to this as the limo pulls to a stop.
     Trying the door, but the door is locked. When he turns
     back to the W.M.M. he has produced a handgun, which is
     now pointing at Mulder. Laid casually across a folded
     arm. Mulder reacts on seeing it.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               The men I work with will stop at
               nothing to clear the way for what they
               believe is their stake in the
               inevitable future. I was ordered to
               kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action to
               protect my grandchildren's lives.
                      (beat)
               I might just as easily kill you.

     Mulder is recoiling as he says this. Then, without
     hesitation in one quick move, he SHOOTS the Driver in
     the head.

     The blood spattering on the front windshield -- and on
     Mulder who has barely had a chance to react.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Trust no one, Mr. Mulder.

     Mulder looks at The Well-Manicured Man, expecting to be
     next. And for a moment, we do too. But the W.M.M. simply
     opens the door and steps out of the car. Holding the
     door open for Mulder who is still frozen by the actions
     that went just before.


     EXT. DESOLATE D.C. STREET - NIGHT

     Mulder steps out of the car, holding the felt envelope.
     The Well-Manicured Man stands with a sober, intense
     look.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
                      (with quiet force)
               You have precious little time. What
               I've given you the alien colonists
               have no idea exists. You hold in your
               hand the power to end the project.

                            MULDER
               How?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               The vaccine you hold is the only
               defense against the virus. Its
               introduction into an alien environment
               may have the power to destroy the
               delicate plans we've so assiduously
               protected for the last fifty years.
                      (beat)
               Or it may not.

                            MULDER
               What alien environment?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her
               science can save the future.

                            MULDER
               What about you?

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               My life is over.
                      (beat)
               Go.

     Mulder stands speechless for a moment. Until the W.M.M.
     points the weapon he's still holding at him.

                            WELL-MANICURED MAN
               Go now!

     And Mulder does. Moving away from the car, looking back
     over his shoulder. As the Well-Manicured Man gets back
     into the limousine, closes the door. A moment later...
     THE CAR EXPLODES INTO FLAMES, knocking Mulder to the
     ground.

     ANGLE ON MULDER

     The felt envelope has been jarred from his grasp. Its
     contents loosed from inside: a piece of paper with
     COORDINATES on it and an AMPULE and SYRINGE.

     Mulder gets up, looks back. Then he picks up the
     envelope and its contents -- and begins to run. Running
     as fast as he can go. Until, far down the block, he
     disappears.

     As the SCREEN DISSOLVES TO WHITENESS -- under which we
     hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. The
     same sound that opened our story.

     Then there is movement, as the curvilinear line of a
     horizon becomes visible, bi-secting the screen between
     the white of the earth and the white of the sky. We
     are:


     EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA

     Across the expanse of whiteness, a DARK IMAGE appears on
     the long flat horizon. Moving toward us. As a LEGEND
     appears, to establish.

     CLOSER ON A SNOW TRACTOR

     Crawling across the harsh frozen land like a domed
     insect.


     INT. SNOW TRACTOR

     Agent Mulder sits behind the controls of the enclosed
     cabin, several days growth on his face. Dressed in
     thick, bundled outerwear. He maneuvers the vehicle to a
     stop. Reaching for a handheld GPS monitor to check his
     position. Catching his breath for a moment -- all
     movement is exertion in this climate. Mulder stares hard
     out the front window, the wipers beating time, but there
     is nothing out there but whiteness. He wipes the fog
     from a side window with his gloved hand, seeing nothing
     but more whiteness. Checking the GPS device again, then
     reaching for the door latch.

     RESUME WIDE EXTERIOR

     Agent Mulder exits the vehicle, hopping down onto the
     snowscape crust. Setting out on foot with the GPS device
     held before him. In this forbidding environment he might
     as well be taking a space walk -- without the security
     of a lifeline. Which is the impression we get as his
     tiny figure trudges across the ice, increasing the
     distance between himself and the snow tractor.

     MOVING WITH MULDER

     Up a gentle grade, the snow tractor now behind him.
     Moving into tight f.g. where he stops, seeing something
     now which allows him to pocket the GPS device. Dropping
     instinctively to his knees, so as to avoid being seen
     by:

     MULDER'S POV

     In the distance is an ICE STATION. A row of
     interconnecting WHITE DOME TENTS, whose design is now
     familiar to us. There are what look like snow tractors
     and other snow vehicles parked alongside the
     structures.

     RESUME MULDER

     Pulling a compact pair of binoculars from one of his
     deep jacket pockets. Training them on:

     THE ICE STATION - BINO MATTE

     PANNING across the domes and vehicles, where there is no
     sign of personnel -- until MULDER PANS off the building,
     finding in his field glasses AN APPROACHING SNOW
     TRACTOR. Moving across the landscape toward the ice
     station. When it pulls to a stop, A MAN exits out of one
     of the domes: THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN. Moving to the
     vehicle and getting in.

     The vehicle reverses now, transporting the CSM back
     away from the ice station.

     CLOSE ON MULDER

     Taking the field glasses away from his eyes. The
     excitement he feels expressed now in his breathing,
     which has become harder and shallower. Mulder rises,
     beginning to move the still great distance between
     himself and the ice station.

                                             CUT TO:


     WIDE ON SCREEN

     Mulder moving slowly across the white horizon toward the
     domed tents.


     LOW ANGLE ON MULDER'S FEET

     Moving cautiously, and with effort on the snowscape
     crust. CAMERA RISING up to Mulder's face, determined and
     watchful.


     FOLLOWING MULDER

     The ice station still several hundred yards in the
     distance, when MULDER SUDDENLY FALLS OUT OF FRAME,
     disappearing into a hole in the snowscape crust that
     just moments earlier had been stable footing.

                                             HARD CUT TO:


     INT. SNOW ICE BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS

     Where Mulder's body falls through a ceiling of snowscape
     crust, landing on his back with a THUD on a hard
     surface. It takes him a moment to catch his breath,
     somewhat reminiscent of Stevie at the beginning of the
     picture. Wincing through the pain. Until he turns over,
     regaining his wits, and his bearings.

     NEW ANGLE

     Mulder has fallen on a hard, narrow metallic structure.
     Its dull black color a stark contrast to the white ice
     it's encased in. The bubble has been created by air
     coming out of vents in the structure, carving out
     corresponding patterns in the ceiling; softening the ice
     and snow above.

     CLOSER ON MULDER

     rising to his knees, the AIR from one of these vents
     blowing onto his face. Pulling off the hood of his
     jacket, looking deep into the vent which is open,
     ungrated.

     And big enough for a man to crawl into. Which, after
     considering the hole he's fallen through high above him,
     is really Mulder's only choice.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. RIBBED CORRIDOR DUCT - CONTINUOUS

     Mulder pulls himself forward through the ribbed corridor
     duct with his elbows, moving lizard-like into the
     constricted darkness.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

     Above a frozen ice lith, Mulder's head appears,
     squeezing his shoulders and body out of a venting. With
     effort, Mulder slides out of the small space, using some
     architecture above as a handhold. Pulling his legs free
     and dropping onto the floor.

     MULDER'S POV

     It is dark in here, the features of the corridor
     ill-defined.

     RESUME MULDER - WIDER

     Mulder pulls a flashlight from a pocket in his parka,
     snicks it on. Its beam reflecting off tall frozen liths
     of ice regularly spaced on both sides of the corridor.

     NEW ANGLE ON MULDER

     Training the light down the corridor, which curves away
     in both directions. Then pointing it at something right
     in front of his nose: something that gives him a start.

     Reaching up with his hand to brush away frost from the
     lith. Finding A MAN FROZEN IN ICE. Naked, his eyes
     staring into some long-forgotten distance. His hair is
     dark, his flat features familiar to us. He is the
     prehistoric hunter from the opening scenes of the movie.
     His flesh has the opaque, see-through quality that we've
     seen before. Inside of which, frozen along with the man,
     is an EMBRYONIC CREATURE.

     REVERSE ON MULDER

     Reacting to this sight, then moving off down the
     corridor, his pace quickened.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA

     LOW ANGLE on the great white expanse. Across which a
     snow tractor is moving. PANNING with the vehicle to...

     Mulder's snow tractor, where the first tractor stops,
     its headlights trained on Mulder's ride.

     A beat, then the discovering machine moves out again,
     following the tracks that Mulder has left, which brings
     it STRAIGHT TOWARD CAMERA. As it passes us, we can see
     the DRIVER and the Cigarette Smoking Man sitting in the
     cabin. As we:

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

     MULDER comes to the end of the dim ice corridor where
     soft light is penetrating through several low, arched
     openings.

     Mulder has to drop down to his knees to see into the
     openings.

     ANGLE FROM OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BALCONY PASSAGEWAY

     Where Mulder is seen looking TOWARD CAMERA. The Balcony
     passageway is short. Mulder drops to his stomach again,
     pulling himself through, toward us. When he reaches the
     opposite end, Mulder pokes his head out, looking up in
     wonder at:


     INT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON
     A STADIUM-SIZED DOME -- (CGI SET EXTENSION)

     Imagine a domed sports arena -- this is the scope and
     scale of the space that Mulder has penetrated. We see
     him as only a small speck on a balcony midway between
     floor and ceiling. Pulling himself out of the balcony
     passageway, which is like countless other passageways.
     Which are actually ventilation ports.

     ANGLE OVER MULDER

     Pulling himself to his feet. Beholding the space before
     him. Looking down to the center floor where a large
     central theater gives off a light different from
     elsewhere in the dome. An icy, bright glow. Leading down
     to the central theater far below are several LARGE
     TUBULAR SPOKES. (One of which leads up right next to
     Mulder's position.)

     ANGLE ON MULDER

     Reacting to this. Then something captures his
     attention.

     MULDER'S POV

     There on the floor, far down below, is THE BUBBLE LITTER
     Scully was transported in. (NOTE* Scully's clothes are
     still in the bubble litter.) Standing out as a rather
     human artifact against the otherwise dull gray bulwarks
     and architecture surrounding it.


     INT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON
     MULDER

     looks beside him where the joint that connects two
     sections of one of the long tube spokes is designed with
     an allowance -- a separation that might allow a man to
     slip through the joint into the tube. Which is what
     Mulder does here.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. TUBULAR SPOKE - CONTINUOUS

     WIDE ANGLE FROM INSIDE TUBE TERMINUS

     Mulder squeezing through into the tube, looking down
     past what looks like a chair lift-like track, on which
     the chairs are actually empty cryopod mechanisms; the
     same structures Mulder saw in the ribbed corridor in
     which bodies were encased in ice. Except these cryopods
     are empty.

     Mulder begins to creep down TOWARD CAMERA, picking his
     way around the empty cryopods.

     REVERSE ANGLE ON MULDER

     Creeping away from us. Heading toward:


     INT. LOWER CRYOPOD CORRIDOR

     Where Mulder pops out at the lower tube terminus. Which
     leads into this bulwarked corridor at the base of the
     large stadium structure. Where:

     REVERSE ON THIS CORRIDOR

     Where Mulder is walking past frozen CRYOPODS hanging on
     a track. Each icy pod containing a HUMAN BODY frozen
     within. Partially visible behind clear blue ice. But
     these are modern men, and women. Their expressions a
     confused horror, as if they have been somehow frozen
     alive. They are slowly tracking.

     Walking along the slowly moving carousel of frozen
     humanity. Stopping, turning, almost as if having
     sensed:

     NEW ANGLE OVER OPPOSITE CRYOPOD

     PUSHING IN ON MULDER'S FACE. Recording the horror and
     fear he's experiencing, on seeing:

     CAMERA RISING UP A FROSTY WALL OF BLUE ICE

     Where a woman's body is encased, its naked features
     hidden behind the opacity of the newly frozen blue
     crust. But whose face is unmistakable as that of Agent
     Scully's. Frozen in a similar expression of far-away
     horror, her eyes cast slightly heavenward.

     MULDER

     hurries to get his jacket unzipped. Removing the FELT
     ENVELOPE, removing the syringe body, the needle and the
     AMPULE.

     Hastily putting the syringe together, getting the needle
     poked into the soft rubber cap of the ampule. Bleeding
     the syringe now, the substance inside squirting out of
     the end of the needle onto the floor of the ship.

     And the moment it does, the whole floor SIZZLES like
     water being dropped onto a hot skillet. Spreading out
     from Mulder in every direction. A VIOLENT CHEMICAL
     REACTION, as predicted by the man who gave him this
     substance. A moment later the entire structure Mulder is
     in SHUNTS. Shuddering violently and setting up a low-end
     RUMBLE. Causing Mulder to accidentally drop the
     syringe.

     LOW CLOSE ANGLE

     on the floor, where the syringe hits and bounces, but
     does not break or leak. Mulder scrambling into frame to
     re-collect it. Seeing the floor where the liquid from
     the syringe hit -- where it has been ETCHED AWAY by the
     substance.


     EXT. HULL OF SPACESHIP/ICY BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS

     Where Mulder crawled into the duct. Condensed air is
     streaming out of all the ducts now. The ice and snow
     above beginning to melt from the force and heat of the
     blasting all.

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     EXT. ICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

     We can hear low end rumble and vibration. TWO DOZEN MEN
     are streaming out of the dome tents. Moving to their
     carious snow tractors and starting the vehicles.

     A small exodus, the tractors pulling out of camp in a
     rush. Heading off in various directions.

     CAMERA FINDING THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN moving to his
     tractor, with THE MAN WHO SHOT MULDER. Taking the last
     drag of his cigarette before throwing it into the snow.
     He stares down at it a moment, as if caught in the grip
     of some emotion conflicting with duty.

     The Man who shot Mulder inside the tractor now, throwing
     open the door for the CSM.

                            MAN WHO SHOT MULDER
               C'mon. It's all going to hell.

     He climbs up onto the vehicle, gets in and closes the
     door. And the vehicle pulls away as we:

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     INT. LOWER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS - AGENT MULDER

     Back on his feet, SMASHING now at the crust of brittle
     blue-ice that encases Scully. BASHING, SMASHING and then
     finally breaking through the hard outer later, its inner
     slushy contents spilling out of the puncture that
     exposes Scully's face and shoulder. Watery aqua-tinted
     liquid drains from her mouth and nose. But Scully is not
     conscious, and there is no indication she is even alive,
     her face frozen in a blank, almost beatific expression.

     OVER MULDER TO SCULLY

     As he plunges the needle into Scully's arm at the front
     of her shoulder. To which there is an immediate reaction
     -- as if given a shot of adrenalin. Her eyes blinking
     away the cold moisture.

                            MULDER
               Scully --

     Scully's lips move goldfish-like as she tries to suck in
     air, an almost fearful expression overcoming her like a
     swimmer who's been held under too long. But no words are
     coming out yet.

                            MULDER
               Breathe -- can you breathe?!

     Scully is straining to do just that -- when liquid
     suddenly SPEWS from Scully's mouth. And she begins to
     cough and gag -- taking big gulps of air as her eyes
     focus on Mulder as if on a phantom, or a miracle.

     Finally faint words ushering forth, whispering breaths
     that Mulder cannot discern.

                            MULDER
               What?

     CLOSE ON MULDER AND SCULLY

     As he leans into her, putting his ear up to her mouth.
     As the softest sound comes out in Scully's frosty
     breath.

                            SCULLY
               Cold...

                            MULDER
               Hang on. I'm going to get you out of
               here.

     As she continues to suck air.

     EXT. HULL OF SPACESHIP/ICE BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS

     The hot air blasting from the ducts is causing the ice
     pack above to melt and collapse.

     EXT. ICE STATION - CONTINUOUS - WIDE

     As the ice tractors head away in all directions from the
     domed structures. A misty fog now emanating from the
     seams of the domes. Heat and condensation.

     INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS

     Filling with misty condensation, too. The small beams of
     light that lighted Mulder's way earlier are now small
     shafts piercing the gathering interior cloud.
     Illuminating:


     THE PREHISTORIC MAN

     Frozen in his icy pod, the hard semi-translucent surface
     of which is now etched with small streams of water
     running to the floor. Everything is melting and in
     motion.

     Including the CREATURE which is vaguely visible inside
     the frozen man. It TURNS slightly inside the body, like
     an animal in utero. Its eyes now looking at us,
     blinking. As it presses against its own fleshy
     container, the body of its human host.

                                             CUT BACK TO:


     INT. LOWER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

     It, too, is filling with misty condensation.

     VARIOUS SHOTS

     Of the ice encasing the human forms sweating and
     melting.

     CAMERA ADJUSTING UP TO REVEAL Mulder pulling Scully
     along in a fireman's carry. She is dressed now in
     Mulder's snow parka and the outer nylon pants he was
     wearing. Scully's legs are weak beneath her. Her body
     limp, but not lifeless. Mulder laboring to get her up
     the INTERIOR of the steep curving cylinder spoke, as the
     air fills with mist.

     NEW ANGLE ON MULDER AND SCULLY - LOOKING DOWN THE TUBE

     Moving toward along the now-halted cryopod carrier

     toward:


     ANGLE ON BALCONY/CATWALK

     Mulder pushing Scully up, though she seems to have at
     least some limited ability to do this on her own. The
     DEEP, LOW RUMBLE we heard in the open frames of the
     movie reaching full volume now. The whole environment
     vibrating as Mulder boosts Scully up on the catwalk.
     Climbing up over the prostrate body. Picking her up from
     the floor, pulling her back into the fireman's carry.


     INT. LOWER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

     Where the bodies are all beginning to melt.

     VARIOUS SHOTS of rivulets of water forming on the
     icy liths that encase the bodies. The water from them
     seeping onto the circular central floor. The condensing
     mist thick and swirling.

     CLOSE ON PODS

     Where the body it houses seems to move. Though AS CAMERA
     PUSHES IN we see that it is the creature inside this
     body moving, as if the heat and the defrosting are
     bringing the embryos to life.


     INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE DOWN
     CORRIDOR

     Scully's head pokes through now, as she's pushed through
     the opening that Mulder used earlier to get into the
     vaulted arena. Pushed in fits and starts until she's all
     the way through. Mulder now straining and squeezing to
     do the same on his own.

     The corridor is filled with heavy condensed mist now as
     Mulder finally slips out of the low passageway, trying
     to get his bearing now as he huddles low over Scully.
     Turning his attention to her as she COUGHS HOARSELY --
     in some kind of acute spasm of pain -- but alive.

                            MULDER
               We've got to keep moving.

                            SCULLY
                      (weakly)
               Where are we?

                            MULDER
               You got me. But I think I know what
               they did with Jimmy Hoffa.

     Scully is struggling now as Mulder tries to pull her to
     her feet again. In real physical pain.

                            SCULLY
               I can't...

     Scully can't finish speaking, her voice becoming a
     hoarse cough.

                            SCULLY
                      (barely a whisper)
               I can't go any farther.

                            MULDER
               Yes you can. You're going to make it,
               Scully.

     Mulder hauling Scully up off the floor AWAY FROM CAMERA
     now.


     NEW ANGLE ON RIBBED CORRIDOR

     CAMERA MOVING THROUGH SPACE in the empty corridor,
     moving at a speed equal to Mulder and Scully's as they
     round the semi-circular ribbed corridor to meet us.
     Coming out of the mist, Scully back in the fireman's
     carry. Approaching the place where Mulder slipped down
     into the corridor.

     Mulder stopping and seeing:

     THE BODY IN THE MELTING ICE LITH

     As it too moves, the embryonic creature inside it
     turning slightly, as if coming awake.

     REVERSE ON MULDER

     Reacting to this -- and then to Scully who suddenly
     starts GASPING FOR BREATH.

     Falling now from Mulder's grasps as her legs buckle and
     she goes down.

     LOW ANGLE ON SCULLY

     Her face is going red, straining for air. Her eyes
     rolling, seeking relief. As Mulder drops down beside
     her.

                            MULDER
               Shit --

     But she is unable to answer. Mulder hastening to unzip
     her/his jacket. To get to her neck and find a pulse.

                            MULDER
               Scully --

     Mulder cannot find a pulse. Scully straining harder now
     as Mulder reaches his fingers into her mouth, clearing
     her passageway. Moving on top of her now, and pumping
     forcefully on her chest -- trying to get air into her.
     One - two - three.

     And putting his mouth down to hers (FINALLY!), breathing
     his life into her. Pulling away from her to see that he
     is unsuccessful at this -- that Scully is continuing to
     strain. Pumping her chest again --

                            MULDER
               You're not dying on me now -- godammit
               godammit godammit --

     As he pumps her chest. Placing his mouth over hers again
     and BREATH - BREATH -- BREATH.

     Lifting his mouth from hers, feeling for a pulse again,
     putting his eat down to her mouth, praying he'll feel
     the breeze of a breath. Nothing. While:


     ANGLE OVER HIM TO THE CREATURE IN THE ICY POD

     As it moves again, MORE VIOLENTLY NOW. As the ice around
     it continues to melt and fissure.


     RESUME MULDER

     His hands going to a pocket on the inside of the jacket
     Scully is wearing -- his jacket -- finding again the
     syringe that he used on Scully. It is still partially
     full of vaccine. Mulder finding this, getting ready to
     use it when --

     -- Scully's body suddenly comes back to life beneath
     him. Labored breaths which turn into a coughing spasm.
     Mulder breaths relievedly for a moment, watching Scully
     coughing, coming back to life. Her eyes trying to focus
     on him, finding him. Seeing his labored relief. The
     panic melting away.

                            SCULLY
                      (weakly, pained whisper)
               Mulder...

     She wants to tell him something. He leans down next to
     her.

                            SCULLY
                      (continued weak)
               Had you big time.

     Mulder has but a moment to savor this weary victory
     though when he REACTS to something, that causes him to
     WHIP HIS HEAD AROUND.


     MULDER'S POV DOWN RIBBED CORRIDOR

     Through the condensed mist he can see CREATURES
     BEGINNING TO HATCH, sprouting from the melted
     ice-encased bodies they have gestated in. Their THREE
     FINGERED HANDS beating at the soft ice. Their powerful
     feet kicking at it, too.


     RESUME MULDER

     Looking the other way down the corridor, seeing --

     MORE CREATURES

     The slushy material that makes up the inner core
     spilling out with them as the creatures KICK out of
     their tombs.

     RESUME MULDER

     Lifting Scully up with all his strength he has left in
     him. He's got to get her overhead now, back up the
     venting that he slipped down from. She is weak and of
     little help.

     Mulder gets her propped up on his strength so that he
     can use the power of his legs to boost her toward the
     opening. Which puts him face to face with THE EMBRYONIC
     CREATURE. Its eye looking directly at him, blinking,
     before it goes into another FITFUL SPASM inside its host
     body.


     ANGLE DOWN FROM VENT

     Where Scully is boosted up TOWARD CAMERA. Her hands
     reaching feebly for something to grab onto. Finding a
     handhold.

                            MULDER
               Keep breathing, Scully.

     She utters something guttural, unintelligible as the
     next thrust up from Mulder gets her head and shoulders
     into the opening of the vent.


     RESUME MULDER

     Beneath her, pushing with all his might. His hands under
     her shoes now, forcing her up into the vent like a
     rolled carpet into the rafters.


     RESUME SCULLY

     Struggling with her arms and elbows, barely conscious,
     but somehow able to manage herself forward.


     RESUME MULDER

     Pushing Scully up the last little way. Then reaching up
     to find a handhold for himself. Grabbing hold and
     lifting himself as one of his feet kicks at the ice --
     where the creature he was just face to face with BURSTS
     from its icy pod. One hand, then the other shooting out
     of the ice where they have broken through the host.
     Ripping open the front of the body, including the man's
     face. Making a slimy, gaping tear in what was formerly
     flesh.

     Its hands grabbing at Mulder as he thrashes to free
     himself from it getting a grip.

     As Mulder struggles to pull himself up, fighting off the
     creature which he cannot see beneath him.


     RESUME CREATURE

     As it emerges from the ice, still grasping and TEARING
     at Mulder's legs with its claws. But as it BURSTS
     COMPLETELY from its place, Mulder is able to pull
     himself up and into the vent in one athletic movement.


     ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE VENT - SCULLY

     lies motionless in the ducting, her body forced forward
     by Mulder's in this last surging move.

     TIGHT ANGLE ON MULDER

     Drawing his legs up quickly inside. Not wasting a moment
     shoving Scully's butt forward in front of him.

                            MULDER
               Scully -- you breathing?

     RESUME SCULLY

     Letting out another low, guttural sound -- which STRAINS
     out of her with each push forward.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. SNOW/ICE BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS

     Scully's head and arms push up through the vent where
     Mulder first entered. The ice and snow surrounding it,
     which had created the bubble structure, have melted and
     fallen. So that above Scully's larger hole has opened up
     to the surface. The air is full of condensation,
     swirling around them.

     ANGLE FROM ABOVE - THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ICE

     Where, through the swirling steam we see Mulder push
     Scully clear of the vent. Climbing free himself now.
     When the surface they are upon SHUDDERS AND QUAKES. As
     if it has come unloosed, destabilized.

     And with this comes A MIGHTY FORCE OF STEAM from the
     vent Mulder and Scully just crawled from. Blasting up
     past them with terrible HISSING FORCE. Causing Mulder to
     throw Scully away from its superheated energy.

     Pulling her up the now climbable embankment created by
     the melting snow; pulling her toward the surface of the
     ice sheet.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA - WIDE

     Where a wide radius of steam rises from similar and
     regularly spaced holes in the ice sheet, defining a
     circular structure beneath. The White Domed Tents of the
     ice station are in the center of this, dwarfed by the
     enormity of the melting radius.


     RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY

     Mulder pulling her up the softened and collapsed snow.
     The hot steam blasting up with hideous force behind
     them. The sound DEAFENING.

     NEW ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY

     Pulling her to the surface of the ice sheet where behind
     them in the distance the ICE STATION can be seen through
     the atmosphere of condensed air. When suddenly the ice
     beneath it gives way and the ice station falls away,
     caving in to the center of the radius. Which is what
     begins to happen to the rest of the ice sheet that
     spreads out to where Mulder and Scully are standing.
     Causing Mulder to realize:

                            MULDER
                      (over the din)
               We've got to run!

     She is weak, but is able to find her footing. Dragged
     behind Mulder as the ice behind them begins to break
     away, falling down into an ever-expanding center and
     sending up magnificent geysers of steam created by the
     superheated surface below.


     WIDE ON SCENE

     Mulder and Scully running AT CAMERA just ahead of the
     collapsing center. The mass of ice around them beginning
     to break up. Steam vents erupting instantaneously
     everywhere.

                                             CUT TO:


     HIGH ANGLE ON SCENE

     A black dome is becoming visible through the giant
     circle of steam, in the ever-widening center hole that
     Mulder and Scully are running from. Which is chasing
     them to the edge of the radius.

                                             CUT TO:


     ANGLE FOLLOWING MULDER AND SCULLY

     As Mulder struggles to pull Scully fast enough to
     outrace the icy debris that is tumbling away just behind
     them. Large chunks falling and bouncing off the
     superheated surface below, blown back up like water
     being dropped onto a hot skillet.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXTREMELY HIGH AND WIDE

     The Agents mere specks fleeing the circle of churning
     ice and steam. As it cascades away in three hundred and
     sixty degrees. From here the deafening sound if absorbed
     into the vastness, tricking us of the reality of the
     massive movement of frozen material down below.

                                             CUT TO:


     ANGLE LEADING MULDER AND SCULLY

     As Scully loses her footing, falling to the ground.
     Mulder dragging her back up to her feet, though,
     maintaining forward momentum. While behind them the
     thundering force of the superheated melting snow and ice
     is moving in on them.

     And then suddenly -- MULDER AND SCULLY are gone!

     The radial edge of the falling snow continuing only a
     few feet beyond where they disappeared. The violent
     upheaval of snow abating but slightly. Beat, beat...

     THEN THE AGENTS APPEAR AGAIN. Thrust upward by a RISING
     BLACK PRECIPICE which catapults them off its leading
     edge. As they fall the distance to the sheet of ice
     below.

                                             CUT TO:


     LOW ANGLE ON ICE SHEET

     Where the Agents hit hard on the ice sheet. The rain of
     ice chunks pounding all around them. As the monolithic
     wall of the craft continues to rise.

     Mulder trying to get to Scully in this hail of debris
     which he shields his face from.


     WIDE ON LEADING EDGE

     Rising faster now out of the earth as it begins to
     increasingly shed and break free of the frozen weight it
     carried. Until the bottom of the edge of the wall
     appears, lifting clear of the ice sheet and the crater
     that held it.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE ON SPACE SHIP

     Where now we see the scope and shape of the ship, which
     is breathtaking. The domed center sloping off to a
     gentle gradient, which is the surface that Mulder and
     Scully were running on. The ship is now slowly rotating
     as it moves upward in a gently rising hover.

     Mulder and Scully are on the ice sheet below.


     RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY

     Scully face down on the ice. Mulder lifting his head
     when THE HEAVY SHADOW of the ship comes over them.
     Looking up from this position to see:

     THE SPACE SHIP

     Moving slowly, laterally just overhead. Thunderously
     rumbling. The dark detail of its underside visible in
     this angle. As it continues to rise, the shadow passing
     over Mulder and Scully.

                                             CUT TO:


     NEW ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY

     Scully is still face down on the ice, as Mulder watches
     the ship's shadow cast over Mulder's SnowCat which is
     still parked in the distance. Moving up and off.

     The ship continues up into the Antarctic sky where it
     rises toward the sky where it begins to get WHITEHOT.
     Transforming itself into pure energy. It is visible for
     several moments during transformation. Then it
     disappears completely. As it does the RUMBLE, which
     dopplers across the white, barren landscape. Then it is
     gone.


     MULDER

     Watches this then lays his head down on Scully's back.
     He is spent, at the brink of complete exhaustion. His
     whole body heaving. But now starting to shiver, and to
     lose consciousness.

     Scully's body is motionless beneath him, for a moment we
     might believe that this is the way it might end. Out
     here on the ice with Mulder and Scully freezing to
     death. A chill wind blows off the Antarctic plain, the
     same LOW RUMBLE, the only taint of silence in vastness
     of this literal end of the world.

     Then Scully coughs -- the same hoarse cough. She's
     alive. Struggling to consciousness. Her head lifting
     slightly, TURNING TO CAMERA. Her eyes blink open and she
     coughs again. Feeling Mulder's weight on top of her,
     unaware of his condition or even where she is.

                            SCULLY
                      (weakly)
               Mulder...

     There is no answer. Scully struggling to pull herself
     out from under the weight of his body. Rolling over so
     that her face is opposite Mulder's now. Seeing that he
     has lost consciousness. Finding the strength to roll him
     over, so that she can cradle him and warm him.

     HIGH WIDE ANGLE ON THIS SCENE

     With the Snowcat a short distance away, Mulder and
     Scully in each others arms. The way it should end.

     FADE TO BLACK

     Silence. Longer than we would like. Long enough to make
     us nervous, then certain, then angry. Then...we FADE UP
     a prelap of the sound of a CRACKLING FIRE.

     FADING UP ON:


     EXT. ACRES OF CORN - MAGIC HOUR

     TRACKING LOW WITH MEN IN FATIGUES, moving along the
     perimeter of the corn field as they set fire to the corn
     stalks with small handheld butane burners. While other
     Men in Fatigues are moving between the rows dousing the
     furrows with accelerant.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DALLAS - NIGHT

     The large room filled with the evidence and debris from
     the bombing. It is dark. Until A FLASHLIGHT BEAM pricks
     the blackness, moving toward us into f.g. Carried by the
     man we now recognize as The Man Who Shot Mulder. He
     moves with directness, purpose. Finding what he's
     looking for amid the cataloged material, he finds on a
     work bench. Next to the microscope Scully had used. It
     is the BONE FRAGMENTS, held in an evidence container.

     He pockets them and exits as quiet and directly as he
     entered.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. ACRES OF CORN - WIDE - CGI PLATE

     The sky aglow with orange flames as the crops burn to
     the ground. We hold on this shot, PRELAPPING the sound
     of:

                            JANA CASSIDY'S VOICE
               ... in light of the report I've got
               before me; in light of the narrative
               I'm now hearing...


     INT. FBI OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW - DAY

     Jana Cassidy sits at the head of the desk, just as when
     we first met her.

     She is flanked by the other members of the review board,
     including A.D. Skinner who sits at the end of the
     table.

     Cassidy flips through a file she's referred to before
     she continues. Looking up with consternation as she
     resumes.

                            CASSIDY
               ... my official report is incomplete
               pending these new facts I'm being
               asked to reconcile. Agent Scully...

     AGENT SCULLY

     Sitting where she last sat, at the small table. The seat
     next to her conspicuously empty. Her face bears the
     signs of slight frostbite, somewhat healed. Her
     expression is even, her attitude composed, but her eyes
     are filled of dark, restrained defiance.

                            CASSIDY
               ...while there is direct evidence now
               that a federal agent may have been
               involved in the bombing... the other
               events you've laid down here seem too
               incredible on their own, and quite
               frankly implausible in their
               connection.

     PANNING THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS - curious, bemused like
     Cassidy. Skinner shifts uncomfortably.

                            SCULLY
               What is it you find incredible?

                            CASSIDY
               Well...where would you like me to
               start? Antarctica is a long way from
               Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very
               well submit a report to the Attorney
               General that alleges the links you've
               made here. Bees and corn crops do not
               quite fall under the rubric of
               domestic terrorism.

                            SCULLY
               No, they don't.

                            CASSIDY
               Most of what I find in here is lacking
               a coherent picture of an organization
               with an attributable motive. I realize
               you're very lucky to be alive Agent
               Scully. The ordeal you've endured has
               clearly affected you -- though the
               holes in your account leave this panel
               with little choice but to delete these
               references from our final report to
               the Justice Department. Until which
               time hard evidence becomes available
               that would give us cause to pursue
               such an investigation.

     Scully has her hand in her coat pocket now. Moving
     around the table and approaching Cassidy. Removing
     something which she puts on the desk in front of her. A
     small vial.

                            SCULLY
               I don't believe the FBI currently has
               an investigation unit qualified to
               pursue the evidence in hand.

     Cassidy picks up the vial, studying the contents of this
     vial: the dead bee that stung Scully. Studying it as
     Scully turns and moves to the door, without permission,
     no further adieu.

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE A.D. SKINNER

     Watching Scully exit.

                            CASSIDY (O.S.)
               Mr. Skinner....?

     CAMERA PIVOTING TO INCLUDE CASSIDY. Looking at him.

                           CASSIDY
               Please ask Agent Scully to come back
               to this hearing. We're not quite
               finished.

     As Skinner rises, unsure of the intent behind this
     directive, we:

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

     We are JUST ABOVE THE TREETOPS. The Capitol Dome is in
     the far distance. CAMERA CRANING DOWN to find Mulder
     sitting by himself on a park bench. We are WIDE. There
     is no one else around.

     Until the Cigarette Smoking Man appears. Walking through
     the otherwise deserted park. Joining Mulder on the park
     bench.

     CLOSER ON MULDER, THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

     They do not speak for several moments. A quite tension
     as the CSM lights up a trademark smoke. Inhaling,
     exhaling. Then:

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
               Congratulations on your survival. Your
               life is worthless now, I hope you know
               that.

                            MULDER
               And yours?

                            CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
                      (derisive)
               You think you've stopped it. What I've
               worked for fifty years to create. You
               haven't stopped it. You can't stop
               it.
                      (takes a drag)
               You're just one man.

                            MULDER
               You're wrong.

     WIDE ANGLE

     Mulder rises from the bench heading TOWARD CAMERA. The
     CSM rising, watching him.

     As Mulder continues toward us. ADJUST TO REVEAL Agent
     Scully in the f.g. Mulder moving to her as the CSM
     watches from the distance. Their eyes meet, an unspoken
     restored bond exchanged in this moment. Before Mulder
     takes Scully by the arm, leads her off. Leaving the CSM
     standing alone in the distance. As we:

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. CORN FIELDS/WHITE DOMES - TUNISIA - DAY

     TRACKING LOW WITH A PAIR OF FEET

     The wearer of them sporting peasant sandals. We realize
     shortly that while the feet are moving across sandy
     ground, that the foliage in the near b.g. is corn. And
     that the person we are tracking with is passing row
     after row of stalks.

     CAMERA RISING AS IT TRACKS

     REVEALING A TUNISIAN MAN dressed in peasant clothes. He
     is carrying a piece of paper. Moving with hasty purpose.
     Stopping at the end of one of the long rows of corn
     where CONRAD STRUGHOLD is coming toward him. Making his
     way between rows of stalks. The Peasant waits patiently
     as Strughold approaches, handing him the piece of
     paper.

     Strughold reads it, his otherwise steely countenance
     reflecting a disturbance seen only in the slight
     narrowing of his eyes.

     He looks up at the Peasant and says something to him in
     Tunisian Arabic. Said as command, which causes the
     Peasant to nod dutifully and move off as he came.

     Strughold stands for a moment, then crumples the paper
     slightly and drops it. Moving off down the same corn row
     in which he approached.

     CAMERA DROPPING TO THE GROUND where we find the paper on
     which we see a flat section that is not so crumpled we
     cannot read the words: X-FILES RE-OPENED. STOP. PLEASE
     ADVISE. STOP.

     CAMERA RISING NOW. Rising up past the stalks. Where we
     can still see Strughold walking. RISING UP AND UP to
     reveal ACRES AND ACRES OF CORN. Many times more than we
     had seen previously. Stretched out across the Tunisian
     Desert, ending only where THREE WHITE DOMES stand on the
     distant horizon.

     Off this image we FADE OUT.

                             THE END
