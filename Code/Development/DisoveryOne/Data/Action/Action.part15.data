      --------------------------------------------------------------

      FADE IN ON:

      EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN

      Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN

      We're looking down at what used to be called "The End of the Known
      World." A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.

      In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.

      Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging
      over a cliff:

      AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.

      Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up
      the ice. A human figure. This is:

      JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.

      Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has
      an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black
      backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to
      JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -

      CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks
      below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He
      looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head:

                              BOND
                 There has to be an easier way to earn
                 a living.

      Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until -

      ANOTHER ANGLE -

      He's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a
      toehold. But when he slams the second pick in -

      THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK -

      BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK -

      And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of
      water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached
      to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall.

      Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and
      forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum.

      At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other
      pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at:

      THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -

      Beginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on
      the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN.

      ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -

      Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally
      frayed through.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      One last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls
      himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE
      ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still,
      he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely
      holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward.

      EXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL -

      Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down -
      through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed.

      As he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he
      smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and -

      THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY -

      Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below.

      IN THE WATERBED -

      A torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge,
      he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland.

      NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND)

      Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff:

      BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL -

      On either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled
      down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself.
      In other words: This was the only way in.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK
      CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the
      side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold.

      He presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond
      slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow.

      EXT. SNOW-COVERED FOREST - BOND SKIS THROUGH THE PINES -

      EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF -

      Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below,
      amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down.

      EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE -

      Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the
      bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to:

      A ROCK OUTCROPPING.

      Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He
      unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a
      HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on:

      A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV)

      50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen
      MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the
      ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying
      HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES.

      Near a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with
      INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side.

      BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT.

      THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT -

      He sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining
      over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions.

      THE SAME SCENE ON A VIDEO WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM, LONDON.

                              BOND'S VOICE
                       (over a speaker)
                 Seven, in position.

                              TANNER'S VOICE
                 Roger, Seven.

      Watching this display is M, TANNER, and a handful of MILITARY BRASS,
      including a RUSSIAN GENERAL, BUKHARIN, and BRITISH ADMIRAL ROEBUCK,
      an aging sea-lion with no love for M, or MI-6.

      M deals with the humorless Admiral by, well, humoring him:

                              M
                 ... What were you saying, Admiral?
                 Something about this 'not being a job
                 for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing
                 playboy spy?'

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 - I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's
                 'assistance' in my report to the
                 Prime Minister. But this is, still,
                 a naval operation.

                              M
                 What do they say in Russia, General
                 Bukharin?
                       (asks questions in
                        flawless Russian)

      The general chuckles. Translates:

                              GENERAL BUKHARIN
                 'In a joint operation, someone's nose
                 always gets put out of joint.'

      M turns to Admiral Roebuck:

                              M
                 I'm interested in success, Admiral.
                 Not who gets credit.
                       (turning to:)
                 Mr. Tanner: What have we got?

      Tanner points to the video wall with a RED LASER PEN.

                              TANNER
                       (ironically)
                 A regular terrorist swap meet. Death
                 at discount: Two Chinese Long March
                 Scuds, a pair of Soviet A-17 attack
                 helicopters -

                              BUKHARIN
                       (interrupting)
                 Stolen -

                              TANNER
                 And the crates look like American M-16
                 assault rifles, Chilean antipersonnel
                 mines, six French Exocet missiles, and
                 75 - no maybe a hundred - kilograms of
                 Czech made C-4 Semtech explosive.
                       (beat)
                 Something for everyone. Fun for the
                 whole family.

                              M
                       (freezing him with a glance)
                 What about ID's?

                              TANNER
                       (pushes a button on a console)
                 One to seven: Deal the face cards.

      THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Bond adjusts a knob on the scope.

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

      On the video-screen, the picture zooms to a CLOSE UP of one of the
      arms traders. Tanner presses a button, and - almost instantly - the
      man's bio and vitals appear on another video screen.

                              TANNER
                 Gustav Meinholtz. Neo-Nazi, former
                 East German STASI agent. Ties to the
                 Beider-Meinhoff gang.
                       (pressing a button)
                 Aces high, seven. Bid to the east.

      Bond shifts his aim, east. (Intercut as necessary) He zeroes in on
      another face, and the man's stats appear in London.

                              TANNER
                 Vilko Barkoviac. Bosnian war
                 criminal; thought to be operating
                 freelance out of Teheran.
                       (pressing a button)
                 Full house, seven. Bid to the North.

      Bond complies. Another face, another set of stats:

                              TANNER
                 Sitoshi Isagura. Japanese religious
                 fanatic. Wanted for the Tokyo subway -

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                       (impatiently, cutting him off:)
                 I've seen enough. Let's finish this.
                       (ordering M:)
                 Tell your man to drop back. We're
                 initiating plan B -

                              M
                 But -

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 - Thank you, M. But this is more
                 than your man can handle.
                       (to Bukharin)
                 Are we in agreement?

                              BUKHARIN
                       (hesitant, at first)
                 - Yes. Yes.

                              M
                 Admiral -

      Moving swiftly, the Admiral has picked up a RED PHONE:

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 Command to Nelson: Authorization to
                 fire.

      EXT. A BRITISH WARSHIP - STEAMING IN THE GULF OF OMAN -

      INT. WEAPONS CONTROL ROOM - BRITISH WARSHIP -

                              CAPTAIN
                 Weapons authorized. Prepare to fire.
                 On my count: Five. Four. Three. Two -

      EXT. DECK OF THE WARSHIP -

      A launcher rotates, and - BOOM - a Cruise missile blasts off.

      INT. WARSHIP WEAPONS CONTROL ROOM -

                              FIRING OFFICER
                 Cruise missile away -

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

                              FIRING OFFICER'S VOICE (Cont'd)
                 Time to target: Four minutes.

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 I appreciate your assistance, M. But
                 this is now a military operation.

                              M
                       (urgently, to Tanner)
                 Bring up the tracking satellite. And
                 get 007 out of there.

      Tanner hits a button - and a third video screen appears, displaying a
      satellite view of the area, detailing the Cruise's path and progress.

                              TANNER
                 One to seven: Exit target area.
                 Repeat -

                              BOND'S VOICE
                 Seven to one. Negative. Wait.

      THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Bond has taken his eye from the scope. He's peering at:

      THE MIG-29'S - ("MiG-1," AND "MiG-2") -

      A FORKLIFT appears from behind the TRUCK blocking the view of "MiG-l"
      A TALL BALD MAN is riding the empty fork, with his back to us.

      BOND -

      Puts his eye back on the scope, shifts the rifle -

      MI-6/VIDEO WALL -

      Bond's scope view settles on THE BALD MAN. The forklift reaches the
      back of the truck. HE STEPS OFF as the fork begins rising to unload
      something. And as the man turns, FACING US to scan the area:

                              TANNER
                 Oh, no.

                              M
                 Who is it?

                              TANNER
                       (calling up his stats)
                 Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear
                 specialist.

                              M
                 Meaning there may be nuclear material
                 down there?

      Tanner nods. A look passes from M, to Bukharin, to Roebuck.

      THE CRUISE MISSILE -

      Hugging the surface, crossing from water to land.

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

                              VOICE FROM WARSHIP
                 Time to target: Three minutes.
                       (sfx: Beep!)
                 Target acquired. Weapon armed.

      Tension. Adrenaline. QUIET PANIC. On the SCREEN, the FORK LIFT has
      pulled a RED BOX from the truck, a SHORT ROUND MAN appearing with it.

                              M
                 Who is that?!? What's in the box??

                              TANNER
                       (punching buttons)
                 I don't know. He's not in the database -

                              M
                       (to Bukharin)
                 What's in the box, General?
                       (he shrugs)
                 What's in the box???

      BUKHARIN
      (sheepishly)
      ... We usually... Transport...
      Weapons grade uranium.

      Shock sweeps the room. M turns on Tanner:

                              M
                 Will it go off?

                              TANNER
                 Maybe. Maybe not.

                              M
                 Abort the cruise.

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 It's too late -

                              M
                 GET BOND OUT OF THERE.

                              TANNER
                 One to seven - one to seven -

      BOND - SQUINTING THROUGH THE RIFLE AT THE OUTCROPPING -

                              BOND
                 Negative, one. NOT YET.

      THE TRUCK/MiG-l, ON THE GROUND/THROUGH THE SCOPE -

      THE BALD MAN slaps the back of the truck obscuring MiG-1. THE TRUCK
      PULLS AWAY, revealing MiG-l's WING. Hanging from the weapons pod: A
      NUCLEAR BOMB.

      BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Mutters a curse.

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

                              TANNER
                 Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield,
                 one kiloton.

                              M
                 Will the cruise set it off?

                              TANNER
                 Yes.

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                       (to Bukharin)
                 Jesus. Can't you people keep
                 anything locked up?

                              GENERAL BUKHARIN
                 We didn't know it was missing.

                              M
                 Get me the Prime Minister. Alert
                 NATO, the CIA, the Pentagon.
                       (presses a button:)
                 Seven: This is a direct order. I
                 want you out of there. Do you copy?

      THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Bond's headset lies on top of the rock, along with the telescopic
      sight - still broadcasting.

      Find Bond, crouching BEHIND the rock. Automatic rifle in one hand,
      GRENADE in the other. He pulls the pin, hurls it 40 feet away.
      Pauses. Waits, counting down time. Then -

      BOND SPRINGS. SHOOTS at one of the CRATES. IT BLOWS UP, just as -
      THE GRENADE EXPLODES.

      There's PANIC ON THE GROUND. Men running everywhere as THE RADAR/
      GATLING GUN spins, and SENDS A HAIL OF FIRE at Bond's diversion.

      And with this, BOND is off, SPRINTING INTO THE CHAOS.

      THE SAME SCENE - VIDEO SCREEN - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM.

      Stoned silence. Disbelief. Tanner whispers:

                              TANNER
                 God help him.

      THE CRUISE MISSILE - FLYING THROUGH A MOUNTAIN RAVINE -

      God help the rest of us.

      THE SECRET AIR BASE -

      As various factions shoot at each other (Who's the traitor?) Bond
      streaks toward the action. Without breaking stride, he swings his
      gun to the right: TWO BURSTS. THREE MEN DIE. Still running, he
      swings to the left: ANOTHER BURST. TWO MORE DOWN.

      Ahead, Bond sees the FLIGHT CREWS DASHING for the MiG's. He makes a
      beeline for MiG-1.

      ANGLE ON THE BALD MAN -

      Slamming the gate on the RED BOX in a cargo truck. Rushing to the
      passenger door. Climbing in. The SHORT ROUND MAN floors the
      accelerator, driving them away.

      THE CRUISE MISSILE - STARTING ITS DESCENT DOWN A MOUNTAIN

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - M, WATCHING HELPLESSLY -

                              VOICE FROM WARSHIP
                 Time to target: Thirty seconds.

      WIDE ON MiG-1 -

      The pilot climbs the ladder to the cockpit. Running at full tilt,
      BOND LEAPS, pulls the man down. They fall to the tarmac, FIGHTING.
      Bond SHOVES A KNIFE in the man's ribs, killing him.

      Kneeling, Bond takes the pilot's helmet off. He looks up: A MAN is
      coming at him with a GUN. In one unbroken move, Bond YANKS THE KNIFE
      from the pilot's body and THROWS IT - thwack - into the man's heart.

      ANGLE ON MIG-2'S PILOT - WATCHING THIS FROM HIS COCKPIT.

      RETURN ON BOND - CLIMBING INTO THE COCKPIT -

      Where the COPILOT (having climbed in from the other side,) sees it's
      not the right guy. As he fumbles for a weapon, BOND BASHES HIM WITH
      THE HELMET. The copilot collapses into his seat, unconscious.

      Bond settles into his seat, fires the engines, closes the double
      canopy, and begins taxiing out.

      THE CRUISE MISSILE - CROSSING OVER THE PERIMETER OF THE AIR BASE

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - ROEBUCK, TANNER, M, WATCHING, UNABLE TO BREATHE -

      HIGH ANGLE - THE RUNWAY -

      The CRUISE SKIMS IN DIRECTLY OVER BOND'S PLANE, speeding to takeoff.

      (INT. BOND'S MiG) BOND SHOVES THE THROTTLES TO THE FIREBALL AND -

      THE VIDEO-WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

      KA-BOOM!!!! The scene on the screen erupts in a GIANT EXPLOSION -
      then turns to video-snow. Is Bond alive? No one in London knows.

      HIGH ANGLE - THE AIR BASE -

      The FIREBALL grows and grows, a raging hell. And just when it seems
      no one could possibly survive: BOND'S MiG ROCKETS OUT OF THE FLAMES!!

      INT. BOND'S MiG -

      Bond thinks he's safe. Sound. Until -

      MiG-2 FLIES OUT OF THE FIREBALL -

      Cannons blazing at 007. A hail of metal and tracers.

      INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG -

      Bond goes into evasive maneuvers - jinks right, jinks left - when,
      suddenly, THE COPILOT REVIVES, and starts trying to STRANGLE Bond
      with a METAL LANYARD. Struggling, Bond HEARS a THIN HIGH-PITCHED
      TONE -

      INT./EXT. MIG-2

      The pilot has locked onto Bond's MiG. Boom! TWO HEAT-SEEKING
      MISSILES roar away.

      INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG -

      Fighting the garrote, Bond KICKS THE THROTTLES forward and PULLS BACK
      ON THE YOKE. The MiG goes into a spine crushing climb as -

      THE TWO HEAT SEEKING MISSILES FOLLOW HIM, LOOPING UPWARD.

      INT. MIG-2 -

      Bond's MiG has disappeared from the pilot's view: Not in front. Not
      on the left. Not on the right. Where did he go? The pilot looks up:

      BOND'S MIG APPEARS, FLYING INVERTED, COCKPIT DOWN, 10 FEET ABOVE MIG-2.

      THE PILOT OF MIG-2 IS STUNNED.

      INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG -

      Fighting against the garrote, Bond strains to reach a RED BUTTON on
      the panel: COPILOT EJECTOR SEAT.

      Bond finally taps it, and - THE BACK HALF OF THE CANOPY BLOWS OFF!

      The COPILOT BLASTS OUT OF THE PLANE, DOWNWARD, directly into MIG-2's
      cockpit. Bond peels off.

      For a second, MiG-2 hangs in the air. Until... BOOM!!! The TWO HEAT
      SEEKING MISSILES BLAST IT TO SMITHEREENS.

      Back in MiG-1, Bond fiddles with the radio.

      MI-6 - SITUATION ROOM -

                              BOND'S VOICE
                 Seven to base. I have a full
                 house. Your bid.

      The situation room erupts in cheers.

      RETURN ON BOND IN THE MIG -

                              BOND
                 By the way: Thank the General for all
                 his "assistance." Over and out.

      EXT. BOND'S MIG -

      Goes to AFTERBURNERS. And from the fiery glow of the engine, we
      DISSOLVE TO:

      THE 007 GUN BARREL. MAIN CREDITS.

      After credits, fade in on:

      EXT. OXFORD COLLEGE - DAY

      All ivy and bricks... And a certain Aston-Martin DB-5, parked.

      INT. BOOK LINED OFFICE -

      Afterglow: Empty champagne bottle. Rumpled sheets on a sleeper sofa.
      Bond is in bed with a smart, IRONIC, (and, yes, stunning,) 30-ish
      Chinese woman, JENNY WU. (NOTE: The Chinese here is Mandarin, spelled
      phonetically.)

                              BOND
                       (running a finger across her lips)
                 ... And what do you call these?

                              JENNY WU
                 Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.

                              BOND
                 Indeed they are.
                       (kisses them, lightly)
                 Deadly little things.

      She laughs. His hand goes beneath the sheets.

                              BOND
                 And what do you call these? The Gang
                 of Two?

                              JENNY WU
                       (smacking his hand, laughing:)
                 Stop it!

                              BOND
                 I was just getting to the interesting part!

                              JENNY WU
                 We've already done the interesting
                 part. Do you forget?

                              BOND
                 Remind me.

      He moves to roll on top of her, but she pushes him off, teasing:

                              JENNY WU
                 Sakwa!

                              BOND
                 Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?

                              JENNY WU
                 Mandarin. You jerk.
                       (tousling his hair)
                 I'm late. I have to get dressed.

      She hops off the bed, leaving frame. Bond settles back on the
      headboard, ready to enjoy the view... When his CELL PHONE RINGS.

                              BOND
                       (lightly)
                 Hello -
                       (catching himself)
                 Hello.

      INT. M'S ANTEROOM - MI-6.

      MONEYPENNY, at her desk.

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Hello, James. I hope I'm
                 interrupting something important.

      INT. OFFICE - (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)

      (Jenny has a leg on the bed, pulling on a full Victoria's Secret
      outfit: Nylons, garter/suspenders, bustier, etc.)

                              BOND
                 Not at all, Moneypenny. I was just
                 brushing up on a little Chinese.

      (In the background, Jenny insists "I am not little.")

                              MONEYPENNY
                 I'm sure she is, James. But I'm
                 afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the
                 rest of your lessons this afternoon.

                              BOND
                       (mock chagrin)
                 Moneypenny... Here I was, finally
                 getting a feel for a new tongue -

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Four o'clock. M will meet you in the
                 conference room.

      Bond watches with amusement as Jenny Wu slips a Graduation-type gown
      over the lingerie. No dress.

                              BOND
                 4:30. It may take me a little longer
                 to wrap things up here.

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Four o'clock. Don't be late.

                              BOND
                       (hanging up:)
                 Tsi tien, Chien-penny.

      ON MONEYPENNY:

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Ah, James. You always were a cunning
                 linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.

      Moneypenny hangs up, looks up, and blanches: M is standing there.

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Don't ask.

                              M
                 Don't tell.
                       (walking away)
                 I don't want to know.

      INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE JENNY'S OFFICE - OXFORD -

      Bond and Jenny Wu emerge from the office. (She's still in the gown.)
      They pass a flock of young students:

                              STUDENT
                 Good afternoon, Professor Wu.

                              JENNY WU
                 Good afternoon.
                       (then to Bond)
                 Are you sure you can't stay for the
                 lecture?

                              BOND
                 I can't. But I did enjoy the dress
                 rehearsal.

      She gives him a wry glance, opens a door to a lecture hall.

                              JENNY WU
                 Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.

                              BOND
                 Tsi tien, Professor Wu.

      She exits; Bond walks off, passing underneath a WALL MOUNTED TV SET.

      ON THE TV SET - The HNN Globe Logo - The Harmsway News Network -
      spins into view, followed by:

                              HNN ANCHOR
                 You're watching HNN, the Harmsway 24
                 hour news network. Coming up:

                 the Ukrainian Presidential elections...
                       (mortise shot of:)
                 Live coverage of the latest HNN
                 communications satellite launch from

                 A special report on the situation in
                 Hong Kong, since the Chinese take-
                 over from Great Britain.

      EXT. MI-6 LONDON - DAY

      The DB-5 drives past the guard.

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

      Debriefing: Bond, M, and several others listen as NATO COLONEL
      DOMINIQUE EVERHART, (early 30's, Belgian,) refers to video clips from
      the Khyber Pass sequence:

                              COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART
                 To sum up: After analyzing the tire
                 inflation of the fork-lift in the MI-6
                 video tape, NATO believes the "red
                 box contains approximately eighty
                 kilograms of U235 weapons grade
                 uranium - an incredibly hard,
                 incredibly heavy, incredibly lethal
                 substance.

                              M
                 And that's enough enriched uranium to
                 produce how many nuclear devices?

                              COL. DQMINIQUE EVERHART
                 Depending on the builder's sophistication
                 - one crude bomb that could devastate
                 London, Paris, New York, Berlin - or all
                 four if they have the latest technology.

      There's a pregnant pause in the room.

                              M
                 And the participants?

                              COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART
                       (pointing at the screen)
                 Kim Dae Yung. Moscow-trained North
                 Korean nuclear weapons specialist;
                 apparently fell out of favor with the
                 current North Korean regime after a
                 botched attempt to steal fissionable
                 material from a British light-water
                 reactor in South Africa - an accident
                 that left him entirely hairless...

      Another face appears on the screen:

                              COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART (cont'd)
                 And Rendera Sikrahm, also known as
                 Richard Stamper. Freelance mercenary,
                 Laos and Cambodia. His father was
                 from Nepal - a Ghurka warrior - con-
                 scripted by the British government to
                 fight in China during World War II -
                 after which the family settled in
                 Hong Kong, where the young Stamper
                 was undoubtedly treated like a second
                 class citizen by both the Hong Kong
                 Chinese, and local British.
                       (beat, aside:)
                 We've all read about the signs at the
                 British swimming pools in Hong Kong
                 that said "No Ghurka's allowed."

                              BOND
                 Nothing like a little imperialism to
                 promote loyalty among the faithful.

                              COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART
                       (stifles a smile, then:)
                 In conclusion: Both these men have a
                 vendetta against the world. They are
                 nuclear armed, and dangerous. And
                 having failed to get the UZ35 through
                 the old opium route - the Khyber Pass
                 - it's NATO's belief that their next
                 attempt will be through Bulgaria -
                 where the NATO Nuclear Strike Force
                 will be there to stop them.

                              M
                 Thank you Colonel Everhart.
                       (stands, turns to:)
                 007, I'd like to see you in my office.
                 Why don't you and the Colonel exchange
                 numbers if you need more information?

                              BOND
                 Yes, M.

      M exits. Bond approaches Dominique. She smiles, warmly. There's a
      mutual attraction - but there's something else going on, unspoken.

                              BOND
                 Interesting presentation.

                              DOMINIQUE
                 Interesting video tape.

                              BOND
                 They point, I shoot.

                              DOMINIQUE
                       (feels her pockets)
                 Do you have a pen? I just got promoted
                 and don't have my new cards yet.

                              BOND
                 Of course.

      Bond hands her a PEN. She regards it cautiously.

                              DOMINIQUE
                 ... Does this do anything?

                              BOND
                 Depends what number you write.

      She gives him a wry look; starts to write. He notes her WEDDING BAND.

                              BOND
                 Married?

                              DOMINIQUE
                 Happily.

                              BOND
                 ... Kids?

                              DOMINIQUE
                 Three. You? Married?

                              BOND
                 No.

                              DOMINIQUE
                       (smiles)
                 I didn't think so.

      For an instant, something crosses Bond's face: Bittersweetness? Re-
      morse? Either way, she's scored a subtle victory.

                              DOMINIQUE
                 Here. I gave you my assistant's
                 phone number. If it's urgent, she
                 knows where to reach me.

                              BOND
                 Thanks.
                       (beat, holding her gaze)
                 Take care -

                              DOMINIQUE
                 You too.

      With a Sphinx-like smile, she watches Bond leave.

      INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Where Bond encounters MONEYPENNY, also walking to M's office.

                              BOND
                 Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting
                 like this. They may be on to us.

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?

                              BOND
                 In the darkest moments, it's what I
                 live for. Especially since I've
                 heard how much you like to watch...
                 On the hidden camera.

      Moneypenny cuts Bond a look - and, in the background, sees Dominique
      leave the conference room, and walk down the hall, away from them.

                              MONEYPENNY
                 By the way, James: Ordinarily I would
                 never ask, but... Weren't you and
                 that Colonel once stranded on a raft
                 for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?

                              BOND
                 Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have
                 you ever known me to kiss and tell?

      They've come to a security door. She punches in a code -

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Actually, I've never known you to do
                 either... But -

                              BOND
                 - We all want what we can't have?

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Not all of us, 007.

      The door opens. They go into:

      INT. M'S ANTEROOM (MONEYPENNY'S AREA) - CONTINUOUS

                              BOND
                 What - no lust for adventure?

                              MONEYPENNY
                 No, 007. It's just that I've learned
                 from personal experience - that when
                 we get what we want -
                       (beat)
                 Somehow the reality is never as...
                 Satisfying as the fantasy.

      Bond scowls. Moneypenny smiles wryly, points to the inner door:

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Don't keep M waiting.

      INT. M'S OFFICE - DAY

      M is behind her desk; MINISTER PETER JOHNSTONE sits across - a high-
      handed Teflon-coated politician, with the survival instincts of
      plutonium. They've been arguing.

                              M
                 Come in, 007. You know the Minister?

                              BOND
                 Of course.
                       (nods to)
                 Minister Johnstone.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 007.

      Bond sits in an armchair. M presses a button, and a video/bio of
      ELIOT HARMSWAY appears on the wall behind her. Mid-50's, regal.

                              M
                 Tell me, 007, what do you know about
                 Elliot Harmsway?

                              BOND
                       (quipping)
                 Only what I read in the newspapers.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (disdainfully)
                 His newspapers?

                              BOND
                       (glancing sideways)
                 Occasionally, yes.
                       (directly to M)
                 British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong;
                 controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable,
                 satellites; books, magazines, movies,
                 computer software. Theme parks.

                              M
                       (holding up a copy of:)
                 - Along with Tomorrow - the first
                 world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27
                 million. Daily. -

                              BOND
                 'Able to topple governments with a single
                 story' - as he says in his press.

                              JOHNSTONE
                       (hurrumph)
                 Exactly.

      Bond looks at Johnstone quizzically. Then a very tight-lipped M. He
      senses he's about to enter a minefield:

                              BOND
                 ... What's Harmsway done?

                              M
                 It seems, 007, we've received a tip

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 A rumor - from an anonymous source -

                              M
                 - that Sir Elliot may be involved
                 with Stamper and Yung, and the
                 missing Uranium.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 Hearsay. Idle chatter from a source
                 you can't identify - who insists on
                 talking only to 007. Nothing but
                 loose talk and innuendo.

                              M
                 That may be the case at present,
                 Minister Johnstone... But our own
                 sources suspect that Mr. Harmsway
                 used his considerable Russian media
                 - holdings to elect Valentin Zukofsky
                 President of the Ukraine - in trade
                 for the uranium.

      (M has punched a button, and Valentin's video bio has appeared.)

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.

                              BOND
                 Perhaps. But it does explain how an
                 ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms
                 dealer is suddenly portrayed as a
                 long-time friend of the people.
                       (beat)
                 If you believe what you read in the papers.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (annoyed)
                 Need I remind the two of you that
                 Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway
                 - is directly descended from the Earl
                 of Aberdeen? That his Scottish
                 ancestors practically invented Hong
                 Kong - and out of sheer gratitude,
                 Queen Victoria herself named the port
                 "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?

                              M
                       (long pause, then:)
                 ... No more than I need remind you,
                 Minister, that merely being a member
                 of the lucky sperm club - does not
                 preclude one from a life of criminal
                 activity.

      Johnstone is reeling. M continues, to Bond, with aplomb:

                              M
                 The reason I invited the Minister
                 here, 007, was to reassure him that
                 this investigation will be handled
                 with the utmost discretion.

                              BOND
                 Of course.

                              M
                 Which is also why I've withheld this
                 information from NATO and our allies.

                              BOND
                       (nods, then, recalling)
                 ... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?

                              M
                 Yes. 1988. He was furious at the
                 British plan to return Hong Kong, and
                 supposedly started his own negotiations
                 with the Chinese Government. The inquiry
                 went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a
                 rather powerful enemy -

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 Not to mention the chaos it caused at
                 Whitehall when his newspapers began
                 screaming for the recall of the
                 sitting government.

                              M
                       (a beat, then:)
                 I'm sending you to Venice, 007.
                 You're to check out the source,
                 determine whether Elliot Harmsway is
                 involved with the enriched uranium,
                 and, if so, stop him.

                              BOND
                 How will I meet the informant?

      She hands Bond a CARNIVAL MASK:

                              M
                 You're to wear this mask at the Venice
                 Carnival, and wait to be contacted.

                              BOND
                 I understand.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (standing, to leave)
                 There is one last thing, 007: Elliot
                 Harmsway is vital to the economic
                 interests of this nation. He's also
                 a major contributor to the party. I
                 expect him to be given every consideration.

                              BOND
                 Political considerations?

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 To the best of my recollection, Mr.
                 Bond, I suggested no such thing.
                       (beat, at the door)
                 In fact, I was never here.

      And he exits. M, frowning, hits a button on her intercom:

                              M
                 Would you send in the new man from
                 equipment branch?

                              MONEYPENNY (O.S.)
                 Right away.

                              BOND
                 .... I hate to ask, but... Did you
                 ever think you'd miss Communism?

                              M
                 We serve the interests of the British
                 people, 007. No matter who we may be
                 foolish enough to elect.

      Bond is silent, chastised. M looks away, then looks back:

                              M
                 But if Elliot Harmsway is involved
                 with that uranium, I want him
                 prosecuted to the ends of the earth.

                              BOND
                 Hopefully, it won't get that far.

      M looks up: MALCOLM SAUNDERS, Q's successor, limps in, looking like a
      mummy - plaster casts on his left leg, left arm; neck-brace, crutch.

                              M
                 Come in, Saunders.

                              SAUNDERS
                 M. 007.

                              BOND
                 Okay, Saunders. What is it this
                 time? Rocket in the leg? Machine
                 pistol in the arm?

                              SAUNDERS
                 Q's retirement party. I'd just put
                 the knife into the cake, and -

                              BOND
                 Come on. I know better than that -

      Bond thwacks the crutch against the leg. Saunders GRIMACES IN PAIN.

                              BOND
                 It must do something.

                              SAUNDERS
                 Well... If you insist.

      Saunders flexes his broken arm; ARMORED SPIKES pop out of the it.

                              BOND
                 The die is cast.

      Saunders exchanges a beleaguered glance with M. He takes off the cast
      and neck-brace, and places a BRIEFCASE on M's desk.

                              SAUNDERS
                 Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much
                 time to demonstrate your new Q toys.

                              BOND
                 How is old Q?

                              SAUNDERS
                 Gone fishing.

                              BOND
                 Fishing?

                              SAUNDERS
                 Big game fishing.
                       (beat)
                 Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift
                 from his friends at the CIA.

      Saunders has opened the briefcase. Bond tries to look inside, but
      Saunders repositions it. Saunders continues:

                              SAUNDERS
                 In the meantime, perhaps this will
                 spark your interest.
                       (takes out a disposable lighter)
                 Cigarette lighter. Thumb here, press here -

      A small flame appears. Bond, unimpressed, reaches for it -

                              BOND
                 Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -

                              SAUNDERS
                 Not from forty feet.

      Saunders flips the lighter sideways and - WHOOSH! A burst of flame
      shoots across the room.

                              SAUNDERS
                 The disposable lighter also contains
                 a small self-detonation charge
                       (beat)
                 Depending on who - or what - you
                 wish to dispose of.

      Bond takes the lighter, begins to play with it...

                              SAUNDERS
                 Stop fidgeting, 007. Next -

      He takes out a pair of SHOELACES.

                              BOND
                 ... Shoelaces?

                              SAUNDERS
                 Plastique explosive shoelaces.
                       (holding them out at length)
                 Cut them to regulate the size of the
                 blast; totally harmless until you
                 attach the detonator hidden in the
                 heel of your shoe.

                              BOND
                       (examining them curiously)
                 Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty'
                 problem?

                              SAUNDERS
                       (frowns)
                 Moving along -
                       (he produces:)
                 A typical plastic security card.

                              BOND
                 Does it work on cash machines?

      Saunders is suddenly stricken. Flustered. He blurts out:

                              SAUNDERS
                 It was an authorized test. I returned the money.

                              BOND
                       (amused)
                 I see...

                              SAUNDERS
                       (ignoring this)
                 Finally, your new watch: Blue laser
                 here for signaling or burning
                 through locks; press this button, the
                 sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.

                              BOND
                       (needling him)
                 If you can't do the time, don't do
                 the crime?

                              SAUNDERS
                       (smirks at Bond, pauses, then)
                 Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last
                 thing: Before Q retired, he asked that
                 I give you one other protective device.

      He hands Bond a WEDDING BAND.

                              BOND
                 A wedding band??? What am I supposed
                 to be able to do with this?

                              SAUNDERS
                 I believe Q's exact words were:
                       (imitating Q, emphatically:)
                 "Hopefully, nothing."

      Bond turns from Saunder's devious grin to an amused M. Smiles:

                              BOND
                 ...I'll give you a ring from Venice.

                              M
                 Good luck on your mission, 007.

      He snaps the ring down on her desk.

                              BOND
                 Till death do us part.

                                                                    CUT TO:

      EXT. VENICE HARBOR/GRAND CANAL - NIGHT

      A GLEAMING WHITE YACHT - with two on-board helicopters, and a huge
      tarped hold - dominates the harbor. (Harmsway's SEA DOLPHIN II.)

      Tonight, however, we find a GONDOLA, gliding through the water...

      Arriving at a festively-lit dock, crowded with gaily costumed
      partygoers and musicians in medieval garb.

      Wearing the mask from M's office, (and a bright blue cape,) Bond
      alights the gondola, and plunges into the crowd.

      EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - NIGHT

      A swirl of colors, noise and music. Pushing his way into the chaotic
      celebration, Bond scans the crowd, looking for a face:

      NOTHING BUT A SEA OF MASKS. White. Yellow. Red. Blue.

      Caught up in the tumult, he turns left, he strains to turn right,
      anxiously looking for the contact. Who is it?

      THREE MASKED WOMEN appear in front of Bond. They curtsy, and giggle.

                              WOMAN
                 Buona sera, signore -

      He's spun by a MASKED MAN with a bottle.

                              MAN
                 Vino?

      Bond waves him off - and is jostled in the other direction, by a
      group of celebrants carrying a long banner.

      Suddenly, the CROWD SURGES FORWARD: A PROCESSION, carrying the
      EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL is making its way through the square.

      Locked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd, Bond struggles to look
      forward - left, right - when he FEELS A TUG at his cape from behind.
      He can only crane his neck to see/hear -

                              MASKED WOMAN
                 I may have been followed. Meet me at
                 the Church in five minutes!

      With an effort, Bond turns to look at her - but sees nothing, save
      the wisp of a satin costume, disappearing as the crowd closes ranks
      behind him.

      SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - NIGHT

      Five minutes later. Almost deserted. A few stray couples. The
      MASKED WOMAN appears, walking tentatively between the shadows and
      the moonlight, looking for Bond. Suddenly -

      Whomp! - an arm reaches out, and yanks her into an alcove.

                              BOND
                 Looking for someone?

      Recovering her breath (it was a violent yank,) the woman - PARIS
      removes her mask. She shines a sexy, 1000-watt smile at 007:

                              PARIS
                 Hello, James.

      Bond reacts. He is not happy to see her.

                              BOND
                 Paris?!? What are you doing here?

                              PARIS
                 Is that any way to say hello?

                              BOND
                 I thought your specialty was good-bye.

      Paris smiles coyly. She LIFTS A HAND to tousle his hair -

                              PARIS
                 Oh, James. I've missed you -

                              BOND
                       (grabbing her by the wrist)
                 Is this another one of your games?

                              PARIS
                 Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't
                 you just be nice?

                              BOND
                 I've got half the British government
                 breathing down my neck. I don't have
                 time for your nonsense.

      She's surprised - and hurt - by his coldness.

                              PARIS
                 Don't you even miss me? Didn't I
                 mean anything to you?

                              BOND
                 Nothing.

      She turns away from him, fighting back tears. Bond doesn't care:

                              BOND
                 What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is
                 this just another one of your stunts?

                              PARIS
                       (anguished)
                 No! He's crazy - he's insane. He
                 hates everybody. He's got these
                 plans -
                       (facing Bond, becoming hysterical:)
                 You've got to help me, James. I'm
                 sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I
                 know I was wrong - but you've got to
                 protect me. I know you still love -

      BOND SLAPS HER. She's stunned. He waits. She's angered:

                              PARIS
                 Do you feel better now?

                              BOND
                       (not giving an inch)
                 Do you?

      She turns away. Bond feels remorse for hitting her. Softens:

                              BOND
                 What about the uranium?

                              PARIS
                 It's on the boat. He's holding a
                 press conference tomorrow.

      Bond reaches out to touch her. She falls into his arms, burying her
      face in his shoulder.

                              PARIS
                 I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll
                 never leave you again.

                              BOND
                       (patting her head)
                 Shhhhh...

                              PARIS
                 Just hold me.

      Bond thinks for a moment, then gently pushes her away, a foot
      backwards, to look in her eyes:

                              BOND
                 How do you know Harmsway?

      Paris' eyes flicker at something over Bond's shoulder. She swoons:

                              PARIS
                 Kiss me.

      She pulls Bond to her, kissing him - then HAULS OFF, BELTING him
      across the mouth.

                              PARIS
                 Bastard! Leave me alone!

      She shoves him off, darts away. Bond is bleeding from his mouth -
      and not altogether surprised at her behavior. He turns to see -

      ANOTHER ANGLE - SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - (BOND'S POV) -

      Paris running to FOUR MEN dressed alike in three-corner hats,
      enveloped from head-to-foot in BLACK CAPES. Their faces are
      completely concealed behind flat, bone-white masks covering all but
      their chins. They look like messengers of death.

      CLOSER ON PARIS AND THE MEN -

      The leader is STAMPER; the others are locals, THUG #1, #2, #3. (THUG
      #1 is built like a bank vault.) Stamper looks steadily at Bond

                              STAMPER
                 Who is he?

                              PARIS
                 Nobody. Just some drunk. Leave him
                 alone -

                              STAMPER
                       (to Thug #3)
                 Take her to the boat.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      He sees STAMPER and the TWO HENCHMEN approaching. He turns and walks
      quickly toward -

      EXT. RIALTO BRIDGE - FIRST (UP) STAIRCASE - NIGHT

      Pushing past carnival-goers, Bond rushes up the central staircase of
      the bridge. At the top, looking onto the main span, he sees -

      THE EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL PROCESSION, approaching like a tidal wave.

      BOND throws a look over his shoulder, and SEES THE THREE MEN, rushing
      up the stairs, knocking people out of the way like bowling pins -
      completely unaware of the oncoming parade at the top.

      BOND turns to face the men... And suddenly THROWS HIS CAPE UP,
      dramatically, like Batman - blocking their view of the procession.

      STAMPER AND THE TWO THUGS hesitate for a moment -

      And BOND PULLS THE CAPE TO HIS BODY, just as the PROCESSION SURGES
      PAST HIM, and spills down the stairs, overwhelming Stamper & Co.

                              BOND
                       (to himself, flexing the cape)
                 So that's how he does it.

      Bond disappears into the oncoming crowd.

      Stamper and Thug #2 are pushed to the bottom of the staircase - but
      Thug #1 bulls his way up, shouldering through the crowd.

      RIALTO BRIDGE - SECOND (DOWN) STAIRCASE - NIGHT

      As Bond nears the bottom of the staircase, he looks back up:

      THUG #1 is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine, tossing
      carnival-goers aside like rag-dolls. Spotting Bond, he charges -

      But gets caught between TWO MEN CARRYING A SATIN BANNER. He goes
      right through it - ripping the material apart with his bare hands,
      pulling the men down, after him.

      BASE OF THE RIALTO BRIDGE - CANAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT

      Bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade. He sees:

      A GROUP OF TOURISTS, posing for a photo by the bridge -

      and just beyond this -

      A STREET SELLER hawking souvenirs from a PUSH CART.

      BOND approaches the TOURIST with the camera, offering to take the
      picture for him.

                              BOND
                 Prego, prego. Permissio.

                              TOURIST
                 Grazie.

      Bond takes the camera. The tourists pose. And with perfect timing,
      Bond turns, and - POP! - sets off the FLASHBULB in THUG #l's face
      just as he comes around the corner.

      Bond flips the camera back to the tourist -

                              BOND
                 Grazie -

      And heads for the PUSHCART. Wheeling it around, he SHOVES IT at the
      thug, who is still stumbling, blinded by the flashbulb.

      The CART SLAMS INTO THE MAN, knocking him on his back. The cart
      stops on top of him, pinning him down.

      BOND takes off, threading through the crowd toward a SIDESTREET.

      Meanwhile, THE STREET SELLER rushes to his wrecked cart. It ERUPTS
      in the air as Thug #1 jumps to his feet. He's getting really pissed
      off. He looks around for Bond - just catching a glimpse of him, as -

      007 disappears down the sidestreet.

      Thug #1 makes a bee-line for Bond - but finds his path blocked by TWO
      MOTORCYCLISTS, chatting away. Barely stopping, Thug #1 lifts one of
      the motorcycles - with the driver still in the seat - and THROWS IT
      INTO THE CANAL.

      RETURN ON THE BASE OF THE BRIDGE -

      Stamper and Thug #2 arrive at the wrecked cart - in time to see Thug
      #1 disappear onto the side Street.

      Stamper motions for Thug #2 to come with him on a parallel course
      along the canals toward -

      THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE - NIGHT

      Bond enters the deserted plaza from the side-street. Sticking close
      to the buildings, he ducks into an alleyway.

      ALLEYWAY - OFF THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE -

      Shrinking back into the shadows, Bond peers out into the Plaza.

      BOND'S POV - THE PLAZA

      Stamper and Thug 2 charge in. Bond watches as they split up and
      start looking for him.

      RETURN ON BOND - IN THE SHADOWS -

      Suddenly, a huge hand grabs 007's shoulder, spinning him around:

      THUG #1 has Bond in his grasp, with murder his eyes. In one fast
      move, Bond side-steps, ducks, and twists out of the cloak, throwing
      it over the Thug's head. And as the Thug struggles to get out from
      under it, Bond slams him head-first into a wall, knocking him out.
      (He's left sitting upright, slumped against the wall.)

      NEW ANGLE -

      Bond heads off down the alleyway, away from the Plaza, toward the
      courtyard of Il Bovolo.

      RETURN ON ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE -

      Thug #2 enters, spots the figure in Bond's cloak. Very quietly, he
      pulls out his gun, kneels... And as he brings the gun up to the
      cloaked figure's head, chambering a round -

      The cloak erupts, with Thug #1 viciously biting Thug #2's gun-hand,
      hurling him against the opposite wall.

      With a frustrated fury, Thug #1 rips off the cloak, and stands.

                              THUG #2
                 Marco - I didn't know -

                              THUG #1
                 After him!

      They charge off.

      IL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT

      Bond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls. No
      way out... Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the FOURTH
      FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY, overlooking the courtyard.

      THE SPIRAL STAIRS -

      Bond takes the marble steps, two at a time.

      RETURN ON THE COURTYARD -

      The two Thugs enter the square. Motioning for quiet, they HEAR
      BOND'S FOOTFALLS on the steps, and race up after him.

      THE BALCONY -

      Coming off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the
      building: Locked. Too heavy to burst in. He glances down at the
      courtyard, and HEARS THE THUGS' FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs.

      Bond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape.

      Pocketing his mask, Bond hops on the BANISTER, REACHES for the
      GUTTER. He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and
      disappears from sight...

      Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase.

      FIRST ROOFTOP -

      Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof. There are
      SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop
      to an adjoining building. Bond jumps.

      SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -

      007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold
      on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. He looks down:
      The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof.

      As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof -

      RETURN ON THE BALCONY -

      Thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. He's too heavy
      to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below.

      FIRST ROOFTOP -

      Thug #1 searches for Bond. He HEARS BOND moving, below him, on the
      next building. He makes a running leap.

      SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -

      Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands. They
      grapple. The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the
      roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond.

      AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF, Bond is about to slide off, onto the
      skylight below, but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment.

      007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... As Thug #1
      tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by GRABBING ONTO
      BOND'S LEGS.

      They sway in the air for a second. The GUTTER bends, breaks, and the
      two of them fall -

      CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT, INTO: -

      VENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT.

      They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the
      Great Hall. Bond is winded. Thug #1, unfazed. He grabs Bond by the
      collar, hauling him up on his feet.

      Thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up
      on his toes. Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond:

                              THUG #1
                 I owe you some pain.

      With lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his
      gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back. Bond's chin just
      clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING.

      The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA,
      and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away.

      As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally
      (yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR.

      With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room.
      He's having fun.

      AS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER -

      THUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond.

      BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out
      of the way, like a gnat.

      Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from
      the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug.

      Unimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE,
      and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed "King Arthur" type sword.

      With one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO.
      The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to:

      A DISPLAY WALL -

      filled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD.
      (Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) Thug #1 stops in his tracks.
      Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax.

      THE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug
      #1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax.

      NEW ANGLE -

      Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond
      backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN.
      (Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.)

      Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the
      last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from
      killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden.

      As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. (A
      studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club)

      Bond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN
      TWO... But loses the weapon in the process.

      Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the
      wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM
      THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright.  -

      In a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1
      backwards, down onto the floor.

      AND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX -

      THUG #1 LUNGES FOR BOND'S GUN ON THE FLOOR.

      BOND CAN'T GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL. HE TURNS TO SEE:

      THUG #1 ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM.

      And at the very last second, BOND DISLODGES THE HAND-AX, SLASHES THE
      IRON MAIDEN'S LEATHER RETAINING STRAPS and -

      NEW ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE IRON MAIDEN'S POV -

      The iron maiden falls forward, impaling Thug #1 on the wooden floor.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      The Iron Maiden covers all of Thug #1, except for his arm, still
      clutching Bond's gun. Bond bends down and retrieves it.

                              BOND
                 He fought hard...
                       (holstering the gun)
                 But the case was terminal.

      And on this note, we -

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. VENICE HARBOR - THE NEXT DAY -

      Under a beautiful blue sky, the gleaming white SEA DOLPHIN II sits at
      dock, festooned with pennants and banners. There's a crowd onboard.
      At the same time, however, 500 feet away...

      INT. DOCKSIDE CAFE -

      Bond meets with Signore DiGIACOMO, a middle-aged Italian Intelligence
      official in shirtsleeves. Two underlings hover in the background.

                              BOND
                 You've confirmed all the legal
                 details with M?

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Si. Bueno. She's very...
                 'Competent.' ...For a woman.

                              BOND
                 Let's go over this one more time.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 You will investigate the boat.
                 You'll signal us if you find the
                 enriched uranium. And then -
                       (distracted)
                 Pardon.

      He looks at a WOMAN who has appeared with a baby in her arms.

                              ITALIAN WOMAN W/BABY
                 Don Franco. I just want to say we're
                 voting for you in the election.

                              DiGIACOMO
                       (teasing, re: the baby)
                 Both of you?

                              ITALIAN WOMAN W/BABY
                       (laughs)
                 Of course.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Grazie, grazie. Ciao.

      She leaves. He turns back Bond:

                              DiGIACOMO
                 So. You'll signal us if you find the
                 uranium -

                              BOND
                 And you'll wait until after the press
                 conference - and everyone is gone -
                 before you board the boat and arrest
                 him.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Perfecto. Then we turn him over to you,
                 and the English government puts him on a
                 military transport back to London.

      Bond nods, looks over at the Sea Dolphin II.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Do not worry, my friend. I only want
                 what is best. For both of us.

      Bond stands to leave. DiGiacomo smiles after 007 - as if he's
      savoring some private secret. He snaps his fingers to an underling:

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Rocco! Un Cappuccino!

      THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

      As Bond makes his way up the gangplank -

      ELLIOT HARMSWAY is holding a press conference near the bow, surround-
      ed by dignitaries. He is a man with an EVIL EUPHORIA - showing off
      all the charm and charisma that's made him one of the world's most
      powerful media tycoons.

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...And so, it's somewhat fitting that
                 we are here today... To christen this
                 environmental research boat in Venice -
                 - 'Venezia' - the port where Marco
                 Polo sailed forth to explore the
                 world's great uncharted oceans...
                       (beat)
                 That 2/3 of the earth's surface where
                 the sharks are not working members of
                 the press.

      Laughter. Bond studies the man. Harmsway continues, pointing to a
      LARGE DRILL/BORING OBJECT, the size of a jet engine, attached to a
      long flexible hose/tube.

                              HARMSWAY
                 With our six custom designed sea-bed
                 coring drills, we will probe the
                 long-term effects of pollution; our
                 sonars, radars, and research labs
                 will study the wind, the water, and
                 the sea life that so dearly feeds us.

      Bond moves through the crowd. He spots a bulkhead, with a door.

                              HARMSWAY
                 And so, in the spirit of international
                 cooperation - thanking my good friend,
                 Valentin Zukofsky - the newly elected
                 President of the Ukraine for all his
                 assistance -

      He motions to Zukofsky, who nods to the audience...

                              HARMSWAY
                 I give this boat to mankind - selflessly
                 - in pure charity asking nothing for
                 myself... But the cable TV rights.

      Big laugh from the assemblage. Harmsway turns to a BEAUTY QUEEN:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Miss Venice? If you'll do the honors -

      SMASH! She cracks a champagne bottle on the tip of the bow. CHEERS!

                              HARMSWAY
                 Now I'll take some questions from the
                 press - even the few of you who
                 aren't on my payroll.

      Laughter. Harmsway points to a reporter:

                              REPORTER #1
                 Mr. Harmsway: Why did you name this
                 boat the Sea Dolphin II?

                              HARMSWAY
                 Actually, my first choice was 'No
                 Comment.' So if someone asked where
                 I was, I could truthfully respond 'No
                 Comment.'
                       (laughter; he points)
                 Over there.

                              REPORTER #2
                 Sir Elliot: Is it true you're in
                 negotiations to move your offices
                 from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur?

                              HARMSWAY
                       (impishly)
                 No comment.

      Amidst more laughter, Bond disappears into the bulkhead door.

      INT. SEA DOLPHIN II - BELOW DECKS -

      Bond moves cautiously down a STAIRCASE...

      And peers along a CORRIDOR. He sees a GUARD, checking doors, making
      sure they're locked. Bond withdraws for a moment, looks back: The
      guard is at the far end of the hall. He lifts a WALKIE-TALKIE:

                              GUARD
                 Level one, secure.

      The guard exits, down another staircase. Bond moves stealthily down
      the corridor, glancing at signs on various doors: FISH HATCHERY,
      WEATHER STATION, CREW'S MESS, etc... Until he comes to:

      METALLURGY LAB. There's a CARD READER by the door. Bond slips out
      his Q-toy, swipes it. Click. He goes inside.

      INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II - CONTINUOUS

      Bond clocks the lab: Power tools, test benches, a SECOND ENTRY
      DOOR... And in the middle of the room -

      THE RED BOX.

      Quickly, (as the echoes of Harmsway's press conference can be heard
      through the portholes,) Bond examines the edges of the box, looking
      for tamper-proof seals. Finds none. Gingerly, he opens it:

      URANIUM SLUGS. They look like black tennis ball canisters.

      BOND presses a button on his watch: THE GEIGER COUNTER CLICKS WILDLY
      Bond pauses. Wants to make sure. He spots ANOTHER GEIGER COUNTER on
      a bench; he moves its probe over the uranium slugs: Same result.

      Bond closes the box. He decides to check out the rest of the room -
      examining gadgets, tools, chemicals. HE OPENS A SHALLOW DRAWER -

      And finds a set of BLACK ROTARY CUTTING SAWS, WITH ELONGATED TEETH.
      (They look almost like a series of sharks' jaws - one oval set inside
      another )

      Bond lifts one - surprised at its extreme weight. He wonders what it
      is used for. Just then -

      THERE'S A CLICK AT THE SECOND DOOR. Bond quickly replaces the
      cutting saw, moves to the first door -

      And as the SECOND DOOR OPENS, Bond slips out the first, into the
      CORRIDOR, down the hall, heading for the stairs.

      BACK IN THE METALLURGY LAB -

      YUNG enters, his hairless head shining under the lights. He looks
      around, sensing something is wrong. Glances: Not the red box. Not
      the Geiger counter. But then he notices it:

      THE DRAWER is sticking out, maybe a sixteenth of an inch.

      Yung picks up a telephone.

      SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -

      Bond emerges from the bulkhead door. The press conference wrapping
      up. As Bond makes his way to the RAIL, looking out on the cafe -

                              HARMSWAY
                 The maiden voyage begins tonight. I
                 have some business in London - but
                 the ship will sail down the Nile,
                 across the South China Sea, stopping
                 in Australia, winding up in San
                 Francisco.

      Bond stands at the rail, AIMS HIS WATCH at the cafe -

                              HARMSWAY (cont'd)
                 But having said that - let's get to
                 the real business - the only thing
                 that attracts newsmen faster than a
                 breaking story the free food and
                 beverage.

      INT. CAFE -

      DiGiacomo sees the BLUE LASER. Motions his men to action.

      RETURN ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -

      Bond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars, trying to remain
      ac inconspicuous as possible. A hand clasps his shoulder:

                              VALENTIN'S VOICE
                 Mr. James Bond!

      Bond spins to see Valentin, surrounded by the usual assortment of
      cheaply dressed goons.

                              BOND
                 Valentin. What an unpleasant surprise.

                              VALENTIN
                 What is it that brings you to
                 Venezia, Mr. Bond? Business -
                       (sly glance to the thugs)
                 Or somebody else's business?

      The goons chortle. Bond isn't happy with this attention. He clocks
      a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA ON ONE OF THE MASTS, scanning the deck.

      A WOMAN'S SHRILL WHINING VOICE - brings Bond back to Valentin. She
      is very colorfully dressed - dripping in high-ticket logos.

                              SOFIA
                 Dimitri!!! You promised I could go
                 shopping!!

                              VALENTIN
                       (sotto, to Bond)
                 New mistress.
                       (to her, impatiently)
                 So? Go!

                              SOFIA
                 I need money.

      Valentin gives a beleaguered shrug, and pulls out a HUGE WAD OF CASH.

                              VALENTIN
                 Here. Take an inch.

      Shaking his head, Valentin turns back to Bond:

                              VALENTIN
                 Come. Let me buy you a drink. It's
                 free.

      With Bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera, they move
      several steps to the bar.

                              VALENTIN
                       (to the bartender)
                 Two vodka martini's. Shaken. Not stirred.
                       (to Bond)
                 And you?

      Bond would rather not drink - but knows that any change from his
      regular behavior might arouse suspicion.

                              BOND
                 One.

      As the bartender pours:

                              BOND
                 I must say, Valentin, capitalism
                 seems to be treating you well.

                              VALENTIN
                       (belting one back)
                 I used to sell weapons; now I buy votes.
                       (then)
                 Off the record.

                              BOND
                 Of course. If you can't beat the
                 government, you might as well own it.

      Valentin spots someone off-camera.

                              VALENTIN
                 Wait - I want you to meet a friend of
                 mine.
                       (calling out)
                 Elliot! Elliot! Come here.

      Harmsway appears. Ebullient as ever.

                              VALENTIN
                 Elliot Harmsway, I want to introduce
                 you to an old friend -

                              BOND
                       (putting out a hand to shake)
                 The name is Bond. James Bond.

      Harmsway greets Bond with a warm smile. Yet his words are ambiguous:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Always nice to meet one of her
                 Majesty's fellow subjects...
                       (a nod to Valentin)
                 Especially one with such
                 distinguished friends.

                              BOND
                 You might say I've always been one of
                 Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.

                              VALENTIN
                       (chortling)
                 'Biggest followers?' He's
                 practically made a career' of it!!

      He laughs. Bond decides to pull Harmsway's chain.

                              BOND
                 It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot.
                 Practically glows in the dark.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (smiles)
                 I can tell you're a man with an eye
                 for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.
                       (signaling off camera)
                 Darling! Come here.
                       (beat)
                 I want you to meet my wife.

      A woman appears in frame, her face obscured by a large sun hat. As
      she reveals her face to the camera - and Bond -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Paris Harmsway, allow me to introduce
                 you to James Bond.

      There is a terrified look on her face. Harmsway continues, beaming
      his most insinuating smile:

                              HARMSWAY
                 But then... I believe you two have
                 already met.

      There is a beat - an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks. Then -

      POLICE WHISTLES BLOW! SIRENS! SOUND OF TIRES SCREECHING TO A HALT!

      The entire party turns to see DiGIACOMO barging his way up the
      gangplank - wearing a ludicrous military uniform, trailed by UZI-
      TOTING CARBINIERI, along with his own VIDEO AND STILL CREWS.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Elliot Harmsway: Under the auspices
                 of the Italian government, I, Franco
                 DiGiacomo -
                       (pauses; smiles at a camera;
                        POP! A flash goes off)
                 Am arresting you for the illegal
                 possession of weapons grade enriched
                 uranium.
                       (to his underlings)
                 Seize the boat!

      A set of frozen glances goes from Bond, to Paris, to Harmsway.

                              VALENTIN
                 I think I suddenly remembered an
                 urgent meeting in Moscow.

      To everyone's surprise, Harmsway guffaws.

                              HARMSWAY
                 My friends, there's been a terrible mistake.
                       (putting his arm around DiGiacomo)
                 Come. Let me show you.

      And he leads the procession off, through the bulkhead door. Bond is
      left with Paris. She is white with fear. Bond moves to console her:

                              BOND
                 Paris -

                              PARIS
                 Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!

                              BOND
                 Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't
                 it in our files?

                              PARIS
                       (anguished)
                 He didn't want anyone to know. He
                 kept it out of the papers. He said a
                 third wife was bad for his image.
                       (beat)
                 You've got to protect me!

      Bond wants to help her - and follow Harmsway. He pulls out a key:

                              BOND
                 Go to my hotel room. I'll be there
                 in twenty minutes.

      Paris looks up at him like a hurt child. She wants some contact; she
      wants to hear him say 'I love you.'

                              PARIS
                 Just - say it. Say it just once.

                              BOND
                       (pauses, discomfited)
                 One thing at a time. I'll see you
                 in twenty minutes. Go.

      She exits; he goes to the bulkhead door... And we pan up to see the
      SURVEILLANCE CAMERA, following him.

      INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Harmsway holds court near the red box. Bond squeezes in.

                              HARMSWAY
                 I believe this is what you're looking
                 for, Colonel.

      He opens the red box. Hoists out a canister.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Is it uranium? Absolutely. But watch -
                       (runs the Geiger counter over it)
                 It's depleted uranium! Completely
                 safe! A child could sleep on it.

      Bond can't believe what he's seeing. DiGiacomo is mortified.

                              HARMSWAY
                 I received it from the Russian
                 government - a by-product of their
                 nuclear arms program - in the hopes
                 that I could create tools for
                 oceanographic research.
                       (beat)
                 It's what I was talking about:
                 'Swords into plowshares'! The Sprit
                 of International Cooperation!

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Signore Harmsway. A thousand apologies.
                       (snaps his fingers to a lackey:)
                 Give him the video tape.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Please. No harm done, Don Franco. Go
                 upstairs, and enjoy the reception.

      As the room empties, he calls -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Oh - Mr. Bond. One minute.

      Bond approaches him. They're the only people in the room.

                              HARMSWAY
                 I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.

                              BOND
                 Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?

                              HARMSWAY
                       (icily)
                 A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't
                 screw with a man who buys ink by the
                 ton.
                       (beat)
                 It's deadlier than uranium.

                              BOND
                       (staring him down)
                 We'll see about that.

      Harmsway glances at his watch. Smiles coldly.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Aren't you late for a meeting?

      EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II/HARBOR - DAY

      Bond rushes down the gangplank, along the dock. Jumps in a gondola.

                              BOND
                 The Danielli. Presto!

      RETURN ON THE METALLURGY LAB -

      Harmsway closes the door. Yung is there.

                              YUNG
                 That was too close.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the
                 message. So will his boss.

      Harmsway presses a button - and suddenly the red box lifts, and a
      second red box appears underneath it, like shuffling a deck of cards.

                              HARMSWAY
                 I'm going to the plane. Tell the
                 captain to set sail at once.

      EXT. THE DANIELLI HOTEL - DAY

      Bond jumps out of the gondola, sprints into the lobby.

      FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR -

      Bond appears, rushing up a staircase. He comes to his doorway. It's
      closed, but unlocked.

      INT. BOND'S HOTEL ROOM -

      Bond enters the room. Looks around, calling out -

                              BOND
                 Paris? Paris?

      He sees the French doors open onto the canal. The curtains billowing
      outward. Bond rushes to the window and looks down:

      EXT. GRAND CANAL - BOND'S POV

      Paris Harmsway is dead, floating in the water.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      Crushed. Devastated. And to make matters worse:

                              DiGIACOMO'S VOICE
                 Signore Bond?

      Bond turns. A flashbulb goes off, capturing Bond and DiGiacomo.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 You're under arrest.

                                                                   CUT TO:

      THE SOUTH CHINA SEA - DUSK

      The HMS INDOMITABLE - a 3,300 ton British frigate, surges through the
      water, heading toward the setting sun.

      CLOSER -

      BATTLE-DRESSED ROYAL MARINES patrol the deck; GUNNERY CREWS man the
      weapons. Whatever is going on here, it's not business as usual.'

      INT. BRIDGE - DUSK

      Close on A VERTICAL GLASS MAP. An electronic panel display with a
      BLINKING YELLOW DOT indicates -

                              NAVIGATOR
                 We've cleared Hong Kong harbor, sir.

      THE CAPTAIN nods. Turns to the GPS OFFICER:

                              CAPTAIN
                 Position?

      The GPS officer enters keyboard commands on console marked "GLOBAL
      POSITIONING SATELLITE." He reads out the data:

                              GPS OFFICER
                 Two-two, zed-three, one-five north; a
                 hundred fourteen degrees, five
                 minutes, ten seconds east.

                              CAPTAIN
                 Mark.

                              GPS OFFICER
                 Locked on satellite, sir.

                              CAPTAIN
                 Set course, two-ten degrees, south
                 south east.

                              NAVIGATOR
                 Coming about, sir.

      The Captain is all business - clipped, sober terse. Turns to his
      FIRST OFFICER, hands him a SLIP OF PAPER:

                              CAPTAIN
                 Orders from London: For the next
                 ninety-six hours, we're to run on
                 full radio silence. Double watches,
                 full alert.
                       (beat)
                 We're to send one encrypted positioning
                 burst to London every six hours -
                 otherwise, zero electronic emissions.

      The first officer nods.

                              CAPTAIN (cont'd)
                 Inform the men, then run a surprise
                 inspection. If someone paints us, I
                 don't want this ship showing up on their
                 radar screen like some god-damned
                 Harrod's Christmas tree.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Yes, sir!

                              CAPTAIN
                 I'll be in my cabin until oh-six-
                 hundred hours.

      The Captain heads for the door.

                              SECOND OFFICER
                 Captain leaving the bridge.

      The officers salute as he exits. With a shrug, the FIRST OFFICER
      picks up the INTERCOM MICROPHONE:

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Attention all hands. Now hear this...

      INT. CREW'S MESS -

      Crowded with CREW MEMBERS eating, waiting on line for food.

                              FIRST OFFICER (INTERCOM)
                 We will rig immediately for
                 electronic silence. All electronic
                 gear is to be shut down...

      CLOSE ON COOK - KITCHEN -

      At microwave. His finger hovers over button, then stops. He opens
      the door of the microwave and takes out a bowl. Dumps the contents
      on the stove.

      INT. SHIP'S HEAD -

      CREW MEMBER with an ELECTRIC SHAVER.

                              FIRST OFFICER (INTERCOM)
                 All personal radios, video devices
                 and computers will be stowed at once.

      He stops shaving.

      INT. ENGINE ROOM -

      The ENGINEER shouts to his crew, over NOISE OF DIESEL ENGINES:

                              ENGINEER
                 Check the engine baffles; rig the
                 generators for shielded operation.

      RETURN ON THE BRIDGE -

      The First Officer stands next to the Communications Officer.

                              COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
                 Communications set to receive only, sir.

      The First Officer looks over the shoulder of RATING at radar screen.

                              RATING
                 Radar switched to passive mode; sonar
                 re-set to low-power operation.
                       (beat)
                 You couldn't find our signature with
                 a magnifying glass.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Let's hope so.

      The First Officer joins the Second Officer at the windows, scanning
      the horizon with binoculars.

                              SECOND OFFICER
                 Looks like we're in for a long,
                 uncomfortable trip.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 We'll all breathe a lot easier when
                 we get this cargo back to London.

                                                                   CUT TO:

      EXT. MANOR HOUSE - THE COAST OF SCOTLAND - DAY

      THE BAGPIPE AND DRUM CORPS of the Royal Highland Regiment (aka the
      "Black Watch") is playing a FUNERAL DIRGE outside a vast stone house,
      with a HARMSWAY NEWS HELICOPTER on the lawn, and LIMOUSINES, A HEARSE
      and a FLOWER CAR in the driveway.

      SIX MEN IN FORMAL MOURNING ATTIRE are entering the house.

      INT. GRAND ROOM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE -

      A SINGLE WHITE ROSE is added to a pile of white roses in PARIS
      HARMSWAY'S OPEN CASKET.

      REVEAL: We're in mid-procession: The last two (of the six men from
      outside) place roses in the casket...

      Then turn, nodding sorrowfully to ELLIOT HARMSWAY (sitting in the
      front row of a room that's keen turned into a makeshift chapel)...

      And follow hand signals of STAMPER, who motions them THROUGH A DOOR,
      to an unseen room.

      After the last man has paid his respects, HARMSWAY stands, walks to
      the bier, and - wiping away a tear - places a single RED ROSE in his
      dead wife's casket.

      INT. HARMSWAY'S INNER SANCTUM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE - DAY

      We're in a room that looks as if it could only exist in, well, a
      James Bond movie: Slick, stark, sterile. Steel, glass, chrome.

      The SIX men are seated around a giant conference table, looking
      absurdly out of place in their formal mourning attire.

      Elliot Harmsway enters, (passing what appears to be the Liechtenstein
      that hangs in the lobby of CAA,) walks to the head of the table,
      takes off his gray mourning gloves, slaps them down, and:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Good morning, Gentlemen. I'm sorry
                 to bring you here under these
                 circumstances, but
                       (beat)
                 Considering our meeting was already
                 scheduled, this was a happy coincidence.

      The men nod. Harmsway sits, dims the lights from a control panel.

                              HARMSWAY (cont'd)
                 Number One, your report?

      A gap-toothed Californian with bland features stands.

                              NUMBER ONE
                 Sir Elliot: The entertainment division
                 is releasing three new animated
                 children's movies this year.
                       (pause)
                 By the time we're finished promoting
                 them on our TV, radio, cable, newspaper,
                 and magazine outlets -
                       (pause)
                 There won't be a parent in the universe
                 who won't feel guilty if they don't take
                 their children to our stores and theme
                 parks to buy the toys, books, video-
                 games and clothing featuring our
                 'lovable little creatures.'
                       (pause)
                 We anticipate revenues of 3.1 billion
                 dollars.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Excellent, Number One. Build a better
                 rat-trap, and the world truly will beat
                 a path to your theme park.
                       (turns to)
                 Number Two?

      A young guy with glasses gets up, looking remarkably like Bill Gates.

                              NUMBER TWO
                 As you're aware, Sir Elliot, our
                 software division has introduced a new
                 computer operating system, Gates '99.
                       (beat)
                 It's deliberately filled with bugs -
                 so people will be forced to buy our
                 upgrades over the next five years.
                       (beat)
                 The window on revenues is 2.8 billion.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Outstanding, Number Two.
                       (beat, remembering:)
                 By the way - Number Five - ?
                       (a man looks up)
                 Who's ahead in the American elections?

                              NUMBER FIVE
                 The Democrat, sir. By nine points.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Maybe it's time to publish that story
                 about his sex life. Even things up.
                 A close race is always better for our
                 TV ratings.

                              NUMBER FIVE
                 Consider him slimed, sir.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Splendid. Next...
                       (with noticeable reserve)
                 Number Three. Your report?

      A SHORT MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN stands. Nervous.

                              NUMBER THREE
                 I regret to inform you, sir, that
                 Saddam Hussein is still demanding a
                 bonus for his role in the Gulf War.

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...Haven't we already paid him for his services?

                              NUMBER THREE
                 Yes, sir. But he still feels his
                 people should share in the increased
                 profits of our news division. He has
                 proposed an additional 500 million
                 dollar payment.

      A pause. The other men in the room shift uncomfortably.

                              HARMSWAY
                 ... And there's no truth that 10% of
                 that money will go into your Swiss
                 bank account?

                              NUMBER THREE
                 No sir! I swear! This is not true!!

                              HARMSWAY
                 You disappoint me, Number Three.

      Harmsway presses a button. Stamper enters. Number Three assumes
      this means death. He BEGS FOR HIS LIFE:

                              NUMBER THREE
                 Please sir. Please -

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...But because I am a just man, I've
                 decided to give Mr. Hussein what he
                 deserves.

      Number Three is confused. Does this mean he's going to live?

                              HARMSWAY
                 Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.

                              NUMBER THREE
                       (overwhelmed with gratitude)
                 Thank you sir! Thank you!

      Harmsway nods, watching him leave:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Good-bye, Mr. Azziz.

      And the man is gone. Harmsway turns his attention back to the room:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Let's proceed with new business.

      Harmsway presses another button. The room darkens. The CENTER OF
      THE TABLE OPENS, and a 3-D MAP OF MALAYSIA rises into view.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Gentlemen: In exactly 36 hours, we
                 are going to initiate phase one of
                 the word's most perfect crime: The
                 biggest theft in the history of mankind.
                       (beat, pointing with a laser)
                 Right here. In the Strait of Malacca.

      EXT. LIMOUSINE - MANOR HOUSE - DAY

      Stamper holds the back door open for Number Three. He gets in.

      INT. LIMOUSINE -

      He seems relieved, until the doors lock, ominously. They drive off.

      EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLAND ROADWAY - (INT./EXT. LIMOUSINE - MOVING) DAY

      Number Three fidgets in the back... And notices Stamper smiling at
      him in the REARVIEW MIRROR. He sees Stamper reach INTO HIS JACKET -
      and PANICS! Is he going to get shot? Is it over? He winces, as -

      STAMPER'S HAND SUDDENLY THRUSTS BACKWARD THROUGH THE PARTITION.

                              STAMPER
                 Gum?

      Shaking his head, he pulls out a HANDKERCHIEF to mop the flop sweat.

      RETURN ON THE MANOR HOUSE - FAVORING THE HNN HELICOPTER -

      Amidst ad-libbed 'good-bye's" from the gang of six (now five,)
      Harmsway gets in the waiting HNN chopper. It powers up, takes off.

      EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - SCOTLAND -

      Stamper's limousine parks near a Gulfstream jet. He opens the back
      door for Number Three. At last, the man believes he is safe.

                              NUMBER THREE
                 Thank you! Thank you so much. You
                 must thank Sir Elliot for me.

                              STAMPER
                       (producing a NEWSPAPER)
                 Here. Something to read on the plane.

      Stamper TUCKS THE PAPER FIRMLY UNDER #3'S ARM - and gives him a
      friendly pat on the back, sending him up the stairs.

      At the doorway, Number Three looks back. Stamper smiles, waving:

                              STAMPER
                 Bye-bye.

      INT. GULFSTREAM JET - DAY

      Number Three settles into his seat. The door closes; the engines
      wind up for take-off. He sighs: He's safe. He casually picks up the
      newspaper, snaps open the front page:

      INSERT FRONT PAGE OF HARMSWAY'S "TOMORROW' NEWSPAPER:

      Screaming headline: ISRAELI AGENT REVEALED. There's a FULL COLOR
      PHOTO OF NUMBER THREE underneath.

      Number Three lowers the paper, white as a ghost, and -

      TWO ARABIAN GENTLEMEN (in full burnoose) sit down on either side of
      him. They smile. And on NUMBER THREE'S BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM, we

                                                                   CUT TO:

      THE H.M.S. INDOMITABLE -

      Moving through FOG in the STRAIT OF MALACCA, night.

      INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

      The room is bathed in blue light as the crew monitors the Indomita-
      ble's command and control systems.

      At the VERTICAL GLASS MAP, the ship's course has been charted from
      Hong Kong, south, down around Singapore, then north, where the YELLOW
      BLINKING dot indicates it's currently in the Strait of Malacca.

      Standing in front of the map, however, THE NAVIGATION OFFICER seems
      perplexed. He's comparing what's on the screen to a piece of paper
      in his hand. Something is wrong.

                              NAVIGATION OFFICER
                 ... This doesn't make sense. What's
                 our heading now?

      THE HELMSMAN looks down at his compass/auto-pilot.

      INSERT COMPASS/AUTO-PILOT - moving from West to North - then holding
      on a North position.

                              HELMSMAN
                 Zero one three. Due north.

      The two officers share a look. Something is odd, but -

                              HELMSMAN
                 We're on course again.

      Just then, the FIRST OFFICER ENTERS from the exterior bridge.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Can't see a damn thing in this fog.
                       (calling out)
                 Rating: What have we got?

      He joins the RATING and COMMUNICATION'S OFFICERS at their scopes.

                              RATING
                 A passenger ferry and two freighters
                 broadcasting on low-band -

                              COMMUNICATIONS
                 And two small fishing boats about 30k
                 north. No radar, but we've
                 identified their engine signatures.

      As the First Officer takes this in:

                              HELMSMAN (O.S.)
                 Damn. It's doing it again.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                       (joining him)
                 What's wrong?

                              HELMSMAN
                 About every ninety seconds, the auto-
                 pilot jogs us to the west.

      He points down to the compass/auto-pilot, SWINGING WEST...

                              HELMSMAN
                 Then re-sets us to the north.

      The compass reaches dead west - then starts to swing back NORTH.

                              HELMSMAN (cont'd)
                 The Captain wants us on the East side
                 of the channel. ...Cross current?

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Not in the Strait.
                       (to the Navigator)
                 How's our position?

                              NAVIGATING OFFICER
                 According to the satellite, we're
                 exactly on course.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Did you check the auto-pilot?

                              HELMSMAN
                 The back-up does the same thing.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Check it again. What about the global
                 positioning satellite? Could there be
                 something wrong with the signal?

                              GPS OFFICER
                 Two words: Im-possible.

      EXT. SPACE -

      As the earth turns below, a TINY SILVER DOT appears in the distance:
      A COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE, spinning slowly on its axis.

      It comes closer and closer to camera, until it FILLS THE SCREEN, and
      the LOGO on its body ROTATES INTO VIEW:

      HNN. THE HARMSWAY NEWS NETWORK.

      RETURN ON BRIDGE - INT. H.M.S. INDOMITABLE - NIGHT

      THE HELMSMAN finishes fiddling with the auto-pilot.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 How is it now?

                              HELMSMAN
                 Seems to be back to normal, sir.

      The First Officer nods... Then HEARS a SHRILL WARNING BEEP.

                              SONAR OPERATOR
                 I have something off the port bow!

      The First Officer rushes to join him at the screen.

                              SONAR OPERATOR (cont'd)
                 100 meters out, just below the surface.
                       (adjusts the controls)
                 A meter in diameter; ten - twelve
                 meters long. ...Floating vertically?

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 A dead head.
                       (off the others' quizzical looks)
                 Water logged timber. Floats straight
                 up. You sometimes see them on the east
                 side of the channel - from the logging
                 camps on Sumatra - but they don't
                 usually float this far west.
                       (calling out)
                 Muncy! Engines to half!

                              HELMSMAN
                 Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                       (explaining)
                 Chew up a log like that in the
                 propeller, you end up with enough paperwork
                 to go from here to London. Twice.

      EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

      The ship is moving towards a DARK VERTICAL SHAPE - Harmsway's SEA-BED
      CORE BORING DRILL (shorthand "THE WORM',) attached to a long flexible
      dredging pipe.

      CLOSER - THE HEAD OF THE WORM -

      Motionless, hanging in the water. Then the monster awakes: A metal
      sphere retracts, revealing a wide angle CAMERA LENS.

      INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

      The Communications Officer reacts to his monitor with ALARM:

      COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
      I'm getting an electrical emission,
      sir! Extremely close. Bearing 240 -

      The First Officer is surprised. All hell is about to break loose:       -

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Punch up the radar -

                              RADAR OPERATOR
                 I've got it, sir. A large craft -
                 XX,OOO tons. Range -
                       (disbelief)
                 200 yards? It's anchored in a cove!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 That's impossible! We're in the
                 middle of the channel!

      A Junior officer bursts in from the exterior bridge:

                              JUNIOR OFFICER
                 Breakers off the port bow! We're
                 heading for shore!

                              SONAR OFFICER
                 Sir -

                              FIRST OFFICER
                       (reacting to the Jr. Officer)
                 Full stop!!! Call the captain!

                              SONAR OFFICER
                 Sir!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                       (annoyed)
                 What?!?!

                              SONAR OPERATOR
                 The log is moving!

      EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

      Propelled by water-jets in its head, THE WORM STREAKS TOWARD THE
      INDOMITABLE, emitting a HIGH PITCHED whine as its drill bit revs up
      to speed. The drill's BLACK TEETH glisten in the water.

      THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, NIGHT)

      Closing in on the hull like a torpedo. It gets closer, picking up
      speed, until - on IMPACT -

      INT. ENGINE ROOM -

      A TORRENT OF WATER engulfs the Engineer and Crewmen when The Worm
      bursts/drills through the hull. As they scream, drowning -

      A CREWMAN ON THE GANTRY scrambles up, one step ahead of the water,
      through a bulkhead, into -

      GENERATOR ROOM - (CONTINUOUS)

      Where the CREWMAN and TWO OPERATORS struggle to CLOSE THE DOOR
      AGAINST THE WATER.

                              SENIOR OPERATOR
                       (on the intercom)
                 We've been hit! We're taking water!

      THE BRIDGE -

      Alarms sound! Red lights flash!

                              DAMAGE CONTROL
                 Flooding in the engine room!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Get me damage reports! Start the pumps!

                              SECOND OFFICER
                       (holding out a ship's phone)

                 It's the Captain -

      PASSAGEWAY #1 -

      On a phone, outside the ship's GYM, deep in the hull:

                              THE CAPTAIN
                 What the hell is going on?!?

                              FIRST OFFICER
                       (intercut if necessary)
                 I think we've been holed, sir!

                              THE CAPTAIN
                 On my way!

      He speeds along the passageway, going through a water-tight door,
      slamming it behind him. Meanwhile, on -

      THE BRIDGE -

                              HELMSMAN
                 The engines are gone!

                              DAMAGE CONTROL
                 Flooding on D deck!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Sound the general alarm! Seal all
                 compartments!

      As the Second Officer grabs the intercom -

                              SECOND OFFICER (into intercom)
                 Attention all hands -

      CREW'S MESS -

      The crew members look up from their meals -

                              SECOND OFFICER (continuing)
                 Proceed to emergency stations -

      GENERATOR ROOM -

      The men have closed the door, but... HEAR A HIGH-PITCHED WHINING,
      GRINDING SOUND from the other side. They exchange a quizzical look;
      they don't know what to make of it, when:

      BANG! The door explodes inward - and a high-pressured stream of
      water blasts in, blowing them back against the walls.

      BRIDGE -

      The lights go out! Everyone is scrambling:

                              SYSTEMS OFFICER
                 We've lost power!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Go to back up generators!

                              SECOND OFFICER (into intercom)
                 Repeat: Seal all compartments, and -

      CREW'S MESS -

      In the dim lighting -

                              SECOND OFFICER (on intercom)
                 Proceed to emergency stations at once!

      The men start to move, but halt at A HUMMING SOUND. They look
      around: Where is it coming from?

      Suddenly a THREE FOOT SECTION OF THE DECK EXPLODES IN A FOUNTAIN OF
      WATER. The men are swept off their feet.

      PASSAGEWAY/GANTRY #2 -

      As the Captain rushes up the steps, he turns around, reacting to a
      GRINDING NOISE -

      CAPTAIN'S POV - THE CLOSED WATER-TIGHT DOOR -

      BOOM! Water blasts through, like 1000 fire hydrants turned on full.

      With terror in his eyes, THE CAPTAIN sprints up the rest of the
      stairs, through a water-tight door, into:

      PASSAGEWAY #3 -

      Where the Captain secures the door behind him, and rushes away.

      THE BRIDGE -

      A desperate battle continues:

                              DAMAGE CONTROL
                 Flooding on C-Deck!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Where the hell are those generators?

                              SYSTEMS ENGINEER
                 Coming up, sir!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Get those pumps working!

      BATTERY ROOM -

      A CREWMAN hurriedly flips switches. The lights flicker... And just
      as they some to life, brightly -

      THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN, and a wall of water and debris blows in,
      destroying everything in its wake.

      THE BRIDGE -

      Lights out! A sense of helplessness is beginning to fill the room:

                              SYSTEMS CONTROL
                 The back-up is gone!

                              DAMAGE OFFICER
                 Flooding up to B-Deck!

                              HELMSMAN
                 We can't hold out much longer, sir!

      All eyes are on the First Officer. Will he save them?

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Where the hell is the Captain?!?!

      THE CAPTAIN (PASSAGEWAY #3) -

      Running, the Captain is about to reach the exit door. Hearing the
      relentless grinding behind him, he throws a look over his shoulder:

      BAM! The entrance door EXPLODES in a thunderball of water.

      The Captain clambers through the exit door to:

      PASSAGEWAY #4 -

      A short hall: He shuts the entrance door, runs to the exit. He
      looks hack again:

      BAM! The door blasts open - and the torrent of water continues the
      chase, as if it's got a personal vendetta against him. He exits to:

      PASSAGEWAY #5 -

      Slamming the door behind him, the Captain looks ahead, and up:

      STAIRS. AN OPEN DOOR AT THE TOP.

      He throws a look back:

      THE ENTRANCE DOOR IS BEGINNING TO HUM AND VIBRATE.

      Sprinting for his life, the Captain rushes up the stairs, two at a
      time. The humming behind him grows louder. He glances back:

      THE DOOR BLASTS OPEN. WATER SHOOTS IN.

      He rushes up the last four steps, just as -

      CA-CHUNK! THE EXIT DOOR SLAMS CLOSED IN FRONT OF HIM!

      With PANIC IN HIS EYES, the Captain turns to face the oncoming
      tsunami! We cut to:

      THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, INT. PASSAGEWAY #5)

      Moving like a shark... Toward THE CAPTAIN'S LEGS, DEAD AHEAD IN THE
      WATER. As it closes in for the kill -

      THE BRIDGE -

      Shifts, suddenly, to the stern. A confusion of anxious voices:

                              HELMSMAN
                 Slipping to stern!

                              DAMAGE OFFICER
                 All major compartments flooded!

      With all hands still awaiting orders -

      THE ROOM LURCHES AS THE BOW RISES! Papers fly! Men slide! The
      First Officer has no choice:

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Abandon ship! Break radio silence!
                 Send our position!

      INSERT - COMPUTER SCREEN -

      The Communications Officer types: "Top Secret. Indian Ocean Naval
      Command. H.M.S. Indomitable Sinking."

                              COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
                       (calling out)
                 What's our position?

                              GPS OFFICER
                       (reading off his screen)
                 One hundred degrees, thirty-one
                 minutes, and seven seconds East, by
                 two degrees, twenty-nine minutes, ten
                 seconds, North.

      As he types, the room lurches again, tilting more to the stern.

      THE CAPTAIN - (STAIRCASE, PASSAGEWAY #5)

      As the passageway shifts, tilting to the stern, the Captain screams
      and WHOOSH! - is sucked down into the water - the worm's vortex -
      like meat being fed into a Cuisinart: A churning, spinning death.

      EXT. THE H.M.S. INDOMITABLE - FOG - NIGHT

      Bow rises completely out of the water as the stern goes under.

      EXT. DECK -

      TWO CREWMAN manage to get a LIFEBOAT away. TWO OTHERS scramble up
      from below and leap into the water.

      WIDER

      The bow is at a forty-five degree angle... And the H.M.S.
      Indomitable pauses - for just a moment - before SLIPPING UNDER, STERN
      FIRST, throwing up a series of great waves.

      EXT. LIFEBOAT -

      Rocked by waves from the sinking ship. The Cook, a Marine, and Three
      Crewmen hear a splash along side. Two of the Crew pull the SONAR
      OFFICER aboard. He takes a minute to catch his breath, then:

                              SONAR OPERATOR
                 Six. That's it? Only six of us?

                              COOK
                 Most of the crew never made it to
                 their life jackets. The Captain?

                              SONAR OFFICER
                       (shrugs, then:)
                 The First officer stayed on the bridge.

      One of the CREWMAN SPOTS SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE:

                              CREWMAN
                 Hey - look! Over there!

      NEW ANGLE - (ROCK OUTCROPPING - STRAIT OF MALACCA - NIGHT)

      The SEA DOLPHIN II emerges from a cove, looking like a ghostly white
      apparition in the fog.

      RETURN ON THE LIFEBOAT -

      The men yell and wave and whistle, hoping to be saved.

      CLOSER ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - DECK -

      Elliot Harmsway removes a pair of binoculars from his face. Turns to
      YUNG, standing next to him at the rail:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Lovely night for a shipwreck, isn't it?

      Yung looks at Harmsway like he's crazy. Oblivious, Harmsway looks at
      his WATCH, then looks through the BINOCULARS again - and begins to
      WHISTLE the opening notes of My Fair Lady's "WOULDN'T IT BE LOVERLY."
      ("All I want is a room somewhere, far away from the cold night air")

      THE LIFEBOAT -

      As the men cry for help, the Sonar Operator spots something just
      below the surface, moving toward the lifeboat at great speed.

      He hears the hum. His eyes follow the churning water...

      And suddenly - out of nowhere - the Worm hits the lifeboat from
      below, smashing it to bits, hurtling the pieces in the air.

      THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Harmsway lowers the binoculars' smiling. Stamper appears, hands
      Harmsway a piece of paper.

                              STAMPER
                 We've decoded their last transmission.

      Harmsway studies it for a moment - smiles.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Perfect. They'll be searching miles from here.
                       (then)
                 Time for phase two. You can get the
                 men in the water.

      And with this, Harmsway turns, and walks off, jauntily whistling
      "Wouldn't It Be Loverly."

      Stamper looks at Yung, re: Harmsway's glee.

                              YUNG
                 You heard him. Get the men in the water!

      NEW ANGLE - SIDE OF THE SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT -

      In the water next to the chip, FOUR DIVERS drop the last of their
      equipment in a DIVE BOAT. They cast off, motoring into the fog.

      EXT. LONDON - RESTAURANT BIBENDUM - NIGHT

      The classic Michelin building on Fulham road.

      INT. RESTAURANT BIBENDUM -

      A YOUNG WOMAN is yammering away at Bond; he's trying to put a good
      face on what is obviously a dreadful fix-up first date.

                              WOMAN
                 I can't believe it took us so long to
                 finally get together! What exactly
                 do you do for the government?

                              BOND
                       (after a beat)
                 You might say... 'Public relations.'

                              WOMAN
                 How fascinating! I bet you meet all
                 the most fabulous people.

      Before Bond can answer, the MAITRE D' interrupts.

                              MAITRE D'
                 Excuse me - Mr. Bond? You have a call.

      Bond excuses himself.

      NEW ANGLE - BOND AT PHONE -

      007 picks up the receiver, without saying hello:

                              BOND
                 Moneypenny! You're early. You
                 weren't supposed to call until -
                       (he stiffens)
                 Yes. I understand. Twenty minutes.

      EXT. THE BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT

      Passing a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY TRUCK with an ad for "TOMORROW" ("The

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT

      ADMIRAL ROEBUCK glares as MINISTER JOHNSTONE enters to address M,
      TANNER, A TREASURY OFFICIAL, and various UNIFORMS and SUITS.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 Good evening. I've just spoken with
                 the Prime Minister at the economic
                 summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a
                 full update within the hour.
                       (beat)
                 For those of you still unaware, some
                 forty minutes ago -

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                       (interrupting)
                 Excuse me, but -
                       (all turn to him:)
                 I must formally protest this meeting.
                 Given the nature of what's occurred -
                 and the need for secrecy - I see no
                 reason to involve the air force, the
                 army, or MI-6.
                       (beat, as M and Tanner exchange a look)
                 This is an internal affair that should
                 be handled strictly by the officers of
                 her Majesty's Royal Navy.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (furious)
                 Admiral, are you suggesting -

      He's distracted by the CLICK OF A DOOR OPENING. All turn to SEE BOND
      entering, wearing a FULL NAVAL UNIFORM. M stifles a smile.

                              BOND
                 Sorry I'm late -

                              M
                 Actually, you're just in time.
                       (she turns to)
                 Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander
                 Bond, don't you?

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                       (deflated)
                 Yes. Of course.

                              BOND
                 I've looked forward to meeting you.

      Bond sits. M glances at Johnstone as if to say "proceed."

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 As I was saying: Approximately forty-
                 five minutes ago, we received an abandon
                 ship signal from the H.M.S. Indomitable.
                       (flicks on a map display)
                 Looking at these infrared satellite
                 images - provided by Mr. Tanner of
                 MI-6 -the ship is presumed lost here,
                 just south of Kuala Lumpur, where she
                 broadcast her last position.

                                                                  CUT TO:

      Through the worm's UNDERWATER camera, FOUR DIVERS with TORCHES and
      WELDING TOOLS are about to enter the HOLE in the Indomitable's hull.

      divers and the worm's functions.)

      The Divers and worm travel to a HATCH COVERED WITH METAL BARS.

      Lighting the welding torches, they try to cut through the metal
      bars... Unsuccessfully.

      VIDEO SCREEN - WORM POV -

      One of the Divers turns to the worm's camera. He SPEAKS into his
      diving helmet's microphone:

                              DIVER
                       (through speaker)
                 It's titanium. we can't cut through.

      INT. SEA DOLPHIN BRIDGE -

      Stamper turns to Harmsway:

                              STAMPER
                 I'll do it.

                              HARMSWAY (into microphone)
                 Divers, stand aside.

      NEUTRAL POV - UNDERWATER - PASSAGEWAY -

      The worm moves into position to grind through the hatch. A protective
      cover slides over the lens, and the grinder whorls into life.

      CLOSER ON THE WORM - The grinder stalls for an instant as it
      encounters the titanium bars.

      STILL CLOSER - One of the URANIUM GRINDING TEETH SNAPS OFF as it hits
      the titanium, and starts to grind through.

      NEW ANGLE

      Once past the bars, the grinder cuts easily through the steel door.
      Trapped air bursts out from inside the compartment. The Divers push
      the worm to one side; two of them enter the hold with lights. The
      worm follows. The two other divers remain behind to feed the worm's
      flexible tubing through the door.

      INT. BILGE HOLD - UNDERWATER -

      The Divers' lights illuminate the hold: STACKS OF GOLD BARS, as far
      as the eye can see.

      INT. BRIDGE - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Harmsway looks at the video screen.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Gentlemen: I do believe we've struck
                 gold... Four minutes ahead of schedule.

      INT. BILGE HOLD - UNDERWATER -

      The worm closes its "eye", revs up its grinders, and attacks the
      first pile of gold Bars. It runs through them like butter.

      The bloodletting and recriminations have begun. This plays fast:

                       (incredulous)
                 One-third of the British gold reserves?!?
                       (beat)
                 What kind of idiot loses -
                       (looks to the treasury officer)
                 What is it? The equivalent of ten
                 billion US dollars???

                              TREASURY OFFICIAL
                       (sheepishly)
                 Give or take. Depending on today's
                 currency rates -

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (ignoring him)
                 What the hell was the gold doing on
                 that boat?

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 We were bringing it back from Hong
                 Kong. Under orders from the Treasury.

                              TREASURY OFFICIAL
                 During the cold war, we stored a
                 third in America, and another third
                 in Hong Kong - in case of a nuclear
                 attack. And with the turn-over of
                 Hong Kong to the Chinese -

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 Why wasn't the ship protected?!?!
                 Why was it sailing without radar?

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 I resent your tone, sir. I have men
                 who are missing -

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 And I have the entire British economy
                 to worry about.

                       (breaking in)
                 Minister -
                       (all turn to him)
                 Obviously, MI-6 was not involved in
                 this operation. But I have to defend
                 the Admiral.

      Roebuck looks at Bond with great surprise. Bond continues:

                              BOND (cont'd)
                 Electronic silence was the safest way
                 to move that gold. Otherwise, any
                 country - or individual - with the
                 crudest missile could just lock onto
                 our signals, and take out the boat.
                       (beat)
                 That's what happened to the Sheffield
                 in the Falklands.
                       (beat)
                 Since then, it's standard operating
                 procedure for any sensitive shipment.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (frowns)
                 At least we know where the gold is.
                 When are the recovery ships due?

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 36 hours. They've already sailed
                 from the Persian gulf.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 I expect to have that gold recovered
                 in 36 hours. Until then, I'm
                 imposing my own electronic silence:
                 For the sake of the economy, not a
                 word to NATO, the press, the CIA.
                       (beat, looking at:)
                 ...And so long as Commander Bond here
                 seems to be such an expert on these
                 matters, I want him to go along as an
                 observer. Are we agreed?

                              ROEBUCK
                 Yes.

                              BOND
                 Yes.

                              M
                 As you wish.

      EXT. SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT

      Harmsway walks along the side of the ship, observing the operation:

      The WORM'S DREDGING PUMP sucks up the ground-up GOLD AND WATER SLUR-
      RY, (through the TUBE hanging over the side,) and dumps it into a
      SERIES OF SLUICES. At each stage the gold nuggets fall to the bottom
      of the sluice, and excess water flows off the side of the ship.

      AT THE STERN HOLD -

      where all the water has been drained off, leaving a cascade of gold
      nuggets pouring into the ship's hold -

      HARMSWAY reaches into the shimmering cascade, and takes a hand-full
      of gold. He sees Stamper approaching.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Remember the golden rule, Mr.
                 Stamper: He who has the gold, rules.

      He drops the gold back in the hold.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Is the helicopter ready?

                              STAMPER
                 Fueled and waiting.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.

      INT. HALLWAY - BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT -

      M and Bond, striding down a hallway to exit the building.

                              M
                 ...You're turning into quite the
                 politician, 007.

                              BOND
                 I have an excellent teacher.
                       (sideways glance)
                 'Make sure you wear the uniform'?

                              M
                       (ignoring his jibe)
                 What do you make of all this?

                              BOND
                 It doesn't quite add up.

      They've come to a door. Pause as he opens it. He explains:

                              BOND
                 The infrared satellite images. No
                 heat, no flame, no explosion. If
                 that boat went down where they said
                 it did, there should have been some
                 residual heat reading on the surface.

                              M
                 Sabotage?

                              BOND
                 A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't
                 just vanish into thin air.

      She nods and pushes through the door. He follows.

      EXT. BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS -

                              M
                 I've already contacted our station in
                 Kuala Lumpur. They're lining up a
                 local contact.
                       (beat)
                 I want you to find that gold, and
                 secure it.

      They've arrived at her car. The door is already open.

                              BOND
                 ... Didn't Elliot Harmsway just move
                 his headquarters to Kuala Lumpur?

      She turns, freezes Bond with a look:

                              M
                 Contrary to what you may believe,
                 007, the world is not filled with
                 mad-men who can hollow out volcanoes,
                 stock them with big-breasted women,
                 and threaten the world with nuclear
                 annihilation.

      Bond reacts to the comeuppance. She continues:

                              M (cont'd)
                 The case is closed. The Italian
                 authorities ruled the girl a suicide.
                 We had enough trouble keeping your
                 name out of the media. For
                 everyone's sake -
                       (beat)
                 Your job is to find the gold. Not
                 settle some personal score with
                 Elliot Harmsway.

      EXT. 'HARMSWAY BUILDING' (HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK) - HONG KONG - DUSK

      Super: HONG KONG. Harmsway's helicopter is perched atop the famous
      tinker-toy-styled building in the Central district.

      INT. PENTHOUSE BOARDROOM - DUSK

      A CHINESE CHOP comes down firmly on a legal document. GENERAL LI (of
      the People's Revolutionary Army) is seated with a squad of lawyers:

                              GENERAL LI
                 And that is the fifth document. With
                 your counter-signature, the sale will
                 be complete.

      The document is passed across to HARMSWAY, sitting with his own legal
      counsel. One of the men is WHISPERING TO HIM, INTENSELY:

                              YOUNG CHINESE LAWYER
                 Are you sure? If we waited -

      Harmsway waves the lawyer off, silencing him. Addresses the General:

                              HARMSWAY
                 General Li: My young associate here
                 has just informed me that if I waited
                 a year, I could perhaps receive a
                 higher price for this building.
                       (beat, wryly)
                 He has great faith in Hong Kong. As did
                 my ancestors. With obvious results.

      Nervous chuckles around the table, but the General is reserved.

                              HARMSWAY (cont'd)
                 Yet to sell this building for more
                 money - to profiteer - would run counter
                 to the Chinese sprit of guanchi - mutual
                 trust and obligation; it would violate
                 the ancient principles of feng shui -
                       (beat)
                 - the reason we sign five documents
                 instead of an unlucky four, and why this
                 building has a fifth, non-functioning
                 ventilation shaft on its roof.
                       (beat)
                 Wind and water, fire and rain, earth
                 and sky - feng shui. All things - at
                 one, in balance, with nature.

                              GENERAL LI
                 ...Most eloquently put, Sir Elliot.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Thank you, General Li. Now I'll just
                 sign this last document -

      He puts the pen to the paper, and BREAKS THE PEN. Alarmed looks.

                              HARMSWAY (cont'd)
                 Terribly sorry. Mr. Stamper?

      From behind, Stamper hands him a pen. Harmsway innocently starts to
      sign in RED INK -

                              GENERAL LI
                 Sir Elliot! Red ink -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Of course! How foolish. More bad
                 luck. I'll just borrow yours -

      He takes General Li's pen, and signs his name with a flourish.

      EXT. ROOF OF 'HARMSWAY BUILDING' -

      Under the whirring blades of the chopper, Harmsway bids farewell to
      General Li. He and Stamper get in helicopter.

      CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER -

      As Harmsway waves good-bye from the window, the helicopter rises,
      REVEALING a METAL CABLE attached to the LANDING SKID.

      WIDER -

      The cable leads to a spool, which runs to the FIFTH METAL VENTILATION
      SHAFT Harmsway referred to in the last scene.

      INT. HELICOPTER - AIRBORNE -

      Harmsway pops open a bottle of champagne.

                              HARMSWAY
                 An old Chinese toast to our friends...

      RETURN ON ROOFTOP HELIPAD -

      The General SEES THE CABLE GROW TAUT AROUND THE VENTILATION SHAFT.
      He reacts with horror.

      INT. HELICOPTER/HARMSWAY ROOFTOP POV -

      Harmsway glances down to watch the VENTILATION SHAFT TOPPLE onto the
      General and his aides, scattering them like rats.

      In the chopper, the pilot cuts the cable, and Harmsway lifts a
      champagne glass:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Confusion to the enemy. In 48 hours,
                 that building - and all of Hong Kong
                 around it - will cease to exist.

      AERIAL - SKIES ABOVE STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

      A BRITISH MILITARY C-130 airship is dropping sono-buoys into the
      water from a low altitude. me plane veers off, revealing A BRITISH
      SEA KING command and control helicopter, hovering above.

      INT. SEA KING HELICOPTER - AIRBORNE - DAY

      Bond holds a map of the channel. He's standing over several CREWMAN
      seated at radar, sonar, and navigation consoles.

                              CREWMAN 1
                 Sounding: Bottom is thirty fathoms.

                              CREWMAN 2
                 Nothing. Negative bounce.

                              BOND
                 We should be right over it.

      They hear a SHARP DINGING SOUND -

                              OPERATOR 2
                 Wait - I'm getting something.

                              BOND
                 Where? What is it?

      The man points at one of the screens, where Bond sees a COMPUTER
      GENERATED MAP OF THE SEA FLOOR, with the FAINT OUTLINE of a WARSHIP.

                              OPERATOR 2
                 Not sure yet -

      He types in some commands on a keyboard, and a 3-D rendering of a
      boat appears on another computer screen. Lots of data:

                              OPERATOR 2
                 The Shinjuku. Japanese troop
                 carrier. World War II.

                              BOND
                 Let's make another pass.

                              CO-PILOT
                       (calling out)
                 We have traffic on the deck -

      They look down and see an HNN (Harmsway News Network) boat.

                              BOND
                 Get rid of them.

      NEW ANGLE - EXT. SEA RING CHOPPER & HNN BOAT -

      The chopper hovers above the HNN boat -

                 the area.

      EXT. HNN WORLD HEADQUARTERS (PETRONAS TOWERS)- KUALA LUMPUR - DAY

      We're looking up at the world's tallest building: The 1500' twin
      Petronas Towers. (They look like an architectural collaboration
      between Friz Lang and H.G. Wells.) At the 50th floor, there's a sky
      bridge connecting the buildings, where -

      INT. SKY BRIDGE - (HNN HEADQUARTERS) - DAY

      Elliot Harmsway strides out of an elevator (in Tower 1,) into a group
      of waiting assistants. Without breaking stride -

                              YOUNG MALE ASSISTANT 1
                 Good morning Sir Elliot! Welcome to

                              HARMSWAY
                 Morning, morning all. What have we got?

      His EXECUTIVE SECRETARY rushes to keep up, reading from a pad, as
      they cross the sky bridge to HNN's main reception area, in Tower 2:

                 Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution,
                 and explain I have no control over
                 what my journalists write -

                              EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
                 And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.

                 "A routine training exercise."

                              HARMSWAY
                 I'm shocked!! Issue the usual vehement
                 protest: Freedom of the press, people's
                 right to know... Lather it up with a lot
                 of righteous indignation.
                       (off their laughter)
                 Next?

      INT. SEA KING HELICOPTER - AIRBORNE - DAY

      Frowning, Bond peers at the Sonar Operator's screen.

                              BOND
                 Still nothing?

      The operator shakes his head. The pilot calls back from the cockpit:

                              CO-PILOT
                 Commander Bond: They've found one of
                 the crewman's bodies!

      EXT. COASTAL INLET - MARSHLAND - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY

      The Sea King comes in above several police cars and boats. Bond
      jumps the last ten feet, and the chopper peels off.

                              MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                 Yo! Jimbo!

      Bond turns to look: It's JACK WADE.

                              BOND
                 Wade, what the hell are you doing here?

                              WADE
                 I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has
                 absolutely no knowledge of the
                 missing ship, the missing gold, where
                 it was going, or when it left Hong
                 Kong.

                              BOND
                 That's reassuring.

                              WADE
                 Hey - the world is my office.

                              BOND
                 Let's take a look at the body.

      As Bond moves off, WADE SNIFFS THE AIR, savoring the aroma:

                              WADE
                 Smells like... Coffee plants.

      NEW ANGLE -

      A POLICEMEN pulls a white sheet from the body. (We don't see it.)
      Bond and Wade look down at something gruesome:

                              WADE
                 Colorful... Shark attack?

      Bond shakes his head grimly.

                              BOND
                 I don't think so. The veins are
                 cauterized - as if they were sealed
                 by heat...
                       (beat, confounded)
                 But there are no burn marks on the
                 flesh. It doesn't make sense.
                       (to the policeman)
                 Who found the body?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                       (points to)
                 Dato. Local fisherman. Says it came
                 in with the tide early this morning.

                              BOND
                 Ask him if it could have washed in
                 from the west side of the Strait.

      The POLICEMAN has an animated conversation with FISHERMAN. Then:

                              POLICEMAN
                 No. He says it's not possible. The
                 current could have only brought the
                 body in from the east.

                              BOND
                       (to Wade)
                 You have a boat?

                              WADE
                 I don't know if you'd call it a boat...

                              BOND
                 Something with an engine? Not oars?

                              WADE
                 Step into my office.

      EXT. 'THE RUNNING DOG' CIGARETTE BOAT - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

      Smashing through the water at breakneck speed. Wade and Bond yell
      over the engines.

                              WADE
                 What do you want with the Harbor Master?

                              BOND
                 Tide and current charts. Work
                 backward from the body - find where
                 the ship sank.
                       (Wade nods appreciatively)
                 Where did you get the boat?

                              WADE
                 Seized it from a guy smuggling
                 computer chips out of Bangkok.
                       (beat)
                 Should have seen his rose garden:
                 Blooms the size of hand grenades.

      Bond looks at Wade: The man remains, forever deranged.

      EXT. PORT KLANG - ESTABLISHING - DAY

      The Harbor Master's tower overlooks a small armada of yachts, fishing
      boats, etc. A series of long dockways jut out into the harbor.

      CIGARETTE BOAT - (PORT KLANG - WATERWAY) - DAY

      Wade's boat is moving slowly along the waterway at the end of the
      docks. Looking off, Bond spots the Harbor Master's Tower:

                              BOND
                 Over there.

      Wade turns the boat down one of the dock channels.

      NEW ANGLE - WADE/BOND'S POV - DOCKWAY CHANNEL -

      A SLEEK LAUNCH is ROARING TOWARDS them, on a dead collision course.
      A WOMAN in a baseball cap is at the wheel.

      WADE pulls his boat to the right; the LAUNCH ROARS AROUND THEM,
      rocking the cigarette boat with its wake.

      BOTH BOND and WADE clock the woman - who we will later learn is
      SIDNEY WINCH. Wade stares after her:

                              WADE
                 I think I've just seen my next future
                 ex-wife.

                              BOND
                       (seeing they're about to crash)
                 Not if you kill us first - unless
                 that's how you plan to leave Muffy.

      Wade scowls, setting the boat back on course.

      DOCKSIDE - PORT KLANG - DAY -

      Bond hops off the boat, securing the lines. Wade joins him.

                              WADE
                 By the way, Jimbo - whatever happened
                 to that girl - in Cuba - ?

      Finished tying the boat, they walk toward the Harbor Master's office.

                              BOND
                 Natalya?

                              WADE
                 Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.

                              BOND
                 She married a hockey player.

                              WADE
                 I envy your 'undercover' assignments.

                              BOND
                       (a look, then)
                 We work in the dark. We do what we can.

      INT. HARBOR MASTER OFFICE - PORT KLANG - DAY

      The local Malay harbor master puts a stack of charts on the counter.

                              HARBOR MASTER
                 Wind, tide, currents... You're the
                 second person today asked for a full
                 set of charts.
                       (holds out a clipboard)
                 If you'd just sign here -

      Bond takes the clipboard -

      INSERT CLIPBOARD - read signature: SIDNEY WINCH.

      Bond returns the clipboard:

                              BOND
                 Thanks.
                       (apparent afterthought)
                 By the way - was there anything
                 strange the night before last? Odd
                 weather, lost boats - ??

                              HARBOR MASTER
                 No... Unless you're talking about
                 the bus problem.

                              BOND
                 ...Bus problem?

                              HARBOR MASTER
                 Captain Cheong's ferry was late. He
                 runs the line across the Strait
                 between here and Sumatra. The lumber
                 mill workers coming back for the
                 weekend missed the last bus. Slept
                 on the docks. Hundreds of them.

                              BOND
                 Thanks.

      EXT. HARBOR MASTER'S TOWER - DAY

      Bond emerges, carrying the charts, along with Wade.

                              BOND
                 I have to get these to London. Do
                 you know this Captain Cheong?

                              WADE
                 Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur
                 yacht club.

                              BOND
                 Can you arrange a meeting?

                              WADE
                 Hell. The CIA built that club.

      EXT. KUALA LUMPUR YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

      Palm trees, torch lights, and Rolls Royces.

      INT. KUALA LUMPUR YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

      A local band plays on the verandah. We find Wade at a POKER TABLE
      with five local Malay Chinese. He CUTS THE CARDS, exuberantly:

                              WADE
                 Okay gentlemen. The name of the game
                 is 7-card Cambodian stud. Everything
                 is wild!

      And then - moving through a beaded glass curtain - we find Bond, in a
      white dinner jacket, sitting with CAPTAIN CHEONG. The Captain is
      elegant, mid-5O's, eye patch. (To be put into local dialect.)

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat
                 is even five minutes late, one begins
                 to worry, Mr. Bond.

                              BOND
                 I know. Pirates from Sumatra want
                 the cargo; smugglers from Thailand
                 and Burma want the ships.

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 Sometimes kill the crew; other times -
                       (points to his eye)
                 Torture them.

                              BOND
                 I'm sorry.

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles
                 off-course that night. Captain blamed
                 the auto-pilot; I suspected he was
                 drunk - until the Sumatra ferry
                 captain had same problem.

                              BOND
                 Did you test the auto-pilots? The
                 satellite positioning receiver?

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.
                       (chuckles)
                 My 90 year old grandfather thinks
                 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon
                 Dragon.'

                              BOND
                       (smiles, standing to leave)
                 I appreciate your time -

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch.
                 Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody
                 knows more about the Strait.

                              BOND
                 Where can I find him?

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 Him? He, is a she -
                       (points)
                 at the bar.

      NEW ANGLE - THE BAR -

      SIDNEY WINCH, about 32, tough, smart, and (here's a surprise,)
      beautiful, is ordering a drink when Bond appears:

                              SIDNEY
                 Bourbon. Neat.

                              BOND
                 I wonder if you handle your liquor
                 more carefully than you handle your boat.

      Very slowly, Sidney turns to Bond. She looks him up and down - as if
      deciding whether this specimen is worth her time. Her conclusion: A
      definite - though skeptical - maybe. She gives him a sultry smile:

                              SIDNEY
                 Sometimes, you just have to plunge
                 into things. Be reckless.

                              BOND
                 - And I bet you always leave turmoil
                 in your wake.

                              SIDNEY
                       (thinking, 'not bad')
                 Have we met?

                              BOND
                 This afternoon. Our boats practically
                 kissed in the harbor.
                       (holds out his hand to shake)
                 James Bond.

                              SIDNEY
                 Sidney Winch.

      The BARTENDER APPEARS.

                              BOND
                 Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.
                       (to Sidney)
                 And another for you?

                              SIDNEY
                 No. But you can buy a drink for my
                 friend, Taro.

      She steps back REVEALING a huge SAMOAN, TARO, wearing a dark suit and
      tie, sitting on a stool. Taro smiles menacingly at Bond.

                              BOND
                 Boyfriend?

                              SIDNEY
                 Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.

                              BOND
                 Pity.
                       (to Bartender)
                 Bring him whatever he wants.

                              SIDNEY
                 So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur,
                 Mr. Bond?
                       (beat)
                 Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage?
                 Running from some poor little girl
                 with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in -
                 London?

      Bond analyzes the situation: 1) She's with a thug. 2) She's in marine
      salvage. 3) She went to the Harbor Master's office for the charts.
      4) She's a smart-ass. He decides to see if he can rattle her:

                              BOND
                 Actually, I'm here on business. You
                 might say it was a... Golden opportunity.

                              SIDNEY
                       (a chill in her voice)
                 And exactly what business are you in,
                 Mr. Bond?

                              BOND
                 Insurance. Lloyds of London.

                              SIDNEY
                       (daggers in her voice)
                 The Strait can be a very dangerous
                 place, Mr. Bond. A few words
                 scribbled on a piece of paper in
                 London doesn't carry a lot of value
                 out here. Including life insurance.

                              BOND
                 I'll keep that in mind.

                              SIDNEY
                       (looking off)
                 I see my date is here.
                       (to Taro)
                 And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.

                              BOND
                 Nice to run into you again.

                              SIDNEY
                 Let's not make it a habit.

      She exits. Turning his back on Taro, Bond watches her cross the
      room. Taro places a huge hand on Bond's shoulder -

                              TARO
                 I think you should go -

                              BOND
                 Not quite yet, Taro -

      And from BOND'S POV - Sidney greets HARMSWAY with a big hug.

                              SIDNEY
                 Uncle Elliot!!

      Watching this, Bond seethes with memory of Paris and his hatred of
      Harmsway. Taro tightens his grip -

                              TARO
                 I said you should -

      But before he finishes, Bond spins, and: 1) slams Taro's head on the
      bar, 2) snatches the ice-pick from the bartender, 3) yanks Taro back-
      ward by his collar, 4) slams the ice-pick through Taro's tie into the
      wooden bar, and 5) kicks the stool out from under the goon.

      Taro is now hanging by his tie, from the bar, choking.

      Bond takes a moment to straighten his own bow-tie. Wade appears,
      jubilant, with a wad of cash:

                              WADE
                 Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -
                       (seeing Taro)
                 What happened?

                              BOND
                 He tied one on.

      EXT. A DESERTED MARINA - MORNING -

      Bond walks down a long dock towards a lone boat, moored at the end.

      EXT./INT. BOAT AT MARINA - MORNING -

      Bond looks around furtively, before climbing aboard the sleek ocean-
      going craft. On the aft-deck, there's a large covered object.

      As Bond reaches for the CABIN DOOR, it opens by itself - and a
      succession of THREE YOUNG ENGLISH WOMEN in STRING BIKINIS emerge.

                              GIRL ONE
                 Good morning!

                              GIRL TWO
                 Good morning.

                              GIRL THREE
                       (calling back into the cabin)
                 He's arrived.

      Bond turns from the door to watch the women. He hears:

                              Q'S VOICE
                 You're late 007. I've been expecting
                 you.

      Q emerges from the cabin in a blazer and an ascot. He's irritated:

                              BOND
                 Q! How are you?

                              Q
                 Retired. I'm not getting paid to
                 help you save the world anymore.

                              BOND
                 I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -

                              Q
                 That hardly makes up for the imposition.
                       (beat)
                 Now, for what I hope will be the very
                 last time - pay attention, 007.
                       (he unfurls a map:)
                 First, computer generated retrograde
                 analysis map. Body here, meteorolog-
                 ical influences here, likely vector-
                 ing of the ship's coordinates here.

                              BOND
                 Do you have any idea of what any of
                 that means? In English?

                              Q
                 Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.
                       (reaches for a Filofax sized device)
                 Next, your new personal communicator.
                       (flips it open)
                 Picture-phone, fax, beeper.

                              BOND
                       (taking it)
                 Do I have to dial '9' to get out?

                              Q
                 I don't care who you dial, so long as
                 it's not me. Next -

      Q walks to the large object on the aft-deck. Pulls off a tarp:

                              Q
                 Your new car. (Insert name)

                              BOND
                       (interrupting)
                 - Four wheel drive?

                              Q
                 Yes. And do try to keep all four of
                 them on the road.
                       (continuing)
                 All the usual refinements: Smoke,
                 missiles, machine guns -
                       (shows him a key fob)
                 Fully operational remote control.
                 Drives forward, reverse -
                       (Bond presses a button,
                        opening a window)
                 Stop that!
                       (grabbing it away)
                 Plus infrared thermal imaging radar,
                 heads up instrumentation, and 17
                 beverage cup holders.

                              BOND
                 ... 17 Beverage cup holders?

                              Q
                 Standard equipment. The world's
                 automobile manufacturers seem to be
                 in some kind of mad war to see who
                 can provide the most beverage cup
                 holders.

      Bond nods, and LOOKS AT a distraction from the GIRLS IN BIKINIS.

                              BOND
                 I must say, Q, you seem to be doing
                 rather well in your retirement.

                              Q
                 Don't even think about it. 007.
                 They're my granddaughters.

      STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

      Clear skies and blue water. The only vessel in sight is a thirty-
      five foot SPORT FISHING BOAT underway at full throttle.

      EXT. SPORT FISHING BOAT, FLYING BRIDGE - DAY -

      Wade at the helm; Bond next to him, near sonar, holding Q's map.

                              BOND
                 Slow down. We're close.

      Wade pulls back on the throttle.

      AERIAL - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/STRAIT OF MALACCA) - DAY -

      The boat starts a wide turn -

      NEW ANGLE - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/ROCK OUTCROPPING/STRAIT) - DAY -

      And we're back at the outcropping where the Indomitable sank. The
      SPORT FISHING BOAT is trolling against a background of sandy beaches
      and the lush green hills of Sumatra.

      FLYING BRIDGE -

      Wade scans the shore; Bond studies the sonar display.

                              WADE
                 I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out
                 here. How could they get this far
                 off course?

                              BOND
                       (concentrating on the sonar)
                 Who knows? Fog, night...

                              WADE
                 They'd never sail this close to the shore.

                              BOND
                 Wait a minute -
                       (beat, pointing to the
                        screen)
                 I've got it. There! Off the port bow!

      INSERT SONAR SCREEN -

      The murky electronic outline of a ship.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      Bond watches the sonar screen. Wade slows engines, consults charts.

                              BOND
                 Cut the engines! It's about two-
                 hundred fifty feet down.

                                                              JUMP CUT TO:

      AN ANCHOR BEING PITCHED INTO THE WATER - (BOW OF SPORT FISHING BOAT) -

      By Wade. Bond is strapping on his scuba tank.

                              WADE
                 Two-fifty's pretty deep for air. You
                 should really be using mixed gases.

      Bond glances at the air gauge on his tanks.

                              BOND
                 I'll make a bounce dive. If I can
                 keep my bottom time short, I'll be
                 all right.

      Bond gathers up FLARES, and sits on the gunwale.

                              BOND
                       (only half teasing)
                 Keep your eye out for pirates.

      Wade pulls back his shirt to reveal TWO SIX-SHOOTERS.

                              WADE
                 I got you covered.

                              BOND
                 That's reassuring.

      Bond rolls backward into the water and disappears.

      UNDERWATER -

      Bond swims to the anchor line, and begins pulling himself downward,
      handover-hand, deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom.

      UNDERWATER BOTTOM -

      Bond touches down by the anchor; his fins kick up the sandy bottom.
      Checking his wrist compass, he sets off through a rocky channel.

      EXT. INDOMITABLE - UNDERWATER -

      Ahead, in the dimness, a huge gray shape looms out of the sand.

      Bond lights a FLARE, and the scene is suddenly alive with color.
      From Bond's position, the hull seems to go on forever before being
      lost beyond range of his flare. Bond checks his air gauge.

      INSERT GAUGES -

      Depth: 283 feet - Air capacity: 3/4 tank remaining.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      Bond swims to the hole in the side of the Indomitable. He pauses to
      study the damage. Then enters.

      INT. ENGINE ROOM - UNDERWATER -

      Bond sees the damage on the passageway door. Swims through it.

      INT. PASSAGEWAY - UNDER WATER -

      The flare throws eerie shadows along the corridor; Bond swims to the
      busted bilge-hold hatch. Again, he pauses to examine the marks made
      by the worm. He drops into the hold.

      INT. CARGO HOLD - UNDER WATER -

      The gold is gone. Bond swims a few yards in: Nothing. A vast empty
      space. Bond's flare sputters and dies. He drops it, lights another.

      As he turns to exit, SOMETHING GLINTS on the deck below the hatch.
      He moves toward it.

      NEW ANGLE - CLOSER -

      A half-chewed GOLD BAR is wedged between a brace and the bulkhead.
      Bond reaches for it, feeling the worm's drill marks on the gold.

      Just as he yanks the bar out, a MORAY EEL lashes out from behind the
      brace, baring its teeth.

      Still clutching the gold bar, Bond jumps back, and shoots up, into:

      PASSAGE WAY -(INT. INDOMITABLE) - UNDER WATER -

      where he collides with something floating just below the ceiling.
      Dropping the flare on the impact, Bond twists around to see:

      THE FACE OF A FLOATING DEAD SAILOR.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      Throwing wildly gyrating shadows, the flare drops to the deck, roll-
      ing under some debris. Regaining his composure, Bond SLIPS THE GOLD
      BAR INTO A WEBBED SACK ON HIS BELT, then moves to retrieve the flare.

      CLOSE ON HATCH/DECK -

      Bond reaches for the flare, under a section of the torn hatch cover.
      He notices the BROKEN URANIUM GRINDING TOOTH. He picks it up, stuffs
      it into his sack, and swims off.

                                                                   CUT TO:

      UNDERWATER BOTTOM - ANCHOR -

      Bond swims to the anchor line, grabs hold, and starts up. On the
      way, he glances at his gauges:

      INSERT GAUGES -

      Depth: 160 feet - Air capacity: below RED LINE - empty. The ambient
      light level on the gauges suddenly DARKENS.

      BOND LOOKS UP TO THE SURFACE -

      HIS POV -

      A black HULL has blotted out the light... And SOMETHING LARGE AND
      HEAVY IS FALLING straight at 007.

      BOND -

      kicks away from the anchor-line just as a 1000 POUND ANCHOR streaks
      by. He looks up again:

      THREE DIVERS ARE IN THE WATER.

      One carries a strange-looking HARPOON-TYPE GUN; another trails a
      CABLE. The divers have fanned out, looking for 007.

      BOND -

      Realizes his best chance is to take one of the men hostage.

      Flashing his KNIFE, Bond cuts the cord to his gold/uranium sack,
      STUFFS THE SACK INTO HIS BAGGY SWIM TRUNKS.

      Bond rockets up, SLAMMING INTO DIVER #1. A confusion of bubbles.

      And just as Bond overcomes the man - spinning him around, holding the
      knife to the diver's throat -

      DIVER #2 SHOOTS the HARPOON-TYPE GUN, and A DOLPHIN NET explodes out,
      ENVELOPING BOND AND THE DIVER in a mesh. (Note: This is a real,
      'fish friendly' research tool.)

      Diver #3 HOOKS THE CABLE he's been trailing onto the net, and -

      EXT. SEA -

      The net erupts through the surface, is hauled up into the air, and
      deposited on -

      THE DECK OF A SELF-PROPELLED SALVAGE BARGE.

      (An old scow, with a large crane, two-story deck-house, and a crew
      whose idea of 'cruise-wear' runs to tattoos and grotesque scars.

      BOND'S POV - THROUGH HIS DIVING MASK -

      As the water drains from his mask, Bond sees the mesh being pulled
      away, and FIVE GOONS come into focus, training AUTOMATIC WEAPONS on
      him. (Bond still has the diver from behind, knife to his throat.)

      One of the goons reaches forward, ripping off Bond's mask. 007 sees:

      TARO - (EXT. SALVAGE BARGE, DECK) -

      Brandishing an UZI at Bond, with a malevolent smile:

                              TARO
                 Uzi beats knife.

                              BOND
                 ...Interesting point.

      Bond sticks the knife into the deck, and releases the hostage.

                              TARO
                 Get him up. Take his belt.
                       (motioning to Wade)
                 Take the two of them to the Captain.

      The men grab Bond roughly, and shove him next to Wade.

                              TARO
                 By the way. I almost forgot.
                       (smashing Bond)
                 I owed you one.

      Bond and Wade are frog-marched to the bridge, passing under the gaze
      of various cutthroat crew members. Wade is completely unfazed.

                              WADE
                       (sniffs the air)
                 Smell that Jimmy? Sea Kelp.

      Bond gives Wade a look.

                              WADE
                 Hey - it could be worse. At least
                 they speak English.

      Bond glances up at a crew member, SHARPENING A MACHETE, smiling.

                              BOND
                 ...Somehow, that's not reassuring.

      INT. BRIDGE - SALVAGE BARGE - DAY

      We're back in Bond-land: A high-tech control room, with lots of
      monitors and white-suited TECHNICIANS. Bond and Wade are pushed
      through the-door, followed by Taro and the two goons.

                              TARO
                 Here they are, Captain.

      The "Captain" turns from a monitor: IT'S SIDNEY.

                              SIDNEY
                 Just give me one goad reason - Mister
                 Bond, from Lloyds of London - why I
                 shouldn't kill both of you, burn your
                 boat, and use your bodies for shark bait.

                              WADE
                       (chirping up)
                 So you two know each other!?! Small
                 world, ain't it? What happened?
                 Commitment problems?

                              SIDNEY
                 Who is he?

                              BOND
                 Sidney Winch, meet -

                              WADE
                 Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial
                 loan division. If you're ever lookin'
                 for a sweet refinance on the boat -

                              SIDNEY
                 - Shut up!

                              BOND
                       (to Wade)
                 You have to excuse Miss Winch: She
                 thinks she's on a 'seduce and
                 destroy' mission through life...
                       (pauses)
                 ...But she won't kill us.

                              SIDNEY
                 No?

                              BOND
                 No. First, because I don't think
                 it's in your nature. And second,
                 because there's no gold down there.

                              SIDNEY
                 So charming! So suave!
                       (beat)
                 Don't insult me. I'm not one of your
                 'little London girls' who falls for
                 the lies.

                              WADE
                 So it was commitment!

                              SIDNEY
                 Every wharf-rat from here to Hong Kong
                 knows what's on that boat and I'm
                 claiming it. One-third of that gold is
                 mine.

                              BOND
                 That's fine, but - even a little
                 London girl knows that one third of
                 nothing is still nothing.

      There's a flicker of doubt in her eyes. She turns to Taro:

                              SIDNEY
                 Was he carrying anything?

      Taro holds up the BOND'S DIVING BELT, indicating 'nothing'. Angrily:

                              SIDNEY
                 Search him.

      The men look at Bond - wearing only swim trunks. Nobody moves.

                              SIDNEY
                 Do I have to do everything around here?

                              BOND
                 I hope so.

      Frowning, Sidney moves to Bond. As she REACHES INTO HIS TRUNKS, we
      cut to THEIR FACES. THEIR EYES ARE LOCKED ON EACH OTHER:

                              BOND
                 I hope you'll be gentle.

                              SIDNEY
                 Think about mom.

      BOND WINCES. She's goosed him.

                              BOND
                 ... Unusual technique.

      Returning to the WIDE SHOT, she opens the sack. SHOWS THE GOLD:

                              SIDNEY
                 And what do you call this?

                              BOND
                 - The family jewels?

      She scowls, takes out the URANIUM TOOTH. Looks at it, blankly, and
      holds it out to a TECHNICIAN, who examines it.

                              SIDNEY
                 What is this?

                              TECHNICIAN
                 ...I don't know. I'm not sure -

      Just then, a CREWMAN BURSTS IN:

                              CREWMAN
                 Boss! We got company - comin' up off
                 the starboard bow!

                              SIDNEY
                       (exiting, to Taro)
                 Bring them.

      Taro motions with his Uzi for Bond and Wade to follow...

      But BOND hesitates, LOOKING BACK AT THE TECHNICIAN with the URANIUM.
      007 wants to get it, but Taro nudges him out with the gun muzzle.

      EXT. MALACCA STRAIT - DAY

      A BRITISH NAVAL CUTTER is pulling alongside the barge - SEA SIREN
      WAILING, crew members in battle gear, FORWARD GATLING GUN manned.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (on bullhorn)
                 Attention sea barge: Lay down your
                 weapons, and prepare to be boarded.

      ON THE BARGE - Sidney and Co. stand, weapons ready.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Repeat: Lay down your weapons, and
                 prepare to be boarded.

      Bond turns to Sidney, who's grabbed a bullhorn of her own.

                              BOND
                 If I were you -

                              SIDNEY
                 - You're not.

                              BOND
                       (as she hoists the bullhorn)
                 Just remember: They think there's ten
                 billion dollars in gold down there.

                              SIDNEY
                 Thank you.
                       (clicks it on, and:)
                 "Now hear this: Drop dead."

      Bond and Wade exchange an amused/helpless glance - as if they both
      know what's coming next. There's a pause, then -

      THE CRUISER'S GATLING GUN ERUPTS WITH AN EARDRUM-SHATTERING SALVO.
      It's only a warning shot, but -

      EVERYONE ON THE BARGE DIVES FOR THE DECK... Except for Bond and
      Wade, who might as well be having tea. Bond looks down at Taro,
      cowering on the boards.

                              BOND
                 Gatling gun beats Uzi.

      NEW ANGLE - (CUTTER/BARGE) - DAY

      An ARMED BOARDING PARTY is coming across an aluminum bridge that has
      extended from the Cutter onto the barge.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (a tiny popinjay)
                 Who's in charge here?

                              SIDNEY
                 I am. What do you want?

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 You have precisely one minute to pull
                 up your anchor and be under way.

                              SIDNEY
                 Forget it. No way. I got here first.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (ignoring her)
                 Who's Wade?

                              WADE
                 That would be me -

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (snidely)
                 Thanks for your message.
                       (turns to)
                 And you're Bond?

                              BOND
                 Yes -

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Guard! Arrest these men! Escort
                 them to the cutter!

      Bond and Wade are stunned. The Marines move in. Bond struggles -

                              BOND
                 Wait a minute -

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Get them out of here. If he says one
                 word, shoot him.

      As TWO MARINES with automatic rifles take Bond and Wade across the
      folding bridge -

                              SIDNEY
                       (demanding)
                 What's your name?

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Captain Morton.

      Pause. She expects him to ask "And yours?" but he doesn't.

                              SIDNEY
                 My name is Sidney Winch, and -

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Good for you, Miss Winch. You now
                 have exactly 30 seconds to get this
                 rust bucket out of here.

                              SIDNEY
                       (furiously)
                 I know my rights. These are
                 international waters. The British
                 Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm
                 claiming it. Under international
                 law, I have the right to salvage
                 what's on that wreck.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should
                 consider hiring an attorney.

                              SIDNEY
                 I was an attorney!

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above
                 that profession.
                       (beat)
                 Ten seconds. Are you leaving?

                              SIDNEY
                 No.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 You leave me no alternative.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (upholstering a walkie-talkie)
                 Cut her anchor.

      As Sidney yells "NO!" - THE FORWARD GATLING GUN erupts to life. One
      short, bone rattling burst CUTS THE CHAIN.

                              SIDNEY
                 You won't get away with this!

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (stepping onto the bridge)
                 Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you
                 to get some steam up - before you run
                 aground.

      As she floats away, Sidney calls out to the Captain, Bond and Wade:

                              SIDNEY
                 You bastards! Believe me - you
                 haven't heard the last of me!

      EXT. DECK - THE CUTTER - DAY -

      Bond, Wade and the Captain.

                              WADE
                 - Nice trick with the arrest. Very convincing.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 It's no trick, Mr. Wade. I've got
                 half a mind to throw both of you in
                 the brig.

                              BOND
                 Don't you think you're overreacting?

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (with great sarcasm)
                 Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard
                 all about you, sir. You were under
                 direct orders to act as an observer -
                 and yet you had to go off, on your own,
                 like some half-assed CIA cowboy -
                       (Wade reacts)
                 Endangering the gold, attracting that
                 lunatic woman, and then putting in a
                 distress call for us to save your
                 bloody hide.

                              BOND
                       (Calmly)
                 ...That's all well and good, Captain,
                 save for one thing:
                       (beat)
                 There's no gold down there.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 What are you talking about? We went
                 through all this and the ship isn't
                 even down there?

                              BOND
                 Yes, the ship is down there. But the
                 gold is gone.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 That's absurd! It took two squads of
                 forty men fifteen days to load that
                 gold.

                              BOND
                 I know what I saw -

                              CAPTAIN
                 I don't care what you think you saw.
                 You're a damned amateur.
                       (beat)
                 Just get off my ship. Go back to
                 your trench-coats and your code names
                 - and leave the job to professionals.

                              BOND
                       (exchanges a glance with Wade, then)
                 Aye-aye, Captain.

      EXT. SPORT FISHING BOAT - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

      As Bond and Wade push away from the Naval Cutter:

                              WADE
                 Where to now, Jimbo?

                              BOND
                       (thinking)
                 I'm not certain... But I think
                 there's someone I want to press for
                 some answers in Kuala Lumpur.

      EXT. COASTAL ROADWAY - MALAYSIA - (BOND CAR) - DAY -

      Bond'- car travels through the tropical landscape, turning at a sign
      for Kuala Lumpur.

      INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - COASTAL ROADWAY - DAY -

      As Bond downshifts in anticipation of an upcoming hill, his CAR PHONE
      RINGS. Before answering it, he looks down at:

      INSERT - DASHBOARD - DIGITAL DISPLAY PANEL -

      Displayed on separate lines:, "INCOMING CALL." "ORIGIN: (the display
      runs through numbers until it hits on) 763-4733." "NAME: (blinking)
      UNKNOWN. "STATUS: (blinking) SECURE."

      RETURN ON BOND -

      Reacting - the information is curious. Bond picks up the phone.

                              BOND
                 Bond.

                              HARMSWAY'S VOICE
                 Hello, Mister Bond.

                              BOND
                       (with an edge)
                 Who is this?

      INT. HARMSWAY'S OUTER OFFICE -

      Harmsway is perched on a desk. In the background, THROUGH HIS OPEN
      OFFICE DOOR, we can see Harmsway's EXECUTIVE SECRETARY serving
      someone coffee from a SILVER TRAY - but we can't see who it is.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Elliot Harmsway! I heard you were in
                 K.L. and thought we might get
                 together for a chat...

      RETURN ON BOND - (INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING) -

                              HARMSWAY (Cont'd, O.S.)
                 We seemed to get off on the wrong
                 foot back there in Venice.

                              BOND
                 How did you get this number?

      INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the
                 information age! Information is
                 currency - and with the right currency,
                 you can have any piece of information.
                       (Bond reacts, sourly)
                 Besides I own the phone company. What
                 do you say? Twenty minutes?

                              BOND
                 I'm on my way.

      Bond hangs up, and drives with renewed determination.

      INT. HARMSWAY'S OUTER OFFICE -

      Harmsway hangs up; STAMPER is standing nearby. Harmsway throws a
      concerned glance at his office, then turns to Stamper:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Let's find out exactly what he knows.

      EXT. KUALA LUMPUR - ROADWAY -(BOND CAR) - LATE AFTERNOON -

      Bond's car approaches the camera, passes it, and heads for HARMSWAY
      TOWERS, looming over Kuala Lumpur in the distance.

      EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - STREET LEVEL - LATE AFTERNOON -

      Bond's car passes the front of the building, and drives down a ramp
      into an underground car park.

      INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - (HARMSWAY TOWERS) -

      Passing NEWSPAPER LOADING DOCKS (with trucks displaying both the
      "TOMORROW" and "HNN" logos, and HUM-VEES used by building security,)
      Bond pulls into the VALET AREA -

      Where a cheerful YOUNG PR WOMAN and VALET wait. Both wear the
      colorful BLAZER used by all Harmsway Building service personnel.

                              BOND
                       (from inside the car)
                 James Bond to see Elliot Harmsway.

                              PR WOMAN
                 Yes. I'm to bring you right up. The
                 valet will take your car -

                              BOND
                 I'd prefer to park it myself.
                       (off her questioning look)
                 Temperamental. Practically has a
                 mind of its own.

                              PR WOMAN
                 Don't they all?

      She points to a spot near the loading docks. Bond drives off.

      INT. BOND'S CAR -

      Bond backs into the space, thinking about the (inevitable) quick get-
      away. He looks through the windshield, surveying the area.

      BOND'S POV - UNDERGROUND CAR PARK -

      TWO BURLY SECURITY GUARDS (in Harmsway Blazers,) stand behind a
      bulletproof security desk. There's a METAL DETECTOR by the door.

      BACK TO SCENE (INT. BOND'S CAR) -

      Reaching inside his jacket, Bond REMOVES HIS GUN, and HIDES IT in a
      compartment under the dashboard.

      INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK -

      The PR WOMAN joins Bond as he locks the car with the REMOTE CONTROL.

                              PR WOMAN
                 Right this way.

      Following her through the metal detector, Bond scans the security
      devices at the guard's desk: Lots of cameras, sensors, and alarms.

      EXT. PRESSROOM OBSERVATION ARCADE -

      Bond and the PR Woman step off an escalator onto an open arcade with
      GLASS WINDOWS looking down into a mammoth NEWSPAPER PRINTING PLANT.

                              PR WOMAN
                       (moving to a door)
                 Mr. Harmsway is checking the afternoon
                 editions. If you'll just follow me -

      INT. PRESSROOM BALCONY -

      The NOISE FROM THE PRINTING PRESSES is deafening. Bond and the PR
      WOMAN walk down a METAL STAIRCASE to the pressroom floor, where -

      Harmsway (wearing a printer's smock and newsprint cap,) is joking
      with SEVERAL PRESSMEN - a fresh issue of "Tomorrow" outstretched in
      his hands.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (spotting Bond, yelling:)
                 Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.

                              BOND
                 Sir Elliot.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Come. Let's get out of the noise.
                       (escorting Bond off)
                 - I'll give you a tour of the
                 building, then we'll talk.

      INT. DRESSING ALCOVE - OFF THE PRESSROOM -

      Harmsway is hanging up his smock in the short hallway that leads from
      the press room to an elevator. There's a SINK in the room.

                              HARMSWAY
                 It's funny, Mr. Bond. Of all the
                 things I own, nothing gives me as
                 much enjoyment as my newspapers.

      He moves to the sink to wash his hands. Turns on the faucets:

                              HARMSWAY (cont'd)
                 Ironic, isn't it? In the age of TV, I
                 still can't get the ink out of my veins.

      Bond SMILES WRYLY, looking at Harmsway hunched over the sink:

                              BOND
                 Yes... A man with ink in his veins,
                 and blood on his hands.

      Harmsway smiles to himself, acknowledging the jibe... But decides to
      ignore it. He turns off the faucet, dries his hands -

                              HARMSWAY
                 We print 31 newspapers here; another
                 two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite
                 plants around the world.

      He pulls on his £2000 Saville Row suit-jacket.

                              BOND
                 ... And how many of those newspapers
                 carried Paris Harmsway's obituary?

      Harmsway turns, and presses the ELEVATOR BUTTON. The doors open,
      instantly. HE SMILES:

                              HARMSWAY
                 All of them, Mister Bond...
                       (motioning inside)
                 After you?

      INT. ELEVATOR -

      The doors close. Bond clocks the security camera in the ceiling.
      Harmsway is about to take great delight in making Bond squirm:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Before I became involved with Paris,
                 she was always involved with the most
                 inappropriate' men...
                       (beat)
                 Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle
                 aged Peter Pans who only brought out
                 the worst in her.

                              BOND
                 I see.

                              HARMSWAY
                 I tried to save her. But she remained a
                 manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate
                 behavior... Delusions of grandeur.

                              BOND
                 I wonder if it runs in the family.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (bursts out in a laugh)
                 The only difference between a
                 psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is
                 the degree of success.

      He looks up at the digital readout, going from 40 to 50.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Still, I do miss her. I only wish
                 she could have lived to see all this.

                              BOND
                 I can feel your pain.

      The doors open:

                              HARMSWAY
                 By the way - what is it that brings
                 you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?

                              BOND
                 Sightseeing.

      Harmsway motions for Bond to exit. They step out into:

      INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY ("ROGUES GALLERY") - LATE AFTERNOON

      A short hallway lined with OIL PORTRAITS of Harmsway's ancestors.
      Double doors at both ends. (People passing through.) As they walk -

                              HARMSWAY
                 I call this the Rogue's gallery.

                              BOND
                 Yes. I can see: You've hung the
                 rest of your relatives.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (pointing to the first portrait)
                 My third great Uncle - the Earl of
                 Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of
                 Hong Kong from the Chinese.
                       (moving to)
                 His son-in-law - George Harmsway -
                 made the first family fortune,
                 running opium into Shanghai...
                       (moving to)
                 His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking
                 the opium...
                 And my grandfather Henry, who opened the
                 first telegraph station, and published
                 the colony's first English newspaper.
                       (pausing, wistfully)
                 It was a city of unlimited possibility.

                              BOND
                 So why did you leave?

                              HARMSWAY
                 Because it's a dying city. Since the
                 Chinese take-over, who knows what can
                 happen tomorrow?
                       (moving to the last two portraits)
                 In any case, this is my father, Charles: A
                 royal bastard who started the first radio
                 and television stations. Said I'd never
                 amount to anything, but...
                       (passing his own portrait)
                 I turned it into this

      He pushes through a door, into:

      INT. HNN NEWS CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON -

      A cavernous THREE STORY ROOM bristling with activity. At the center
      is the main HNN ANCHOR DESK, (where a news broadcast is in progress,)
      surrounded by scores of reporter's desks a la CNN.

      Around the perimeter of the room are VARIOUS TV STUDIOS looking out
      on Kuala Lumpur. All are broadcasting: A Larry King-type chat show;
      MTV; SPORTS; a KITCHEN where a chef is preparing something flambeed.

      With its walls of monitors, equipment, and control rooms, the effect
      is overwhelming. Harmsway will walk Bond around the perimeter:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.
                       (starting to walk)
                 Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his
                 legions; I have my divisions:
                       (pointing)
                 News, sports, business, entertainment.
                 And these are my foot soldiers:
                       (a wave of his hand)
                 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed
                 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87
                 magazines, and 29 different cable TV
                 channels - in 35 languages.

                              BOND
                 And still not a thing to watch.

      He glances at the SATELLITE CONTROL ROOM, with a NASA-type WORLD MAP.

                              BOND
                 ...Although it must be fun to have
                 all those satellites.

                              HARMSWAY
                 They're merely tools to disseminate
                 information.

                              BOND
                       (wryly)
                 Or disinformation... If you wanted to,
                 say, beam down a signal to send a ship
                 off course? Maybe one degree a minute?

                              HARMSWAY
                       (guffaws)
                 Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I
                 should buy it for a book! It's
                 totally preposterous, but -
                       (off Bond's reaction)
                 You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I
                 can amuse you.

      He stops at a VIDEO TERMINAL. Begins to type.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Let's see... First we have this
                 James Bond... I believe he's a field
                 adjuster for Lloyd's of London...

      INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S MI-6 COVER -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Then we have this James Bond.

      INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S KGB FILE -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (reading from the screen)
                 ... Licensed to Kill...
                       (aside)
                 Not a bad title for that book...
                       (then)
                 Or perhaps you'd prefer this James Bond -

      INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S CHINESE FILE -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Who I believe they call "007."

      Bond is not amused. Harmsway is enjoying himself:

                              HARMSWAY
                 You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both
                 men of action. But your era is passing.
                 Words are the new weapons; satellites the
                 new artillery. And make no mistake about
                 it: In the right hands, they can be as
                 deadly as your Walther PPK.

                              BOND
                 ...Words to live by?

                              HARMSWAY
                 Your choice.
                       (glancing at his watch)
                 Look at the time! Come. There's
                 someone I want you meet - about a
                 story I'm thinking of publishing.

      As they leave, Bond is frustrated by Harmsway's "I don't care what
      you think you know - I can crush you" attitude... And now, Harmsway
      plans (and the operative word here is plans,) to use Bond, to tie off
      the one other loose thread in his perfect crime:

      INT. HARMSWAY'S OFFICE -

      The DOOR opens and Harmsway enters, followed by Bond. He calls to
      someone we don't see:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Hello, dear. I'm sorry I took so long -

      REVEAL: SIDNEY is sitting across from his desk.

                              SIDNEY
                 That's okay, Uncle Ell -

      She freezes in mid-sentence, seeing Bond. Bond is equally surprised.

                              SIDNEY
                 What is HE doing here?

                              HARMSWAY
                 I see you two have met.

                              BOND
                 Briefly.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (crossing to his desk)
                 Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him
                 here hoping he might shed some light
                 on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of
                 London.'
                       (sly glance to Bond)
                 ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?

                              SIDNEY
                 He's not going to tell the truth! He
                 was diving for the gold!

      Harmsway sits, and addresses Bond, matter-of-factly:

                              HARMSWAY
                 It seems - Mr. Bond - that Miss Winch
                 has told me the most incredible story: A
                 sunken British warship filled with gold;
                 a British cutter firing on her; billions
                 of dollars in bullion lying on the
                 bottom of the Strait.

      Bond isn't enjoying this charade.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Obviously, the British government
                 denies all of this -

                              SIDNEY
                 - I told you! He was there! -

                              HARMSWAY
                 - But as I've explained to Sidney,
                 without proof, there's just no story.
                 Don't you agree Mr. Bond?

      Before Bond can answer -

                              SIDNEY
                 But I have proof! You ran out of here
                 so fast, I didn't get to show you.

      Bond and Harmsway react - with entirely different concerns: Harmsway
      wasn't expecting her to have proof; Bond knows that if she shows him
      the gold, (or worse, the uranium tooth,) Harmsway will probably kill
      both of them to destroy the evidence, and witnesses.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (forcing a smile)
                 ...And what's that, my dear?

                              BOND
                 Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -

      Sidney cuts Bond off, DROPPING THE GOLD BAR on Harmsway's desk.

                              SIDNEY
                 He brought that up from the wreck.

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...I see.

      Alarmed, Bond wants to stop Sidney from reaching into her bag again -

                              BOND
                 Sidney, I wouldn't -

      Too late. She drops the uranium tooth on his desk.

                              SIDNEY
                 And what about this? Any idea what this is?

      Silence. Harmsway and Bond exchange a sober look. Then:

                              HARMSWAY
                 ... I believe it's a depleted uranium
                 drill bit, my dear.

      HE PRESSES AN ALARM UNDER HIS DESK. Bond reaches for the DRILL TOOTH.

                              BOND
                 Why don't we just take these -

                              SIDNEY
                       (blocking him)
                 No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.

      Harmsway stands, comes around the desk:

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...Well! I do believe this requires
                 further investigation!

                              SIDNEY
                 Thank you, Uncle Elliot.

                              HARMSWAY
                 No matter what the British government
                 says, I won't kill this story.
                       (his secretary appears in the doorway)
                 Miss Oxford will show both of you to
                 the elevator... And one of my people
                 will definitely be in touch sooner
                 than later.

                              BOND
                 I'm sure they will.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Good-bye, Mister Bond.

      He reaches to kiss Sidney - and looks in her eyes a second too long.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Good-bye, darling.

      Watching them exit, his smile turns hard and bitter.

      INT. ELEVATOR HALLWAY - DAY -

      As the Executive Secretary escorts them to the elevator, Bond glances
      out the PICTURE WINDOW, with its view of the other tower.

                              EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
                 Thank you both for coming in...

      BOND'S POV - EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS -

      Five floors directly down is the GLASS-ENCLOSED SKY BRIDGE; just
      above him, he sees TWO WINDOW WASHERS being pulled up on a TWO MAN
      SCAFFOLD.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      A CHIME SOUNDS; the elevator doors open. Bond and Sidney ad-lib
      good-byes to the secretary and get in.

      INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

      Sidney presses the button for "1". Bond glances at the FLOOR INDI-
      CATOR with reads "55" - clocks the SECURITY CAMERA - and starts
      looking for an ESCAPE PANEL. Sidney watches out of the corner of her
      eye, thinking he's nuts.

                              BOND
                       (glancing at the security camera)
                 ... Do you have a gun?

                              SIDNEY
                 What?

                              BOND
                       (yanking it down)
                 You heard me. A gun?
                       (disabling it)
                 I left mine in the car.

                              SIDNEY
                 That's funny: you struck me as the kind
                 of man who always carries protection.

                              BOND
                 Listen to me! I'm a British secret
                 service agent. And we have about two
                 minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.

      He glances up at the escape panel at the rear of the car.

                              SIDNEY
                 Has anyone ever suggested that you're
                 a paranoid psychotic?

      Bond ignores the insult, explaining as he moves under the panel:

                              BOND
                 Harmsway sank that ship and stole the
                 gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.
                       (boosting himself up)
                 And thanks to your little show and tell -
                       (straining to open the panel)
                 - giving him the evidence -
                       (popping it open)
                 We're the only ones who can tie him
                 to the crime.

                              SIDNEY
                 Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!

                              BOND
                 Blood or Dutch?

                              SIDNEY
                 He was my father's best friend!

                              BOND
                 He's killed closer.

                              SIDNEY
                 You are seriously deranged.

                              BOND
                 Maybe. But why are we going up
                 instead of down?

      He nods to the FLOOR INDICATOR. She looks: 60, 65, 70. IT STOPS.
      Bond reaches down to her -

                              BOND
                 Sidney, come with me -

      THE DOORS OPEN. She looks at his outstretched hand with disdain:

                              SIDNEY
                 Not if my life depended on it.

      INT. 70TH FLOOR -- DAY

      Sidney comes out onto a floor still under construction. The elevator
      doors CLOSE behind her. To the right, she sees STAMPER and a
      Harmsway-blazered GUARD, with MACHINE PISTOLS.

                              SIDNEY
                 Thank God! He's crazy!

                              STAMPER
                 Does he have a gun?

                              SIDNEY
                 No.

      On Stamper's reply -

                              STAMPER
                 Good -

      He lunges for her, grabs her, spins her around, overwhelming her.
      She struggles, yelling:

                              SIDNEY
                 This is a mistake!

                              STAMPER
                       (gun against her skull)
                 Shut up!

      Using Sidney as a HUMAN SHIELD, Stamper marches her in front of the
      closed elevator doors. The guard follows. THEY POSITION THEMSELVES
      FOR A MASSACRE. Reaching around Sidney, Stamper pulls out his RADIO:

                              STAMPER (into radio)
                 Open 14.

      A beat. It opens. The men unleash a HAIL OF BULLETS, then realize -

      NEW ANGLE - (INT. ELEVATOR) -

      The car is empty. Stamper perplexed. Pushing Sidney in front of
      him, he enters the elevator, cautiously... When, suddenly:

      BOND SWINGS DOWN OUT OF THE ESCAPE PANEL (like an athlete on a high-
      bar) FEET FIRST - barely clearing Sidney's head as he KICKS Stamper
      and the Guard in their faces. They go flying backwards.

      Bond jumps down, grabs Sidney -

                              BOND
                 Need a lift?

      And boosts her into the escape panel, following her up.

      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE THE ELEVATOR - (CONTINUOUS) -

      Bond and Sidney rush forward to the front wall as -

      STAMPER AND THE GUARD -

      Recover, grab their guns, move to the threshold, and START RAKING THE
      CEILING WITH GUNFIRE.

      ELEVATOR SHAFT -

      Bond presses his body against Sidney, on the front wall, trying to
      SHIELD HER as BULLETS RIP UP THE FLOOR behind them. With his free
      hand, Bond reaches up for the LATCH to open the door above them.

      INT. ELEVATOR -

      Stamper stops shooting. Moves to the rear of the cab, under the
      escape panel. Peers up. Sees nothing. Turns to the Guard:

                              STAMPER
                 Help me up.

      ELEVATOR SHAFT -

      Stamper's head pokes up through the hole just as Bond and Sidney have
      disappeared into -

      INT. HALLWAY - (ELEVATOR BANK) - 71ST FLOOR.

      Squeezing out from between the elevator doors, (which immediately
      close behind them,) Bond and Sidney encounter a group of STUNNED
      OFFICE WORKERS, waiting for the elevator.

                              BOND
                       (to the office workers)
                 ... I'd try the stairs.

      As Bond and Sidney scamper off -

      RETURN ON STAMPER - IN THE ELEVATOR -

                              STAMPER
                       (rushing out)
                 The stairs!
                       (barking into his RADIO)
                 Attention all units! They're on the
                 71st floor!

      INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY - ANOTHER PART OF THE BUILDING -

      Harmsway is striding towards the SECURITY CENTER, RADIO in hand:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Stamper! They're not to leave this
                 building alive!

      BOND AND SIDNEY - (INT. HALLWAY) -

      Moving cautiously toward a CORNER of ANOTHER HALLWAY.

                              SIDNEY
                 This has got to be a mistake.

                              BOND
                 The only mistake is that they didn't
                 kill us in the elevator.

      At the corner, Bond STOPS, SEEING A GUARD, farther down the hall (his
      back to them) CHECKING DOORS.

                              BOND
                 Wait here.

                              SIDNEY
                 No. I'm going with you.

      Bond frowns, but doesn't have the time to argue. They start doing a
      "DUCK AND COVER" in and out of doorways TO SNEAK UP ON HIM.

      INT. SECURITY CENTER -

      Harmsway bursts in on GUARDS watching a WALL OF SECURITY MONITORS.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Where are they?

                              GUARD #1
                 I don't see them -
                       (scanning the monitors)
                 There!

      INSERT VIDEO MONITOR - (SURVEILLANCE SHOT OF HALLWAY) -

      Bond and Sidney have just come into frame, sneaking up on the GUARD.

                              HARMSWAY (OVER)
                 Warn him!

      CLOSE ON THE GUARD - (INT. HALLWAY) -

                              VOICE ON RADIO
                 Porter! They're behind you -

                              GUARD
                       (lifting the radio to reply)
                 Roger! Over and -

      BAM. BOND DECKS HIM.

                              BOND
                 Out.

      Bond kneels, grabs the GUARD'S MACHINE PISTOL, and CLIPS, just as -

                              SIDNEY
                 JAMES!

      TWO GUARDS have entered from a STAIRCASE DOOR, hoisting MAC-10's. In
      an instant: (1) Bond lets go a BURST. (2) The Guards SHOOT back,
      diving for cover in the staircase door. (3) Bond rolls, (4) Pushes
      Sidney into an open DOORWAY, and (5) returns A BURST, from -

      INT. SMALL KITCHEN/COPIER ROOM -

      Sidney is shaken. As Bond stands in the doorway, guarding them -

                              SIDNEY
                 Okay. So it wasn't a mistake.
                       (Bond lets go a blast)
                 What do we do now? Offer them
                 dinner?!?!

      Bond glances back at the KITCHEN SUPPLIES. GETS AN IDEA. He sud-
      denly TWISTS, SMASHING the BUTT OF HIS GUN down on some GLASSWARE on
      the counter, then TWISTS BACK, returning a BURST OF GUNFIRE.

                              BOND
                 Come here. You shoot. I'll cook.

      She thinks he's nuts, but squeezes next to him. Handing her the gun:

                              BOND
                 Aim that way.

      Sidney scowls - as Bond moves off-camera - when suddenly, BULLET HITS
      RIP UP THE DOOR FRAME. She jumps, TERRIFIED.

      Bond looks at her from the PHOTO-COPYING MACHINE, where he is YANKING
      OUT the TONER CARTRIDGE. He offers a simple piece of advice:

                              BOND
                 Shoot back!

      Sidney frowns... Turns... And as she LETS THE GUN RIP, we cut to:

      INT. STAIRWELL - (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING) -

      Stamper, running up steps with the guard. They exit into:

      A SHORT SERVICE HALLWAY - 71ST. FLOOR -

      They rush though it, bursting through a door into:

      THE ELEVATOR BANK HALLWAY -

      Stamper and the Guard start hunting Bond.

      RETURN ON SIDNEY (HALLWAY/KITCHEN) -

      As she continues to exchange fire with the guards...

      BOND, (having broken the toner cartridge open,) is DUMPING THE TONER
      in a coffee can. He reaches for a BOX of sugar

                              BOND
                 One second -

      And (with GUNFIRE SFX over,) Bond sweeps the BROKEN DISH into the
      can, and drops his Q LIGHTER in the mix.

      He moves to Sidney, in the doorway. Kneels. In-between shots:

                              BOND
                 ... How did you get into marine
                 salvage?

                              SIDNEY
                       (gun burst, then)
                 My father left me the business.

      Bond glances at his watch, timing the bomb. The guards shoot; she
      shoots back, then explains:

                              SIDNEY
                 I used to be a divorce lawyer in New
                 York City.

      Bond nods, continuing to look at his watch. Glances at her:

                              BOND
                 Not a lot of difference.

                              SIDNEY
                 What do you mean?

      Bond reaches forward to toss the coffee can -

                              BOND
                 Either way, you're taking the goods
                 from dead hulks.

      He tosses the can, and PULLS HER BACKWARDS, covering her.

      NEW ANGLE - THE HALLWAY -

      The GUARDS spring from the door, rushing forward to storm Bond's
      position - just as the COFFEE CAN rolls towards them, and EXPLODES.

      RETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN -

                              BOND
                 Let's go -

      Taking the gun, the two of them start for the door when -

      NEW ANGLE - OPPOSITE END OF THE HALLWAY - CORNER -

      Stamper and the GUARD have arrived at the corner, BLASTING.

      RETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN -

                              BOND
                 Damn!

      Swiftly, Bond grabs a JUG of CLEANER from under the sink, moves to
      the door, and ROLLS IT DOWN THE HALL in Stamper's direction.

      STAMPER AND THE GUARD - (HALLWAY CORNER) -

      Anticipate a bomb. They move back.

      BOND AND SIDNEY (INT. KITCHEN) -

                              SIDNEY
                 What the hell does that do?

                              BOND
                 Cleans dirt. Let's go.

      INT. HALLWAY -

      Bond and Sidney BREAK for the STAIRCASE DOOR. (Where the first Guards
      were shooting at them from.) TWISTING AROUND, Bond lets a BURST go
      in Stamper's direction, as he stoops to scoop up one of the dead
      guards' MAC-l0's.

      INSERT - BOND'S BULLETS RIP UP THE JUG OF CLEANER.

      BOND AND SIDNEY ESCAPE FROM THE HALLWAY -

      STAMPER -

      Cowers, waiting for the jug to blow up... Then realizes:

                              STAMPER
                 It's a trick! After him.
                       (into his radio, on the run)
                 They're in the south stairwell!

      HARMSWAY, IN THE SECURITY CENTER -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Get more men up there!

      INT. STAIRWELL - LANDING -

                              SIDNEY
                 Down?

      Bond leans over the railing. Sees GUARDS coming UP. SHOOTS.

                              BOND
                 Up.

      They go up about three stairs, and Sidney sees GUARDS descending.

                              SIDNEY
                 Down?

                              BOND
                       (shoots, then)
                 Up.

      Bond and Sidney bound up the stairs through a METAL DOOR, just as -

      INT. HALLWAY -

      Stamper and the Guard bound down the hallway, heading for the door.

      INT. SECURITY CENTER -

      Harmsway smiles, watching Bond on a monitor:

                              HARMSWAY
                 ... And so much for that.
                       (into radio)
                 They're on the 72nd floor set-back.
                       (explains to the guards)
                 Nowhere to go.

      EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TERRACE SETBACK - TWILIGHT -

      It's magic hour as Bond and Sidney rush out onto the setback. Bond
      sees a WINDOW WASHER'S RIG. And although Sidney asks -

                              SIDNEY
                 Now what?

      Bond's first concern is to make sure Stamper can't get them. Amidst
      a pile of CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT, he spots a PNEUMATIC NAIL GUN. He
      grabs it, and -

      BANG. BANG. BANG. He fires 3 NAILS through the door into the frame.

                              BOND
                 That should buy us some time.

      Now, Bond moves to the WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - a two-man bucket-like
      scaffold ON TRACKS, with TWO LEATHER SAFETY HARNESSES inside, and a
      LARGE CABLE SPOOL/MOTOR that stays on the roof.

      Approaching it, Bond looks over the side:

      BOND'S POV - LOOKING DOWN FROM 72ND FLOOR -

      Twenty stories below is the sky bridge. 50 stories below that, the
      ground. It's a long, long, way down.

      RETURN ON BOND - AT THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - TERRACE SET-BACK -

                              BOND
                 Help me move this.

      INT. STAIRWELL -

      Darting up the few steps, Stamper and Guards arrive at the door. He
      tries to open it. Won't budge.

                              GUARD
                 I'll call for a battering ram -

                              STAMPER
                 No. Get the fire ax.

      One of the guards grabs it from inside a FIRE CABINET. He hands the
      AX to Stamper, who takes the first SWING AT THE DOOR.

      RETURN ON BOND - TERRACE SET-BACK - EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

      Bond is positioning the window washer rig. He explains:

                              BOND
                 We'll go down close to the sky bridge.
                 We may be able to swing over and use it
                 for cover.

      As Bond climbs into the bucket, Sidney peers over the side.

                              SIDNEY
                 No way. I sail. I do not fly.

      BANG! Behind them, Stamper's AX HAS JUST PENETRATED THE DOOR.

                              BOND
                 ... Sometimes, you just have to take
                 the plunge.

      Bond yanks her in, flips switches on the control pod, and starts
      down, as fast as they can go.

      EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - AERIAL -

      Bond and Sidney descend. Tiny specs against the sunset.

      INT. STAIRCASE -

      Stamper gives the last few chops to the door. He kicks it open.

      EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR -

      Stamper and the guards rush to the ledge.

      BOND AND SIDNEY - DESCENDING ON THE RIG - 60TH FLOOR -

      Bond, looking up - for Stamper - and down - to check their progress.

                              SIDNEY
                 All I know is one thing: If we get
                 out of here alive, that gold is mine.
                       (beat)
                 I've earned it.

      Looking upward, Bond SEES STAMPER peering over the rail. BOND FIRES.

                              BOND
                 One thing at a time.

      EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - TWILIGHT -

      Stamper jumps back from the ledge, enraged. Ax in hand, he moves to
      the WINDOW WASHING RIG'S MACHINERY -

      And takes a roundhouse swing at the UNSPOOLING CABLE - but instead of
      cutting it, the ax BOUNCES OFF, and the RIG SLIDES ON ITS TRACKS.

      THE RIG - (STILL DESCENDING) -

      Swings! Sidney SCREAMS - almost falling out. Bond grabs her. They
      are now 5 STORIES DIRECTLY ABOVE THE SKY BRIDGE, swaying like a giant
      pendulum - although still descending.

      RETURN ON STAMPER - TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

      Having failed at the cable, Stamper goes at the PULLEY feeding it.
      He swings. Swings again. With each blow, the pulley shaft weakens.

      BOND AND SIDNEY - (WINDOW WASHER'S RIG) -

      Dropping in VIOLENT SPURTS - just trying to stay in the damn bucket.

      STAMPER - WIELDING THE AX -

      Finally, the pulley shaft SHATTERS. THE CABLE GRINDS TO A HALT.

      BOND AND SIDNEY -

      are stopped about 20 feet above the sky bridge.

                              SIDNEY
                       (panicked, anxious, fast)
                 What now? And don't give me some
                 movie cliché like 'trust me.'

                              BOND
                       (what the hell)
                 Trust me.

      And with this, he turns, and SHOOTS OUT the adjacent WINDOW.

                              BOND
                 Let's go -

      But as he starts to climb out - SIDNEY SCREAMS! THE CABLE SUDDENLY
      DROPS THEM 10 FEET LOWER, BELOW THE WINDOW.

      THE TERRACE SET-BACK -

      Stamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum. It's coming loose
      from its moorings.

      BOND AND SIDNEY -

      look down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge - facing what
      (she thinks) is certain death:

                              SIDNEY
                 We're going to bounce off that thing!

      Bond looks up - assuming they have only seconds left before Stamper
      cuts the cable. HE GRABS HER:

                              BOND
                 Hold on!

      TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

      Stamper takes a final swing at the cable drum. With a GREAT CLAT-
      TERING SOUND it SNAPS FREE OF THE MOORINGS, smashes into the wall,
      and the whole mechanism CAREENS OVER THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING.

      THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG -

      Bond and Sidney feel the cable give way. They start to free-fall.

      BOND - FIRES HIS MACHINE PISTOL at the glass top of the sky bridge.

      THE BULLETS SHATTER THE GLASS -

      BOND AND SIDNEY CRASH THROUGH, INTO -

      INT. 50TH FLOOR SKY BRIDGE -

      Landing on the deck of the bridge. Bond rolls to his feet as -

      Fifty stories of cable from above is falling onto the deck. Bond
      yanks Sidney to the side of the building, just as THE CABLE DRUM,
      PULLEY, AND THE REST OF THE MECHANICS CRASH ON THE WALK-WAY.

      72ND FLOOR TERRACE SET-BACK -

      Looking down, Stamper flips open his radio.

                              STAMPER
                       (over radio)
                 They're on the bridge. Seal off the
                 50th floor!

      INT. SECURITY CENTER -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (looking at the monitors)
                 I should have hired this man.
                       (to his guards)
                 Get somebody up there!

      INT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -

      Bond is moving to the window washer rig debris.

                              SIDNEY
                 What about the elevators?

      He steps to the side of the bridge, and looks at the railings: Four
      inch pipe. Bond begins to work feverishly:

                              BOND
                 We tried that already. Remember?

      Bond picks up the cable and the leather harnesses.

                              SIDNEY
                 You know, this is as much your fault
                 as it is mine.

      Bond is slipping the cable around the railing pipe. One loop.

                              BOND
                 Sidney, we don't have time for this -

      He pulls on the loop to test it. Good enough. Makes a second loop.

                              SIDNEY
                 Sure! Just when I want to talk -
                       (beat)
                 Not that I would have believed you -

      Bond tests the second loop. He's satisfied. Turns to her:

                              BOND
                 Put your back to the railing. Sit up
                 on it.

                              SIDNEY
                       (doing it)
                 Are you listening to me?

                              BOND
                 Put your arms around my neck. Lock
                 your legs around my waist.

                              SIDNEY
                 ... We have time for that?

      Just then, GUARDS APPEAR OUT OF FAR ELEVATOR DOOR. Running, THEY
      SHOOT. BOND FIRES A BURST BACK as - A NEW ROUND OF BULLET HITS
      BEGINS TO RAIN DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE.

      BOND LOOKS UP: Stamper has commandeered a second window washer's
      rig, and is descending, FIRING AT THEM.

      Bond looks at Sidney -

                              BOND
                 Sometimes you just have to -

                              SIDNEY
                 Don't say it.

      She locks her arms and legs around him, he snaps the leather harness
      around her waist, and they roll over the railing Amidst gunfire.

      EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - TWILIGHT

      Bond and Sidney fall from the bridge - 50 stories up.

      They go down,

      And down,

      And down -

      RETURN ON THE RAILING - (INT. SKY BRIDGE) -

      The cable looped around the railing is slowing their descent; the
      PAINT ON THE RAILING IS BURNING OFF, and the STEEL itself is STARTING
      TO SMOKE from the friction.

      BOND AND SIDNEY - DROPPING -

      Dropping -

      And Dropping.

      Looking to the ground, Bond sees the PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION BALCONY
      coming up fast from below. It looks like they're going to get
      splattered on the tile floor, when -

      RETURN ON THE RAILING - SKY BRIDGE -

      The cable comes to the end of its run! It DRAGS THE SPOOL, THE
      BUCKET, and all the other MECHANICS to the side of the bridge,
      SMASHING AGAINST THE WALL, JAMMING AGAINST THE RAILING.

      EXT. THE PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION BALCONY - TWILIGHT -

      Bond and Sidney jerk to a halt. They're swinging about five feet
      from the balcony. There's a pause...

                              SIDNEY
                 Is this - like - a normal day for you?

                              BOND
                 It's a lousy job, but -
                       (reaching for the balcony)
                 The only reason I stay is for the
                 health benefits.

      Bond PULLS THEM OVER TO THE BALCONY.

      INT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -

      Stamper lands on bridge. He unbuckles his harness, runs to railing,
      looks down and sees SIDNEY AND BOND climbing out onto the balcony,
      going for the PRESS ROOM DOOR.

                              STAMPER
                       (into his radio)
                 They're heading for the press room.
                 Stop them!

      INT. PRESS ROOM -

      Bond and Sidney enter at the top of the metal stairs Bond came down
      earlier to meet Harmsway.

      The Presses are running full blast; the noise is deafening.

      At the "start" end of the presses - where the paper is fed in - Bond
      sees a GIANT ROLL OF NEWSPRINT on a CRANE, about to be loaded.

      Directly beyond this is the door to the elevator/wash-up room where
      Bond and Harmsway exited earlier. -

      Coming out of that DOOR, Bond sees THREE GUARDS in Harmsway Blazers
      carrying guns.

      BOND shoots the HOOK on the CRANE CARRYING THE NEWSPRINT ROLL.

      It CRASHES TO THE GROUND, rolling backwards on the guards. As they
      start scrambling around it -

      Bond and Sidney race down the stairs, turning in the opposite direc-
      tion (toward the finishing end of the press, near the garage...)

      They encounter a GORILLA-SIZED PRESSMAN, with an oversized crowbar.

      Bond and the Pressman square off. Bond tries to get around him. The
      man lifts his crowbar to smash Bond with it. Bond tries to block the
      descending crowbar with his gun - but the crowbar snaps it in half.

      Bond and the Pressman engage in a short, furious fight - throwing
      each other against the side of the press...

      Which ends when Bond finally gets the upper hand for a second, and
      pushes the man back, into a pile of INK DRUMS. Momentarily stunned,
      Bond forces the man's head into an OPEN INK DRUM -

      And as he comes up, COVERED WITH INK, gasping for air, Sidney bops
      him on the head with the crowbar.

      Now, Bond and Sidney take off, toward the garage/exit -

      But one of the Guards (from the crashing roll of newsprint) darts out
      from between the banks of the printing press, tripping Bond.

      Bond stumbles, face down - then spins over, kicking up at the Guard
      as he comes to finish Bond off.

      The Guard stumbles backward -

      Crashing against a NEWSPAPER BALING MACHINE. (A large machine that
      wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery.)

      Rushing the man, Bond struggles with him - and manages to FLIP the
      BALING SWITCH - literally tying the man up. The only problem is that
      as Bond turns -

      The LAST GUARD has Sidney in a choke-hold; he's aiming a gun at Bond.
      Seemingly at once, (1) Sidney bites the Guard's forearm, (2) Bond
      ducks, (3) the Guard shoots wildly, (4) the gun drops, and (5) -

      Bond rushes the man, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARDS INTO THE PRINTING PRESS,
      pulling Sidney away at the last moment.

      The Guard is sucked up in the press rollers, and...

      The pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn BRIGHT RED.

                              BOND
                 He was bad news.

      Spotting more Guards coming down the far staircase, Bond grabs Sidney
      and the gun, and runs to the NEWSPAPER DELIVERY CHUTE.

                              BOND
                 Down there!

      They jump into it, sliding down, and around an ALUMINUM CHUTE into:

      INT. GARAGE - HARMSWAY TOWERS.

      Bond and Sidney come out near a TROLLEY stacked with newspapers.

      Hearts pounding - having left the pressroom's deafening noise -
      they're ready for almost anything, except what they HEAR:

      The SOUND OF ONE MAN APPLAUDING. A polite, almost bored clapping.

                              HARMSWAY (O.S.)
                 Vert, very, good Mr. Bond. Outstanding
                 performance.

      Harmsway is standing with TEN GUARDS, shoulder to shoulder, in a
      straight line, all HOLDING WEAPONS on Sidney and Bond.

                              HARMSWAY (continuing)
                 I'm the certain the British taxpayers
                 would be impressed by your efforts.
                 Don't you agree?

                              BOND
                 I think they'd rather know who stole
                 their gold.

      Harmsway can't help his ego:

                              HARMSWAY
                       (chuckles)
                 Why, I did, of course. It's on the
                 Sea Dolphin II, twenty miles outside
                 of Hong Kong... Not that it will do
                 either of you any good to know.
                       (beat)
                 Now both of you: Stand up. And toss
                 the gun out, Mr. Bond.

      Bond SLIDES THE GUN several feet in front of him... And THROWS A LOOK
      TO HIS CAR, noting THE GUARDS ARE LINED UP DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH.
      Bond begins to scheme.

                              SIDNEY
                 Uncle Elliot: How could you do this
                 to me?

      Bond sneaks his hand in his pocket.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Oh, please, Sidney. There's a
                 hundred billion dollars at stake.
                       (beat)
                 Besides, I never really liked your
                 father that much. He cheated at cards.

      Bond has removed the CAR REMOTE CONTROL. He palms it.

                              BOND
                 Are your guards really going to kill
                 a helpless girl?

                              HARMSWAY
                 My guards are from South Africa, Mr.
                 Bond. This is their chance to get even
                 with the formerly 'Great' Britain.
                       (beat)
                 Now both of you. Put your hands on
                 your heads, and step forward.

      Holding the remote control, Bond puts his hands on his head. He's
      manipulating the control into the right position to use it.

                              BOND
                       (trying to buy time)
                 What did you do, Harmsway? Make some
                 deal with the Chinese government for
                 the gold?.. Was the radioactive
                 uranium I found in Venice part of it?

      He finally has the remote control in the right position.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Questions, questions, Mr. Bond...
                 Which I'm afraid I've neither the
                 time, nor the inclination to answer.
                       (to the guards)
                 Take them out to the jungle and -

      Suddenly, BOND'S CAR ENGINE STARTS WITH A ROAR. The GUARDS TURN, in
      shock TOWARDS THE CAR, as:

      BOND retrieves the gun he slid out, and pulls Sidney behind the
      newspaper trolley, while -

      THE CAR BEGINS TO MOVE, sending the guards scrambling.

      BOND takes his position with Sidney.

                              BOND
                 I forgot to mention: The job comes
                 with a car.

      007 begins shooting, as -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Kill it! Shoot the damn thing -

      THE GUARDS START BLASTING THE EMPTY MOVING CAR. They manage to shoot
      out the headlights, while -

      BOND is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same
      time. As bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them -

                              BOND
                 Here. You shoot. I'll drive.

                              SIDNEY
                 ...You know, that's another reason
                 you're probably not in a successful
                 relationship.

                              BOND
                 Another reason??? Did I miss something???

                              SIDNEY
                       (taking the gun)
                 You insist on calling all the shots.
                       (beat)
                 And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.

      Bond eyes her for one split second. Points at the guards:

                              BOND
                 Aim that way.

      Sidney starts to shoot as -

      THE GUARDS continue to blast away at the car... But:

      THE WINDOWS DON'T SHATTER.

      THE ARMOR-PLATED SIDE-PANELS ONLY DENT WITH BULLET HITS...

      THE TIRES DON'T GO FLAT.

      There's chaos; a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as BOND STEERS
      THE CAR TO THEIR POSITION, where the door opens automatically.

                              BOND
                 Ready? Now!

      The two of them make a break for the car, DIVING INSIDE.

      INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - GARAGE -

      - Bond guns the engine, slams the transmission into gear. Burning
      rubber, GUARDS bounce off the front fenders.

      THE GUARDS -

      Continue to shoot at the car.

      OTHER GUARDS -

      Run for the HUM-VEES. Hop in and chase.

      INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

      Bond flips open a hidden control panel. Flips a switch.

      EXT. BACK OF BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

      The TAIL-LIGHTS DROP DOWN and MACHINE GUNS start to fire.

      INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

      Bond glances at the REARVIEW MIRROR. Sees the HUM-VEES. Presses
      another switch -

      CLOSE ON BOND'S EXHAUST PIPE -

      Whoosh! A MISSILE blasts out, trailing smoke as it hones in on -

      THE FIRST HUM-VEE.

      BOOM! It's decimated.

      ANGLE ON HARMSWAY - ON HIS RADIO -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Seal the garage! Cut the power!
                 He's got no headlamps!

      INT. GARAGE - FIRST TURN -

      As the car screeches around a corner, the overhead lights go out.

      INT. BOND'S CAR -

      Bond flips down the visor: A THERMAL IMAGING DISPLAY drops down.

      INSERT "HEADS UP" IMAGING DISPLAY -

      It looks just like the jet fighter videos from the Gulf War.

      INT. GARAGE - SECOND TURN - UP RAMP -

      Bond's car roars around a second turn, with sparks flying as it
      scrapes the walls. AHEAD, a MASSIVE ONE-PIECE DOOR is FOLDING DOWN
      FROM THE CEILING. A city street beyond.

      INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING -

                              SIDNEY
                 We're not going to make it!

      Bond flips down a control panel from the RADIO. A DIGITAL DISPLAY
      begins to run through a set of numbers. Bond explains:

                              BOND
                 If it's radio controlled, it'll break
                 the code.

                              SIDNEY
                 If not?

                              BOND
                       (pointing to a button)
                 We blast through.

      THE CAR APPROACHES THE CLOSING DOOR AT HIGH SPEED -

      BOND SEES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. HE PUNCHES THE MISSILE BUTTON.

      TWO MISSILES ROAR OUT FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR -

      THEY EXPLODE AGAINST THE CLOSING DOOR - TO NO EFFECT.

      BOND'S CAR GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER -

      SIDNEY SCREAMS! BOND BRACES, AND -

      BOOM! CRASH! SILENCE. BLACK. After a moment, we HEAR THE SOUND OF
      FOOTSTEPS ON CEMENT.

      INT. GARAGE -

      The lights come on. The car is a twisted wreck, smashed against the
      wall. Bond and Sidney are slumped forward, unconscious.

      Harmsway KNOCKS TWICE ON THE GARAGE DOOR, to demonstrate:

                              HARMSWAY
                 - Built to withstand a nuclear blast.
                       (to Stamper, checking
                        Bond's pulse)
                 Are they alive?

                              STAMPER
                 Yes. Shall we kill them?

                              HARMSWAY
                 No. I have a better idea. In fact,
                 Mr. Bond may have actually improved
                 my original plan.
                       (beat)
                 Bring them both to Hong Kong. And
                 Make sure he has nothing else up his
                 sleeve.

      DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR - HONG KONG - MORNING -

      It is early morning in this strange harbor - a place where floating
      restaurant rise out of the fog; where an old Chinese man wearing an
      LA Laker's jersey practices tai-chi on the bow of an ancient junk;
      where sampans cut through the chop filled with ducks, computer boxes
      and women dressed in Chanel 1996, and Beijing 1256... While the
      captains of these small water-taxis chatter away on cell-phones.

      At the end of the harbor, dominating this scene, the CAMERA FINDS:

      THE FIVE SMOKESTACKS OF THE ABERDEEN HARBOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.

      Panning down this massive dockside facility, the image changes to:

      THE SAME SCENE ON A 5" PORTABLE VIDEO MONITOR -

      With one important difference: There's an HNN logo in lower corner.

                              ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (VO)
                 As part of our continuing report on
                 terrorism, we're outside Hong Kong's
                 Aberdeen Harbor nuclear power plant...

      NEW ANGLE (EXT. POWER PLANT, FRONT ENTRANCE, WATERSIDE) -

      Two VIDEO CAMERAMEN are shooting an ASIAN HNN REPORTER interviewing a
      middle-aged CHINESE MAN. We don't see the reporter's face; from the
      "over the shoulder" news angle, he's WEARING A HAT.

      (There's also HNN BELL JETRANGER HELICOPTER on the ground, and a
      seemingly empty HNN BOAT moored to a nearby pier.)

                              ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (cont'd)
                 - Interviewing Mr. David Chin, senior
                 engineer in charge of security.
                       (beat)
                 Tell me, Mr. Chin: How safe is this
                 plant from a terrorist attack?

      He holds out a MICROPHONE to Chin.

                              CHIN
                 Totally secure. Without codes, you'd
                 need a missile to blast through the
                 front door; you normally can't even get
                 this close (to the plant) without a full
                 security clearance.

                              ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER
                 ...Could you say that a little closer
                 to the microphone?

      He pushes the microphone closer to Chin's face:

                              CHIN
                 Of course. You'd need -

      Suddenly, A PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE EMERGES FROM THE MICROPHONE... And
      CHIN COLLAPSES. The HNN reporter TAKES OFF HIS HAT: IT'S YUNG.

                              YUNG
                       (to the guards)
                 Now!

      At once, the two cameramen turn: One AIMS his shoulder-mounted video
      camera at a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA; the other aims at the FRONT DOOR.

      BOOM! ROCKETS shoot out from their lenses, destroying both.

                              YUNG
                 Let's go!

      As Yung and the cameramen rush forward -

      ANGLE ON THE HNN BOAT -

      Harmsway emerges from the boat accompanied by two men carrying a box
      of equipment. He calls back to TWO MEN who have appeared on deck:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Get the machine in the water!

      They begin using a hoist to lift one of the "worms" from a hold.
      (This one looks like an open-mouthed torpedo, with an antenna on top,
      and no flexible tubing attached.)

      INT. HALLWAY/RECEPTION - POWER PLANT -

      Yung and the cameramen turn a corner to the reception/security area:

                              POWER PLANT GUARD
                 What happened out there?

                              YUNG
                 A generator blew. Nothing to worry about.
                       (beat)
                 But I need one last shot of you. Why
                 don't you stand by the alarm?

                              POWER PLANT GUARD
                 No problem.

      The guard stands, and smiles, posing for the video camera... And Yung
      pulls a pistol from his pocket and shoots him.

                              YUNG
                       (to the cameramen)
                 Up the stairs!

      They follow Yung up a set of stairs leading to the reactor control
      room. Meanwhile, back at the HNN boat:

      INT. CABIN - HNN BOAT

      Bond is at the porthole, wearing only shorts, trying to figure a way
      out. He hears the door click open, and -

      A Guard enters carrying a pile of Bond's clothing with his shoes on
      top. Stamper is behind him, holding a gun on Sidney.

                              STAMPER
                 Put on your clothes.
                       (to the guard)
                 Cuff him.

      The guard cuffs Bond's hands (in the front,) and we cut back to:

      INT. POWER PLANT CONTROL ROOM -

      Yung and the Cameramen sweep into the control room: Lots of con-
      soles, with a window overlooking the REACTOR CORE, and its
      surrounding blue COOLING POOL.

                              YUNG
                       (to the half-dozen engineers)
                 I'm sorry to interrupt again. But we
                 need one more picture for the story.

      The engineers ad-lib replies: "Sure." "Okay." Yung smiles:

                              YUNG (CONT'D)
                 Why don't you line up against the
                 wall? Let's make it a group shot.

      The engineers line up against a wall. The cameramen take positions
      for a massacre. And at the first sound of gunfire, we cut to:

      EXT. ENTRANCEWAY -

      Stamper is marching Bond and Sidney through the door in handcuffs.

                              BOND
                 Sleep well?

                              SIDNEY
                 Next time, I do the driving.

      Bond gives her a look.

      RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -

      Harmsway and Yung are locking down at the VIDEO SCREEN of a portable
      version of the "worm" controller we saw on the SEA DOLPHIN II.

                              YUNG
                 The drill is in the water;
                 approaching the intake tunnel.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Excellent.

      Harmsway looks up, hearing:

                              BOND
                 I see you're in your natural element,
                 Harmsway: A room filled with lethal
                 power...
                       (beat)
                 ...With a toxic core at its center.

      Harmsway smiles at Bond and Sidney, who have entered (handcuffed, at
      gun point,) with Stamper and a guard. Harmsway is charming as ever:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Do come in Mr. Bond, Sidney...
                 You're just in time for a nuclear
                 meltdown!

      Coming closer, Sidney struggles against her cuffs, swinging at him -

                              SIDNEY
                 You bastard -

      Stamper restrains her, while Bond scans the room for an advantage.
      He sees a MACHINE PISTOL on the console.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember
                 you fondly.

                              YUNG
                       (calling from the console)
                 Approaching the first gate.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Start the grinders.

      UNDERWATER - POWER PLANT INTAKE TUNNEL -

      The "worm" is nearing an iron sluice gate; the eye closes, the
      grinders rev, and it starts to eat through the bars.

      RETURN ON CONTROL ROOM -

                              BOND
                 ...So that's what the weapons grade
                 uranium was for.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of
                 minutes, the boring device will
                 arrive at the core of the reactor...
                       (beat)
                 And when the radioactive blades cut
                 into the plutonium -

                              BOND
                 - Instant melt-down.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Chernobyl will look like a campfire.

      Young calls out again, with a hint of urgency. Bond decides to try
      rattling Harmsway - so he can move Closer to the gun, unnoticed.

                              YUNG
                 We're through the first gate.
                 Approaching the second -

                              BOND
                       (demanding)
                 Why, Harmsway? Wasn't stealing the
                 gold enough?

                              HARMSWAY
                       (to Yung)
                 Bore through.
                       (to Bond, chuckling)
                 ...They used to say living well was
                 the best revenge, Mr. Bond.
                       (beat)
                 They're wrong.
                       (beat)
                 Revenge is the best revenge.

                              YUNG
                 Entering the main tunnel - ten
                 minutes to target -

                              BOND
                       (fiercely)
                 What could you possibly have to be
                 vengeful for, Harmsway? Still trying
                 to prove yourself to daddy?

      This infuriates Harmsway. Bond moves closer to the gun.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!

                              YUNG
                 You have to leave -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (enraged, ignoring Yung)
                 A hundred and fifty years ago, my
                 ancestors took this island - a
                 barren, lifeless rock - and turned it
                 into the greatest city known to
                 modern civilization.
                       (beat)
                 And now that I'm being forced to give
                 it back, I intend to return it in
                 exactly the same condition: A
                 barren, lifeless rock.
                       (beat)
                 The gold is merely reparations -
                 payment from the spineless British
                 government who wouldn't listen.

                              BOND
                       (to Sidney, glancing at the gun)
                 ... I think Uncle Elliot is having
                 his own melt-down.

                              YUNG
                 Approaching the third gate -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Smash through it!
                       (then)
                 Laugh all you'd like, Mr. Bond - but
                 you fit perfectly in to my plans.
                       (he reaches for a newspaper)
                 Here. This just in. Newsflash.
                 Read all about it.

      He thrusts an issue of TOMORROW at Bond, holding the top half out as
      Bond reads THE HEADLINES, sourly:

                              BOND
                 ... Hong Kong destroyed by nuclear
                 meltdown... British agent found in
                 reactor suspected of sabotage; Harmsway
                 calls for British government to resign.

      Harmsway smiles at Bond:

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...As the advertising says: Tomorrow
                 never lies.

                              BOND
                 What about the gold?

                              YUNG
                 You must go. Now. Otherwise the
                 boat won't be out of range -

      Stamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Thirty seconds.
                       (then, to Bond)
                 That's the most brilliant part of the
                 plan, Mr. Bond: To save the economy,
                 I'll let the new British government -
                 my British government - announce that
                 the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong
                 - where no one will be able to touch
                 it for a hundred years.
                       (beat)
                 And just by coincidence:

      He turns the paper over and reads/reveals a smaller headline:

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...Gold mine opens in Vietnam.
                       (turns to Stamper)
                 Let's go. Put them in the airlock.

      Stamper moves towards Bond and Sidney. Bond edges closer to the gun.

                              BOND
                 You'll never get away with it,
                 Harmsway. Too many people know.

      Bond tenses, ready to spring -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Who, Mr. Bond? The kooks - the
                 crazies - the conspiracy theorists?
                 The Oliver Stones of the world?
                       (pausing, then, with great scorn:)
                 I'll publish their books, I'll make
                 their movies, I'll put them on my TV
                 shows!
                       (beat)
                 They're my bellboys. They carry my
                 luggage.

      Bond moves, but - the guard picks up the gun!!! Bond frowns.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Now. Get them in the airlock.

      Fortunately, Bond has a back-up plan. As Stamper hustles them off -

                              BOND
                 One problem, Harmsway: The girl. And
                 the handcuffs. They'll give it away.

      Harmsway considers this for a second. Sidney takes Bond's arm.

                              SIDNEY
                 No. I want to stay with him.

      Bond looks at her. He's surprised: In the blink of an eye, he
      realizes he's developed feelings for her. He knows that if he could
      hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper "You're a hell of a girl"...

      But at the same instant - throwing a glance at Yung - he knows he's
      running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (breaking the moment, cynically)
                 How sweet.

                              SIDNEY
                       (satto, to Bond)
                 My timing always was lousy.

                              BOND
                       (cold and hard)
                 I'd rather die alone.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs.
                 We'll drown her at sea.

                              SIDNEY
                       (to Bond, sarcastically)
                 Enjoy the rest of your life.

      As Stamper pushes Bond into the reactor room airlock, he hears:

                              HARMSWAY
                 I'll meet you on the boat, south of
                 Lantau Island.

      INT. AIRLOCK -

      The door closes. Bond looks out the small window at:

      HARMSWAY AND YUNG IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

                              YUNG
                 Take the men. I can finish alone.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (to the technicians and cameramen)
                 You come with me -
                       (to the guard who handcuffed Bond)
                 You stay here.

      As they exit -

      INT. AIRLOCK -

      Bond has yanked his shoes off. He pulls out the PLASTIQUE EXPLOSIVE
      SHOELACES and opens the SECRET COMPARTMENT IN HIS HEEL, revealing a
      DETONATOR, and EAR PLUGS.

      Moving quickly, Bond BITES OFF a 2-inch piece of shoelace, and wraps
      it around the chain-link connecting his handcuffs, while...

      INT. CONTROL ROOM -

      Yung sits down at the worm control and explains to the guard:

                              YUNG
                 We'll cut through the last gate, then
                 set it on auto-pilot.

      He starts to maneuver the joystick, and -

      UNDERWATER - INTAKE TUNNEL -

      The worm turns a corner. We see -

      THE WORM'S POV - (INT. INTAKE TUNNEL MOVING) -

      100 feet ahead: An iron gate. Beyond it, the blue lights from the
      reactor cooling pool... And beyond that... THE REACTOR CORE, a
      shimmering silver target.

      Meanwhile, back outside, at -

      THE DOCK -

      Water sprays violently as the HNN boat thunders out of Aberdeen
      harbor with Harmsway at the helm. Junks and sampans are tossed in
      his wake, as

      INT. AIRLOCK -

      Bond finishes pressing the SHOELACES AROUND THE DOOR LOCK... Then
      TURNS UP HIS SHIRT COLLAR TO PULL OUT A WIRE that's been hidden
      inside.

      He connects it between the explosive on the handcuff chain and the
      detonator, then steals a glance out the window at:

      YUNG -

      still guiding the worm with the joy stick. His eyes are focused on:

      THE CONTROL PANEL (INCLUDING VIDEO SCREEN, SHOWING WORM'S POV) -

      Where Yung sees the gate looming ahead on the video screen. He
      presses a nearby button marked "START GRINDERS"... And the video
      goes black, replaced by the words "GRINDERS ENGAGED."

      UNDERWATER -(INTAKE TUNNEL) -

      The worm bares its lethal teeth; and revs up to speed. Meanwhile -

      BOND -

      Closes his eyes, presses the detonator, and -

      YUNG -

      HEARS a small BOOM from inside the airlock.

                              YUNG
                       (to the guard)
                 Check it out. Be careful.

      The guard picks up his machine pistol, starts to the door.

      INSIDE THE AIRLOCK -

      Bond (with his hands now free) is quickly rewiring the detonator to
      the plastique explosive around the door handle.

      YUNG MANEUVERS THE JOY-STICK, AS -

      UNDERWATER (INTAKE TUNNEL)

      The worm's teeth are beginning to cut into the steel bars.

      THE GUARD APPROACHES THE DOOR.

      BOND BRACES HIMSELF INSIDE THE AIRLOCK.

      THE GUARD PEERS INTO THE WINDOW -

      And suddenly... BOOM! The door blows open with a shattering blast!

      NEW ANGLE - THE CONTROL ROOM -

      The guard is blasted backward, dead. Bond rolls out, scrambling for
      the weapon. Yung slams his hand on a button marked "AUTO-PILOT." A
      caption appears on the video screen "TARGET LOCKED," and -

      As Bond grabs the gun, bringing it up to shoot, Yung dives on top of
      him. They struggle, and the gun skitters across the floor towards
      the window overlooking the blue cooling pool.

      Breaking free, Bond moves around a console for the gun. Yung takes a
      shortcut - leaping on, and then over the console, as -

      THE WORM (UNDERWATER - INTAKE TUNNEL) -

      Chews through the last of the iron bars, and glides through the hole
      toward THE SILVERY REACTOR CORE, 35 feet ahead.

      BOND AND YUNG -

      have squared off in a short, brutal MARTIAL ARTS battle.

      (The fight takes place in the space between the consoles and the
      reactor core window; the gun, lies on the ground between them.)

      They trade punch after punch - and although Bond is holding his own,
      Yung is every bit his equal.

      Backing off, Bond spins into a crescent kick -

      But Yung catches Bond's foot, and shoves Bond backwards, crashing
      against a wall near a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

      Meanwhile, all through this...

      THE WORM IS GETTING CLOSER TO THE CORE.

      RETURN ON BOND AND YUNG -

      As Yung reaches down for the gun, Bond grabs the fire extinguisher
      from the wall. He rushes Yung, blasting him with CO2.

      In the white smoke, Yung drops the gun... Then CHARGES at Bond,
      headbutting him, twisting, and turning 007... SMASHING BOND
      BACKWARDS AGAINST THE GLASS WINDOW.

      THE WINDOW SHATTERS. Bond is winded. And as he struggles to stop
      himself from falling backwards into the reactor room...

      Yung does a FLYING, FEET FIRST KICK to finish the job -

      But at the last second, BOND DUCKS, reaches up, and uses Yung's
      momentum to send him flying over Bond's head into -

      THE REACTOR ROOM.

      He sails through the air, heading for the cooling pool 20' below, as -

      THE WORM CLOSES IN ON THE SILVER REACTOR CORE.

      SCREAMING, YUNG HITS THE WATER FEET FIRST, AND -

      UNDERWATER (REACTOR CORE) -

      THE WORM BURROWS IN ON HIM.

      RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -

      Bond races to hit the "EMERGENCY REACTOR SHUT DOWN" button. He pulls
      a FIRE ALARM, disconnects the worm, and sets off an "EMERGENCY
      DECONTAMINATION" system, spraying the room with a mist of water.

      Finally, Bond retrieves the gun, and pauses to look down at:

      THE REACTOR POOL (BOND'S POV) -

      There's a cloud of RED in the middle of the blue water.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      Bond goes to the dead guard. Gets the key, removes his handcuff
      bracelets, then hoists the dead guard over his shoulder, and exits.

      EXT. HELICOPTER - (EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR POWER PLANT) - DAY

      With the sound of fire engines approaching in the background, Bond
      straps the dead guard into the passenger seat, and takes off.

      EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II - (AERIAL - SOUTH CHINA SEA) - DAY

      The HNN boat has pulled alongside the Sea Dolphin II. The gang from
      the nuke plant is boarding the larger boat.

      (Note: From the air, we should notice that the "gold hold" is now
      covered by a steel hatch, and the biggest worm is stored in the open,
      hanging from a steel boom.)

      THE DECK -

      Coming up the ladder first, Harmsway is greeted by the Captain.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Any news?

                              THE CAPTAIN
                 The call just went out on the Hong
                 Kong police radio: Fire at the power
                 plant.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (ironically)
                 Alert the media!

      Stamper and Sidney have climbed onto the deck.

                              STAMPER
                 What do you want me to do with her?

                              SIDNEY
                 - Can't we make a deal? I won't say
                 anything -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (touching her cheek)
                 You're so cute, my dear.
                       (beat)
                 But I'm afraid not.
                       (to one of the cameramen)
                 Put her in the storage room.

      The cameraman takes her away. Harmsway turns to the captain:

                              HARMSWAY (CONT'D)
                 We'll get rid of her when we're in
                 International waters.
                       (then)
                 Set sail, full speed, due south.
                 I'll be in my cabin. Let me know
                 when Mr. Yung arrives. We'll break
                 out the champagne.

      INT. LOWER PASSAGEWAY/STORAGE ROOM - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Near the engine room (indicating we're near the bottom of the boat,)
      the cameraman opens a door to a small, cramped room with a bench, and
      SCUBA EQUIPMENT. He pushes Sidney inside.

                              CAMERAMAN
                 Don't get any ideas.

      Then locks the door on her.

      EXT. BOND'S HNN HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY

      Several hundred feet in the air, the helicopter is heading for an
      island in the distance.

      INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING -

      Bond checks the compass, and adjusts his course. The COMPASS SWINGS
      DUE SOUTH.

      BOND'S POV -

      The helicopter clears the island: Bright blue sea ahead. Bond sees
      then passes over - the HNN boat, bobbing empty in the water...

      Then, further ahead, he spots the stern of Sea Dolphin II, shimmering
      in the instance.

      REAR DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Looking north, off the back of the boat Stamper and a crewman see the
      helicopter - a tiny speck in the air.

                              STAMPER
                 There it is.

      Stamper lifts a pair of BINOCULARS for confirmation.

      STAMPER'S POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -

      He sees two figures in the cockpit.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      Stamper picks up his radio:

                              STAMPER
                 It's him. They both made it.

      THE BRIDGE -

      The Captain replies:

                              THE CAPTAIN
                 I'll tell Sir Elliot.

      HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

      Harmsway is working at a computer. A chime sounds.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Yes?

                              CAPTAIN'S VOICE
                 He's approaching from the north, sir.

                              CREWMAN
                 Fantastic. Invite the crew on deck
                 to celebrate, and I'll be up in a few
                 minutes.

      INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY -

      Bond is about two miles out from the stern of the Sea Dolphin II.
      Maybe 500' in the air.

      Taking the machine pistol from the dead guard's lap, he opens the
      small pilot's window, and balances it on his knees. Ahead, he sees:

      BOND'S POV - DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      The crewmen are lining up on either side of the landing pad, near the
      ship's railings.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      Ready for war. He pushes the cyclic pitch lever forward, and the
      Bell Jetranger goes into a screaming descent.

      THE DECK/HELICOPTER LANDING PAD

      Champagne bottles pop. Stamper is with a crewman, who looks up at
      the chopper, about 1000' off the stern:

                              CREWMAN
                 He seems to be coming in awfully fast.

      Stamper picks up his binoculars.

      STAMPER'S POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -

      He sees Bond.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

                              STAMPER
                 Get the guns! It's not him! It's
                 Bond!!!

      He might have also added "It's too late," as -

      NEW ANGLE - REAR DECK OF THE BOAT/HELICOPTER -

      Bond SWOOPS IN LOW on the port side of the boat, FIRING HIS GUN from
      the pilot's window, and using the CHOPPER'S BLADES to threaten the
      men on deck.

      About half of them DIVE INTO THE WATER FOR SAFETY, only to be quickly
      left behind.

      Flying up the port side toward the front of the boat, Bond passes -

      INT. HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

      The windows rattle as Bond's chopper thunders by. Perplexed,
      Harmsway stands, opens the porthole curtains. He cranes his neck,
      but sees nothing. He presses an intercom button:

                              HARMSWAY
                 What the hell is going on?

      INT. BRIDGE -

                              THE CAPTAIN
                       (on a phone)
                 I don't know sir -

      The helicopter suddenly appears in front of him. Shooting from the
      pilot's window, Bond shatters the glass windows -

      And the Captain slumps forward on the wheel, spinning it as he slides
      to the deck.

      INT. HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

      The boat pitches wildly; Harmsway looses his balance, crashing into a
      wall.

      INT. STORAGE CABIN -

      Sidney is thrown from her bench, slamming against scuba tanks.

      EXT. MID-SHIP - DECK -

      Stamper bounces himself, handing out AUTOMATIC WEAPONS from an arms
      cache hidden inside a DINGHY.

      The two cameramen take their M-16's and rush forward, jumping up on
      some machinery to climb onto -

      THE ROOF OF THE BRIDGE -

      They rush forward, and assume positions shooting at Bond.

      ANGLE ON THE HELICOPTER -

      Taking hits. Bond pivots and turns the chopper, heading straight for
      them.

      BOND'S POV - (INT. HELICOPTER) -

      The men turn, and start to run as the chopper chases them -

      CLOSE ON THE CHOPPER'S LANDING SKIDS -

      BOND HOOKS BOTH OF THEM WITH THE SKIDS, BY THE BACK OF THEIR UNTUCKED
      SHIRTS!!!!   The man are flailing like crazy as -

      BOND PULLS BACK ON THE CYCLIC PITCH LEVER -

      THE HELICOPTER REARS BACKWARDS, AND UP -

      And the men burst through their shirt buttons, FALLING, SHIRTLESS,
      into the sea.

      INT. HELICOPTER -

      Bond pushes the cyclic sideways to bank down, and in, on the boat.
      But he doesn't see -

      WIDE - (BOAT/HELICOPTER)

      A SMALL ROCKET STREAKING UPWARD from the boat. Stamper is holding a
      shoulder mounted launcher.

      THE HELICOPTER -

      BOOM! It hits the engine.

      INT. HELICOPTER -

      The gauges go crazy; the alarms go berserk. The entire cockpit is
      chattering as Bond struggles to remain in control.

      EXT. LADDER LEADING TO THE BRIDGE -

      HARMSWAY is trying to make his way up the ladder as the boat
      continues to veer out of control. He pauses to look up at:

      THE HELICOPTER, GYRATING WILDLY -

      INT. HELICOPTER -

      Bond forces the cyclic forward. The helicopter pitches forward -

      BOND'S POV - (INT. HELICOPTER)

      He's heading straight for the hatch covering the gold hold. Whoever
      is left alive is diving off the ship to get out of the way.

      INT. BRIDGE -

      Struggling with the wheel, Harmsway picks up the radio:

                              HARMSWAY
                 What the hell is going on?

                              STAMPER (O. S. )
                 It's Bond!

                              HARMSWAY
                 Kill him! Finish it!

      ANGLE ON STAMPER (EXT. MID-SHIP) -

      With the worm dangling from a boom in the background, he watches:

      EXT. HELICOPTER/SHIP

      With the chopper about 15 feet above the gold hold - just barely
      under control - Bond opens the door.

      He leaps out onto the hatch, and rolls off, disappearing as -

      THE CHOPPER CRASHES onto the gold hold, in a GIANT BALL OF FLAME and
      twisted metal.

      INT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT -

      Sidney looks up, hearing and feeling the explosion.

      INT. BRIDGE -

      Harmsway regains control of the boat; he TAKES A GUN from the dead
      captain, and pushes the body out.

      EXT. PASSAGEWAY -

      With FLAMING DEBRIS still falling around him, Bond is stealthily
      moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship.

      (Bond has two goals in mind at this point: First, to neutralize any
      threats, and second, to save Sidney if she's still alive.)

      Arriving at a BULKHEAD DOOR, Bond checks both directions down the
      passageway, then pokes his head inside -

      And is SUDDENLY YANKED BACKWARDS, OUT INTO THE PASSAGEWAY, thrown
      against a railing.

      Bond looks up:

      STAMPER stands with a smile on his face. One arm is raised above his
      head, grasping the WORM on the swinging boom. The worm is attached
      to the boom by a thin metal cable.

                              STAMPER
                 You're mine now.

      Bond rushes at Stamper, slamming into him. The man doesn't flinch.
      With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him
      against a steel wall. Bond crashes to the deck.

      As Bond recovers, Stamper (still smiling) presses a RED BUTTON on a
      wall, and THE WORM comes to life.

      Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm.

      Bond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond
      against the wall with his free hand as he -

      MANEUVERS THE WORM TOWARDS BOND'S HEAD.

      With the cutting blades whirring inches away from Bond's nose -

                              STAMPER
                 I'm going to do this slowly -

      Bond executes a scissor kick to Stamper's ankles. Stamper tumbles
      sideways. Bond rolls away from the worm -

      But by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is
      rushing at Bond full force, with the worm.

      Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once. Bond ducks. The worm chews
      into the wall.

      Pulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - (same
      action,) then a third (same action) - still missing Bond.

      INSERT - CLOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL/CABLE -

      With all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in
      the cable, on the ground.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      Stamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in
      the groin. Stamper doubles over in pain -

      And the worm FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND, swinging on the boom OVER THE
      SIDE OF THE SHIP.

      UNDERWATER -

      The grinders propel the worm forward, into the hull.

      SIDNEY - (INT. STORAGE ROOM) -

      Hears a strange vibrating sound from the wall.

      HARMSWAY - (INT. BRIDGE) -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (barking into the radio)
                 Stamper! Report in!

      EXT. DECK/PASSAGEWAY -

      As Stamper straightens up, winded from the groin kick -

                              HARMSWAY'S VOICE
                       (continuing, on Stamper's radio)
                 Report to the bridge!

      BOND rushes to A SMALL PILE OF SLACK CABLE, which is rapidly growing
      taught as the worm wends its way underwater.

      Stamper rushes Bond -

      And in one lightening fast move, Bond wraps the cable twice around
      Stamper's neck.

      Suddenly THE CABLE TIGHTENS, and -

      STAMPER soars 15 in the air, HANGING BY HIS NECK, as -

      INT. STORAGE CABIN -

      THE WORM BURSTS THROUGH THE WALL! A torrent of water floods in,
      pushing Sidney off to one side.

      WORM'S POV - INT. STORAGE CABIN -

      It's zooming at the door!

      INT. PASSAGEWAY -

      The door bursts open, sending tons of water into the passageway.

      INT. BRIDGE -

      The boat shudders violently, sending Harmsway crashing against a
      wall, cutting his head.

      EXT. THE DECK -

      As the boat rocks, Bond steadies himself, then starts for the bridge,
      using the same route as the cameramen lifted by the chopper:

      First climbing up on some machinery, then up onto the bridge roof.

      INT. STORAGE ROOM -

      Sidney is thrashing for air, with only a few inches left between the
      rising water and the ceiling.

      INT. PASSAGEWAY -

      3/4 filled with water. Rising fast.

      THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, INT. PASSAGEWAY)

      The worm is heading for a door. We see the door disintegrate in
      front of us, as the worm bursts into -

      THE ENGINE ROOM.

      With the water cascading over the camera, (as if we were riding
      inside an ocean wave,) the worm heads for a tank marked "FUEL."

      EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

      The boat is sinking. Bond is running across the bridge roof, when:
      THE BOAT SUDDENLY LISTS TO THE STARBOARD SIDE.

      INT. BRIDGE -

      Harmsway is thrown backwards. Gun in hand, he makes his way up the
      incline, to the port-side door.

      Just when he thinks he's made it -

      Bang. Bond appears in the doorway, having jumped down from the roof
      on the small exterior walkway. He's seething with rage.

      Harmsway looks up at him. Blinks in disbelief.

                              BOND
                 I never believe what I read in the
                 newspapers.

      Harmsway slowly brings up the gun.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Pity you'll miss your obituary.

      Bond smacks the gun out of his hand with contempt. Moves closer.

                              BOND
                 Where is she, Harmsway?

      BOOM! The fuel tanks explode in the distance. The bridge rocks
      violently; the room tilts to a greater angle.

                              HARMSWAY
                 You want to kill me, Bond? Go ahead.

      With both arms, Bond pushes Harmsway backwards, flinging him downward
      against the starboard wall. The water is rising on the bridge.

                              BOND
                       (moving in on him)
                 Where is she Harmsway? -

      He grabs Harmsway by the lapels, and throws him against the front
      wall, crashing onto the instrument panel head first.

      Harmsway laughs maniacally, face down on the gauges:

                              HARMSWAY
                 What is it, Bond? You haven't the
                 guts?

      Boom! There's another explosion in the background! The front of the
      boat tilts upward! The water is rushing in!

      Bond grabs Harmsway by the shoulder -

                              BOND
                 You spineless paper tiger -

      And yanks him off the instrument panel, flinging him backwards
      against the rear wall of the bridge.

                              BOND
                 Where is she, Harmsway?!? Or did you
                 kill her like Paris?

      Suddenly, THE BOAT GROANS. The BRIDGE RISES OUT OF THE WATER! AND
      BOND loses his balance, FALLING ONTO HARMSWAY -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (glaring, insanely:)
                 We all go down together!!!

      Harmsway lunges for Bond's throat -

      AND THE BRIDGE SLIPS UNDERWATER -

      Where Bond breaks Harmsway's grasp in a violent struggle - then
      punches him. Air bubbles break from Harmsway's mouth. He
      frantically tries to break free for the surface -

      But Bond pulls him back down, and holds him down, pushing down on
      Harmsway's shoulders.

      Harmsway is thrashing about, flailing in all directions, pounding at
      Bond in a haze of bubbles...

      Then falls still.

      With his lungs aching, bursting with fire, Bond rockets up -

      UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -

      through the bridge windows, up to -

      THE SURFACE.

      He breaks through the water, gasping for air... And then, almost
      instantly, dives down again.

      UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -

      Bond dives for the boat - down, and down, chasing it, as if he could
      just grab it, and stop it from sinking.

      He goes deeper, and deeper, as it sinks further and further away,
      just beyond his reach.

      And just when it seems impossible for him to survive - to hold his
      breath a second longer -

      A FIGURE IN SCUBA GEAR (mask and tank) GRABS HIM.

      Bond turns in disbelief. Stares into the mask: IT'S SIDNEY. She
      puts her regulator in Bond's mouth...

      And they share the air as they rise from the depths.

      THE SURFACE -

      They break through the water. Sidney yanks off her mask. Teases:

                              SIDNEY
                 What do you mean, you'd rather die
                 alone?

                              BOND
                 I didn't say when I want to die -

      She splashes him. Turning away, Bond spots Stamper's 'arms cache'
      dinghy floating nearby.

      NEW ANGLE - THE DINGHY -

      Bond climbs into it, then helps Sidney get in. They collapse in the
      bottom of the boat, resting their heads against the gunwale.

      After a beat, SIDNEY CLEARS HER THROAT. Bond is already amused:

                              BOND
                 ... Yes???

                              SIDNEY
                 Before we go any further here, Mr.
                 Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just
                 want to get two things straight.

                              BOND
                 ... Yes?

                              SIDNEY
                 First, that boat is in international
                 waters. I'm claiming it for salvage.
                 One-third of that gold is mine.

                              BOND
                 And number two?

                              SIDNEY
                 If you think we're going to have some
                 kind of 'life affirming' romance here
                 just because we cheated death, let me
                 be clear:
                       (pause)
                 We're going to have it where I want,
                 and when I want.

                              BOND
                 And when might that be?

                              SIDNEY
                 Now.

      He laughs. She falls into his arms. They kiss, and we cut to:

      TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS -

      With the dinghy reflected in the glass. In unison, they are both
      lowered, revealing Q and Wade.

                              Q
                 ... As usual, I see the situation is
                 in 007's very capable hands.

                              WADE
                 Life is not fair.

                              Q
                       (emphatically)
                 You're right.

      A British naval officer appears.

                              OFFICER
                 Excuse me, Major Boothroyd - the
                 message went to London.

                              Q
                 Thank you.

      Q and Wade throw a glance back to the sea, then turn, waking off:

                              WADE
                 Tell me, Q-ster. You do ever do any
                 gardening?

                              Q
                 ...The only thing I ever planted was
                 bugs.

      CLOSE ON A PICTURE OF HARMSWAY ON A VIDEO SCREEN -

      On the wall behind M's DESK. It's night. Moneypenny sits across
      from M, with a steno pad.

                              M
                 Moneypenny, take the following release:
                       (beat)
                 The body of Sir Elliot Harmsway was
                 found floating in the South China Sea
                 this morning, at 08:00 hours local
                 Hong Kong time.
                       (pauses)
                 At present, local authorities believe
                 the media mogul committed suicide.

      RETURN ON THE DINGHY -

      Bond and Sidney break off a kiss. She lies nestled in his arms.

                              SIDNEY
                 James... Is this really what a
                 typical day is like for you?

      Bond replies with a wry smile:

                              BOND
                 Yes...
                       (pause)
                 But some days... Are longer than
                 others.

      And with this, he reaches up over his head, and pulls a tarp over the
      two of them...

      And the camera pulls back, and up, rising into the air to reveal:

      The entire British Navy closing in on them from all points of the
      compass.


                                    THE END

                           (save for one last line:)

                            James Bond will return.

	1.  EXT. NIGHT. - THE PACIFIC IS ANYTHING BUT
	
	WINDS HOWL. Rain drives horizontal. The sea surges up, 
	nearly to the flight deck of the Aircraft Carrier USS Kitty 
	Hawk. The carrier plunges, driving its bow into a wall of 
	grey water. The deck pitches forward and back, rolls left to 
	right, and yaws in a corkscrew motion. The entire 93,000 ton 
	behemoth rises and falls in the TYPHOON-DRIVEN SWELL. 
	
	
	2.  SOMETHING DROPS DOWN OUT OF THE NIGHT
	
	A ROAR. Silver wings flash by, a cockpit, fiery jet 
	exhausts. A forty ton monster drops at 120 knots into an area 
	the size of a tennis court in a CONTROLLED CRASH. 
	
	2A.  A SHOWER OF SPARKS, A SCREECH OF RUBBER AND METAL as 
	the gear hits the deck. The hook catches the 3 wire and the 
	F-14 TOMCAT is slammed to a halt. It's the scariest thing 
	you've ever seen, the most dangerous maneuver in aviation and 
	just another day at the office for a Naval Aviator.
	
	TITLES OVER 
	
	HARD DRIVING ROCK AND ROLL - THE CARS - RIDE ME HIGH
	
	
	3.  FLIGHT DECK - THE LANDING SIGNAL OFFICER - (LSO)
	
	Leans almost horizontal into the winds. He holds the pickle, 
	controlling the landing lights and speaks into a mike. His 
	calm, professional commands belie the extreme conditions.
	
			LSO
	POWER, POWER...DON'T CLIMB...
	OKAY, HOLD WHAT YOU GOT.
	
	
	4.  ANOTHER TOMCAT FLIES OVER THE RAMP
	
	It slams in. The pilot hits full power, catches the wire, slams 
	to a stop, cuts his engines.
	
	5.  OMITTED
	
	6.  AIR OPS - BELOW DECK 
	
	Lots of scopes and electronic gear. The CARRIER CONTROL APPROACH 
	OFFICER (CCA) watches a blip on radar, reaches for his mike key.
	
	
	
	7.  EXT. THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING - (AERIAL)
	
	We float like gods, above the storm, above the cloud cover, 
	looking down. From overhead, a probe slides into frame, then 
	a graceful nose. The cockpit sides by, Pilot, then Radar 
	Intercept Officer (RIO) barely illuminated by the orange glow 
	of their instruments. The fuselage gracefully swells to two 
	enormous air intakes, then variable angle wings, swept back 
	for high speed flight. Twin tailbooms cant outward, 
	horizontal stabilizers make constant adjustments. Enormous 
	twin jet exhaust ports glow red in the moonlight.
	
	
	8.  INT. COCKPIT - (AERIAL)
	
	We become aware of WIND WHISTLE, JET ENGINE SOUNDS, RADIO 
	STATIC. The pilot, COUGAR, is calm, steady. The Radar 
	Intercept Officer in the backseat, GOOSE, is a wildman, 
	always an edge of humor in his voice. A UHF transmission 
	breaks in..
	
			STRIKE (V.O. filtered)
	GHOST RIDER, THIS IS STRIKE... WE 
	HAVE UNKNOWN CONTACT INBOUND,

	Come in on the cockpit with stenciled name and call signs: LT. 
	EVAN MITCHELL is the pilot, MAVERICK. In flight suit and oxygen 
	mask, we can only see his eyes. they are confident. In his 
	mid-twenties, he is lean, hard, athletic...the archetype fighter 
	pilot. His rear-seater is LTJG. WALTER MERLIN; WIZARD.
	
			MAVERICK

	Maverick peels off to right, to high cover position; 5 o'clock.
	
	
	9.  INT. GHOST RIDER 117 - COUGAR'S POV
	
	HEADS UP DISPLAY (HUD) glows dimly on the windscreen. Directly 
	in front of the stick, two CRT screens display data. The bottom 
	screen shows a radar sweep. Wedged between the instruments is a 
	snapshot of a pretty young woman with a 2 month-old baby.

	NEGATIVE, COUGAR. LOOKS LIKE HE'S 
	SINGLE.
	
	
	11.  INT. 117 - COUGAR'S COCKPIT
	
			COUGAR
	HANG BACK AND WATCH FOR HIM. HERE 
	COMES...MIG ONE.
	
	
	12.  EXT. SKY 
	
	Closing at 900 knots, The MiG is a speck, then a flash and a 
	ROAR, a knife-edge pass at 300 feet. It rockets past his left 
	wing tip and disappears. Cougar kicks rudder, whips the stick, 
	screams into a tight turning roll and dives after him. He slams 
	the throttle forward to ZONE 5 AFTERBURNER.  
	
	
	13.  EXT. - MAVERICK'S F-14
	
	Maverick sees a SECOND MiG drop from above onto Cougar's tail.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	BOGEY ON YOUR SIX. I'M ON HIS.
	
	Maverick swings after him, lights it. 
	
	
	13A.  ALL FOUR JETS SCREAM DOWN IN A POWER DIVE. 
	
	They punch through cloud cover into the soup.
	
	
	
	14.  EXT. COUGAR'S F-14 
	
	He is closing on the first MiG when a shocking BLIPBLIPBLIPBLIP 
	tone breaks into their headsets.
	
			GOOSE
	I've got a six strobe.  I think 
	he's locked on us.
	
			COUGAR
	It's a MiG 21. They don't have 
	radar missiles!
	
			GOOSE
	Let's hope you're right!
	
			COUGAR
	What is he doing?
	
			GOOSE
	He's pissing me off!
	
	Cougar swings mad gyrations, cutting back and forth across the 
	front MiG's tailpipe, trying to break the lock-on. The TONE grows 
	more insistant.
	
			COUGAR
	Can't shake him.
	
			MAVERICK (V.O.) 
	WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
	
			COUGAR
	Maintaining course. Straight for 
	Mustang.
	
			GOOSE
	Stay with him.
	
	The tone grows steady, BLIPBLIPBLIPBLIP.
	
			GOOSE
	   (alarmed)
	That's missile lock! 
	
			COUGAR
	He better be kidding!
	
			GOOSE
	Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole.
	Hope nobody burps!
	
	
	
	14A.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
			MAVERICK
	I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR. (to himself)  
	Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
	
			COUGAR
	I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
	
			MAVERICK
	ROGER, COUGAR. (to himself and his RIO) 
	Okay boys, pull out with your hands up 
	and nobody'll get hurt.
	
	
	14B.  INT. COUGAR'S F-14
	
	Up front, Cougar checks his gunsight...He gets I.R. lock...
	
			COUGAR
	We're locked on MiG ONE. Why 
	doesn't he disengage?
	
			GOOSE
	These guys are getting on my 
	nerves.
	
	
	14C.   FINALLY, MIG ONE TURNS AWAY.
	
			GOOSE
	GHOST RIDER TO MUSTANG. BANDITS  
	TURNING AWAY.
	
	But Cougar presses forward, and MiG TWO stays on his tail.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	COUGAR, BREAK LEFT. TRY A HIGH G 
	ROLL UNDERNEATH. BREAK OUT THE 
	BOTTOM.
	
	Anger gives way to discipline. Cougar's Tomcat breaks left, 
	dives into dense cloud. MiG TWO still follows.
	
			MAVERICK
	HE'S STILL ON YOU, COUGAR.
	
	
	15.  EXT. COUGAR - IN THE CLOUDS
	
	Still hears the tone, BLIPBLIPBLIP...
	
			COUGAR
	
	I KNOW. I KNOW.
	
	He rolls over into wild evasive maneuvers, finally breaks lock. 
	
	
	16.  INT. MIG
	
	Breaks out of cloud, looks around, startled.  There is nothing, 
	no F-14. He scans the sky frantically, while rolling the 
	aircraft. ...Suddenly, he feels a presence. He looks straight up 
	and behind him. A few feet away, a TOMCAT slides into position 
	canopy to canopy, an incredible feat of flying. Maverick and 
	Wizard stare at him. Maverick slides even closer, canopies nearly 
	touching. The MiG pilot acknowledges them with a weak wave.  
	Maverick stares for a moment, then flips him the bird. 
	
	The MiG pushes negative G, hard down and away. He heads for the 
	deck.
	
			WIZARD
	He's running for it.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Ah, the thrill of victory and the 
	agony of defeat.
	
			WIZARD
	Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 
	4.0.  We're gonna get them wet 
	unless we find a Sonoco station.

	BLASTS slam the airframe. Rain tattoos the canopy. A gust rolls 
	the Tomcat, he straightens it, A gust flips it again.

	The Carrier lights appear and disappear through the storm.

	   (To Himself)
	
	A walk in the park, Mustang. You

	with me?
	
	Goose is thrown about as the wing dips, straightens, dips.
	
			COUGAR
	Help me with this one, I'm really 
	screwed up.

	Bring it left. Bring it left,

	You're not. We're level. Look at

			GOOSE (V.O. filtered)
	WELL, WE CAN'T STAY UP HERE EITHER.
	
	
	25.  FLIGHT DECK 
	
	Maverick's plane settles in over the ramp, suddenly, BLASTS FROM 
	IT'S AFTERBURNERS...it ROARS over the deck without touching and 
	off into the night. The LSO is shocked into comment.

	He's nine o'clock high. We're two

	27.  DARK TURBULENT CLOUDS
	
	Maverick's plane pulls up behind Cougar's. Cougar's plane 
	suddenly flips over, flying inverted.
	
	
			COUGAR
	I'm pulling up.
	
			GOOSE
	No! Now we're inverted!
	
	
	Maverick pulls up off the wing of the inverted aircraft. His 
	voice is calmness itself.
	
			MAVERICK
	HEY, ANY OF YOU GUYS SEEN AN
	AIRCRAFT CARRIER AROUND HERE?
	
	Cougar looks over, surprised.
	
			COUGAR
	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
	
			MAVERICK
	EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE.
	..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU.
	YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
	
	Nothing happens.
	
			MAVERICK
	COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK. HALF ROLL 
	IT. NOW!
	
	
	Cougar's plane completes the roll, is now upright.
	
			GOOSE
	We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to 
	put it down.
	
			COUGAR
	It's crazy, man. Instruments are 
	crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
	
			GOOSE
	TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR

			MAVERICK
	YOU'RE NOT IN THE STRAPS.  IT'S 
	VERTIGO, THAT'S ALL IT IS. STAY ON 
	MY WING. I'LL DROP YOU OFF.
	
	Maverick pulls up wing tip to wing tip, inches apart.
	
			COUGAR
	MAVERICK.
	
			MAVERICK
	YEAH, COUGAR?
	
	
			COUGAR
	YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME...
	IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
	
			MAVERICK
	NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL.
		EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
	
			COUGAR
	I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M 
	GONNA EJECT.
	
			GOOSE
	Look at the weather! They'll never 
	find us! We're near out of fuel. 
	Put it down.

	OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS 
	THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL 
	HAVE YOUR BUTT!
	
			GOOSE
	You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be 
	where your head used to be.
	
	
	28.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK 
	
	All eyes are on what they can see of the approach of the two 
	planes. Maverick drops him off at the pattern and circles. The 
	LSO watches the approach. The Tomcat drops a wing, straightens, 
	drops the wing, straightens ... the approach of a pilot 
	experiencing vertigo as Cougar tries to satisfy his inner ear.
	
			LSO
	LEVEL...YOUR WINGS... EASY... 
	YOU'RE SETTLING....FLY THE BALL.
	
	A wind shear just off the ramp drives the plane suddenly down.
	
			LSO
	POWER...POWER!..POWER!...WAVE OFF!  
	WAVE OFF  WAVE OFF!
	
	
	AFTERBURNERS BLAST, but the Tomcat horrifyingly settles tail-low 
	toward the deck. The deck crew watches in terror as the plane 
	wallows in toward them. The LSO'S turn, take a few steps and 
	throw themselves off the flight deck.
	
	They sail into the night toward the surging seas a hundred feet 
	below, then are caught in safety nets hung off the side.
	
	
	28A.  THE PLANE
	
	Settles, settles, standing on it's engines, trying to arrest 
	it's downward momentum. The hook raises sparks as it skids across 
	the deck... The plane stops falling and hangs for a moment, about 
	to blast back up, when the hook catches the last wire.. The wire 
	snags it, plucking 45,000 pounds of fuel, metal and men out of 
	the air and slamming it all to the deck. WHAMMMM! Right wheel 
	flies up the deck and over the side...the gear collapses. The 
	plane SCREECHES sideways. The crew watches helplessly as it skids 
	slams into it and comes to rest in cloud of fuel vapor and steam.
	
	The LSO runs up, shouting into the mike. 
	
			LSO
	COUGAR, GOOSE...COME IN COUGAR! 
	SHUT YOUR ENGINES DOWN, YOU'VE 
	ARRIVED.
	
			AIR BOSS
	GHOST RIDER! ACKNOWLEDGE!
	GHOST RIDER! ACKNOWLEDGE!
	
	Crash crew leaps into action. The fire crew is there. The man in 
	the Silver Suit jumps up on the wing and crawls to the cockpit. 
	The figures inside are not moving. He hits the canopy release. 
	The canopy pops open. Silver suit grabs at the rear seat harness 
	release. He screams through his suit's aluminized cloth...
	
			SILVER SUIT
	Goose, can you hear me?  Goose!
	
	Nothing for a moment. He's dead! Then the RIO'S helmet 
	moves...His head turns. He tears the mask away from his face, 
	looks up at Silver Suit. His head clears.
	
			GOOSE
	Oh, Hello... Valet parking?
	
	Silver suit is stunned for a moment. He straightens up, his head 
	inclines quizzically. Then it hits him.
	
			SILVER SUIT
	Son of a bitch!
	
			GOOSE
	You will put it up front,
	with the Porsches?
	
	He grabs him under the armpits, drags him out of the plane. 
	
			GOOSE
	Hey...easy...Take it easy...
	I'm a veteran!
	
	
	Goose grabs a passing crewman by the arm.
	
			GOOSE
	Can you check under the hood. I 
	thought I heard a funny noise.
	
	Other crewmembers help Cougar out. He seems stunned, but Goose 
	reacts to his fear with frantic one-liners. He grabs a crew 
	member's radio, as Silver Suit helps him away and looks to the 
	figures of the Admiral and the Air Boss far up on the bridge... 
	He waves to them, does his best impression...Desi Arnaz.
	
			GOOSE
	Lucy...Ricky...I'n Home!
	
	
	28B.  BRIDGE FLIGHT DECK
	
	A moment of disbelief... Then hysterical, tension relieving 
	laughter.
	
	
	28C.  FLIGHT DECK
	
	Goose spots Cougar being helped out. He pulls away, reaches back 
	into the cockpit and grabs Cougar's snapshot of wife and kid. 
	They lead Goose away as firemen blast the aircraft with foam.
	
			GOOSE
	Is it extra for the hot wax?
	
	28D.  BRIDGE  - FLIGHT DECK - AIR BOSS
	
			AIR BOSS
	Clear the flight deck.
	
	
	
	29.  FLIGHT DECK
	
	A TILLIE, a four wheel mobile crane, slams up to the plane and 
	slings its lifting harness. Goose turns to Silver Suit.
	
			GOOSE
	Well...there goes your tip.
	
	30.  INT. MAVERICK'S PLANE
	
	They have monitored the chatter. 
	
			WIZARD
	It's Goose. He's alright. Bring it 
	left...You're settling.  IS THE 
	DECK CLEAR?
	
			LSO (V.O. filtered)
	   (softly)
	ROGER, BALL, LITTLE POWER...DON'T 
	CLIMB...OKAY, HOLD WHAT YOU GOT! 
	
	Wizard does a quick sign of the cross, reaches down, grabs his 
	balls...as...
	
	
	30A.  FLIGHT DECK 
	
	The TOMCAT slams onto the deck, clearing the wreckage by inches.
	
	
	31.  INT. CARRIER HATCHWAY - FLIGHT SURGEON, OTHERS 
	
	Watch as they bring a shaken Cougar past. Goose, eyes wild, 
	waves at Maverick and Wizard, rolling up. They flame out - 
	VVOOOMMMMM! They sit there, immobile, waiting for a tow, looking 
	numb.  Goose does his "stewardess".
	
			GOOSE
	On behalf of your Captain and your 
	crew, I want to thank you for 
	flying VF101. And next time your 
	plans include the middle of the 
	goddamn ocean in the dead of 
	frigging night, I hope you'll think 
	of Naval Aviation.
	
	The surgeon looks into Goose's eyes.
	
			SURGEON
	Stress reaction...
	
			XO
	
	Check his head.
	
			GOOSE
	   (wobbling off)
	Never mind my head, check my 
	shorts!
	
	
	32.  SICK BAY - LATER
	
	Cougar lies alone in the dimness, staring at the overhead.
	
	33. 03 LEVEL - BELOW DECKS - OFFICER'S COUNTRY
	
	The usual CLANGS, WHISTLES, ENGINES of Navy life sound FORLORN 
	ECHOING through the dim, deserted passage. From the distance, a 
	single figure passes in and out of the glow of the overhead 
	lights. Cougar comes closer, hobbling unsteadily.
	
	He reaches a door, pulls himself erect and knocks on the sign:
	
	Commander Tom Otawoczek
	CO VF 101
	STINGER
	
	
	34.  STINGER'S CABIN
	
	The skipper works at his desk, responds without looking up.
	
			STINGER
	Come in.
	
	He looks up. Cougar stands in the doorway, a strange, dazed look 
	on his face.
	
			STINGER
	Cougar, what is it? You should be 
	in sick bay. What are you doing?
	
	He walks over to the skipper's desk. His eyes are glazed, but 
	his jaw is firm.
	
			COUGAR
	Thinking of my wife and kid.
	
	A determined movement. Hand to chest.
	
	
	34A. OMITTED
	
	Something metal hits it, skids across the polished surface and 
	clangs up against the coffee mug: gold wings.
	
	
	
	35.  PASSAGEWAY
	
	Cougar comes out of Stinger's room, bumps into Goose, and 
	Maverick. He turns the other way.
	
			GOOSE
	Cougar!
	
	He stops, turns to them. There is nothing to say. Goose hands 
	him his snapshot. Cougar looks at his wife and kid for a moment, 
	then looks up at them. He turns away.
	
			MAVERICK
	Cougar?		STINGER (O.S.)
	Maverick, Goose...Come in here.
	
	
	36.  STINGER'S OFFICE - DOORWAY
	
	Maverick appears, followed by Goose. They stand at 
	attention.
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir?
	
	The Skipper says nothing. Maverick sees the wings on the 
	desk. He enters, walks over, stares down at them. He picks 
	them up. 
	
			GOOSE
	Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
	
			STINGER
	Don't.
	
			MAVERICK
	He's a good pilot.
	
			STINGER
	I talked a man back once. Three 
	months later, we lost him. It's his 
	decision. Only he knows.
	
			GOOSE
	He's the best you have. He's going 
	Top Gun!
	
			STINGER
	Was.
	
			MAVERICK
	What?
	
	
			STINGER
	Was going. (Turns to Maverick.) Now 
	you are.
	
			MAVERICK
	Me?
	
	Maverick stares at the wings, lost in conflicting emotions.
	
			STINGER
	Well, he's going (indicating Goose) 
	and he needs someone to fly the 
	plane.
	
			GOOSE
	Skipper, you can't do this!
	
			STINGER
	I didn't do it, he did it himself. 
	Something about a wife and kid. The 
	fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. 
	I know it. You were up there, you 
	know it, too.
			GOOSE
	Give him a break, Skipper. It was 
	raining snakes up there. He'll be 
	alright, soon as all the gorillas go 
	home...
	
	The Skipper stares at Goose, non-plussed for a moment.
	
			STINGER
	I know some RIOS are a little 
	wiggy...but you abuse the 
	priviledge! I don't believe I'm 
	going to have to put the two of you 
	in the same cockpit...but there it 
	is! It may be good for the Navy. It 
	might be good for you, but most of 
	all, it's good for me. It'll get 
	you out of my sight.
	
	
			GOOSE
	But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked 
	for Top Gun...He's the best of the 
	best!
	
			STINGER
	Well, you'll just have to make do 
	with him (indicates Maverick).
	
	Goose and Maverick exchange looks.
	
	
			GOOSE
	Mav's a great flyer but....
	
			STINGER
	He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, 
	he's so damn good he might have 
	been picked for Top Gun himself. 
	Except for one thing. (SCREAMS) He 
	just can't seem to follow orders!
	
	
	Stinger moves slightly, to stand now, directly in front of 
	Maverick and speak eye to eye at four inches.
	
			STINGER
	You just did an incredibly brave thing! 
	What you should have done was land your 
	plane. You don't own that plane, the 
	taxpayers do. I should ream you out for 
	it. But it just doesn't work with you. 
	You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe 
	...too good. You never really stepped in 
	it yet. So this is your chance. I'm 
	gonna send you up against the best. They 
	are better than you. Maybe they'll knock 
	that shine off your eagle and you'll 
	see, finally, where discipline and 
	teamwork fit it. 
	Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out 
	of it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir?
	
			STINGER
	That is all. Tell me about the MiG 
	some other time...
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir!
	
	He snaps off a salute and does an about face.
	
			STINGER
	Maverick..
	
	He turns back.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir..
	
			STINGER
	The wings..
	
	
	He looks down at the wings in his hands, slowing walks over 
	places them gently on the Skipper's desk.
	
			STINGER
	Gentlemen!
	
			MAVERICK/GOOSE
	Sir?
	
	
	His facade cracks just slightly.
	
			STINGER
	Good luck.
	
	
	37.  INT. PASSAGEWAY
	
	Maverick and Goose push through a gauntlet of aircrews. They 
	have become notorious. Guys grab at them...questions...the 
	MiGs?..What happened up there? How close did they get? What did 
	the MiGs do? One word is heard over and over..."TopGun". Goose is 
	left behind in the crowd. Maverick pushes through. He walks 
	fast...faster. Up ladders, around turns, down ladders, through 
	passageways. Faster. He breaks into a trot, then a canter, 
	squeezing past enlisted men, parts lockers, then he breaks into a 
	run...
	
	38.  EXT - CARRIER - NIGHT AND STORM
	
	A hatch slams open on the side of the Carrier. He's out on a 
	catwalk, instantly soaked, running on rain slicked stairs 
	cantilevered high over the breaking seas. He plunges forward to 
	the bow of the ship, stands on the very peak. He is yelling 
	something. He stands there as the bow plunges terrifyingly into 
	the trough. The water rises like a green mountain, up, up to 
	break just a few feet below him, showering him with spray. The 
	noise is incredible. 
	
	Come around on his face. It is maddened. He raises his fist and 
	punches the night.
	
	
	The foaming slope of the wave rushes up, changing color as it 
	DISSOLVES TO:
	
	Desert Sand whipping by...
	
	39.  MOJAVE DESERT - 1 WEEK LATER
	
	A big bike, a real big bike, a turbo...rockets across the 
	desert. Fast. Real fast. Aviator shades low above the handlebars 
	--Maverick. Goose hangs on in back. It cranks faster, pulls 
	closer...ENGINE SCREAMING. It cranks up a notch, it's going to 
	
	explode. It can't go faster, but it does. It SCREAMS HIGHER. It 
	ROARS under, by and away, leaving dust...
	
	
	39A.  THE BIKE - STILL
	
	Silence. Just the HISS AND POP OF METAL COOLING. Maverick sits 
	on it, staring out past us. Goose looks over Maverick's shoulder.
	
	We see why. Feet come into the frame. Then the uniform: 
	California Highway Patrol.
	
	
	40.  COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR SAN DIEGO
	
	40A.  ANGLE ON MAVERICK. CHP enters the frame, the usual 
	hypercivil arrogance tinged with awed disbelief. The usual 
	questions are spaced for effect as if he might be talking to some 
	other form of life. Maverick is off the bike, standing at 
	attention. Goose follows more slowly.
	
			CHP
	Son. Do you know why
	I stopped you?
	
	Maverick has some good idea how to deal with authority.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir. I do sir
	
	The CHP adjusts his own aviator shades.
			CHP
	Well... What   is   it?
	
			MAVERICK
	   (more than sincere)
	Sir. You are going to give me a 
	warning, Sir!
	
	
	CHP - A touch of a smile, quickly surpressed.
	
			CHP
	License and registration.
	
	Maverick hands them over with his Navy ID. CHP scans them, 
	hesitates a moment over the last, looks up with a touch more 
	respect.
	
			CHP
	Lieutenant, do you know how fast  
	you were going?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir. I do, Sir.
	
			CHP
	Well? 
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir. I was going Mach point one 
	five.
	
	CHP nods sagely.
	
			CHP
	One SIXTH the speed of sound!
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir.
	
			CHP
	   (a guess)
	Lieutenant... What do you...  
	usually fly?
	
			MAVERICK
	F-14's sir.
	
			CHP
	   (new respect)
	Tomcats?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir!
	
	A long pause. Respect in the cop's eyes. He taps the Navy ID on 
	the handlebars...staring at this sincere young man.
	
			CHP
	Lieutenant... Is there...
	a Russian attack?
	
			MAVERICK
	No sir! But you have to be ready. 
	
	
	The cop nods and stares at him.
	
	
	41.  EXT. MIRAMAR NAVAL AIR STATION - LATER
	
	
	41A.  OMIT
	
	
	The bike is BLURPING... barely going fast enough to stay 
	upright. Maverick cool in shades and campaign cap dorks past the 
	hanger with the sign: FIGHTERTOWN, USA. He pulls ahead. In back 
	of him, escorting with flashers...the CHP. They pull up at the 
	gate. Maverick and Goose salute the guard, hands over their ID. 
	The CHP gets out of his car, leans against the door.
	
			CHP
	Lieutenant.
	
	Maverick turns to him.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes, Sergeant?
	
			CHP
	Remember one thing.
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir?
	
			CHP
	Outside of this gate...
	I...am Top Gun.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir!
	
	He salutes. The CHP returns a snappy one. He gets back in his 
	car and turns away. Maverick receives his ID and clearance. As he 
	passes through, a couple of pilots in flight suits (ICE AND 
	HOLLYWOOD) stare at him. The taller, dark, cool one speaks in a 
	dry voice, meant to be overheard.
	
			ICE
	Uh oh, police escort. This one must 
	be a real killer.
	
	The second pilot grins big at them. Maverick turns slightly 
	stares over his shades at them as he passes. Goose grins back the 
	challenge.
	
	42.  AERIAL COMBAT - VIETNAM ERA - F4'S, MIG 17'S - STOCK 
	
	The Doors on the soundtrack.  Jets swoop, missiles fire, a plane 
	explodes. Gun camera views of MiGs, SAMS, flak, bombing runs...
	
			VIPER (V.O.) 
	During the Korean War, the Navy kill 
	ratio was twelve-to-one. We shot down 
	twelve of their jets for every one of 
	ours. In Vietnam, this ratio fell to 
	three-to-one. Our pilots depended on 
	missles. They lost their dogfighting 
	skills.
	
	
	
	F-14's fighting with F-5's. Music becomes current. 
	
			VIPER (V.O.) 
	Top Gun was created to teach ACM. Air 
	Combat Maneuvering...Dogfighting. 
	Richthofen, Guynemer, Rickenbacker, 
	Galland, Rudel, Bong would envy us. We 
	do just what they did, but we do it 
	beyond the speed of sound. 
	
	
	43.  INT. DAY - TOP GUN ORIENTATION ROOM.
	
	
	VIPER - A tough-looking, confident leader in a blue flight suit, 
	stands before a video-tape monitor. Behind him, on the monitor, 
	the dogfighting continues.
	
			VIPER
	By the end of Vietnam we upped our 
	kill ratio to thirteen to one. 
	
	
	He turns on the lights. We see his audience in F.G.
	
			VIPER
	You're here 'cause you're the top 
	one per cent of all naval aviators.
	
	THE CLASS 
	
	Sixteen young men - eight flight crews - sit at attention. They 
	are trim, fit and confident - high school heroes, college jocks.
	
			VIPER (V.O.) 
	You're the elite, the best of the 
	best. We're gonna make you better, 
	because you're job is damned 
	important. 
	
	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE MEN 
	
	The camera moves among them. Hold on one of the men; the one who 
	greeted Maverick at the gate, Ice.
	
			VIPER (V.O.)
	With the tensions in the world today, the potential for confron- 
	tation is greater than ever, and 
	carrier pilots will be the first 
	ones there. Air combat excellence 
	is vital.
	
	
	Ice is not looking at the speaker, but, rather, in our 
	direction. HOLLYWOOD, a blond, good-looking pilot, whispers 
	something to him, and gestures. Ice is getting the lowdown on 
	someone. The camera moves and we see who that someone is, as 
	Maverick enters the frame. 
	
			VIPER
	 ...Someone once asked me if 
	training men for air combat made 
	the world less safe--flying loaded 
	guns... an accidental confrontation 
	and so forth...
	
	Maverick feels the stare of the other man and glances in his 
	direction. Their eyes meet. Ice smiles coldly.
	
	
	ANGLE - VIPER 
	 		VIPER (Con't)
	My answer is: the dangerous thing 
	is being unprepared. You want 
	trouble, that's what you get when 
	things don't work out, when you 
	can't do what you say you can. When 
	you don't know what you can do. And 
	when your opponents aren't sure 
	either. We are not policy. We don't 
	make policy. Elected officials 
	...civilians, do that. We are the 
	instrument of policy. The tip of 
	the spear. So we had best be sharp.
	
	Maverick has turned to look at Ice. Ice glances back in his 
	direction. Maverick looks at the back of the room where guys in 
	blue flight suits stand. They are the instructors. They look 
	relaxed, poised, mean.  Goose is looking up front...Where Viper 
	has stopped. Goose nudges Maverick. 
	
			GOOSE
	   (whispers)
	What are you doing?
	
			MAVERICK
	Nothing...That's McGown...that's 
	Singer, isn't it?
			GOOSE
	Turn around, pay attention. What 
	are you doing?
	
			MAVERICK
	    (musing to himself)
	...Just wondering...(turns back) 
	...who is the best.
	
	
	He's shocked to find Viper staring right at him, with a killer 
	grin on his face. He's feels caught like a naughty schoolboy.
	
			VIPER
	Really...    (smiles)
	Ya know. We'd like to know who's 
	best too. That's why we've got that 
	plaque on the wall... with the Top 
	Top Gun crew from each class. You 
	think maybe your name's gonna be on 
	it?
	
	Maverick knows he's in trouble, considers the social 
	alternatives, then tells him the truth.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir.
	
	A couple of ooo's and aahh's from the guys. The instructors 
	stare the challenge at him. He slides lower in his seat.
	
			VIPER
	Considering the company you're in, 
	that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
	
			MAVERICK
	    (somewhat chastised)
	Yes sir.
	
			VIPER
	I like that in a fighter pilot.  
	(couple of laughs from the guys) 
	It's okay to be confident. You have 
	to think you're King Kong to want 
	to try to land on carriers. Just 
	keep in mind the other component of 
	success...teamwork.
	
	Viper gathers his notes, the lecture is over.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir.
	
	Viper turns back for one more thought.
	
			VIPER
	Gentlemen, this is about combat. 
	Remember, there are no points for 
	second place. Dismissed.
	Viper walks out. Maverick finds Goose looking at him, 
	quizzically. Others mill around the plaque.  A big, friendly bear 
	of a RIO speaks.
	
	
	
			WOLFMAN
	A plaque?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	It's not the plaque. The winner can 
	get assigned here as instructor. He 
	gets to fight every day.
	
	They move closer to examine the names on the plaque.
	
	
	44.  EXT. "O" CLUB - NIGHT.
	
	Fast cars in the driveway, fast music blares into the 
	night. It's Wednesday; Animal Night. Maverick, Goose 
	Hollywood and Wolfman walk to the entrance.
	
	
	
	45.  INT. WOXOF BAR
	
	
	Loud music, low ceiling, plaques of the squadrons line the 
	walls. A dancer gyrates on stage, largely ignored by pilots 
	talking with their hands. Every pretty girl in San Diego 
	seems to be here. It's a noisy, rowdy place--a "steam 
	releaser" for people under pressure. Nevertheless, there is 
	a control to it all, there are none of the usual bar types, 
	just pilots and Naval Officers.
	
	The Ghost Riders enter. The place is on fire:  a mob of 
	dancers, flashing lights, blaring HARD ROCK MUSIC. Beer 
	flows. Pilots talk flying and hustle girls.
	
	NEARBY - AN A7 pilot stands by the bar. He knows Goose and 
	speaks loudly for his benefit.. 
	
			A7 PILOT
	You know the Fighter Pilots motto? 
	It's better to be dead than to look 
	bad.
	
	They grin broadly. Goose replies as they brush past.
	
			GOOSE
	I don't know, Frank, anybody gets 
	off on bombing the shit out of dirt 
	has got to be queer.
	
	Goose exchanges friendly punches with the attack pilots. 
	Maverick's introductions and friendly barbs are drowned by the 
	music. Maverick is a bit reserved. He doesn't move among the 
	crowd as naturally as Goose does. Hollywood and Wolfman drift 
	
	away, searching for quarry. Goose orders beer. He nods toward a 
	TALL YOUNG MAN across the room.
	
			GOOSE
	Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew 
	him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
	
			MAVERICK
	Is there anybody in the Navy you 
	don't know? 
	
			GOOSE
	Gotta keep track of the 
	competition.
	
	Goose suddenly reaches out and grabs a guy moving past.
	
			GOOSE
	Slider -- they let you into Top 
	Gun? If you're among the best in 
	the Navy, I tremble for the 
	security of this country.
	
			SLIDER
	Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss 
	to get here?
	
			GOOSE
	The list is long, but 
	distinguished.
	
			SLIDER
	So's my Johnson.
	
			GOOSE
	This is Maverick.
	
	Smiles good-naturedly, shakes hands with Mav. 
	
			SLIDER
	So I've heard.
	
			GOOSE
	Who's your pilot?
	
			SLIDER
	Tom Kazansky.
	
			GOOSE
	    (very impressed)
	No shit. The Iceman....
	
			SLIDER
	Mister to you.
	
	
			GOOSE
	You think you can stay up with us.
	
			SLIDER
	I think, yeah, we'll show you a 
	thing or two.
	
			GOOSE
	This is Evan Mitchell, he steers 
	the thing. 
	
			SLIDER
	So I heard. Steers it pretty close. 
	Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was 
	a good man.
	
			MAVERICK
	Still is..
			SLIDER
	Yeah. That's what I meant.
	
	Suddenly, behind them, a flame shoots up. Someone ducks his head 
	and swallows it. The pilot sets an empty glass on the bar.
	
			SLIDER
	What was that?
	
			GOOSE
	Flaming Hooker. Sort of an 
	institution around here. Or maybe 
	this is the institution, I forget 
	which. It's the house drink. It'll 
	warm the cockles of your heart ... 
	and other things depending on where 
	you spill it.
	
	He motions to the barmaid and she moves over, sets them up. 
	GOOSE holds a demitasse glass. The barmaid pours Drambuie. They 
	look at Goose apprehensively. Goose looks at nearby flyers in 
	Camo fatigues.
			GOOSE
	You can't show fear in front of 
	Marines...They're like Doberman's 
	they'll go for your throat, it's 
	instinctive.
	
	He takes out match and lights it. Maverick holds his arm.
	
			MAVERICK
	You ever done this before?
	
			GOOSE
	What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
	
	
	He downs it all in one gulp, slaps the glass on the bar, still 
	aflame. He stands there, blinking. 
	
			SLIDER
	How was it?
	
			GOOSE
	Could use a dash more jet fuel.
	
	The others are duly impressed. Maverick's gaze falls on Ice 
	watching from the end of the bar - Slider takes one, Maverick 
	takes one too, downs it in a gulp. Sundown, taking up the 
	challenge, motions for one. The barmaid pours it.
	
			GOOSE
	Careful, don't make an ash of 
	yourself...
	
	He tries to drink the flaming concoction. He tries to go for a 
	sip, but it's too close to his face, he tries to tilt the flame 
	away, but that doesn't work. Finally he goes for the gulp. He 
	burns his lip and misses.  He sets his hair on fire. It goes up 
	in a WHOOOSH!!
	
			SUNDOWN
	Yeow!
	
			GOOSE
	Mayday! Down in flames! 
	
	He throws a beer in Sundown's face, quenching the fire. Sundown 
	blinks through the beer.
	
			SUNDOWN
	Thanks, I needed that.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	You guys are not only crazy, you're 
	dangerous!
	
	Ice comes up from the end of the bar. He motions the Barmaid for 
	another; it comes. Goose lights it. He gulps it down, cool as 
	hell.
			ICE
	    (Disdainfully)
	Frat boys.
	
	
	He walks away. Slider goes after him.
	
			MAVERICK
	Who is that guy?
	
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	That's Kazanski.
	
			GOOSE
	No shit! That why they call him Ice?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. 
	No mistakes. Wears you down. After 
	enough time, you just get bored and 
	frustrated, you do something stupid, and 
	he's got you.
	
	Maverick moves in Ice's direction. He passes Wolfman dancing 
	with a girl with bright purple fingernails.
	
	ANGLE - DANCEFLOOR.
	
			GIRL
	Why do you all have such funny 
	names?
	
			WOLFMAN
	You gotta have a call sign that's 
	just your own...never changes...you 
	have to recognize it immediately. 
	Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, 
	break left!"..you react right away.
	
			GIRL
	Why do they call you Wolf?
	
			WOLDFMAN
	   (smiles)
	Oh, I don't know.
	
	Goose comes up with his arm around a girl.
	
			GOOSE
	Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't 
	believe a word I say. Tell her I'm 
	married, will you?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yeah, he's married--but then again, 
	he,s not dead.
	
	Sally laughs and tries to pull Goose back toward the dance 
	floor. Something in Maverick's eyes makes him hang back with his 
	partner.
	ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - DANCERS
	
			GIRL
	Could I get a call sign?
	
	
			WOLFMAN
	Well, I don't know. That depends.
	
			GIRL
	On what?
	
			WOLFMAN
	Well, it doesn't just happen, you 
	gotta do something famous.
	
			GIRL
	Like what?
	
			WOLFMAN
	Oh...I'll think of something.
	
	Maverick smiles at this, but seems on edge... He watches a few 
	pretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits, then 
	turns and walks up to Ice, who sits, drinking with Slider.
	Maverick walks over to him. Ice notices Slider's attention going 
	to Maverick. He turns and grins at him.
	
			ICEMAN
	Figured it out yet?
	
			MAVERICK
	Figured out what?
	
			ICEMAN
	Who is the best.
	
			MAVERICK
	Nope.
	
			ICEMAN
	Need a hint?
	
			MAVERICK
	I think I can work it out on my 
	own.
	
			ICEMAN
	You like to work alone. I've heard 
	that about you. 
	
			MAVERICK
	I've heard of you, too. You were in 
	124 with Bargamian.
	
			ICEMAN
	And you were with Cougar. He was my 
	roommate in flight school.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	He's a good man.
			ICEMAN
	The best.
	
			SLIDER
	You must have soloed under a lucky 
	star. First the MiG, then you slide 
	into Cougar's place.
	
			GOOSE
	It's not Cougar's place. It's ours. 
	
			ICE
	What do you think it was? Was it 
	that MiG contact that did it?
	
			GOOSE
	Did what?
	
			ICE
	Got you here.
	
			GOOSE
	We're here because we're the best 
	flyers in the wing. Not because of 
	some MiG encounter.
	
			SLIDER
	What luck! Guys fly their whole 
	career without seeing a MiG up 
	close...You're famous.
	
			ICE
	You mean notorious.
	
	Something in the way he says it. It's not quite a joke, more an 
	insult. Maverick's about to take the whole conversation too far 
	when something...someone catches his eye. She catches quite a few 
	eyes in this room. She is very pretty and she's walking in on the 
	arm of a Commander. Maverick turns back, but the moment has 
	passed. Ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile. Goose pulls 
	him away.
	
			MAVERICK
	What do these guys think, I made 
	Cougar quit?
	
			GOOSE
	Pay no attention to it. They're 
	just trying to rattle you. It's all 
	psychological. Sit down..and drink.
	
	
	He deposits Maverick at a chair by a table where other pilots 
	cluster watching and listening to Bugs shoot down his wristwatch. 
	Maverick broods...
			BUGS
	We were just really diving down and by 
	then we were right over downtown 
	Haiphong.  It was some great shit. Jack 
	says, "What are you doing?" "What, what 
	am I doing, Jack?" He says, "What are 
	you doing?" I said, "I'm rolling in, 
	Jack." "Bugs, we're at thirty-two 
	hundred feet. Oh shit, we were like 
	zooom... So we scraped down at hundred 
	feet right over--downtown Hanoi!  Oh 
	shit, goddamn it! And blowing down the 
	river. And so once we were there we let 
	down to about fifty feet just going down 
	the river and Jack says... "Bugs... 
	don't ever do that again!" "Okay, right, 
	Jack, I'll never do that again!"
	
	Maverick pays little or no attention. He broods and drinks. 
	Suddenly, Hollywood nudges him, he turns.
	
			MAVERICK
	What, what is it?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Target passing. Check your six.
	
			MAVERICK
	Never mind mine. Check hers.
	
	They turn. Long legs, great ass, beautiful.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Her six is a ten! Uh oh, a turn to 
	engage.
	
	
	
	HIS POV - ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM
	
	Maverick sees a stranger, and somehow he knows, he knows even 
	then.  Wolfman turns, sees her walking too.
	
			WOLFMAN
	Bogey...9 o'clock level.
	
			SUNDOWN
	Nine thirty. Bogey?  You presume 
	that hostile?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	
	Well, we should contact and check 
	it out.
	
	
	She has turned toward them. She passes by. They start to make a 
	move for her. But just then she finds her date at the bar; a 
	distinguished man with Captain's stripes. Their smiles freeze and 
	they slide back in their chairs. Maverick can't stop looking at 
	her...After a while, the intensity of his gaze draws her 
	attention. She feels him. She is nodding and smiling to her date, 
	but her eyes scan the room like radar. A warning tone goes off in 
	his brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him. He feels that 
	thrill of excitement and fear you get when you know you're 
	targeted in someone's scope. Her eyes hold on him for a long 
	moment...long enough, and then sweep by the rest of the room. She 
	turns her attention back to the Captain and laughs at something 
	he says.
	
	
	Over in a corner, Goose chats up a couple of San Diego girls.
	
			GOOSE
	The family unit -- that's the most 
	important thing. It's the only 
	thing you can count on. I'm married 
	--did I tell you that?
	
			FIRST GIRL
	Four times. We don't believe you.
	
			GOOSE
	I've been married since I was 
	eighteen. Why don't you believe me?
	
			SECOND GIRL
	Because you don't look married. 
	
			FIRST GIRL
	You're not even wearing a ring.
	
			GOOSE
	    (big smile)
	I take it off when I'm chasing 
	women. It's the only honorable 
	thing to do.
	
	
	ANGLE - MAVERICK
	
	He's half listening to Bugs rattle on.  His eyes are drawn back 
	to the woman. He tries not to stare. She seems to know a lot of 
	people in the club. He looks away. Hollywood is chatting up a 
	girl with a sincerity that cannot be taught. His line is just as 
	polished as his appearance.
	
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	You don't think about death up 
	there, but you think a lot about 
	the danger. One mistake and you're 
	a smoking hole in the ground.
	
			GIRL
	I never knew it was so dangerous.
			HOLLYWOOD
	Oh yeah, it makes everything down 
	here more meaningful. You feel a 
	certain intensity of life, and you 
	want to grab onto every moment.
	
	Maverick looks up at the bar again. A shock. She (Charlie) is 
	staring right at him, intensely, as her date whispers something 
	in her ear. She notices him, staring back, quickly looks away, 
	embarrassed. She says something to the man. He nods and turns 
	away as someone else grabs his attention. The woman, now wouldn't 
	look this way for anything. She picks up her purse from the bar 
	and walks through the crowd and out of the room. Impulsively, 
	Maverick's up, he follows. 
	
	
	46.  INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE BAR
	
	He breaks out, looks around, doesn't see her. Someone disappears 
	around a corner. He moves after.
	
	CORNER - A door slams shut. Impulsively, before he realizes what 
	he is doing, he's through it. 
	
	
	47.  WOMEN'S ROOM. 
	
	A feminine GASP!  He should have looked at the sign on the door. 
	The realization of where he is hits him too late. She is standing 
	by the mirror, with her make-up out, looking back at him. He's 
	not quite sure what to do. A hasty retreat would be appropriate, 
	if embarrassing. Ah, what the hell, he is a fighter pilot!  He 
	just walks right over to her...no idea what he will say. She's 
	got her lipstick out, twisting it. She looks over at him with an 
	amused smile.
	
			CHARLIE
	Long cruise, was it?
	
	She leans over the sink, puts on lipstick, sees his eyes cover 
	her.
	
			CHARLIE
	Anything I can do to help, Lieutenant?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Lots of things. 
	
	She laughs. He is sort of attractive, but there are other girls 
	in the room, she doesn't want to be too encouraging...She tries 
	not to grin at his embarrassment.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'll bet!
	
			MAVERICK
	Uhhh...Anything I can do for you?
	She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, 
	but she's instinctively attracted.
	
			CHARLIE
	Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
	
	She hands him a makeup mirror. Starts redoing her lipstick. He 
	just stares at her...She looks up at him, than back to her 
	warpaint. Finally, when it comes, it is cool and amused.
	
			CHARLIE
	Now I know why all the girls come 
	here. They know how horny you guys 
	get. But this...is ridiculous.
	
			MAVERICK
	It's not that.
	
	Mock anger. She's toying with him.
	
			CHARLIE
	It isn't?
	
			MAVERICK
	Well, it is. It is that, too.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's a big comfort to me.
	
			MAVERICK
	I could be, too.
	
	 		CHARLIE
	How so?
	
			MAVERICK
	Save you from a big mistake with 
	that other guy.
	
			CHARLIE
	And on to a bigger one with you?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Yeah, most likely.
	
			CHARLIE
	Was there ever a girl who didn't 
	like fighter pilots?
	
			MAVERICK
	I heard of one once.
	
	She laughs again, shakes her head...another cowboy! She gently 
	takes the compact out of his hands, snaps it closed.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'm really flattered, Lieutenant, 
	but I don't go out with pilots.
			MAVERICK
	Then what are you doing here?
	
	Three pretty blondes enter and look at Maverick quizzically but 
	not without interest.
	
			CHARLIE
	I think the question is...what are 
	you?
	
	She tries to keep a straight face as she walks out of the room. 
	
	The other girls look at him expectantly.  A beat.  He just 
	stands there, then realizes he's holding her lipstick. 
	
			MAVERICK
	Hi. I'm here to talk about a new 
	concept in cosmetics...
	
	47A.  WOXOF BAR. She returns, spots the Captain, motioning to 
	her.  Maverick enters, goes to the other end of the bar. He 
	orders a drink. It comes. He drinks it, pays for it, moves off 
	toward the door. Someone backs into his path, he moves quickly 
	and bumps into someone else; her. 
	
			CHARLIE
	Sorry.
	
	She sees it's him.
	
			MAVERICK
	My fault. Should have watched
	where I was going.
	
	Her hand goes to his collar. She adjusts his insignia. She 
	smiles.
	
			CHARLIE
	
	Where's your wing man? Who's 
	watching your six?
	
			MAVERICK
	Uh, nobody, I guess.
	
	One final adjustment.
	
			CHARLIE
	Too bad.
	
	She breaks the spell abruptly, turns away.
	
			CHARLIE
	See you around.
	
	Maverick finds his voice.
	
			MAVERICK
	Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'm with someone. 
	
	
	48.  EXT. "O" CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT
	
	P.O.V. - 
	
	From a car in the parking lot, we see Charlie and the Captain 
	leave the club. They walk directly toward us and stop. She turns, 
	says something polite...a peck on the cheek. He turns away. A 
	dome light briefly illuminates the interior of the car as a door 
	opens. It rocks slightly as someone gets in. Charlie turns back 
	and walks over, taking her keys out. She opens the door to the 
	car and gets in. 
	
	
	48A.  EXT. CAR - NIGHT
	
	She starts the car and pulls away. Suddenly, a figure sits up in 
	the back.
	
			MAVERICK
	I thought he'd never leave.
	
			CHARLIE
	Yeow!
	
	Startled, she nearly drives off the road. She turns to him, 
	startled.
	
			CHARLIE
	You! What are you doing here?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Everybody's got to be somewhere.
	
			CHARLIE
	What if Captain Dawson had come 
	with me?
	
			MAVERICK
	It would have been really 
	embarrassing!
	
			CHARLIE
	How did you know this was my car?
	
			MAVERICK
	Simple deduction. It's fast. It's 
	pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's 
	your color...matches your lipstick.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's all!
	
			MAVERICK
	And I asked someone.
			CHARLIE
	You think you're pretty smart.
	
			MAVERICK
	I think I'm in love.
	
	
	49.  EXT. GUARD GATE
	
	She pulls up at the guard gate, a MARINE CORPORAL is on duty. He 
	sees the pretty girl pull up and stop, leans over helpfully.
	
			MARINE
	Can I help you, Ma'am?
	
	She smiles even more sweetly.
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't know, Corporal. Can you do 
	anything about this lunatic?
	
	The car door swings open. Maverick gets out. The car roars away. 
	He stands in the glare of the spotlight...rocking on his heels, 
	looking across at the guard, who snaps to attention and stares 
	holes in his chest.
	
	
	50.  INT. TOP GUN - NEXT MORNING. 
	
	
	Two guys in flight suits run down stairs past stencils of MiG 
	kills on walls, then down corridor.
	
			FLEX
	Not so fast...my head.
	
	They skid to stop outside a door.
	
	
	51.  INT. HANGAR
	
	Ground crews work on planes in B.G. Jester in middle of lecture.
	Door bursts open. Sundown and Flex skid to a halt when they see 
	whole class looking at them.
	
			JESTER
	Who are you?
	
			SUNDOWN
	I'm Sundown.
	
			JESTER
	Yeah, right. You're late.
	
	
	Viper breaks in, indicating Flex.
	
			VIPER
	And who are you?
	
			FLEX
	Flex 
	
			VIPER
	Flex...? You don't look like Flex  
	to me. You call that muscle? 
	Doesn't look like muscle. Looks 
	like...Pork.
	
	They laugh. Even Sundown has to laugh, scratching his chest.
	
			VIPER
	What're you laughing at? You're 
	Fungus.
	
	Stops scratching.
			SUNDOWN/FUNGUS
	Fungus!
	
			PORK
	Don't make an issue of it, it'll 
	stick.
	
			FUNGUS (Unhappily)
	
	It'll stick anyway. 
	
	Viper turns away...
	
			VIPER
	Now to continue. In this class we 
	will be dealing with F-5's and 
	A4's, as our MiG simulators. 
	Technically the F-5 does not have 
	the thrust to weight ratio of the 
	MiG-21--it also does not bleed 
	energy below 300 knots like the 
	MiG-21 does. The A4 does not turn 
	as well as the MiG-17 but has 
	significantly better visibility.
	
	Maverick looks back to his notes. SFX footsteps...door 
	opening. Viper looks up to back of room door.
	
			VIPER
	Hi, Charlie. Good, our TAGREF's 
	here. Charlie's the most qualified 
	to get into P subs and curves, and 
	VN diagrams.
	
	Maverick turns to see the TAGREF walk forward.  Maverick 
	stares at her as she passes without acknowledging him. He is 
	surprised, embarrassed.
	
			VIPER
	Charlotte Blackwood--code name Charlie-- 
	not your ordinary TAGREF. Charlie has 
	her Ph.D. in astrophysics--she's a 
	civilian contractor so you don't salute 
	her...or anything else. Is that clear?
	
	She walks to the front and starts her presentation. She 
	talks about something very technical, arcane. MiG tactics, 
	technology. As the briefing rattles on, Maverick reacts to 
	her. Goose glances over at him. He, too, recognizes the girl. 
	He looks at his partner. Maverick feels his stare.
	
			CHARLIE
	Hello, I think I have some new data for 
	you...Now a MiG 21 has a problem with 
	the inverted flight tanks. It won't do a 
	Negative G push over. Even below one G, 
	they risk a flame out. Operationally, 
	they will do a zero to one G only.
	
	A snicker from the audience. She hesitates momentarily, goes 
	on.
			CHARLIE
	
	The latest intelligence shows that 
	the most they will do in operation 
	is one....is there something wrong, 
	Lieutenant.
	
			MAVERICK
	I don't think you're altogether 
	right...about the MiG, that is.
	
	She stops--some of the pilots look at him. Viper glares.
	
			CHARLIE
	I beg your pardon.
	
			MAVERICK
	No, I beg yours. But I don't think 
	you're right on that.
	
			CHARLIE
	Why not?
	
			MAVERICK
	I saw one.
	
			CHARLIE
	You saw a MiG 21?
	
			MAVERICK
	I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
	
			CHARLIE
	    (She doesn't believe him)
	Where did you see that?
	
			MAVERICK
	It's classified.
	
	Nervous buzz in the room. Viper goes rigid. Charlie can't 
	believe it.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's what?
	
			MAVERICK
	It's classified. Like Hollywood 
	says, I could tell you, but then 
	I'd have to kill you.
	
	Pork stifles a laugh, the others chuckle. Viper is 
	embarrassed.
	
			VIPER
	Maverick!!!
	
	
	She stops Viper with a glance.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's all right.
	
	She can handle it. She is very cool, not overbearing. She 
	says it calmly. She doesn't want to embarrass him any more 
	than he is, but she has to get the facts straight.
	
			CHARLIE
	 Lieutenant, I have a top secret 
	clearance. The Pentagon sees to it 
	that I know more than you.
	
			MAVERICK
	Not in this case.
			CHARLIE
	    (Flatly.)
	You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes, ma'am.
	
			CHARLIE
	Where were you?
	
			MAVERICK
	On his six.
	
	Little stifled laughs.
	
			CHARLIE
	He was in a 4G Negative dive and 
	you were on his six?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was 
	directly above him.
	
	She stares at him for a moment, then she has him. She goes 
	for the kill.
	
			CHARLIE
	If you were directly above him, how 
	did you see him?
	
			MAVERICK
	I was inverted.
	
	A real buzz in the room.  Ice laughs audibly.
	
			CHARLIE
	You were in a 4G inverted dive with 
	a MiG 21?   (She can't believe it.)
	
	At what range ?
	
			MAVERICK
	Two.
	
			CHARLIE
	Two miles.
	
			MAVERICK
	Two meters.
	
	
	Chuckles, barely suppressed. Goose pipes up to deflect 
	attention.
	
			GOOSE
	One and a half, actually. I got a 
	polaroid.
	
			CHARLIE
	    (Flatly.)
	Lieutenant...
			MAVERICK
	Ma'am?
	
			CHARLIE
	What were you doing there?
	
			MAVERICK
	Giving him the bird.
	
	Open laughter. She thinks it's at her. She grows red.
	
			CHARLIE
	The what?
	
			MAVERICK
	You know. The finger.
	
	He shows her, but she can handle this. 
	
			CHARLIE
	So you're the reason those
	SALT talks failed.
	
	The room breaks into laughter. At him. Now he grows red. 
	Goose puts his hand on Maverick's arm, shakes his head as if 
	to say: "Let it go, pal, she got you". 
	
	She looks at Viper. He doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. 
	He knows there's something here he doesn't control.
	
			VIPER
	Lieutenant!
	
	
			GOOSE
	It's just like he says, sir.
	
			VIPER
	    (He snaps)
	I don't care!
	
	
	51A. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE LECTURE HALL
	
	She walks away. He runs up and stops her.
	
			MAVERICK
	Why didn't you tell me you were a 
	TAGREF?
	
	She studies him coolly for a moment, like a specimen.
	
			CHARLIE
	It never came up.
	
			MAVERICK
	You let me make a fool of myself.
	
			CHARLIE
	You seemed determined to do that 
	anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you 
	were a famous MiG insulter?
			MAVERICK
	Would it have made a difference? 
	
			CHARLIE
	No.
	
			MAVERICK
	What would?
	
			CHARLIE
	You know, I'm assigned to this 
	school. I see sixteen new hotshots 
	every eight weeks. Your attention 
	is flattering, but not really 
	productive. Why don't you keep your 
	mind on flying.
	
	She reaches over and aligns his collar insignia.
	
			CHARLIE
	Why can't you keep this straight?
	
	She smiles at him and walks away. Maverick turns, sees the 
	others sizing him up. Most of them grin. Maverick moves down 
	the corridor past the CO's Office. Viper leans against the 
	
	doorsill. He lights a pipe, laconically eyes Maverick. His 
	tone gives away nothing, like an ELINT probe eliciting a 
	response.
	
			VIPER
	Maverick... Where'd you get that 
	call sign?
	
			MAVERICK
	Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
	
			VIPER
	You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir.
	
			VIPER
	A good man. Good flyer.
	
	Viper turns away. 
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir. Thank you sir.
	
	Maverick watches him for a beat, he's been tested, but he's 
	not sure how or why. He turns to catch up with Goose and the 
	others.
	
	EXT. SKY - LATER
	
	At twenty-eight thousand feet, the two planes circle each 
	other, going in opposite directions. As they jockey for 
	position, they snap past each other like ends of bullwhips.
	
	The earth spins, the horizon appears and disappears. With 
	each hard turn, Maverick and Goose can be heard "grunting" to 
	keep blood in their brains, to keep from passing out.
	
	The fight is hard, physical, and exhausting. The extreme G 
	forces--6.5--flatten them against their seats, causing their 
	heads to weigh over one hundred pounds. Maverick strains to 
	turn his head and track the other jet as it streaks past at 
	Mach One. 
			MAVERICK
	I've lost him -- where is he?
	
			GOOSE
	On your six -- coming hard. Four 
	hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on 
	your six and closing fast!
	Hard left! HARD LEFT!
	
	
	Maverick jerks the stick left, and the F-14 takes an 
	astonishing turn. Jester ROARS past into a wide arc.
	
			GOOSE
	Great move. Great
	
			MAVERICK
	He should've had me.
			GOOSE
	Take it down. Let's bug out of 
	here. Call for a draw.
	
			MAVERICK
	No way. I'll nail him this time. 
	Going vertical.
	
	
	THE PLANE EXPLODES INTO AFTERBURNER - rocketing toward 
	space. Jester is left in direct line with the sun, and his 
	canopy is sprayed with a blinding glare. Going ballistic is 
	dangerous. The plane flys like a bullet, obeying the laws of 
	physics, not the pilot's touch on control surfaces. The 
	ballistic call warns other aircraft that he is, for the 
	moment, out of control.
	
			GOOSE
	He's blind -- you got him!
	
			JESTER
	NO JOY! NO JOY! WHERE ARE YOU?
	I'VE LOST SIGHT.
	
			GOOSE
	He's out of energy! You got 
	control? Unload!
	
	The F-14 peels over the egg, in a backward dive. It rockets 
	down the outside, gaining energy. Over the ROAR of jets, the 
	SCREAM of the wind, Goose shouts data, but it is muffled, a 
	distant voice in a typhoon. Through the canopy, we see 
	Jester, and he hangs in the air like a sparrow in the path of 
	a falcon.
	
	PILOT'S POV - HUD in windscreen - a diamond in a box. 
	Maverick lines up the diamond with Jester, and we hear the 
	high pitched tone BEEPING.
	
			JESTER
	WE'RE BELOW THE HARD DECK. FIGHT'S 
	OFF.
	
			GOOSE
	He's right. We're at ten thousand.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	No way. I got you, sucker. You're 
	going down.
	
	Jester maneuvers, but Maverick keeps him in the gunsight. 
	The BEEPING is louder, faster.
	
			MAVERICK
	In the envelope. FOX TWO MISSILE 
	SHOT. YOU'RE GONE, JESTER, DEAD! 
			GOOSE
	    (stunned)
	Goddamn! We beat him!
	
	There is an edge of anger in Jester's voice.
	
			JESTER
	ROGER FOX TWO. GET YOUR BUTTS ABOVE 
	THE HARD DECK. RETURN TO BASE 
	IMMEDIATELY.
	              
	They are brought up short for a moment, then the thrill of 
	victory gets the best of them. Goose lets out a war whoop. 
	The F-14 sweeps up, rolls into an Immelman..
	
			MAVERICK
	We did it!
	
			GOOSE
	Look, Ma, top of the world!
	
	
	52A.  EXT. MIRAMAR - LANDING PATTERN.
	
	Maverick's Tomcat breaks hard and high, rolls over on its 
	side, wings perpendicular to the ground. Goose sees the world 
	go sideways.
	
			GOOSE
	Ahhh...A little high on the left, 
	don't you think?
	
			MAVERICK
	Right.
	
	He aileron rolls another quarter turn. Inverted, they pass 
	right down the runway.  Goose looks out and insouciantly 
	watches the world go by at 300 knots, upside down.
	
			GOOSE
	Right. Much better. ...Ahhh...what 
	do you call this?
	
	
	
			MAVERICK
	It's a victory roll.
	
			GOOSE
	I wouldn't call it victory.  It's 
	more like...self immolation.
	
	
	52B.  INT. CONTROL TOWER 
	
	Controllers work. Officers watch the landing activity. One 
	old salt, turns from the coffee machine, a cup of steaming 
	Java microns from his lips. A ROAR. VABOOM! The Tomcat roars 
	over. He yelps as hot coffee flys all over his shirt.         
	                                                    52C.  
	EXT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
	They complete the roll, bank left, zoom right by the tower, 
	level with the observation window. 
	
	                                                             
	52D.  F-14'S POV. Controllers look out at the F-14, mouths 
	drop open. 
	
	
	52E.  ANGLE GOOSE
	
	He waves jauntily.
	
			GOOSE
	Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in 
	there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at 
	one point I did want a Navy career.
	
			MAVERICK
	Come on, relax...
	
			GOOSE
	You see all those guys with gold on 
	their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I 
	think that was Johnson, Air Boss of 
	the Kitty Hawk! 
	
			MAVERICK
	Come on, we beat an instructor. How 
	many times in your life do you get 
	to do a victory roll? 
	
			GOOSE
	Just once, if they take your plane 
	away.
	
	They roll out, break over the runway.
	
	
	                                                      ***
	52F.  EXT. FLIGHTLINE. 
	
	Maverick and Goose walk by parking Tomcats...Ice is 
	unstrapping, Slider is climbing down. Ice looks at Maverick, 
	says one word.
	
			ICEMAN
	Cowboys!
	
	Maverick keeps walking...Goose hangs back.
	
			SLIDER
	Nice. Always a good idea to show up 
	your instructors.
	He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose 
	indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
	
			GOOSE
	Hey, see any controls back there? 
	   (thinks about team loyalty, 
	   reacts to Jester's glare...)
	And anyway...we beat the Son of a 
	Bitch!
	
	He turns and runs to catch up with Maverick.
	
	
	53.  INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
	
	Pilots half undressed. Maverick and Goose enter the room, 
	carrying their helmets. The students look up at them, and 
	Goose suddenly flashes a thumb's up sign with a grin. The 
	students react with clenched fists, ad libs, high fives, 
	victory punches.
	
			WOLFMAN
	You won?!!!
	
			MAVERICK
	Didn't everybody?
	
	"Oooo" -- they all go "ooo" and laugh.
	                                                 
			WOLFMAN
	No, we...got our butts kicked.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Thirty seconds. That's all it took 
	to blow us out of the sky.
	                                                
			WOLFMAN
	
	We went like this, he went like 
	that. I say to Hollywood: Where'd 
	he go? Hollywood says: where'd who 
	go?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	And he's laughing. Right over the 
	radio, He's laughing at us.
	
	Attention turns to the doorway as Ice and Slider enter. Ice 
	gives a brief dramatic pause, then flashes thumbs up and 
	smiles. The students celebrate Ice's win.  Ice handles the 
	attention with the easy composure of one who is used to it. 
	Maverick ignores him and begins to peel out of his G-suit. 
	Ice moves toward his locker.
	                                                      ***
			GOOSE
	You won. 
	Congratulations.		HOLLYWOOD
	Maverick and Goose won too.
	
	Ice talks into his locker.
	
			ICE
	That's not what I heard.
	
			GOOSE
	We won! 
	Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his 
	locker, dismissing them.
	
			ICE
	Below the hard deck doesn't count. 
	You guys are the second team, 
	aren't you?
	
	Maverick gets up, moves to him, starts to say something, 
	when Jester, breaks into the room.
	
			JESTER
	Maverick, Goose. Viper's office. Now!
	
	
	53A. INT. TOPGUN CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CO'S OFFICE.
	
	
	SCREAMING AND YELLING.  A lot of screaming and yelling, 
	muffled by the door.
	
	                                                             
	53B. INT. ANTEROOM. 
	
	Enlisted Yeomen and Chiefs go about their clerical duties in 
	acute embarrassment mixed with curiousity. Behind the CO'S door, 
	someone is screaming his head off.
	
	
	BOOM! The door bursts open. A big, brawling Officer - Johnson, 
	the Air Boss - blasts out, nearly smashing into a female petty 
	officer. She almost spills her coffee. Johnson looks right and 
	left in fury too strong for words. He looks like he wants to 
	smash something. They move out of his way, but he justs blasts 
	through the door and disappears down the hall.
	The enlisted men turn to Viper's office.
	
	
	53D  THEIR POV
	
	Jester stands inside stonefaced. Maverick and Goose are 
	rigid. Viper...with excess calm deliberation, softly walks 
	over, grasps the doornob. He glances in this direction. The

	53D. ANGLE ENLISTED (MEN)
	
	In a flash, each man finds something totally engrossing in 
	his work, or something terribly important to do elsewhere. 
	Slowly, steadily, Viper swings his door closed.54.  INT. 
	VIPER'S OFFICE 
	
	He moves over to face Maverick. There is a SILENCE like 
	after a train wreck; nothing but the POPPING of sprung metal 
	and the low GASP of escaping steam. Viper speaks quietly, 
	like a funeral director consoling the living. Makes you want 
	to scream.
	
			VIPER
	Well....That about covers the 
	flyby. 
	
	Jester almost breaks into a grin.
	
			VIPER
	Now...in addition...you broke two 
	major rules of engagement. And... 
	That's ...not good.
	
	
	Maverick gives no response. Viper continues.
	
			VIPER
	Lieutenant Candela lost sight of 
	you, and called "no joy". You 
	failed to respond. 
	
	He stops and looks at Maverick... A beat. Maverick finally 
	nods 
			VIPER
	Why?
	
	
	Maverick is exhausted. It's been a long, rough day. His 
	voice is a horse whisper.
	
			MAVERICK
	I had him in view. I was peeling 
	over the egg, into a dive. He saw 
	me when I moved in for the kill. 
	There wasn't any danger...
	
			VIPER
	    (to Goose)
	Is that how you remember it?
	
			GOOSE
	Yes, sir. By the time we could 
	respond, we were diving right into 
	his view.
	
	Viper is not satisfied with the answer, but he moves on.
	
			VIPER
	The hard deck for this hop was ten 
	thousand feet. Jester, at what 
	point did you call off the fight?
	
			JESTER
	Just below ten thousand.
	
			VIPER
	But you continued to fight.
	
	Another pause, another grudging nod.
	
			VIPER
	Why?
	
			MAVERICK
	We weren't below for more than ten 
	seconds. There was no danger. I had 
	the shot. I took it.
	
			VIPER
	The rules of engagement are not 
	flexible. They exist for your  
	safety. You will obey them.
	Is that clear?
	
	Maverick thinks about continuing the discussion, but the 
	thought is momentary. He quickly cuts his losses, gives Viper 
	what he thinks he wants...He is just on the cusp of too 
	sincere.
	
			MAVERICK
	
	Yes sir, perfectly clear. I guess 
	we were ...I was... just a little 
	over enthusiastic.
	
	Viper measures him for a moment, then lets it go.
	
			VIPER
	I guess you were. Dismissed.
	
	Maverick and Goose leave the room. Viper looks at Jester, 
	picks up Maverick's fitness report. Doesn't read it, looks 
	back at Jester.
	
			JESTER
	I don't know what to tell you, 
	Skip.
	
			VIPER
	Tell me one thing.
	
	Jester waits.
	
	
			VIPER
	...If you had to go into combat, 
	would you want him with you?
	
	Jester turns, walks slowly around the room. The walls are 
	lined with pictures; planes and pilots...history. There are 
	MiG killers, attack squadrons, ground personnel...There's one 
	picture of a Phantom in flight with the backseater mooning 
	the camera. Other pictures show carriers, famous flyers, 
	previous CO's. Finally Jester replys.   
	
			JESTER
	Yep.
	
	Viper slaps shut the fitness report. 
	
			JESTER
	He's seat of the pants... 
	Completely unpredictable -- nothing 
	by the book. All over the sky. But 
	I don't know, Skip, he's really got 
	something.
	
			VIPER
	Yeah, we get one of these guys 
	every damn class.  (laughs) 
	"Maverick!" 
	
	He throws the report on the desk.
	
			JESTER
	
	Yup, a wild pony.

	56.  INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
	
	Wind ROAR, jet WHINE. Hollywood and Wolfman are being thrown 
	about as Hollywood fights the stick.
	
	
			WOLFMAN
	No. No. Look out, you lost it.
	
	
	They depart flight. Tumble. The horizon swings wildly as 
	they go into flat spin.
	
			WOLFMAN
	We're dead!
	
	
	A face appears at 12,000 feet, right in front of their 
	canopy. Goose's eyes bug at them.
	
			GOOSE
	Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser 
	butts are scattered across KANSAS.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	    (disgusted with himself)
	Come on. I died enough for one 
	night.
	
	
	56A.  EXT. COCKPIT
	
	They climb out of the simulator - A cockpit sprung on 
	moveable rams, surrounded by a dome on which video images are 
	projected.
	
	As they climb down, Maverick and Goose climb up into the 
	cockpit to take their place.
	
			GOOSE
	Have you guys ever considered 
	career counseling?
	
	
	57. OMITTED
	
	
	56B. SIMULATOR CONTROL ROOM - Filled with computers, tape 
	transports and video screen representations of computer 
	generated combat. Now Maverick flies it as Charlie and other 
	techs watch.
	
	56C. COCKPIT
	
	Maverick flys the heck out of it. It's real. It lurches and 
	bumps, the NOISES and sights look real. He gets on the tail 
	of a MiG. It breaks, he breaks, then what he does is just too 
	fast to follow. It screams around in a turn. Suddenly, there 
	is a WHUMMP...ALARMS...the lights come on.
	
			GOOSE
	What happened.
	
			TECH (V.O. FILTERED)
	What did you do in there?
	
			GOOSE
	What did you do? You broke it!
	58. COMPUTER ANALYSIS ROOM 
	
	Maverick and Goose enter. The techs cluster around the 
	keyboards trying to reprogram, to figure out what went wrong.
	
			CHARLIE
	You flew it off the template. 
	Nobody ever did that before.
	
			GOOSE
	That's what she said last night.
	
	She stares at Goose until he grins and moves off to give the 
	others his valuable opinions on how to reprogram the 
	computers.
	
			CHARLIE
	What is it about you?
	
	He just shrugs at her and smiles.
	
			MAVERICK
	What would you say, too fast...too 
	quick...
	
			CHARLIE
	And far too aggressive.
	
			MAVERICK
	It is combat. Every second counts. 
	
			CHARLIE
	
	The hottest moves in the world 
	aren't gonna help you if you wind 
	up alone.  Your wingman's got to be 
	able to follow you. Trust you. Know 
	that he can depend on you. It's 
	more than just fancy flying.
	
			MAVERICK
	Well, what you need...what you have 
	to keep looking for...what you want 
	to get is a wingman who can stay up 
	with you. Who can match you move 
	for move. Then you've got 
	something.  I'm sorry.
	
			CHARLIE
	For what?
	
			MAVERICK
	That stuff about the MiG. I was out 
	of line.
	
			CHARLIE
	Apology acknowledged.
	
			MAVERICK
	Is that all?
			CHARLIE
	What else do you want?
	
			MAVERICK
	Um. You.
	
			CHARLIE
	There you go with those moves 
	again.
	
			MAVERICK
	Too aggressive?
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't mix with the boys. I work 
	here. Let's keep it professional.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm special.
	
			CHARLIE
	   (laughs)
	Yes. I'll give you that!
	
			MAVERICK
	Give me a break, I'm asking you 
	out.
	
	
			CHARLIE
	I can't.
	
			MAVERICK
	I thought there was something... 
	That night in the club...
	
			CHARLIE
	Lieutenant...
	
			MAVERICK
	Evan... or Maverick.
	
			CHARLIE
	Maverick...you know the rules of 
	engagement.
	
			MAVERICK
	    (can't believe it.)
		The what?
	
			CHARLIE
	Some one comes up hot on your six, 
	what do you do?
	
			MAVERICK
	What are you talking about?
	
			CHARLIE
	You turn into him, check him out, 
	identify friend or foe.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm not your foe.
			CHARLIE
	And if he's harmless, you 
	disengage.
	
			MAVERICK
	Harmless!
	
			CHARLIE
	Uh hum.
	
			MAVERICK
	What if he's not?
	
			CHARLIE
	You have to shoot him down....If 
	he's smart, he'll turn away before 
	that happens.
	
			MAVERICK
	
	Harmless. Nobody ever called me 
	harmless before...
	
			CHARLIE
	And probably never again. It's 
	nothing personal. It's just...I 
	know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm 
	immune...
	
			MAVERICK
	Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And 
	I don't give up. Everything I've 
	ever wanted I've had to work like 
	hell for. Well, how about it?
	
			CHARLIE
	How about what?
	
			MAVERICK
	How about anything, anything you 
	want to do.
	
			CHARLIE
	Hard to argue with that, isn't 
	it...
	
			MAVERICK
	A date... Coffee... A drink...A 
	walk in the park.
	
			CHARLIE
	What about the plane?
	
			MAVERICK
	What plane.
	
			CHARLIE
	Most of them invite me to sit in 
	the cockpit...play with the levers 
	and things. 
			MAVERICK
	Well, get used to it.
	
			CHARLIE
	Used to what?
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm different. 
	
			CHARLIE
	I'm starting to sense that now.
	
			MAVERICK
	
	You're slow to engage. But you'll 
	come around.
	
	She pushes him out the door
	
			MAVERICK
	Let's make it at eight.
	
			CHARLIE
	Make what?
	
			MAVERICK
	Anything.
	
			CHARLIE
	Okay, anything. Just...go. I've 
	gotta work.
	
	She closes the door, turns back to her screen.

	59A.  BEACH LA JOLLA - DAY
	
	A day off. Pilots, other personnel are enjoying a day at the 
	beach. There are bikinis, and beer, sunfishes and water 
	skiing. The annual Over-the-Line (a variation of softball) 
	tournament is in progress. The team from the Teddy Kennedy 
	Driving School is whipping another known as Scum de Terre. 
	The pilots are doing pretty well at blowing off steam.
	
	59B.  UNDERSEA
	
	Undulating sea grass. Muffled HISS of the surf. A pretty 
	fish comes into view. A spear shoots through it, and nails it 
	to the ocean floor.
	
	59C.  SHORELINE
	
	Two figures pop to the surface and wade in to the beach. 
	Maverick holds the wriggling fish. Charlie is repulsed. She 
	pulls off her mask and snorkle, follows him in to shore..
	59D. THE BEACH
	
	They flop down. He drops the fish in front of her, sees her 
	reaction at watching its death throes.
	
			CHARLIE
	Why'd you do that?
	
			MAVERICK
	   (surprised)
	
	I had the shot.
	
	She looks at him for a moment, then turns away, fiddles with 
	her mask.
	
			MAVERICK
	It dies. We live.
	
			CHARLIE
	You're an animal.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's true. What are you?
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't enjoy watching things 
	suffer.
	
	He smashes the fish on a rock. It is still.
	
			CHARLIE
	No!
	
			MAVERICK
	It's not suffering anymore.
	
			CHARLIE
	   (she looks at him strangely,  
	   half jokes)
	You're horrible
	
			MAVERICK
	You're not, cause you eat frozen 
	meatballs?   (he puts it down)
	Things die. Every time you breathe, 
	you kill millions of tiny 
	organisms. Every time you eat, 
	something had to die. 
	
			CHARLIE
	You don't have to kill it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Somebody does. It's more honest 
	this way. You do your own dirty 
	work.
	
			CHARLIE
	You ever think about killing 
	another human being?
	
			MAVERICK
	About as much as they think about 
	killing me.
	
	
			CHARLIE
	Does it bother you?
	
			MAVERICK
	They know the rules...(this is too 
	strong for her, she turns away, he 
	comes around to her.) That's the 
	deal. That's why you're up there. 
	It's him or me. That's the price of 
	admission. (she draws away) It 
	bothers you, why? You're part of 
	it. (She stiffens, he's losing her. 
	He softens)  Everybody dies. Most 
	people don't get to die for 
	something.
	
	You don't want to confront it, do 
	you. You want to keep it all clean, 
	cerebral... velocity vectors, 
	wing-load diagrams...You ever been 
	up?
	
			CHARLIE
	Flying?
			MAVERICK
	You use your mind to keep things at 
	a distance. You ever just let go?
	
	She doesn't answer.
	
			MAVERICK
	You know what really scares me? 
	Living too long. Losing my hair and 
	my teeth...and my guts and my wind. 
	And my brains...Sitting in a room 
	with my hands in my lap, watching 
	daytime TV. 
	
			CHARLIE
	You don't believe any of this. You 
	don't think you'll ever die.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's it, of course. When I'm up 
	there and doing it, I'm cheating it 
	every second. I'm subverting all 
	laws...gravity...whatever. I'm 
	skating the edge of it.
	
			CHARLIE
	Winston Churchill.
	
			MAVERICK
	
	What?
	
			CHARLIE
	What he said..."There's nothing so 
	exhilarating as being shot at 
	without result."
	
			MAVERICK
	All you've got is one life. I guess 
	it's worth about the same to every 
	body. You ever see an old woman 
	after her husband has died? And the 
	meaningless years of decline 
	stretch ahead...  When you're in 
	the air and doing something really 
	dangerous, you can look ahead... 
	maybe ten seconds. That's your 
	whole future. That's as far as it 
	goes. But imagine what those 
	seconds are worth.
	
			CHARLIE
	What if you kill yourself? Think of 
	everything you'll miss.
			MAVERICK
	There is lots of stuff I don't know 
	about...  Fine wine... great art... 
	the opera. I guess if I live long 
	enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, 
	I'll never miss it.
	
			CHARLIE
	Are you really that brave?
	
			MAVERICK
	    (shakes his head no.)
	I watched my mother die. Cancer. 
	She had a long time to think about 
	it. They say you reach an agreement 
	with death. Come to accept the fact 
	that pretty soon you won't be here. 
	I didn't see that. She... was very 
	brave...braver than I am. You go up 
	there, there isn't time to think. 
	If you make a mistake, you're just 
	a smudge on the ground. Simplifies 
	funeral arrangements.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's just as I thought.
	
			MAVERICK
	What?
	
	
			CHARLIE
	You're totally insane.
	
			MAVERICK

	Thanks very much.

	Care for some suchi?.
	
	
	59E.  THE OTHER END OF THE BEACH - LATER
	
	A killer volleyball game in progress. Maverick and Charlie 
	wander toward it, talking softly to themselves. Goose runs up 
	and grabs him away. 
	
			GOOSE
	Come on, we're next.
	
			MAVERICK
	What?
	
			GOOSE
	Come on, I got over six bucks on 
	the line.
	
	Maverick looks up and sees the other two-man team, the 
	victors, waiting on the other side of the net for them. Of 
	course it had to be Ice and Slider.Charlie sits and watches 
	as the game gets immediately out of hand. In moments, 
	Maverick and Ice rotate to forward positions directly 
	opposite each other across the net. Other revelers turn to 
	watch as it degenerates (?) to more than a game. Maverick 
	glances at Charlie. He seems uncomfortable, but irrevocably 
	drawn into the confrontation. She says nothing, but her 
	attitude is apparent. Back to the game: Slider and Goose set 
	them up, as they try to spike the ball in each other's face. 
	The final point...up over the middle. They both go up, 
	Maverick smashes, Ice blocks, but the ball sails away, off 
	his forearm. For the first time ever, Maverick beats him. He 
	looks over at Charlie, she is staring out to sea. She looks 
	back at him and he's suddenly had enough competition. They 
	call for another game, but Maverick turns away...
	
			GOOSE
	Come on, come on! It's double or 
	nothing.. We're talking twelve 
	bucks American, here.
	
			MAVERICK
	I've had enough...for now.
	
	He grabs Charlie and his gear..
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Come on.
	
			CHARLIE
	Where?
	
			MAVERICK
	You want to go ballistic?
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't know. I don't like being 
	out of control.

	since I first saw a jet. I wanted 
	to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, 
	then I wanted to fly off carriers, 
	then I wanted Top Gun.
	
			CHARLIE
	And now?

	And now I want you.

	He puts money in jukebox. She watches him...eye to eye

	No fooling on base, no signs,
	no comments, no talk. By anyone.

	Why?

	in my line of work.
	
	
	A long beat. He looks at her -- makes the pact: like a 
	sailor.
	
			MAVERICK
	Acknowleged.
	
	She looks at his eyes for any sign of a put-on, insincerity. 
	Finally he smiles at her but she can read it. It's time. She 
	moves in and covers his grin with a gentle kiss.

	An F-14 swoops over the desert, ROARS over an antenna 
	complex.
	
	The JET.- In it's missile rack, it carries a TACTS 
	transponder. The TACTS Range is an area of the desert 
	completely enveloped by computerized radar. The computers 
	
	calculate a number of aircraft's positions and velocities by 
	means of transponders in the ships and ground stations that 
	talk to each other thousands of times a second.  Using this 
	system, it is possible to track aerial combat instantaneously 
	and give pilots directions and also to play back the combats 
	for analysis.
	
	
	63.  INT. TACTS RANGE TRAILER - DAY
	
	The double viewing screens are five feet high; high 
	technology, state of the art. On the screens are computer 
	animated figures showing jets from various angles. Flight 
	data is displayed. The operators punch buttons to show 
	various points-of-view of the battle: a pilot's p.o.v.; God's 
	p.o.v. from overhead, a long range p.o.v., showing topography 
	of the landscape and height of mountains.
	
	Students and instructors sit on chairs in the peanut 
	gallery, facing Viper at the front of the room. Charlie is in 
	the back.
	
			VIPER
	The bandit has good position right 
	here. All right, freeze here. The 
	moment of choice -- Maverick is 
	defensive. He has a chance to bug 
	out right here....Better to retire 
	and save your plane than force a 
	bad position. Stay in the diamond 
	another three seconds, the bandit 
	will blow you out of the sky...make 
	a hard right, select zone 
	5...(turns to Maverick to drive 
	point home) you can extend and 
	escape. You make a bad choice. Roll 
	forward.
	
	The computerized rendering resumes on the screen.
			VIPER (Con't)
	You perform a split S. That's the 
	last thing you should do. The 
	bandit is right on your tail -- 
	Freeze there...the bandit has you 
	in his gunsight. What were you 
	thinking here, Maverick?
	
			MAVERICK
	I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
	
			VIPER
	Big gamble with a thirty million 
	dollar plane!
	
	
			MAVERICK
	    (smiling)
	No guts, no glory.
	
	It's a joke. Viper doesn't like that answer at all, but some 
	of the students laugh and mockingly whistle at the cockiness 
	of it. They give Maverick the high sign. Slider leans forward 
	to him.
			SLIDER
	Your guts. His glory.
	
	Maverick slumps down in his chair under Viper's glare.  The 
	computer rendering rolls forward again. He glances back at 
	Charlie. She smiles sympathetically at him.
	
			VIPER
	Unfortunately, the gamble worked, 
	or you might have learned 
	something. The bandit never gets a 
	clean shot...Maverick makes an 
	aggressive vertical move here, 
	comes over the top and defeats the 
	bandit with a missile shot. The 
	encounter was a victory, but we've 
	shown it as an example of what not 
	to do. Ice is next.
	
	Another computerized rendering comes up on the screen. 
	Hollywood leans close to Maverick and speaks quietly.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Gutsiest move I ever saw.
	
	Maverick gives him a small nod of appreciation.
	
			VIPER
	And the dumbest...Okay, look at 
	this. It's textbook. Ice takes 
	control of the battle immediately. 
	He never gives the bandit a chance 
	to take the offensive. An early 
	turn here -- excellent. He goes for

	76.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY
	
	In full flight gear, carrying their helmets and trying to 
	stuff food down their gullets, the students rush/stumble 
	toward the flight line. Hollywood takes a bit of a sandwich 
	and makes a face.
			GOOSE
	What the hell is this?
	
			MAVERICK
	Don't chew it, you won't have it 
	that long. Easier to clean the 
	cockpit if it comes up in big 
	chunks.
	
	Jester yells from the distance.
	
			JESTER
	On the run. Let's go. Move it!
	
			GOOSE
	A fighter pilot's lunch... a hot 
	dog and a puke.
	
	
	They scurry ahead, overtaking the others. 
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	I was a victim of circumstance.
	
			GOOSE
	They should have warned you about 
	that one.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	She's kinky for flight suits--said 
	that she'd never seen so many 
	zippers--played with them all 
	night. The noise alone kept me up.
	
			GOOSE
	What'd you do?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Pulled left, rolled out, 
	underneath.
	
			WOLFMAN
	It's kind of ironic. All you guys 
	have women troubles and I don't.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	That's because you don't have any 
	women.
	
			WOLFMAN
	Until last night. Did you see the 
	moves I was making on that girl at 
	the party?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	The girl with the purple 
	fingernails?
	
			WOLFMAN
	That's her--tall hungry woman with 
	fire in her eyes. It was great.
	
			MAVERICK
	It was bad.
	
			WOLFMAN
	Bad?
	
			MAVERICK
	The girl with the purple 
	fingernails was Coogan's sister.
	
	They all laugh. Wolfman looks stunned.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Coogan spent half the night looking 
	for her. He said he was gonna kill 
	the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his 
	sister.
	
			WOLFMAN
	I didn't ruin her.
	
			MAVERICK
	You didn't help.
	
			WOLFMAN
	No, really. She came ruined!...   
	Ya think he knows it was me?
	
			GOOSE
	Seemed not to. But it's hard to 
	know. You never can tell what's in 
	the mind of a psychopath.
	
	Wolfman looks very unsettled.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Hear about Ice?
	
			WOLFMAN
	What now?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	He won again.
	
	Goose walks beside Maverick now.
	
			GOOSE
	Something bothering you?
	
			MAVERICK
	Nothing. Let's just go fight.
	
	
	Wolfman looks very apprehensive as they approach the F-14's. 
	MECHANICS surround both planes, making last minute checks of 
	all systems. Among them is COOGAN, six and a half feet tall, 
	looking mean. Maverick tosses him a wave.
	
			MAVERICK
	Morning, Coogan.
	
			WOLFMAN
	How's it goin', Coog?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Ever find your sister, Coogan?
	
			COOGAN
	You guys know somethin' about that?
	
	Wolfman swallows hard and hurries quickly into the plane. 
	Coogan glares at them all with a look that could kill.

	78.  EXT. F-14'S - DAY
	
	Hollywood leads, Maverick follows. They point their noses 
	down and dive. Two bogies fly side by side at five thousand, 
	outlined against the blue Pacific. Smaller, slower, they seem 
	helpless for a moment. We hear the instructors in the F-5's.
	
	
			VIPER (V.O. filtered) 
	TWO AT SEVEN O'CLOCK, JESTER. 
	SCRAMBLE.
	
			JESTER
	ROGER. COMING LEFT.
	
			HOLLYWOOD 
	Holy shit, it's Viper.
	
			MAVERICK 
	Keep your shirt on, he's saying 
	holy shit it's us.
	
	The bogies split. Bogey One hard left. Bogey Two hard right. 
	Hollywood sweeps left, pursuing Bogey One. Maverick hangs 
	back to cover him.
	
	Bogey One makes a strong vertical move. Hollywood stays on 
	him.
			MAVERICK
	STAY WITH HIM, WOOD... YOUR SIX 
	CLEAR!
	
	Bogey One loops and comes down, and Hollywood almost loses 
	him for a moment before regaining the angle.
	
			MAVERICK
	STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
	
			GOOSE
	Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose 
	on!
	
	Maverick looks quickly at three o'clock high, sees Bogey Two 
	returning to the fight. He jerks the stick right, and the two 
	planes make a quick pass.
	
			VIPER
	SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
	
			MAVERICK
	ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY.
	WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
	
			GOOSE
	Just cover Wood, Maverick.
	Mutual support, man!
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm gonna take him, Goose.
	
			GOOSE
	Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
	
			MAVERICK
	I want him!
	
	Maverick goes suddenly vertical, zooms straight up.
	
			GOOSE
	Hey, come on--hey!
	
	Maverick loops the F-14 down to get the quick angle on Viper 
	in Bogey Two. Viper takes off, running from the fight again. 
	Maverick looks over his shoulder and sees that Hollywood 
	still has a good position on Bogey One. He takes a hard right 
	and streaks off after Viper.
	
			GOOSE
	What what are you doing?
	We're cover!
	
			MAVERICK
	Wood's okay. I want Viper.
	
	Goose looks back at Hollywood and Bogey One.
	
			GOOSE
	But we're cover!
	
	
	Viper streaks across the sky with Maverick close behind. He 
	pushes the throttle forward to ZONE 5 - full afterburner.
	Viper shows all his tricks...hard left, hard right, rolling 
	into vertical, flipping into a dive. Maverick stays with him. 
	
	
			VIPER (To himself)
	Goddamn, rookie, you're all right!
	
	
	79.  INT. F-14
	
	Maverick turns to get Viper in the diamond. He hears a 
	SIDEWINDER GROWL in his headset.
	
			MAVERICK
	What's the range, Goose. I've got a 
	good tone.
	
	Viper jinks but Maverick stays with him.  Viper is in the 
	diamond, and the TONE GOES CRAZY. But suddenly....
	
			GOOSE
	Two bogies ! Three o'clock high, 
	nine o'clock high! Break!
	
	They come out of nowhere, flashing down toward Maverick--a 
	crossfire ambush. Maverick's eyes are startled.
	
			JESTER
	ATOLL ON THE NORTHERN F-14. HE'S 
	OUT OF THE FIGHT..
	
	Maverick is stunned. He has been tricked, humiliated. 
	There's a little salt for the wound as Viper and Jester 
	celebrate.
	
			VIPER
	 	WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
	
			JESTER
	NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR 
	WINGMAN. NICE GOING. 
	
			GOOSE
	THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT REGRETS TO 
	INFORM YOU THAT YOUR SONS ARE DEAD 
	BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID! 
	
	Slaps his helmet like a dolt...
	
			VIPER
	KNOCK OFF THE CHATTER, TOP GUNS. 
	LET'S RTB. VIPER HAS THE LEAD.
	
	
	80.  INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
	
	Silence. Several pilots in various forms of undress. 
	Maverick and Goose sit with their heads down, a hangdog 
	expression on their faces.
	
	81.  INT. DIRTY DAN'S - A BAR - 
	LATER
	
	Maverick mopes at the bar, a figure comes up behind him.
	
			VIPER
	Ya know, that was the best flying 
	I've seen since Nam...(He grins) 
	...Right up to that part where you 
	got killed.
	
	Viper sits down. He's in a jovial, taunting mood.  Maverick 
	watches him guardedly.
	
			VIPER
	Twenty years' experience, I 
	couldn't shake you. You may be a 
	great flyer. I mean that.
	
			MAVERICK
	I lost.
	
			VIPER
	Of course you did. I said a great 
	flyer, not a smart one. You fly 
	reckless. Great instincts. No 
	discipline. That ambush today, you 
	followed your emotions instead of 
	your wingman. Of course you got 
	killed...and well deserved to. It 
	was a really stupid mistake. In 
	battle, it gets people killed.
	
	Maverick nods and stares at his beer.
	
			MAVERICK
	I can take care of myself.
	
			VIPER
	Talent is no holy shield. Von 
	Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. 
	Instincts are not enough. Do it our 
	way. We've worked these things out. 
	The good pilots can become better 
	and the great ones can learn how to 
	stay alive.  (he studies him for a 
	moment)  Why do you have to do 
	everything the hard way?
	
			MAVERICK
	It's my own way. It works for me.  
	I don't care about the rest of that 
	stuff.
	
			VIPER
	Then why are you here?
	
			MAVERICK
	For the same reason you are.
	
			VIPER
	Oh, you mean the thrill!
	
			MAVERICK
	The flying. The fighting.  I'd go 
	up there ten times a day to fight. 
	I'd win at least nine of them. 
	That's all I want to do. It's what 
	I do best. I am real good.  Just 
	give me the jet.
	
	Viper studies him,
	
			VIPER
	It's not a gift, just a loan...
	
	He finishes his beer, then rises.
	
			VIPER
	Nine out of ten is okay, as long as 
	it's only fun and games. But this 
	isn't about that. This is serious 
	business. It is dangerous up there! 
	At 500 knots, things can change a 
	lot in a second. Discipline is what 
	protects us.
	
	He signals the bartender and drops some money on the bar. He 
	stretches, looks around. 
	
			VIPER
	It was a good day. You learned 
	something. You lost and you're 
	still alive to think about it. And, 
	you lost your wingman. That's a 
	cardinal sin...don't ever do it 
	again. You owe Hollywood an apology 
	and you owe me a beer.
	
	Viper touches Maverick's shoulder as he moves away. It was 
	just the gesture Maverick needed, for he seems to relax from 
	his tension. He sips his beer alone.
	
	
	82.  INT. SAN DIEGO AIRPORT - NIGHT
	
	Maverick and Goose move through the terminal, 
	anxious/expectant looks on their faces.
	
			GOOSE
	Relationships are a bitch, here. 
	It's hard enough to concentrate 
	...under the pressure. Having a 
	woman here is asking for it.
	
			MAVERICK
	I guess that's what I'm doing, 
	then.
	
			GOOSE
	Where do you find the time? Where 
	do you find the energy. It's tough 
	enough to keep your mind on school. 
	A woman here is a real pain in 
	the...
	
	
	A pretty woman emerges from the crowd and spots them first. 
	She rushes them, happily, carrying her sleepy four-year-old, 
	RICKY. Goose undergoes an immediate change, beaming a big 
	smile that he has practiced on her for years. She sets down 
	the kid.
	
			GOOSE
	...butt...Hi, honey, God, am I glad 
	to see you! I missed you.
	
	Goose wraps his arms around Carol, smack, a kiss. She smiles 
	at Maverick, turns back to Goose.
	
			CAROL
	I had to come, Willard, I got so 
	lonesome I just couldn't stand it.
	
			GOOSE
	Sure, honey, I understand. It's 
	great to see you. Hey where's your 
	backseater, where's the world's 
	smallest RIO..
	
	He looks all around and then down at the kid, hiding shyly 
	behind his mother's skirts. Goose grabs up the kid and zooms 
	him around, a game they've played before, every six months or 
	so. The kid laughs happily.  Maverick just sort of smiles to 
	himself and shakes his head.
	
	83.  OMITTED
	
	84.  A POOL (OR BEACH)
	
	Maverick comes to the surface. She enters frame by the side 
	of the pool.  She hands him a split fresh pineapple. He eats 
	it in the  most salacious manner possible. He's so contented, 
	he's babbling.
	
			MAVERICK
	Food...and you...my F-14!
	
			CHARLIE
	In that order?
	
			MAVERICK
	Well no...inverse order.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'm still second best.
	
			MAVERICK
	You ever fly an F-14?
	    (She laughs.)
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't fly in anything that
		doesn't show movies.
	
	He gets out, grabs a towel, moves over to some chairs. His 
	flight suit is draped over one. He moves it to sit down.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Ahhh, you'd love it. Night carrier 
	landings! The most dangerous thing 
	you can think of! ...next to 
	you...And the most exciting. You're 
	living at one hundred and ten per 
	cent. Greatest high in the world... 
	
	
			CHARLIE
	Danger?
	
			MAVERICK
	    (of course).
	Yeah! 
	
			CHARLIE
	Doesn't it ever bother you?
	
			MAVERICK
	Why, what's gonna happen?
	
	His flight suit slips onto the ground. Charlie retrieves it. 
	As she lifts the suit, something falls out of the pocket. 
	Looks like a gold coin. She picks it up. Maverick is drying 
	his hair. She holds the object out to him, questioning. He 
	sees it, quickly takes it, stuffs it back into his pocket.
	
			MAVERICK
	Lucky charm.
	
			CHARLIE
	What do you take me for? It's a 
	Navy Cross.
	
			MAVERICK
	Just good luck.
	
			CHARLIE
	Where'd you get it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Pawn shop. What's to eat?
	
	He roots through a picnic basket.
	
	
	84A.  MONTAGE - PREFLIGHT ACTIVITY
	
			VIPER (V.O.) 
	...MiG sweep over the water.  You 
	will proceed down the one-seven 
	-zero degree radial looking for 
	MiGs. You will engage all that you 
	find, destroy them, and return to 
	base. Maverick, has the lead. Any 
	questions? All right, let's go. 
	Move like you've got a 
	purpose....
	
	85.  EXT. CLOUD COVER - 
	20,000 FT. - DAY
	
	Four F-14's fly in formation over the Pacific, searching for 
	(MiGs). They spot them, engage. The combatants fly scissor 
	patterns, slashing past each other, angling for position.
	
	We hear the VOICES OF COMBAT from the planes, a barrage of 
	information exchanges between pilots and RIO's. Maverick and 
	Ice swoop close together on each other's wing--moving on each 
	other, testing, they glance at each other and nod. The 
	Challenge...the fight is on. Suddenly an F-5 rises up out of 
	the clouds in front of them--Ice has the advantage and rolls 
	in on him.
	
			ICE
	ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
	
			MAVERICK
	SHIT!!
	
	The F-5 sees his pursuers. Goes into a hard left.
	
			ICE
	MIG'S IN A LEFT. MIG'S IN A 
	LEFTHAND. I'M ENGAGING.
	
	
	Ice struggles against the G's to bring his nose to bear. 
	They go around into a Lufbery--a tight circle, Ice has the 
	advantage. He is closer to the F-5's tail than the F-5 is to 
	his. But he can't close, can't line up the shot. He grunts 
	and strains as the G force pushes him down.
	
			MAVERICK
	COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M 
	IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
	
			ICE
	STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M 
	ENGAGED. I'M IN.
	
	Maverick maneuvers close to their left circle.
	
			ICE
	GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. 
	GET OUT OF THERE.
	
			MAVERICK
	FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
	
			ICE
	GET LOST!
	
			MAVERICK
	YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- 
	I'M COMING IN.
	
			ICE
	IT'S MY SHOT.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY 
	WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
	
			ICE
	STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, 
	MAVERICK.
	
			MAVERICK
	YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
	
	
	MAVERICK - ABOVE.
	
			MAVERICK
	ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
	
			ICE
	NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
	
	
	Maverick is pulling a log of G's, but can't target his 
	weapons, he continues to turn in a hard circle, going round 
	and round without gaining. He can't bring his nose to bear.
	
			MAVERICK
	IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
	
			ICE
	NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
	
	Ice stays.
	
			MAVERICK
	COMING IN.
	
	Maverick dives down between the two planes pulling 6.5 G's, 
	exposing his underside to Ice. All Ice sees is belly. 
	Obviously, in this attitude Maverick can't see him.
	
			ICE
	    (under breath.)
	Sonofabitch.
	
	He slams the stick hard right in toward Maverick. 
	Ice quickly rolls up right, in front of him.
	
			ICE
	LOOK OUT!
	
	
	Maverick sees him flash into his view. He has to slam the 
	stick forward to avoid collision. He swings by real close. 
	Too close.
	
			GOOSE
	Oh, no!
	
	
	
	They pass through Ice's turbulence. The blast distorts the 
	airflow to Maverick's left engine. BOOMBOOMBOOM. The engine 
	flames out. Full thrust on the right, engine swings the tail 
	around in a yaw. Maverick slams the stick right to correct 
	but too late.
	
			GOOSE
	Plane's coupling up! Plane's 
	coupling up!
	
	
	The plane couples one yaw to the next--the tail swings 
	around-- which becomes an ever increasing flat spin, like an 
	out-of -control frisbee.
	
			GOOSE
	This is not good!...(Rising panic) 
	We're low!
	
	
	Maverick is pinned to the instrument panel by centrifugal 
	force, desperately tries to reach back for the ejection 
	lever--but is falling short by about a foot.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm pinned to the panel.
	
			GOOSE
	Time to go.
	
			MAVERICK
	I can't eject.
	
	
	The plane is spinning ever faster, out of control. He drops 
	the gear. Still spins. Goose is closer to center of spin--G 
	forces are less. He reaches behind him for the eject handle, 
	starts the eject sequence.
	
			GOOSE
	3000 feet. I'll do it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
	
	
	85A.  BOOM - A HURRICANE OF WIND AND NOISE
	
	The canopy BLASTS away--but is held spinning above the 
	cockpit by the vortex of the sinking jet. Goose glances up at 
	it.
	
			GOOSE
	1000.
	
			MAVERICK
	Let's go. Eject.
	
	
	Goose yanks the ejection handle. Things happen in a split 
	second. Goose is fired up and out by the rocket under his 
	seat. Almost instantly he impacts the spinning canopy. A 
	sickening CRUNCH. The canopy is knocked away. Maverick is 
	slammed back in his seat as the ejection seat straps wind up. 
	He is BLASTED out of the plane just before it spins in.
	
	
	85B.  TIGHT ON MAVERICK AS HE TUMBLES IN SLOW MOTION
	
	He's in shock..the loud THUMPING of his heart, labored 
	breathing, a scream that stays in his mind.
	
	Instinctively, he gropes for straps. He releases the pilot 
	seat, it tumbles away. His chute streams, balloons open, 
	snapping his body like a bullwhip.  He drifts momentarily, 
	then plunges into the sea.
	
	
	85C. UNDERWATER
	
	His face, distorted in the water; wild eyes, disoriented, 
	choking for air. He reaches out, finds nothing to grab.
	Suddenly, he is yanked hard to the side.
	
	
	85D.  SURFACE 
	
	The parachute is caught by the wind, and dragged, pulling 
	Maverick along beneath the surface. He is twisting in the 
	water, turning over and over, trying desperately to slip out 
	of the tangled straps. He finally hits the surface of the 
	water and sucks air into his lungs. With the end of his 
	strength, he hits the release snaps and breaks free from the 
	parachute. It whips away like a kite in a typhoon.
	
	The sea is choppy and rough. He struggles as his equipment 
	drags him under. He twists, finds the inflatable raft 
	attached to his harness. Maverick pulls the cord, and the 
	raft hisses open. He pulls his body into the six-by-two foot 
	raft and collapses, completely exhausted. The survival has 
	been almost without thinking: an instinctual physical 
	struggle.
	
	
	85E.  TWILIGHT
	
	Maverick begins to focus on the situation. He stains the 
	water with dye, then sees another parachute floating nearby. 
	Paddling to the parachute, he reaches over the side and 
	begins to pull on the heavy cords that are submerged in the 
	water.
	
	A great struggle. The weight is extremely heavy. Finally, he 
	pulls a body to the surface. Goose. Goose is dead. Maverick 
	releases the parachute and pulls Goose into the raft on top 
	of him. He holds Goose in his arms. His mind shuts down 
	again.
	
	From high above the ocean, we see the debris on the water. 
	An oil slick, pieces of honeycomb titanium, and the small, 
	helpless figure in the raft.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	86.  EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
	
	Searchlights skim over the black ocean. A brilliant light 
	flashes as Maverick pops a pencil flare. Helicopter blades 
	flick powerfully. The lights of the choppers descend toward 
	the wreckage area, scanning the debris, searching for life. 
	The spotlights find Maverick and Goose in the raft.
	
	The draft from the chopper churns the water. A FROGMAN drops 
	from the chopper and hits with a heavy splashes. He surfaces 
	and swims to the raft as a rescue harness is lowered.
	
	Maverick watches curiously as he starts to examine Goose. He 
	hugs Goose closer and looks threatened.
	
	
			FROGMAN
	Let him go, sir. Take it easy.
	
	He tries to pry Goose free, but Maverick has a death grip on 
	the body.
	
			FROGMAN
	Sir! Let him go. It's all right. 
	Let him go.
	
	
	Maverick glares at the man as he bobs in the water.
	
	Another long moment, then Maverick releases Goose. The 
	frogman quickly straps Maverick into the harness. 
	
	HIS POV. - He watches the lifeless body in the water as he 
	is pulled up and away. He shivers from the cold.
	
	
	87.  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Extreme CLOSE ON Maverick's face. He is emotionless. His 
	eyes are flat and absolutely without expression. There is 
	complete silence in the room. Then we hear the quiet, calm, 
	probing voice of Viper.
	
			VIPER
	How do you feel?
	
			MAVERICK
	All right.
	
			VIPER
	Goose is dead.
	
			MAVERICK
	I know. I was there.
	
	
	
	Not one sign of emotion from Maverick. Not one tone of 
	expression. We see Viper now, and his face is strained from a 
	very long day.
	
			VIPER
	If you fly jets long enough, 
	something like this happens to you. 
	No one escapes it. It touches us 
	all.
	
	Maverick looks at Viper, and his eyes are very disturbed.
	
			MAVERICK
	He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
	
			VIPER
	My first squadron in Vietnam, we 
	lost eight out of eighteen planes. 
	Ten guys. The first one kills you, 
	but there'll be others--you can 
	count on it.
	
	
	No reaction from Maverick. He can't quite face up to that 
	reality right now.
	
			VIPER
	You've got to put him in the box.
	
	
	Maverick is watching Viper, but he doesn't have anything to 
	say.
	
	
	88.  EXT. CHARLIE'S SPORTSCAR - NIGHT
	
	The RADIO plays John Lennon; "Stand by Me". Maverick opens 
	his eyes, doesn't know where he is for a moment.
	
			CHARLIE
	...they say you're alright.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm fine.
	
			CHARLIE
	This is it, then.
	
			MAVERICK
	What?
	
			CHARLIE
	The dark side. The price you pay 
	for all the fun you're having. You 
	knew about it, of course. Didn't 
	you?
	
			MAVERICK
	He was a friend of mine. A good 
	guy...great guy. It was my 
	fault.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's not what I hear.
	
			MAVERICK
	I was flying...my responsibility.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's what you get flight pay for.
	
			MAVERICK
	Maybe I shouldn't take it.
	
			CHARLIE
	    (In surprise)
	Why? You act like you didn't know 
	one day this would happen.
	
			MAVERICK
	Not to me.
	
			CHARLIE
	You knew it. You all do. It's part 
	of it. Maybe the most important 
	part.
	
	
	88A.  ON THE BEACH - NIGHT AND FOG 
	
	Charlie's car pulls up. They get out and walk down toward 
	the water. Maverick seems dazed. She is softly taunting.
	
			MAVERICK
	Where are we?
	
			CHARLIE
	Where are we? You know where we 
	are. It's called the beach. It's 
	where life first crawled up out of 
	the sea. I come here sometimes... 
	when I feel like crawling back in.
	
			MAVERICK
	You don't have to do this.
	
			CHARLIE
	Do what, show you a good time?
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm not good company. I should be 
	alone.
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't think so, but if that's 
	what you want...
	
	They stand there, not making a move.
	
			MAVERICK
	No.
	
			CHARLIE
	What do you want?
	
			MAVERICK
	I want it back.
	
			CHARLIE
	What?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yesterday.
	
	She turns, nods out, past the moon.
	
			CHARLIE
	You look way out there. Out past 
	the date line. West becomes East, 
	all things change. You cross the 
	line...today becomes yesterday...or 
	tomorrow, I forget which.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's what I want.
	
			CHARLIE
	Of course the line's just 
	imaginary. You can cross it twenty 
	times...nothing really changes.
	
	She turns and walks along the surfline.
	
			CHARLIE
	On the beach... It's what they say 
	when Navy men retire...He's "On The 
	Beach". I always liked that. I had 
	a picture...in my head... all these 
	old guys wandering around here, 
	looking out into the past.
	
	He walks to the surf, kicks the sand with his bare feet.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	If we knew then, what we know now, 
	we might never have come up out of 
	there.
	
	He turns to her. She just looks at him.
	
			CHARLIE
	You don't believe that.
	
			MAVERICK
	Hardly ever.
	
			CHARLIE
	Only when you're depressed. Then it 
	passes.
	
			MAVERICK
	It does.
	
			CHARLIE
	Everything passes. Immutable law of 
	the Universe.
	
	
	He picks up a piece of flotsam, a twig, worn smooth.
	
			CHARLIE
	This too...shall pass. You put as 
	much life as you can between it and 
	you. You start piling up experience 
	between then and now.
	
	He turns and walks.
	
			MAVERICK
	What do you do when you come here?
	
			CHARLIE
	I sit. I think. I play games.
	
			MAVERICK
	What kind of games?
	
			CHARLIE
	I like to play "reality".
	
	She stops and turns.
	
			MAVERICK
	How do you play reality.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's strip reality, actually, like 
	what the pilots always want to 
	play.
	
			MAVERICK
	  (this gets a small laugh)
	Strip reality! How do you play 
	that?
	
			CHARLIE
	It's like strip poker, only, 
	without the bluffing. (he laughs 
	again) One person says something 
	and if the other one accepts that 
	it's true, the one who says it, 
	gets to take one item of clothing 
	off.
	
			MAVERICK
	You're crazy. (She stops, he goes 
	on, softer) That's a pretty silly 
	game.
	
			CHARLIE
	Not as silly as some. You know the 
	silliest one? ...that we are gods. 
	That we control events on the 
	beach... that we can turn back 
	time...
	
	She moves in close.
	
			CHARLIE
	Want to play the game? 
	
			MAVERICK
	How does it go?
	
			CHARLIE
	You say the truth. (a beat...)    
	Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want 
	to win the game, don'tcha?
	
			MAVERICK
	What truth?
	
			CHARLIE
	The big one. The one that's most on 
	your mind.
	
	A long pause...it comes hard.
	
			MAVERICK
	Goose is dead.
	
			CHARLIE
	    (she nods)
	True.
	
			MAVERICK
	Now?
	
			CHARLIE
	Take something off.
	
			MAVERICK
	Off me or off you?
	
			CHARLIE
	That's up to you.
	
	
	He takes the ribbon from her hair. It falls down over her 
	face and shoulders. Now it's her turn.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's dangerous...what you do.
	
	He nods. She slowly loosens his tie and pulls it from around 
	his neck.
	
			MAVERICK
	It was my fault.
	
	
	She says nothing, stands looking into his eyes. He slowly, 
	as if in a trance, takes her blouse off.
	
			CHARLIE
	You can't bring him back.
	
	She takes off his shirt.
	
			MAVERICK
	It was my fault.
	
	
	
	He starts to reach for her. She pulls back.
	
			CHARLIE
	Nope. Already used that.
	
	She turns and thinks for a moment, looking at the moon.
	
			CHARLIE
	Your life goes on.
	
	
	Rather than struggle his T shirt over his head, she grabs it 
	with both hands. She leans in close and bites it. She grabs 
	both sides of the tear and slowly rips it off his body.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	What does it mean?
	
			CHARLIE
	   (shakes her head no)
	That wasn't fair. It was a 
	question. Penalty round!
	
	
	She drops her skirt.
	
			CHARLIE
	You didn't mean it. You didn't 
	think. You'd do anything to take it 
	back.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's three.
	
			CHARLIE
	And that's one!
	
	
	She unbuckles his belt, slowly slides it off. She unzips his 
	pants, they fall.
	
			MAVERICK
	One more.
	
			CHARLIE
	Your watch.
	
	She unbuckles it.
	
			MAVERICK
	You owe me one.
	
	
	He rests his head on her shoulder, unhooks her bra. She 
	shrugs it off.
	
	They stand on the beach in shorts and bikini bottom, looking 
	into each other's eyes.
	
			CHARLIE
	Looks like a tie.
	
			MAVERICK
	Who's gonna win?
	
			CHARLIE
	We'll say it together. On the count 
	of three...One...two...
	
	Leaning in, softer and harder...they both jump the gun.
	
			BOTHTOGETHER
	I love.ove y.you.
	
	They embrace madly and sink to the sand. From the distance 
	it looks like a strange slithering creature crawling back to 
	the sea.
	
	
	89.  INT. GOOSE'S ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The lights are out in Goose's room at the Bachelor Officers' 
	Quarters. The door opens, and Maverick enters. He sets a 
	cardboard box on the bed.
	
	Silently, Maverick gathers together Goose's few personal 
	possessions. He fills the box with clothes, books, a clock, a 
	radio, a walkman, and articles from the bathroom. He examines 
	each closely, like an artifact...as if he might find some 
	message or meaning in them. He fumbles them into the box. He 
	can't see too well, his eyes are full of tears.
	
	Maverick closes the box and carries it to the door. He takes 
	one last glance around, then leaves and closes the door 
	behind him.
	
	
	89A.  INT. BOQ RECEPTION AREA                      *
	
	Carol and the kid, stand, staring at a silent TV. Carol 
	looks dazed, lost. Maverick walks in, finds her. An awkward 
	silence while they both try to think of something to say. 
	Maverick hands the box to Carol.
	
	90.   OMITTED
	
	89B.  CLOSE UP - MAVERICK.
	
	He sits staring right through us...the thousand-yard stare. 
	A strange white unreal light washes over him. The only color, 
	the Navy and gold of the stripes on his shoulderboards. A low 
	rumbling mumbling filters through the HISS of surf or fans or 
	something...Snatches of low whispered 
	conversation....disregard of...basic air-safety 
	principles...too aggressive...incident.... 29 July...within 
	performance parameters... disciplinary action...tactical 
	doctrine.... even reckless at times... 
	conjecture...unsupported ...benefit of the doubt...
	
	Maverick's 
	eyes slowly focus. The light attenuates. The surrounding 
	image becomes denser. Things become real.
	
	
	89C.  INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - MAVERICK'S POV
	
	A BOARD OF INQUIRY, a COMMANDER and other NAVY OFFICERS 
	seated behind tables at the front of the room. Maverick faces 
	them, wearing dress whites. Viper is also present. The 
	Commander looks at each of the Officers. They each nod, in 
	turn, indicating readiness. The Commander turns to Maverick, 
	and states for the record:
	
			CDR.
	The Board of Inquiry finds that Lt. 
	Evan Mitchell was not at fault in 
	the accident of twenty-nine July.
	
	No response from Maverick, one way or the other. Viper 
	studies his face with concern.
	
			CDR.
	 Lt. Mitchell's record will be 
	cleared of this incident.
	
	
	Still no response from Maverick.
	
		CDR.
	Lt. Mitchell is restored to flight 
	status without further delay. These 
	proceedings are closed.
	
	Maverick doesn't respond.
	
	
	91.  INT. MAVERICK'S ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Maverick lies on his bunk and stares at the ceiling. The 
	phone next to his bed is RINGING.  It RINGS EIGHT OR NINE 
	TIMES, then stops. He makes no move to reach for it. 
	
	
	92. through 95. OMITTED
	
	
	94A.  INT. COCKPIT - F-14 ON FLIGHT LINE
	
	Maverick sits in the cockpit staring at the controls while 
	the ground crew preps the aircraft for flight. Coogan helps 
	him strap in. He speaks solicitously to Maverick. It is 
	unheard over the JET NOISE and RADIO BABBLE. Maverick looks 
	at the cockpit as if it's a strange territory, suddenly 
	foreign to him. He grabs the stick like it's some peculiar 
	talisman. He turns and looks aft. He seems surprised that it 
	moves the control surfaces in the tails.
	
	96.  INT. F-14 - DAY
	
			FUNGUS
	BOGEY AT TEN O'CLOCK LOW. YOU'VE 
	GOT THE ANGLE -- PIECE OF CAKE.
	
	
	Maverick checks ten o'clock low. He is disturbed. He tries 
	to make the move, but he is a man with no secret: he is 
	afraid.
	
			FUNGUS
	ENGAGE, MAVERICK - ANYTIME.
	
	
	The bogey abruptly turns into him. Maverick hesitates. Then 
	suddenly, he jerks the stick hard right and takes the F-14 
	away from the bogey at great speed. Fungus is startled.
	
			FUNGUS
	WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN 
	THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
	
		MAVERICK
	DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
	
			FUNGUS
	WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO 
	LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
	
			MAVERICK
	NO. NO GOOD.
	
	
	96A.  INT. FLIGHT LINE - DAY
	
	Jester walks up to Viper who waits near an F-5.
	
			JESTER
	He just won't engage. He can't do 
	it, Skipper. He can't get back on 
	the horse. 
	
			VIPER
	It's only been a week. Keep sending 
	him up.
	
			JESTER
	I've seen this before.
	
			VIPER
	So have I.
	
			JESTER
	Some guys never get it back.
	
	
	He walks off.
	
	
	
	97. through 102.  OMITTED
	
	
	103.  INT. LOCKER ROOM - IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
	
	Maverick grabs his stuff out of the locker, throws them in a 
	bag. He glances up as Fungus enters, continues to pack.
	
			FUNGUS
	What are you doing?
	
			MAVERICK
	Saving them some paperwork.
	
			FUNGUS
	Since when did you care about  
	paperwork? 
	
	Maverick walks away. Fungus hesitates, then follows him.
	
			FUNGUS
	If I could fly like you I'd have 
	everything I want. If I could fly 
	at all. I can't fly. I can't fly 
	like that. Nobody can. Whatever it 
	is, you've got it!
	
			MAVERICK
	Not anymore. 
	
			FUNGUS
	So, you're scared--so what? You 
	ever get a good look at me in the 
	back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
	
	Grabbing the suitcase, Maverick brushes past Jester and 
	walks up the corridor. Jester and Fungus watch him go. Fungus 
	goes to the phone.
	
	
	104.  EXT. SAN DIEGO AIRPORT - NIGHT
	
	Charlie parks her car, jumps out, and runs toward the main 
	entrance to the terminal.
	
	
	105.  INT. TERMINAL
	
	Charlie hurries through the crowd, bumping past people, 
	searching frantically for Maverick in the huge terminal. She 
	moves past bench after bench, and her eyes flick in all 
	directions. A quick glance at the souvenir shop, the coffee 
	shop, and then she heads for the bar.
	
	Maverick is there, sitting alone in a booth with his 
	suitcase beside him, staring into a drink. Charlie composes 
	herself, then walks to the booth and sits down across the 
	table from him. Maverick does not look pleased.
	
			CHARLIE
	Never liked fighter pilots anyway. 
	
	
	
	He looks up trying to be angry, but he can't help it, she 
	makes him laugh.
	
			MAVERICK
	You came to the right place.
	
	The waitress comes up.
	
			MAVERICKWhat are you having?
	
	Turns to the waitress.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'll have what he's having... 
	Hemlock, is it?
	
	The waitress departs. He tries not to smile, but can't help 
	it.
	
			CHARLIE
	You weren't gonna say goodbye?
	
			MAVERICK
	I was, later. 
	
			CHARLIE
	Long distance? I wouldn't do that 
	to you. I'd at least talk to you.
	
			MAVERICK
	I didn't want to see you. I mean, I 
	did...but I didn't..
	
			CHARLIE
	I know exactly what you mean.
	
			MAVERICK
	How could you?
	
		CHARLIE
	I've got a gift just like you do. 
	My gift is I just know what people 
	mean, even if they can't say it. It 
	helps when you're trying to 
	communicate with fighter pilots. 
	Like what you just said was "I'm 
	embarrassed, I feel I've done 
	something wrong, that I've failed, 
	and I don't think I can live up to 
	the expectations of a wonderful 
	interesting, intelligent woman like 
	yourself." That about it?
	
			MAVERICK
	    (laughs)
	...Something like that.
	
	
			CHARLIE
	And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by 
	myself for awhile, like until I can 
	think of a new career...hotel 
	management or something...
	
			MAVERICK
	Big talk for someone who's never 
	been shot off her computer.
	
			CHARLIE
	Hey, I never said I was a fighter 
	pilot...I never claimed to think it 
	was fun to be shot off the end of a 
	ship in a storm. I can find 
	contentment in a good book. I don't 
	have to roar by someone at Mach two 
	with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I 
	just get happy being with the right 
	man.
	
			MAVERICK
	I hope you find him.
	
			CHARLIE
	I think I have... I could be wrong. 
	I have been before. Just remember 
	one thing. If you're not Top Gun, 
	if you're not fighting jets, you're 
	not gonna be able to act like a 
	fighter pilot... You're gonna have 
	to act like the rest of us. You're 
	gonna have to master humility. For 
	you guys, that's the toughest 
	maneuver of all.
	
	She gets up...lays a bill out for the drinks...
	
			CHARLIE
	So long, Sailor. See you on the 
	beach sometime.
	
	
	She swings away. Her wake sucks in the stares of every man 
	in the place. Then they look over to Maverick, quick flicks 
	of envy in their eyes. He stares them back and can't quite 
	meet their eyes.
	
	
	106.  EXT. BEACH AT VIPER'S HOUSE - LATER
	
	Viper is tugged down the beach by a three year old kid. They 
	come across one creature who's had a bad night...Viper spots 
	him, he spots Viper, and Viper moves toward him. Tim, Viper's 
	kid, wants to head for the sea and pulls his father in that 
	direction. He stops, puts his hand on his hips like he's seen 
	the pilots do. 
	
			TIM
	Dad...Of all the aminals in the 
	ocean, which one's the baddest?
	
	
			VIPER
	I don't know, Tim. You'll have to 
	ask them.
	
	Viper turns to the creature, Maverick, and shrugs.
	
			VIPER
	Runs in the family...
	
	Maverick stands up. 
	
			MAVERICK
	Skipper, sorry to bother you.
	
			VIPER
	No bother.
	
			MAVERICK
	I called your house.
	
			VIPER
	My wife's house.
	
			MAVERICK
	She said you took your kid to the  
	each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or 
	beach or the ballgame. Y'have the 
	option...(Maverick thinks for a 
	beat. Segues to the question...) 
	What about me?
	
	Viper turns, they stroll together.
	
			VIPER
	We can send you back to your 
	squadron with nothing noted on your 
	record except "CNC" --course not 
	completed, no explanation required. 
	Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your 
	career, but people always wonder 
	about things like that.
	
			MAVERICK
	Or....
	
			VIPER
	Or you can quit.
	
			MAVERICK
		I don't know...
	 
			VIPER
	I didn't know either. That's why I 
	told Jester to prepare your papers.
	
	Maverick looks irritated. Viper stops at an icecream vendor 
	and orders three with a gesture.
	
			MAVERICK
	You've already made up your mind.
	
	
			VIPER
	It's no disgrace, kid. That spin 
	was hell. It would wreck anyone's 
	confidence. You could be a good 
	pilot again someday...
	
			MAVERICK
	    (starts to get his back up)
	You think I should quit?!
	
			VIPER
	I didn't say that. That's up to 
	you. But I have responsibility for 
	the other guys up there, not just 
	you. They need to know you're all 
	right...that they can depend on 
	you.
	
	
	The vendor hands them icecream, they take it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Here, let me get this. We'll be 
	even.
	
	He reaches into his pocket for change, comes out with a 
	handful. Slams it on the counter, stars picking the proper 
	change out. Viper spots something and reaches for 
	it...Maverick sees and tries to block it, but Viper comes up 
	with the Navy Cross.
	
			MAVERICK
	Lucky charm.
	
	But Viper recognizes it for what it is.
	
			VIPER
	Sometimes it's luck, but in this 
	case, he earned it... I served with 
	your old man.
	
			MAVERICK
	I know.
	
			VIPER
	VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me 
	of him. You're just like he was, 
	only better...and worse.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm nothing like him.
	
			VIPER
	You may not think so, but you are.
	
			MAVERICK
	He was by the book, all the way.
	
			VIPER
	They waved him off. He thought he 
	knew better. He hit the 
	ramp.
	
			MAVERICK
	I never heard that.
	
			VIPER
	Not something they tell dependents.
	
			MAVERICK
	It's not true.
	
	
	Viper looks at him, for a long beat, throws his icecream 
	away.
	
			VIPER
	Why would I lie?
	
	He turns, walks away. Maverick stands there for a moment, 
	thinking, then catches up to him, stops him...struggles with 
	the thought...as Viper breaks in...
	            
			VIPER
	You start on a wrong heading... the 
	more you stick to it, the further 
	you get from your target. A good 
	pilot always questions himself, 
	always questions his judgments, 
	stays alert for drift and makes the 
	corrections...You may find a little 
	discipline helps with the fear. You 
	don't have to be alone up there.
	
	A pause...quiet intensity.
	
			MAVERICK
	How can I go on? I feel so... 
	responsible.
	
			VIPER
	Kid, the plain fact is...you are. 
	I'm not gonna stand here and blow 
	sunshine up your ass. Technically, 
	they absolved you. You and I know 
	what really happened. You pushed 
	it. You are responsible and you'll 
	always carry that. You know what, 
	I'll carry it too. I should have 
	taken you out of that cockpit.
	I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... 
	I always try to find something 
	worthwhile in someone's death. It's 
	no trade-off. It's not one for one. 
	What you learned isn't worth his 
	death. It couldn't be. But maybe 
	there is some value in it. I know 
	it's the first thing I've ever seen 
	that's really gotten to you. Now 
	the question is, what will you do 
	with it. If it gets you out of 
	flight status...so you don't kill 
	yourself or anybody else...that's 
	good. That's one good thing. You 
	were an accident waiting to 
	happen.
	
			MAVERICK
	You think I shouldn't fly.
	
			VIPER
	I didn't say that. That's up to 
	you. I think that if you do, if you 
	choose to come back, you'll be a 
	better pilot... a better man.
	
			MAVERICK
	Would you take me back? Would they?
	
			VIPER
	I'll have to think about it. I 
	don't know about them. I do know 
	one thing, We've got a lot invested 
	in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even 
	more than those other guys, Naval 
	Aviation needs a very few, very 
	good men.
	
	107 through  114.  OMITTED
	
	
	115.  INT. TOP GUN OFFICE  
	
	LOUD ROCK AND ROLL. The graduation ceremonies are in full 
	swing...They consist of informal ribbing, laughing, and a lot 
	of talking with the hands. every now and then, the name Goose 
	comes up and a shadow passes across a face. For the most 
	part, they press on, having a good time. Fungus shrugs at 
	someone's question and looks around.
	
			FUNGUS
	I don't know where he is...
	
			PORK
	What are his plans?
	
			FUNGUS
	I don't know.
	
	Ice stands proudly holding the Top Gun plaque as others 
	congratulate him...Hollywood looks up as the door opens, 
	Maverick is there.  He looks uncomfortable, unsure. He sees 
	Ice with the plaque. Fungus moves over to him, brings him in.
			FUNGUS
	I'm glad.
	
			WOLFMAN
	Good to see you, man.
	
	One by one, they come over, shake his hand. Viper stands 
	there, looking pleased but gruff. Maverick walks over, shakes 
	his hand. The party starts to pick up. A real celebration, 
	now. 
	
	Jester enters, a sheaf of messages in his hand. He takes 
	Viper aside for a word. Viper nods at him. The group's 
	attention gradually swings onto them. They quiet down 
	instinctively. Viper finally turns to them.
	
			VIPER
	Gentlemen, you know how I hate to 
	break up this party before it has a 
	chance to get really out of hand...
	    (more serious)
	...but there's a major flap on.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	We're being called back?
	
			VIPER
	You're on your way. Don't bother 
	going to BOQ. Your bags are packed.
	
	He hands them orders. Someone turns the music back up... as 
	they shake hands all around, the music grows, becomes purer 
	as the background voices drop out. 
	
	115A.  TIGHT ON MAVERICK'S 
	EYES
	
	WIDEN OUT -
	
	To include his helmet. Stereo headphones from his walkman 
	carry the same music from the party as he sits in the cockpit 
	and stares at the grey water rushing under. He sits in his 
	Tomcat on Ready 5 Alert. In the back, Fungus plays a hand 
	computer game - Jet Attack.
	
	
	116.  EXT. USS KITTY HAWK - SOMEWHERE AT SEA
	
	Maverick's Tomcat sits waiting for a launch order on the 
	forward catapult.
	
	
	116A.  ANGLE - MAVERICK
	
	He goes over the briefing in his mind...Stinger's voice 
	breaks through the music.:
	
			STINGER (V.O.)
	...Navy oceanographic ship... 
	international waters... fired 
	upon... unknown forces...
	
	
	117.  INT. READY ROOM - USS KITTYHAWK - MOMENTS BEFORE
	
	In full flight gear, sixteen teams of fighter pilots and 
	RIO's pay close attention to the Squadron CO, Stinger.
	
			STINGER
	...by unknown forces...by Migs. We 
	don't know who they are.  All I 
	know is that it's our ship, and our 
	orders are to escort it out of the 
	area.
	
	Stinger circles an area on the map.
	
	
	117A.  TOMCAT ON THE DECK - MAVERICK
	
	He studies his copy of the same map, headings and vectors 
	pencilled in.
	
			STINGER (V.O.) 
	This is "Bullseye". A rescue 
	operation is to begin within the 
	hour. Your mission is to give air 
	support to that rescue. There are 
	MiGs in the area, and tensions are 
	high. If you witness a hostile act 
	you will return fire. We will be 
	covering 360 degrees of the compass 
	by section. Be prepared for

	119.  DECK - KITTY HAWK 
	
	Maverick sits in his Tomcat on the Catapult on ready alert, 
	listening to the message traffic. He gets a launch order, 
	turns to the LSO. The LSO salutes, Maverick salutes and flips 
	him the bird. The LSO drops to the deck. Maverick is slammed 
	back as the F-14 is fired off the deck and rockets into the 
	sky.

	120.  EXT. SKY - HOLLYWOOD AND ICE 
	
	The two MiGs cross in a scissor pattern in their path... a  
	provocation...they join together again and fly level at ten 
	thousand feet. One of the MiGs does a sudden canopy roll.
	
			HOLLYWOOD 
	VERY FANCY!
	
	BOOM! A FLASH! Suddenly, Out of nowhere, Hollywood's hit.  
	WHAM! Just that fast, he's hit and goes down.  His f-14 
	disappears into the clouds.
	
			ICE
	WOOD! WOOD, ACKNOWLEDGE!
	
	Ice puts his nose down and follows him.
	
			ICE
	VOODOO ONE, MUSTANG. VOODOO THREE

	He comes out of clouds at 1500, nothing but empty water 
	below.

	122A.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
			FUNGUS
	Let's go! Dive on those bastards!  
	
	Maverick hesitates.
	
			FUNGUS
	Come on, man, engage. This is it. 
	Get your nose in there.
	
	Maverick hesitates again. He sees the hornet's nest below; 
	planes all over the sky.
	
			FUNGUS
	Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. 
	Take him. Pull on the goddamn 
	stick, man!
	
			MAVERICK
	Okay, okay.
	
			FUNGUS
	Don't tell me okay. Do it!
	
	Maverick draws a breath, then forces himself to pull the 
	stick over. The F-14 rolls in hard toward the battle. 
	Suddenly, the cluster breaks apart. The MiGs break in every 
	direction as Maverick BLASTS through their formation. 
	Something comes up through the clouds. A MiG BLASTS by. 
	Another rolls in and locks onto them.
	
	The MiGs swarm toward the TOMCATS, coming from every 
	direction. CANNON FIRE erupts from one of the MiGs.
	
			MAVERICK
	MAVERICK'S EMGAGED. HARD LEFT, ICE, 
	PADLOCK THE EASTERN SECTION.
	
	The F-14's execute a left oblique turn in unison. They come 
	down in a section attack with their cannons blazing. From 
	Maverick's cockpit, everything looks choppy:  MiGs slide past 
	at incredible speed. Cannons BLAST, as the planes scramble 
	for position.
	
	Out-numbered four to two, Maverick and Ice fight 
	defensively. Maverick has the angle on a MIG, when Fungus 
	spots a missile launch.
	
			FUNGUS
	BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! 
	FLARES!
	
			MAVERICK
	BREAKING LEFT!
	
	Maverick releases a flare as he takes the F-14 into a hard 
	left. The missile tracks the heat of the flare and sails out 
	of the area, missing the Tomcat and falling toward the sea.
	
			ICE
	TWO MIGS ON MY TAIL, MAVERICK. I'M 
	DEFENSIVE.
	
	Maverick jerks his stick right and streaks toward Ice. He 
	cuts off one of the MiGs with CANNON FIRE, driving it down 
	toward the deck. Ice goes into vertical and comes around to 
	gain an angle on the other MiG. His RIO is in position to 
	check Mav's rear. 
	
			SLIDER
	MAVERICK! SIX O'CLOCK!
	
	Maverick turns to look and jerks a hard left. The MiG is on 
	him, CANNON BLAZING. Ice Yo Yos inside and cuts the MiG off. 
			ICE
	FOX ONE.
	
	He fires a sidewinder. The MiG turns hard, the missile sails 
	away.
	
	
			SLIDER
	BANDIT, THREE O'OLOCK HIGH!
	
	Ice's F-14 is suddenly caught in a HAIL OF CANNON FIRE as a 
	MiG sweeps down from three o'clock. He breaks, dives. The 
	jets streak across the sky, low to the deck, skimming the 
	surface.
	
			FUNGUS
	ICE'S  DEFENSIVE, HELP HIM OUT.
	
	Maverick's F-14 Rollaways in and intercepts the bogey on 
	Ice's tail.
	
			MAVERICK
	REVERSE RIGHT.
	
	Ice turns right, the MiG bugs and jerks into vertical.  
	Maverick swoops after him.
	
			FUNGUS
	STAY WITH HIM. YOUR SIX IS CLEAR.
	
	
	Maverick closes, jerking left, right, twisting and turning, 
	staying on his tail. 
	
	
	122B.  MAVERICK'S COCKPIT
	
			FUNGUS
	ONE ON OUR SIX! BUG OUT! BUG OUT!
	
	BULLETS fly by Maverick's F-14 from the MiG on his six. He 
	pulls a hard left, then takes the plane straight up. We hear 
	instructions shouted by Fungus, but it is all obscured in the 
	SOUNDS AND FURY OF THE BATTLE. Maverick peels over the top 
	and comes down like a comet. A series of passes at the MiGs. 
	As they come by, one of the MiGs pulls up, 
	
			MAVERICK
	OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH. 
	
			ICE
	LOOK OUT! 
	
	
	They look up. An MiG 21 is coming down, belly to them, close 
	to a mid-air collision.
	
			MAVERICK
	JESUS!
	
	
	He pushes down. The MiG ROARS BY. The whole airplane goes 
	"BOOOMMMM" it's that close.
	
			FUNGUS
	OHHHHH SHIT!
	
	The shock, the air pressure SLAMS them as it goes by, 
	missing by 4-5 feet. Maverick pulls back in, sees a MiG 21 
	below. It takes off, bugging out. Ice goes after him. The MiG 
	maneuvers, jerking hard left, hard right, twisting  up, down.
	
	Ice is right in his shadow. They come in hard and low over 
	the sea. He has the MiG in the diamond.
	
			ICE
	GOOD TONE, FOX ONE
	
	The MiG starts turning.
	
			ICE
	Ah Nuts!
	
	
	The missile goes by the tail.
	
			ICE
	Son of a bitch!
	
	Then his tail comes off, the airplane goes over, a chute 
	comes out. The MiG EXPLODES into a thousand small pieces. 
	They roar by the MiG pilot hanging in his straps.
	
			SLIDER
	JESUS!  HEY SPLASH ONE, SPLASH ONE 
	BANDIT! SPLASH THAT SUCKER!
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT ONE HERE. ON THE NOSE.  
	COMING DOWN. 
	
	Rolling down on him, good SIDEWINDER TONE. The MiG'S sense 
	him, they break, one guy down low. 
	
			ICE
	ON THE NOSE?
	
			MAVERICK
	GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
	 
	He squeezes the trigger.
	
	
	123.  EXT. THE MISSILE STARTS TO GO 
	
	The vapor trail comes off, the MiG 21 turns like he's been 
	bounced off a rubber wall, comes around on the missile, beats 
	it. The missile flies by him. 
	
	
			MAVERICK
	AH, SHIT! GODDAMN IT!
	
	MiG comes back turning into him.
	
			FUNGUS
	THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT ONE COMING UP.
	
			FUNGUS
	AND HE'S GUNNING.
	
	He looks back. 30 millimeter tracers go by; they just kind 
	of float. He breaks, hits airbrakes, the trailing MiG dives 
	through.
	
	Suddenly another MiG appears, rocketing straight for him. 
	They close at 900 knots--VABOOOM!--They pass nose to nose, 
	canopy to canopy. Both planes pitch straight up, trying for 
	the altitude advantage.
	
			MAVERICK
	Zone 5 burners.
	
	The F-14 outclimbs the MiG sitting on its tail, full 
	thruster, it rockets straight up, away from the planet.  
	Maverick has the advantage. Suddenly, his F-14 runs out of 
	energy. FUNGUS is the first to call it.
	
			FUNGUS
	We're ballistic! Ohhhhhh Shit!
	
	The plane backs down on itself, backs into its own smoke as 
	it flips over, falls away...He catches it, just regains 
	control, when...A ROAR. He looks up.
	
	SECOND MIG coming down. Right on him. It fills the Canopy! 
	Instinctive - A Push to miss him, Maverick breaks fast down 
	into him, a last ditch maneuver, and the airplane 
	DEPARTS...the roll rates and the pitch rates combine and it 
	tumbles over the top; the airplane just goes end-over-end. 
	They are being slammed and rattled all over the 
	cockpits...bone-jarring, neck-snapping whips. SHRIEKS and 
	SCREAMS from the airframe. Terriflying?
	
			FUNGUS
	Ohhh Mother!
	
			MAVERICK
	    (strangely calm)
	Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a 
	slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, 
	I've got it.
	
	
	Fungus is getting his teeth rattled. He's helpless, he has 
	no controls, there's nothing he can do but hold on.
	
	
			FUNGUS
	Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? 
	Are you CRAZY?
	
			MAVERICK
	Roger, I've got it. 
	
	The plane's gyrations are rattling Fungus's helmet off the 
	canopy. 
	
			FUNGUS
	You've got it?   Good!  Cause for a 
	minute there, you had me worried.
	
	It yaws and rolls, starts into a spin.
	
			FUNGUS
	Now have you got it?  Have you 
	still got it?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yawing right.
	
			FUNGUS
	I know!
	
			MAVERICK
	Rudder's left, stick's forward.
	
			FUNGUS
	Swell! Passing ten thousand!
	
	
			MAVERICK
	I've got it -- hold on!
	
			FUNGUS
	Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your 
	harness!
	
			MAVERICK
	I can recover. Hold on!
	
	They're in a progressive spiral, nose low.  The altimeter 
	unwinds, speed picks up. The G forces are forcing them away 
	from the axis of spin, jamming Maverick against the 
	instrument panel at the front of the cockpit. 
	
			MAVERICK
	You with me?
	
	Fungus, also, is jammed to his panel.
	
			FUNGUS
	Right behind you. 
	
	He is closer to the center of spin and less strongly held. 
	It doesn't do much good, however, he can't control the plane. 
	The only thing he can reach is the yellow and black loop; the 
	ejection handle. He reaches for it.
	
			FUNGUS
	Speed's up to 150. 
	
	Fungus's eyes are wide.  The earth grows larger as it rises 
	towards them. G forces flatten them. They've long since lost 
	the MiG. Nobody but an idiot would try to follow them in this 
	maneuver.
	
			FUNGUS
	5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
	
			MAVERICK
	Okay.
	
	
	The earth grows larger.
	
			FUNGUS
	4500. Critical point.
	
	
	FUNGUS grabs the ejection handle with both hands.
	
			MAVERICK
	No! Not again!
	
			FUNGUS
	What are you talking about,
		we gotta go!
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm not losing it again!
	
	The jet is standing on its nose, gaining speed, plunging 
	towards the ocean.  
	
			FUNGUS
	Gotta go, man.
	
			MAVERICK
	280, 290, 300 knots.
	
			FUNGUS
	3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man.  
	3,000 feet, we gotta go!
	
			MAVERICK
	You go. I'm staying with it.
	
			FUNGUS
	I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
	
	Then, just as suddenly, as he's about to pull...Maverick 
	catches it. The plane responds. They're out of the spin. He 
	gets control. Fungus sits there dumbly, hands on handle. 
	Still not believing...
	
			FUNGUS
	ONE....ONE....ONE...
	
	
	SEA LEVEL 
	
	Maverick stops the tumble, pulls the nose up quickly and the 
	F-l4 sweeps into level flight no more than a hundred feet 
	above the deck. He comes up and looks right at Ice. Ice is 
	down low. He comes around, a MiG-21 all over him like a cheap 
	suit. A flick, a whip, and Maverick in perfect position, 
	rolls right in on the MiG. Fungus looks like he just saw 
	Jesus. 
	
			FUNGUS
	What  in  the  Christ...was that? 
	
	He looks at the Mig target set-up in front of him in awe.
	
			FUNGUS
	Did you plan that? Was all that 
	something you planned?
	
	
	Maverick's acquired the target and is all business. 
	
			MAVERICK
	ALL RIGHT, ICE. COME HARD 
	STARBOARD, THEN EXTEND TO THE EAST. 
	
	
	Fungus is still lividly frazzled.
	
			FUNGUS
	Because...if that was... Next time 
	you tell me first.
	
			ICE
	ROG.
	
	Maverick breaks down, Ice zooms up, breaks in and takes the 
	MiG the other way. Maverick Yo Yo's in, comes right up behind 
	the MiG, as the MiG starts acceleration. 
	
	
	Maverick rolls in on Ice and the MiG. 
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD 
	TONE ON IT.
	
			ICE
	I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF  
	A SHOT?
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
	
			ICE
	WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
	
			MAVERICK
	WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2 
	
	The MiG fires.
	
			MAVERICK
	HE FIRED, BREAK NOW!
	
	Ice breaks left, drops flares. The MiG's missile follows the 
	flares. Maverick FIRES. The missile doesn't twitch. It flys 
	right up the tail pipe of the MiG, the canopy flies off, the 
	pilot comes out of it, and then the MiG blows up, We go right 
	through the fire ball. VVVARRRUOOMMM!
	
			MAVERICK
	He's out! We got him!
	
	The MiG rolls into the ground...KABOOM!  They swoop by the 
	pilot, hanging in his straps...He watches them, dumbly. 
	Fungus waves. 
	
			FUNGUS
	What a dope! Maybe they'll
		give him another plane...and we
		can shoot him down again.
	
	Maverick and Ice join up, light it, stand on their burners 
	and blast straight for the sun.
	
	
	MAVERICK'S F-14 
	
	Without warning, a triple roll, as the elation hits him.
	
	
	125.  INT. MAVERICK'S COCKPIT 
	
			FUNGUS
	What is it? What's wrong?
	
	
	Fungus nervously looks around at his circuit breakers.
	
			FUNGUS
	Is there something I should know?
	
			MAVERICK
	Just relax.
	
			FUNGUS
	Is it the plane?
	
			MAVERICK
	The plane is fine.
	
			FUNGUS
	Is it you?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We 
	did it...Damn! We sure did it!

	off his feet.
	
	
	129.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
	He glances over at Ice, who gives him thumbs up.
	
			MAVERICK
	BOSS, YOU BETTER CLEAR IT OUT,
		WE'RE FIVE MINUTES OUT
		AND WE'RE DOING IT!
	
	
	130.  INT. PRI-FLY BRIDGE
	
	The Admiral looks out over the water and smiles.
	
			MAVERICK (V.O. filtered)
	TEN MILES ASTERN, BOSS. HOW ABOUT 
	IT?
	
	
	The Air Boss is livid. He clenches the mike.
	
			AIR BOSS
	MUSTANG TO GHOST RIDER!...
	
	Just then the Admiral pipes up.
	
			ADMIRAL
	Johnson!
	
			AIR BOSS
	Yes, Sir, Admiral?
	
			ADMIRAL
	Give him his flyby.
	
	
	The Admiral looks at the others, tries to surpress his own 
	grin. He slides into his (borrowed) command chair, looks into 
	the wind. On the back of the chair, a clue; his name and 
	rank:  RADM. Buford Clancy, "BOOMER"
	
	The AIR BOSS burns, but has no choice. 
	
			AIR BOSS
	    (really pissed off)
	 ROGER, GHOST RIDER, YOU'RE CLEAR.
	
	131.  EXT. 
	KITTY HAWK DAY
	
	Sailors line the deck and search the sky. They crane their 
	necks from their battle stations, sweating into the sun, 
	watching for the approach of F-14's. Someone sees it--he 
	points and SHOUTS. The F-14 appears, and every man stands and 
	CHEERS.
	
	
	132. POV -
	
	WE COME SCREAMING IN, 5 FEET OVER THE WATER, throwing up 
	rooster tails behind. WE SPLIT OFF and ZOOM along each side 
	of the carrier, at 100 feet and ROLL IT.
	
	
	133.  INT. PRI-FLY BRIDGE--VVVAAAAABBOOOOM!
	
	It lifts the Air Boss right off his feet. The walls warp, 
	dust sifts from the overhead. The whole tower just goes BOOM!
	
			AIR BOSS
	Goddamn that guy!"
	
	
	134.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
	
	They break at 500 knots. Ice is first down over the ramp, 
	waved in.  The F-14 comes in a little rocky. It bounces hard 
	but grabs the wire, then jerks to a sudden halt. The sailors 
	CHEER AND APPLAUD, throwing fists of victory into the air, 
	straining to get a look at Ice as the crew directs his plane 
	off to the side. Opening the canopy, Ice and Slider unstrap. 
	Stinger and the others are there. Guys are climbing up, 
	climbing all over the airplane. They're already painting a 
	MiG on the side, and they're looking at Ice in awe.
	
	
	135.  POV - MAVERICK - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - AS HE LANDS
	
	He catches the wire, the view slams down toward the deck as 
	the plane arrests, then comes up...He releases the cockpit 
	and can hear the ROAR OF THE CROWD...
	
	
	136.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
	
	He swings the nose around past Ice's. Ice's plane is covered 
	in colored jerseys as the ground crew pulls him out. 
	Maverick's plane swings towards the PRI-FLY BRIDGE. Pilots in 
	flightsuits pour from the deck hatch APPLAUDING... 
	
	
	137.  HE CUTS HIS ENGINES AS THE GROUND CREW SWARMS
	
	As Maverick and Fungus climb down, they see their wingmen on 
	the deck. Ice is looking in Maverick's direction. His face is 
	inscrutable. Maverick gets mobbed, but pushes over to Ice. 
	They stare at each other for a moment, eye to eye even as 
	they are buffeted by the crowd. Finally, Ice breaks...a grin.
	
	
			ICE
	I guess I owe you one.
	
			MAVERICK
	You don't owe me anything.
		We're on the same team. 
	
			ICE
	You saved our lives. You did it! 
	
			MAVERICK
	We did it.
	
			ICE
	You're a hell of a flyer.
		    (he can't resist)
		You can be my wingman any time.
	
			MAVERICK
	    (laughs)
	No. You can be mine!
	
	Now Ice laughs. Nobody's ever gonna win on this one. But Ice 
	smiles at him...It's now a running joke between them.
	
			ICE
	Whatever you say, Commander.
	
	
	He and Slider snap to and proudly salute. Maverick 
	hesitates, then returns it. As Ice and Slider snap it off, it 
	turns into the pilot's salute, they give them the bird. 
	Maverick and Fungus laugh and return the compliment. 
	
	As they are mobbed by sailors, Maverick is elated to see two 
	familiar figures: Hollywood and Wolfman turn from their 
	battle damaged TOMCAT on the forward elevator as it sinks out 
	of sight below decks.
	
	
	138.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
	
			FUNGUS
	What happened to you?
	
			WOLFMAN
	He got our radio, and an engine. We 
	were lucky to make it back.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Not luck. Skill.
	
	
	ANOTHER ANGLE
	
	Stinger rushes up, grabs Ice and Maverick in a bear hug.
	
			STINGER
	MiG killers! You name it, boy. 
	Sky's the limit. You name it. A 
	medal. Anything you want. Anything.
	
	
			ICE
	MiG killers!  What else is there?
	
	Maverick grins, turns away from them.  He he looks out, at 
	the dying sun glinting over the sea. He thinks how beautiful 
	it is out here! Fungus grabs him from behind.
	
			FUNGUS
	You hear that? Anything we want. 
	Anything...Well???
	
			MAVERICK
	Well what?
	
			FUNGUS
	What do you want?
	
			MAVERICK
	What do I want?
	
			FUNGUS
	What do you want?
	
			MAVERICK
	     (he thinks.)
	Any more MiGs?
	
	Stinger shakes his head no.
	
			STINGER
	They don't seem to want to come up 
	anymore. There's nothing on the 
	scopes. In fact, everybody's 
	denying the incident ever happened. 
	So...what is it?  What do you want?
	
	
	Maverick turns away, considering the options.
	
	
	139.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK - ANOTHER ANGLE
	
	Another Tomcat rolls up to park nearby. He looks 
	at the plane. Over the deck LOUDSPEAKER, comes the 
	final call to the F-14:
	
			LSO (V.O. filtered)
	    (a touch of sarcasm)
	OKAY, GENTLEMEN. YOU CAN CUT YOUR 
	ENGINES...YOU HAVE ARRIVED....
	
	
	WWHHHEEEEZZZZEEERRRRRUUUUUMMMMMMMMM...
	
	AS THE ENGINES FADE, SO DOES THE PICTURE.
	
	
	FADE IN - WEEKS LATER
	
	140.  EXT. DAY - FLIGHT LINE MIRAMAR - TOPGUN
	
	Viper, Jester and others walk out of hangar to watch a wing 
	return.
	
	
	141A.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY
	
	THEIR POV. Suddenly an F-14 breaks, ROARS in over the field 
	inverted, a hundred feet off the ground.
	
	
	142.  FLIGHT LINE MIRAMAR - DAY
	
			JESTER
	Who's the hell is that?
	
			VIPER
	Three guesses.
	
			JESTER
	Well, he's in trouble and he didn't 
	even get here yet.
	
	
	Jester looks over at an admiral, who steps out of a staff 
	car, squints up at the swooping plane, turns, barks an order 
	to his driver, jumps in the car and SLAMS the door, the car 
	takes off.
	
	
	143.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - FURTHER DOWN THE RUNWAY
	
	MP jeeps - lights flashing, pull out and head for the flight 
	line.
	
			VIPER
	Come on.
	
	They head for the hangar
	
	
	144.  OVER THE END OF THE RUNWAY
	
	The jet breaks at 500 knots and sets down neatly on the 
	tarmac. The rest of his flight follows in perfect formation.
	
	
	145.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - MAVERICK'S JET -PULLING UP
	
	He unbuckles his straps, takes his helmet off. He looks over 
	at the approaching caravan.
	
			FUNGUS
	I think they know we're here.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Let me do the talking.
	
			FUNGUS
	Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do 
	the talking! 
	
	He stands up in the cockpit, gives a snappy salute.
	
			FUNGUS
	Why Admiral....How really good it 
	is to see you!
	
	
	Maverick turns away. As he backs down the steps, a jeep 
	screeches up, doors slam open, footsteps.
	
			A VOICE
	Who's in charge here?
	
			MAVERICK
	I am.
	
	He's answered automatically, but now it hits him. He knows 
	the voice. He turns.
	
	HIS POV - CHARLIE, HANDS ON HIPS
	
			CHARLIE
	Not for long, you keep that up.
	
	He hops down, stands there speechless, grinning happily at 
	her.
	
			CHARLIE
	Well?
	
			MAVERICK
	Well what?
	
			CHARLIE
	You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, 
	you got your MiGs....You're our new 
	Top Gun instructor...Now what?
	
			MAVERICK
	Oh...I'll think of something... 
	What are you doing here?
	
			CHARLIE
	I live here, remember?
	
			MAVERICK
	Right on the flight line?
	
	He's got her on that one. She laughs.
	
			CHARLIE
	Everybody's got to be somewhere.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Maybe your somewhere's with me...
	
	He puts his arms around her. Self-conscious, she pulls away, 
	a little embarrassed to show this on the flight line. He 
	laughs.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's okay. I always look forward 
	to a challenge. 
	
	
	Now she laughs back and puts her arms around him. She kisses 
	him and now she doesn't give a damn who sees it.

	1.  EXT. NIGHT. - THE PACIFIC IS ANYTHING BUT
	
	WINDS HOWL. Rain drives horizontal. The sea surges up, 
	nearly to the flight deck of the Aircraft Carrier USS Kitty 
	Hawk. The carrier plunges, driving its bow into a wall of 
	grey water. The deck pitches forward and back, rolls left to 
	right, and yaws in a corkscrew motion. The entire 93,000 ton 
	behemoth rises and falls in the TYPHOON-DRIVEN SWELL. 
	
	
	2.  SOMETHING DROPS DOWN OUT OF THE NIGHT
	
	A ROAR. Silver wings flash by, a cockpit, fiery jet 
	exhausts. A forty ton monster drops at 120 knots into an area 
	the size of a tennis court in a CONTROLLED CRASH. 
	
	2A.  A SHOWER OF SPARKS, A SCREECH OF RUBBER AND METAL as 
	the gear hits the deck. The hook catches the 3 wire and the 
	F-14 TOMCAT is slammed to a halt. It's the scariest thing 
	you've ever seen, the most dangerous maneuver in aviation and 
	just another day at the office for a Naval Aviator.
	
	TITLES OVER 
	
	HARD DRIVING ROCK AND ROLL - THE CARS - RIDE ME HIGH
	
	
	3.  FLIGHT DECK - THE LANDING SIGNAL OFFICER - (LSO)
	
	Leans almost horizontal into the winds. He holds the pickle, 
	controlling the landing lights and speaks into a mike. His 
	calm, professional commands belie the extreme conditions.
	
			LSO
	POWER, POWER...DON'T CLIMB...
	OKAY, HOLD WHAT YOU GOT.
	
	
	4.  ANOTHER TOMCAT FLIES OVER THE RAMP
	
	It slams in. The pilot hits full power, catches the wire, slams 
	to a stop, cuts his engines.
	
	5.  OMITTED
	
	6.  AIR OPS - BELOW DECK 
	
	Lots of scopes and electronic gear. The CARRIER CONTROL APPROACH 
	OFFICER (CCA) watches a blip on radar, reaches for his mike key.
	
	
	
	7.  EXT. THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING - (AERIAL)
	
	We float like gods, above the storm, above the cloud cover, 
	looking down. From overhead, a probe slides into frame, then 
	a graceful nose. The cockpit sides by, Pilot, then Radar 
	Intercept Officer (RIO) barely illuminated by the orange glow 
	of their instruments. The fuselage gracefully swells to two 
	enormous air intakes, then variable angle wings, swept back 
	for high speed flight. Twin tailbooms cant outward, 
	horizontal stabilizers make constant adjustments. Enormous 
	twin jet exhaust ports glow red in the moonlight.
	
	
	8.  INT. COCKPIT - (AERIAL)
	
	We become aware of WIND WHISTLE, JET ENGINE SOUNDS, RADIO 
	STATIC. The pilot, COUGAR, is calm, steady. The Radar 
	Intercept Officer in the backseat, GOOSE, is a wildman, 
	always an edge of humor in his voice. A UHF transmission 
	breaks in..
	
			STRIKE (V.O. filtered)
	GHOST RIDER, THIS IS STRIKE... WE 
	HAVE UNKNOWN CONTACT INBOUND, 
	MUSTANG. YOUR VECTOR ZERO NINE ZERO 
	FOR BOGEY.
	
	Almost immediately the RIO picks up a target and responds.
	
			GOOSE
	CONTACT 20 LEFT AT 25, 900 KNOTS 
	CLOSURE.
	
	
	8A.  ANGLE - SECOND F-14 - 115 - COUGAR'S WINGMAN 
	
	Come in on the cockpit with stenciled name and call signs: LT. 
	EVAN MITCHELL is the pilot, MAVERICK. In flight suit and oxygen 
	mask, we can only see his eyes. they are confident. In his 
	mid-twenties, he is lean, hard, athletic...the archetype fighter 
	pilot. His rear-seater is LTJG. WALTER MERLIN; WIZARD.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'LL I.D. HIM, YOU HOOK 'EM.
	
	Maverick peels off to right, to high cover position; 5 o'clock.
	
	
	9.  INT. GHOST RIDER 117 - COUGAR'S POV
	
	HEADS UP DISPLAY (HUD) glows dimly on the windscreen. Directly 
	in front of the stick, two CRT screens display data. The bottom 
	screen shows a radar sweep. Wedged between the instruments is a 
	snapshot of a pretty young woman with a 2 month-old baby.
	
	
			GOOSE
	Closing fast. MUSTANG, THIS IS 
	GHOST RIDER ONE ONE SEVEN. CONTACT 
	ONE BOGEY, 090 AT 15 MILES, 900 
	KNOTS OF CLOSURE.
			COUGAR
	Look for the trailer.
	
			GOOSE
	I don't see anything.  MAVERICK, 
	YOU HAVE A TRAILER?
	
	
	10.  MAVERICK'S F-14 
	
	Flying in combat spread, 1 mile abeam, higher. 
	
			GOOSE
	NEGATIVE, COUGAR. LOOKS LIKE HE'S 
	SINGLE.
	
	
	11.  INT. 117 - COUGAR'S COCKPIT
	
			COUGAR
	HANG BACK AND WATCH FOR HIM. HERE 
	COMES...MIG ONE.
	
	
	12.  EXT. SKY 
	
	Closing at 900 knots, The MiG is a speck, then a flash and a 
	ROAR, a knife-edge pass at 300 feet. It rockets past his left 
	wing tip and disappears. Cougar kicks rudder, whips the stick, 
	screams into a tight turning roll and dives after him. He slams 
	the throttle forward to ZONE 5 AFTERBURNER.  
	
	
	13.  EXT. - MAVERICK'S F-14
	
	Maverick sees a SECOND MiG drop from above onto Cougar's tail.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	BOGEY ON YOUR SIX. I'M ON HIS.
	
	Maverick swings after him, lights it. 
	
	
	13A.  ALL FOUR JETS SCREAM DOWN IN A POWER DIVE. 
	
	They punch through cloud cover into the soup.
	
	
	
	14.  EXT. COUGAR'S F-14 
	
	He is closing on the first MiG when a shocking BLIPBLIPBLIPBLIP 
	tone breaks into their headsets.
	
			GOOSE
	I've got a six strobe.  I think 
	he's locked on us.
	
			COUGAR
	It's a MiG 21. They don't have 
	radar missiles!
	
			GOOSE
	Let's hope you're right!
	
			COUGAR
	What is he doing?
	
			GOOSE
	He's pissing me off!
	
	Cougar swings mad gyrations, cutting back and forth across the 
	front MiG's tailpipe, trying to break the lock-on. The TONE grows 
	more insistant.
	
			COUGAR
	Can't shake him.
	
			MAVERICK (V.O.) 
	WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
	
			COUGAR
	Maintaining course. Straight for 
	Mustang.
	
			GOOSE
	Stay with him.
	
	The tone grows steady, BLIPBLIPBLIPBLIP.
	
			GOOSE
	   (alarmed)
	That's missile lock! 
	
			COUGAR
	He better be kidding!
	
			GOOSE
	Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole.
	Hope nobody burps!
	
	
	
	14A.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
			MAVERICK
	I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR. (to himself)  
	Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
	
			COUGAR
	I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
	
			MAVERICK
	ROGER, COUGAR. (to himself and his RIO) 
	Okay boys, pull out with your hands up 
	and nobody'll get hurt.
	
	
	14B.  INT. COUGAR'S F-14
	
	Up front, Cougar checks his gunsight...He gets I.R. lock...
	
			COUGAR
	We're locked on MiG ONE. Why 
	doesn't he disengage?
	
			GOOSE
	These guys are getting on my 
	nerves.
	
	
	14C.   FINALLY, MIG ONE TURNS AWAY.
	
			GOOSE
	GHOST RIDER TO MUSTANG. BANDITS  
	TURNING AWAY.
	
	But Cougar presses forward, and MiG TWO stays on his tail.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	COUGAR, BREAK LEFT. TRY A HIGH G 
	ROLL UNDERNEATH. BREAK OUT THE 
	BOTTOM.
	
	Anger gives way to discipline. Cougar's Tomcat breaks left, 
	dives into dense cloud. MiG TWO still follows.
	
			MAVERICK
	HE'S STILL ON YOU, COUGAR.
	
	
	15.  EXT. COUGAR - IN THE CLOUDS
	
	Still hears the tone, BLIPBLIPBLIP...
	
			COUGAR
	
	I KNOW. I KNOW.
	
	He rolls over into wild evasive maneuvers, finally breaks lock. 
	
	
	16.  INT. MIG
	
	Breaks out of cloud, looks around, startled.  There is nothing, 
	no F-14. He scans the sky frantically, while rolling the 
	aircraft. ...Suddenly, he feels a presence. He looks straight up 
	and behind him. A few feet away, a TOMCAT slides into position 
	canopy to canopy, an incredible feat of flying. Maverick and 
	Wizard stare at him. Maverick slides even closer, canopies nearly 
	touching. The MiG pilot acknowledges them with a weak wave.  
	Maverick stares for a moment, then flips him the bird. 
	
	The MiG pushes negative G, hard down and away. He heads for the 
	deck.
	
			WIZARD
	He's running for it.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Ah, the thrill of victory and the 
	agony of defeat.
	
			WIZARD
	Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 
	4.0.  We're gonna get them wet 
	unless we find a Sonoco station.
	
			MAVERICK
	COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK.  I'M 
	GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE 
	BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?

	WELL, WE CAN'T STAY UP HERE EITHER.
	
	
	25.  FLIGHT DECK 
	
	Maverick's plane settles in over the ramp, suddenly, BLASTS FROM 
	IT'S AFTERBURNERS...it ROARS over the deck without touching and 
	off into the night. The LSO is shocked into comment.

	26.  MAVERICK'S COCKPIT  - (AERIAL)
	
			MAVERICK
	I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
	
			WIZARD
	What the hell you doing?
	
			MAVERICK
	Helping him in.
	
			WIZARD
	What makes you think we can get 
	back in?  We don't have the fuel 
	for this.
			MAVERICK
	Just get me to him.
	
			WIZARD
	He's nine o'clock high. We're two 
	thousand pounds low!
	
	
	27.  DARK TURBULENT CLOUDS
	
	Maverick's plane pulls up behind Cougar's. Cougar's plane 
	suddenly flips over, flying inverted.
	
	
			COUGAR
	I'm pulling up.
	
			GOOSE
	No! Now we're inverted!
	
	
	Maverick pulls up off the wing of the inverted aircraft. His 
	voice is calmness itself.
	
			MAVERICK
	HEY, ANY OF YOU GUYS SEEN AN
	AIRCRAFT CARRIER AROUND HERE?
	
	Cougar looks over, surprised.
	
			COUGAR
	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
	
			MAVERICK
	EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE.
	..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU.
	YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
	
	Nothing happens.
	
			MAVERICK
	COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK. HALF ROLL 
	IT. NOW!
	
	
	Cougar's plane completes the roll, is now upright.
	
			GOOSE
	We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to 
	put it down.
	
			COUGAR
	It's crazy, man. Instruments are 
	crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
	
			GOOSE
	TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR 
	INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
	
			MAVERICK
	YOU'RE STRAIGHT AND LEVEL, COUGAR.
			COUGAR
	I'M HANGING IN MY STRAPS. I TURN IT 
	OVER AND I'M STILL HANGING IN MY 
	STRAPS. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON 
	UP HERE?
	
			MAVERICK
	YOU'RE NOT IN THE STRAPS.  IT'S 
	VERTIGO, THAT'S ALL IT IS. STAY ON 
	MY WING. I'LL DROP YOU OFF.
	
	Maverick pulls up wing tip to wing tip, inches apart.
	
			COUGAR
	MAVERICK.
	
			MAVERICK
	YEAH, COUGAR?
	
	
			COUGAR
	YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME...
	IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
	
			MAVERICK
	NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL.
		EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
	
			COUGAR
	I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M 
	GONNA EJECT.
	
			GOOSE
	Look at the weather! They'll never 
	find us! We're near out of fuel. 
	Put it down.
	
			MAVERICK
	COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
	
			COUGAR
	OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS 
	THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL 
	HAVE YOUR BUTT!
	
			GOOSE
	You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be 
	where your head used to be.
	
	
	28.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK 
	
	All eyes are on what they can see of the approach of the two 
	planes. Maverick drops him off at the pattern and circles. The 
	LSO watches the approach. The Tomcat drops a wing, straightens, 
	drops the wing, straightens ... the approach of a pilot 
	experiencing vertigo as Cougar tries to satisfy his inner ear.
	
			LSO
	LEVEL...YOUR WINGS... EASY... 
	YOU'RE SETTLING....FLY THE BALL.
	
	A wind shear just off the ramp drives the plane suddenly down.
	
			LSO
	POWER...POWER!..POWER!...WAVE OFF!  
	WAVE OFF  WAVE OFF!
	
	
	AFTERBURNERS BLAST, but the Tomcat horrifyingly settles tail-low 
	toward the deck. The deck crew watches in terror as the plane 
	wallows in toward them. The LSO'S turn, take a few steps and 
	throw themselves off the flight deck.
	
	They sail into the night toward the surging seas a hundred feet 
	below, then are caught in safety nets hung off the side.
	
	
	28A.  THE PLANE
	
	Settles, settles, standing on it's engines, trying to arrest 
	it's downward momentum. The hook raises sparks as it skids across 
	the deck... The plane stops falling and hangs for a moment, about 
	to blast back up, when the hook catches the last wire.. The wire 
	snags it, plucking 45,000 pounds of fuel, metal and men out of 
	the air and slamming it all to the deck. WHAMMMM! Right wheel 
	flies up the deck and over the side...the gear collapses. The 
	plane SCREECHES sideways. The crew watches helplessly as it skids 
	slams into it and comes to rest in cloud of fuel vapor and steam.
	
	The LSO runs up, shouting into the mike. 
	
			LSO
	COUGAR, GOOSE...COME IN COUGAR! 
	SHUT YOUR ENGINES DOWN, YOU'VE 
	ARRIVED.
	
			AIR BOSS
	GHOST RIDER! ACKNOWLEDGE!
	GHOST RIDER! ACKNOWLEDGE!
	
	Crash crew leaps into action. The fire crew is there. The man in 
	the Silver Suit jumps up on the wing and crawls to the cockpit. 
	The figures inside are not moving. He hits the canopy release. 
	The canopy pops open. Silver suit grabs at the rear seat harness 
	release. He screams through his suit's aluminized cloth...
	
			SILVER SUIT
	Goose, can you hear me?  Goose!
	
	Nothing for a moment. He's dead! Then the RIO'S helmet 
	moves...His head turns. He tears the mask away from his face, 
	looks up at Silver Suit. His head clears.
	
			GOOSE
	Oh, Hello... Valet parking?
	
	Silver suit is stunned for a moment. He straightens up, his head 
	inclines quizzically. Then it hits him.
	
			SILVER SUIT
	Son of a bitch!
	
			GOOSE
	You will put it up front,
	with the Porsches?
	
	He grabs him under the armpits, drags him out of the plane. 
	
			GOOSE
	Hey...easy...Take it easy...
	I'm a veteran!
	
	
	Goose grabs a passing crewman by the arm.
	
			GOOSE
	Can you check under the hood. I 
	thought I heard a funny noise.
	
	Other crewmembers help Cougar out. He seems stunned, but Goose 
	reacts to his fear with frantic one-liners. He grabs a crew 
	member's radio, as Silver Suit helps him away and looks to the 
	figures of the Admiral and the Air Boss far up on the bridge... 
	He waves to them, does his best impression...Desi Arnaz.
	
			GOOSE
	Lucy...Ricky...I'n Home!
	
	
	28B.  BRIDGE FLIGHT DECK
	
	A moment of disbelief... Then hysterical, tension relieving 
	laughter.
	
	
	28C.  FLIGHT DECK
	
	Goose spots Cougar being helped out. He pulls away, reaches back 
	into the cockpit and grabs Cougar's snapshot of wife and kid. 
	They lead Goose away as firemen blast the aircraft with foam.
	
			GOOSE
	Is it extra for the hot wax?
	
	28D.  BRIDGE  - FLIGHT DECK - AIR BOSS
	
			AIR BOSS
	Clear the flight deck.
	
	
	
	29.  FLIGHT DECK
	
	A TILLIE, a four wheel mobile crane, slams up to the plane and 
	slings its lifting harness. Goose turns to Silver Suit.
	
			GOOSE
	Well...there goes your tip.
	
	30.  INT. MAVERICK'S PLANE
	
	They have monitored the chatter. 
	
			WIZARD
	It's Goose. He's alright. Bring it 
	left...You're settling.  IS THE 
	DECK CLEAR?
	
			LSO (V.O. filtered)
	   (softly)
	ROGER, BALL, LITTLE POWER...DON'T 
	CLIMB...OKAY, HOLD WHAT YOU GOT! 
	
	Wizard does a quick sign of the cross, reaches down, grabs his 
	balls...as...
	
	
	30A.  FLIGHT DECK 
	
	The TOMCAT slams onto the deck, clearing the wreckage by inches.
	
	
	31.  INT. CARRIER HATCHWAY - FLIGHT SURGEON, OTHERS 
	
	Watch as they bring a shaken Cougar past. Goose, eyes wild, 
	waves at Maverick and Wizard, rolling up. They flame out - 
	VVOOOMMMMM! They sit there, immobile, waiting for a tow, looking 
	numb.  Goose does his "stewardess".
	
			GOOSE
	On behalf of your Captain and your 
	crew, I want to thank you for 
	flying VF101. And next time your 
	plans include the middle of the 
	goddamn ocean in the dead of 
	frigging night, I hope you'll think 
	of Naval Aviation.
	
	The surgeon looks into Goose's eyes.
	
			SURGEON
	Stress reaction...
	
			XO
	
	Check his head.
	
			GOOSE
	   (wobbling off)
	Never mind my head, check my 
	shorts!
	
	
	32.  SICK BAY - LATER
	
	Cougar lies alone in the dimness, staring at the overhead.
	
	33. 03 LEVEL - BELOW DECKS - OFFICER'S COUNTRY
	
	The usual CLANGS, WHISTLES, ENGINES of Navy life sound FORLORN 
	ECHOING through the dim, deserted passage. From the distance, a 
	single figure passes in and out of the glow of the overhead 
	lights. Cougar comes closer, hobbling unsteadily.
	
	He reaches a door, pulls himself erect and knocks on the sign:
	
	Commander Tom Otawoczek
	CO VF 101
	STINGER
	
	
	34.  STINGER'S CABIN
	
	The skipper works at his desk, responds without looking up.
	
			STINGER
	Come in.
	
	He looks up. Cougar stands in the doorway, a strange, dazed look 
	on his face.
	
			STINGER
	Cougar, what is it? You should be 
	in sick bay. What are you doing?
	
	He walks over to the skipper's desk. His eyes are glazed, but 
	his jaw is firm.
	
			COUGAR
	Thinking of my wife and kid.
	
	A determined movement. Hand to chest.
	
	
	34A. OMITTED
	
	Something metal hits it, skids across the polished surface and 
	clangs up against the coffee mug: gold wings.
	
	
	
	35.  PASSAGEWAY
	
	Cougar comes out of Stinger's room, bumps into Goose, and 
	Maverick. He turns the other way.
	
			GOOSE
	Cougar!
	
	He stops, turns to them. There is nothing to say. Goose hands 
	him his snapshot. Cougar looks at his wife and kid for a moment, 
	then looks up at them. He turns away.
	
			MAVERICK
	Cougar?		STINGER (O.S.)
	Maverick, Goose...Come in here.
	
	
	36.  STINGER'S OFFICE - DOORWAY
	
	Maverick appears, followed by Goose. They stand at 
	attention.
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir?
	
	The Skipper says nothing. Maverick sees the wings on the 
	desk. He enters, walks over, stares down at them. He picks 
	them up. 
	
			GOOSE
	Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
	
			STINGER
	Don't.
	
			MAVERICK
	He's a good pilot.
	
			STINGER
	I talked a man back once. Three 
	months later, we lost him. It's his 
	decision. Only he knows.
	
			GOOSE
	He's the best you have. He's going 
	Top Gun!
	
			STINGER
	Was.
	
			MAVERICK
	What?
	
	
			STINGER
	Was going. (Turns to Maverick.) Now 
	you are.
	
			MAVERICK
	Me?
	
	Maverick stares at the wings, lost in conflicting emotions.
	
			STINGER
	Well, he's going (indicating Goose) 
	and he needs someone to fly the 
	plane.
	
			GOOSE
	Skipper, you can't do this!
	
			STINGER
	I didn't do it, he did it himself. 
	Something about a wife and kid. The 
	fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. 
	I know it. You were up there, you 
	know it, too.
			GOOSE
	Give him a break, Skipper. It was 
	raining snakes up there. He'll be 
	alright, soon as all the gorillas go 
	home...
	
	The Skipper stares at Goose, non-plussed for a moment.
	
			STINGER
	I know some RIOS are a little 
	wiggy...but you abuse the 
	priviledge! I don't believe I'm 
	going to have to put the two of you 
	in the same cockpit...but there it 
	is! It may be good for the Navy. It 
	might be good for you, but most of 
	all, it's good for me. It'll get 
	you out of my sight.
	
	
			GOOSE
	But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked 
	for Top Gun...He's the best of the 
	best!
	
			STINGER
	Well, you'll just have to make do 
	with him (indicates Maverick).
	
	Goose and Maverick exchange looks.
	
	
			GOOSE
	Mav's a great flyer but....
	
			STINGER
	He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, 
	he's so damn good he might have 
	been picked for Top Gun himself. 
	Except for one thing. (SCREAMS) He 
	just can't seem to follow orders!
	
	
	Stinger moves slightly, to stand now, directly in front of 
	Maverick and speak eye to eye at four inches.
	
			STINGER
	You just did an incredibly brave thing! 
	What you should have done was land your 
	plane. You don't own that plane, the 
	taxpayers do. I should ream you out for 
	it. But it just doesn't work with you. 
	You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe 
	...too good. You never really stepped in 
	it yet. So this is your chance. I'm 
	gonna send you up against the best. They 
	are better than you. Maybe they'll knock 
	that shine off your eagle and you'll 
	see, finally, where discipline and 
	teamwork fit it. 
	Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out 
	of it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir?
	
			STINGER
	That is all. Tell me about the MiG 
	some other time...
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir!
	
	He snaps off a salute and does an about face.
	
			STINGER
	Maverick..
	
	He turns back.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir..
	
			STINGER
	The wings..
	
	
	He looks down at the wings in his hands, slowing walks over 
	places them gently on the Skipper's desk.
	
			STINGER
	Gentlemen!
	
			MAVERICK/GOOSE
	Sir?
	
	
	His facade cracks just slightly.
	
			STINGER
	Good luck.
	
	
	37.  INT. PASSAGEWAY
	
	Maverick and Goose push through a gauntlet of aircrews. They 
	have become notorious. Guys grab at them...questions...the 
	MiGs?..What happened up there? How close did they get? What did 
	the MiGs do? One word is heard over and over..."TopGun". Goose is 
	left behind in the crowd. Maverick pushes through. He walks 
	fast...faster. Up ladders, around turns, down ladders, through 
	passageways. Faster. He breaks into a trot, then a canter, 
	squeezing past enlisted men, parts lockers, then he breaks into a 
	run...
	
	38.  EXT - CARRIER - NIGHT AND STORM
	
	A hatch slams open on the side of the Carrier. He's out on a 
	catwalk, instantly soaked, running on rain slicked stairs 
	cantilevered high over the breaking seas. He plunges forward to 
	the bow of the ship, stands on the very peak. He is yelling 
	something. He stands there as the bow plunges terrifyingly into 
	the trough. The water rises like a green mountain, up, up to 
	break just a few feet below him, showering him with spray. The 
	noise is incredible. 
	
	Come around on his face. It is maddened. He raises his fist and 
	punches the night.
	
	
	The foaming slope of the wave rushes up, changing color as it 
	DISSOLVES TO:
	
	Desert Sand whipping by...
	
	39.  MOJAVE DESERT - 1 WEEK LATER
	
	A big bike, a real big bike, a turbo...rockets across the 
	desert. Fast. Real fast. Aviator shades low above the handlebars 
	--Maverick. Goose hangs on in back. It cranks faster, pulls 
	closer...ENGINE SCREAMING. It cranks up a notch, it's going to 
	
	explode. It can't go faster, but it does. It SCREAMS HIGHER. It 
	ROARS under, by and away, leaving dust...
	
	
	39A.  THE BIKE - STILL
	
	Silence. Just the HISS AND POP OF METAL COOLING. Maverick sits 
	on it, staring out past us. Goose looks over Maverick's shoulder.
	
	We see why. Feet come into the frame. Then the uniform: 
	California Highway Patrol.
	
	
	40.  COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR SAN DIEGO
	
	40A.  ANGLE ON MAVERICK. CHP enters the frame, the usual 
	hypercivil arrogance tinged with awed disbelief. The usual 
	questions are spaced for effect as if he might be talking to some 
	other form of life. Maverick is off the bike, standing at 
	attention. Goose follows more slowly.
	
			CHP
	Son. Do you know why
	I stopped you?
	
	Maverick has some good idea how to deal with authority.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir. I do sir
	
	The CHP adjusts his own aviator shades.
			CHP
	Well... What   is   it?
	
			MAVERICK
	   (more than sincere)
	Sir. You are going to give me a 
	warning, Sir!
	
	
	CHP - A touch of a smile, quickly surpressed.
	
			CHP
	License and registration.
	
	Maverick hands them over with his Navy ID. CHP scans them, 
	hesitates a moment over the last, looks up with a touch more 
	respect.
	
			CHP
	Lieutenant, do you know how fast  
	you were going?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir. I do, Sir.
	
			CHP
	Well? 
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir. I was going Mach point one 
	five.
	
	CHP nods sagely.
	
			CHP
	One SIXTH the speed of sound!
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir.
	
			CHP
	   (a guess)
	Lieutenant... What do you...  
	usually fly?
	
			MAVERICK
	F-14's sir.
	
			CHP
	   (new respect)
	Tomcats?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir!
	
	A long pause. Respect in the cop's eyes. He taps the Navy ID on 
	the handlebars...staring at this sincere young man.
	
			CHP
	Lieutenant... Is there...
	a Russian attack?
	
			MAVERICK
	No sir! But you have to be ready. 
	
	
	The cop nods and stares at him.
	
	
	41.  EXT. MIRAMAR NAVAL AIR STATION - LATER
	
	
	41A.  OMIT
	
	
	The bike is BLURPING... barely going fast enough to stay 
	upright. Maverick cool in shades and campaign cap dorks past the 
	hanger with the sign: FIGHTERTOWN, USA. He pulls ahead. In back 
	of him, escorting with flashers...the CHP. They pull up at the 
	gate. Maverick and Goose salute the guard, hands over their ID. 
	The CHP gets out of his car, leans against the door.
	
			CHP
	Lieutenant.
	
	Maverick turns to him.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes, Sergeant?
	
			CHP
	Remember one thing.
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir?
	
			CHP
	Outside of this gate...
	I...am Top Gun.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir!
	
	He salutes. The CHP returns a snappy one. He gets back in his 
	car and turns away. Maverick receives his ID and clearance. As he 
	passes through, a couple of pilots in flight suits (ICE AND 
	HOLLYWOOD) stare at him. The taller, dark, cool one speaks in a 
	dry voice, meant to be overheard.
	
			ICE
	Uh oh, police escort. This one must 
	be a real killer.
	
	The second pilot grins big at them. Maverick turns slightly 
	stares over his shades at them as he passes. Goose grins back the 
	challenge.
	
	42.  AERIAL COMBAT - VIETNAM ERA - F4'S, MIG 17'S - STOCK 
	
	The Doors on the soundtrack.  Jets swoop, missiles fire, a plane 
	explodes. Gun camera views of MiGs, SAMS, flak, bombing runs...
	
			VIPER (V.O.) 
	During the Korean War, the Navy kill 
	ratio was twelve-to-one. We shot down 
	twelve of their jets for every one of 
	ours. In Vietnam, this ratio fell to 
	three-to-one. Our pilots depended on 
	missles. They lost their dogfighting 
	skills.
	
	
	
	F-14's fighting with F-5's. Music becomes current. 
	
			VIPER (V.O.) 
	Top Gun was created to teach ACM. Air 
	Combat Maneuvering...Dogfighting. 
	Richthofen, Guynemer, Rickenbacker, 
	Galland, Rudel, Bong would envy us. We 
	do just what they did, but we do it 
	beyond the speed of sound. 
	
	
	43.  INT. DAY - TOP GUN ORIENTATION ROOM.
	
	
	VIPER - A tough-looking, confident leader in a blue flight suit, 
	stands before a video-tape monitor. Behind him, on the monitor, 
	the dogfighting continues.
	
			VIPER
	By the end of Vietnam we upped our 
	kill ratio to thirteen to one. 
	
	
	He turns on the lights. We see his audience in F.G.
	
			VIPER
	You're here 'cause you're the top 
	one per cent of all naval aviators.
	
	THE CLASS 
	
	Sixteen young men - eight flight crews - sit at attention. They 
	are trim, fit and confident - high school heroes, college jocks.
	
			VIPER (V.O.) 
	You're the elite, the best of the 
	best. We're gonna make you better, 
	because you're job is damned 
	important. 
	
	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE MEN 
	
	The camera moves among them. Hold on one of the men; the one who 
	greeted Maverick at the gate, Ice.
	
			VIPER (V.O.)
	With the tensions in the world today, the potential for confron- 
	tation is greater than ever, and 
	carrier pilots will be the first 
	ones there. Air combat excellence 
	is vital.
	
	
	Ice is not looking at the speaker, but, rather, in our 
	direction. HOLLYWOOD, a blond, good-looking pilot, whispers 
	something to him, and gestures. Ice is getting the lowdown on 
	someone. The camera moves and we see who that someone is, as 
	Maverick enters the frame. 
	
			VIPER
	 ...Someone once asked me if 
	training men for air combat made 
	the world less safe--flying loaded 
	guns... an accidental confrontation 
	and so forth...
	
	Maverick feels the stare of the other man and glances in his 
	direction. Their eyes meet. Ice smiles coldly.
	
	
	ANGLE - VIPER 
	 		VIPER (Con't)
	My answer is: the dangerous thing 
	is being unprepared. You want 
	trouble, that's what you get when 
	things don't work out, when you 
	can't do what you say you can. When 
	you don't know what you can do. And 
	when your opponents aren't sure 
	either. We are not policy. We don't 
	make policy. Elected officials 
	...civilians, do that. We are the 
	instrument of policy. The tip of 
	the spear. So we had best be sharp.
	
	Maverick has turned to look at Ice. Ice glances back in his 
	direction. Maverick looks at the back of the room where guys in 
	blue flight suits stand. They are the instructors. They look 
	relaxed, poised, mean.  Goose is looking up front...Where Viper 
	has stopped. Goose nudges Maverick. 
	
			GOOSE
	   (whispers)
	What are you doing?
	
			MAVERICK
	Nothing...That's McGown...that's 
	Singer, isn't it?
			GOOSE
	Turn around, pay attention. What 
	are you doing?
	
			MAVERICK
	    (musing to himself)
	...Just wondering...(turns back) 
	...who is the best.
	
	
	He's shocked to find Viper staring right at him, with a killer 
	grin on his face. He's feels caught like a naughty schoolboy.
	
			VIPER
	Really...    (smiles)
	Ya know. We'd like to know who's 
	best too. That's why we've got that 
	plaque on the wall... with the Top 
	Top Gun crew from each class. You 
	think maybe your name's gonna be on 
	it?
	
	Maverick knows he's in trouble, considers the social 
	alternatives, then tells him the truth.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir.
	
	A couple of ooo's and aahh's from the guys. The instructors 
	stare the challenge at him. He slides lower in his seat.
	
			VIPER
	Considering the company you're in, 
	that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
	
			MAVERICK
	    (somewhat chastised)
	Yes sir.
	
			VIPER
	I like that in a fighter pilot.  
	(couple of laughs from the guys) 
	It's okay to be confident. You have 
	to think you're King Kong to want 
	to try to land on carriers. Just 
	keep in mind the other component of 
	success...teamwork.
	
	Viper gathers his notes, the lecture is over.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir.
	
	Viper turns back for one more thought.
	
			VIPER
	Gentlemen, this is about combat. 
	Remember, there are no points for 
	second place. Dismissed.
	Viper walks out. Maverick finds Goose looking at him, 
	quizzically. Others mill around the plaque.  A big, friendly bear 
	of a RIO speaks.
	
	
	
			WOLFMAN
	A plaque?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	It's not the plaque. The winner can 
	get assigned here as instructor. He 
	gets to fight every day.
	
	They move closer to examine the names on the plaque.
	
	
	44.  EXT. "O" CLUB - NIGHT.
	
	Fast cars in the driveway, fast music blares into the 
	night. It's Wednesday; Animal Night. Maverick, Goose 
	Hollywood and Wolfman walk to the entrance.
	
	
	
	45.  INT. WOXOF BAR
	
	
	Loud music, low ceiling, plaques of the squadrons line the 
	walls. A dancer gyrates on stage, largely ignored by pilots 
	talking with their hands. Every pretty girl in San Diego 
	seems to be here. It's a noisy, rowdy place--a "steam 
	releaser" for people under pressure. Nevertheless, there is 
	a control to it all, there are none of the usual bar types, 
	just pilots and Naval Officers.
	
	The Ghost Riders enter. The place is on fire:  a mob of 
	dancers, flashing lights, blaring HARD ROCK MUSIC. Beer 
	flows. Pilots talk flying and hustle girls.
	
	NEARBY - AN A7 pilot stands by the bar. He knows Goose and 
	speaks loudly for his benefit.. 
	
			A7 PILOT
	You know the Fighter Pilots motto? 
	It's better to be dead than to look 
	bad.
	
	They grin broadly. Goose replies as they brush past.
	
			GOOSE
	I don't know, Frank, anybody gets 
	off on bombing the shit out of dirt 
	has got to be queer.
	
	Goose exchanges friendly punches with the attack pilots. 
	Maverick's introductions and friendly barbs are drowned by the 
	music. Maverick is a bit reserved. He doesn't move among the 
	crowd as naturally as Goose does. Hollywood and Wolfman drift 
	
	away, searching for quarry. Goose orders beer. He nods toward a 
	TALL YOUNG MAN across the room.
	
			GOOSE
	Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew 
	him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
	
			MAVERICK
	Is there anybody in the Navy you 
	don't know? 
	
			GOOSE
	Gotta keep track of the 
	competition.
	
	Goose suddenly reaches out and grabs a guy moving past.
	
			GOOSE
	Slider -- they let you into Top 
	Gun? If you're among the best in 
	the Navy, I tremble for the 
	security of this country.
	
			SLIDER
	Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss 
	to get here?
	
			GOOSE
	The list is long, but 
	distinguished.
	
			SLIDER
	So's my Johnson.
	
			GOOSE
	This is Maverick.
	
	Smiles good-naturedly, shakes hands with Mav. 
	
			SLIDER
	So I've heard.
	
			GOOSE
	Who's your pilot?
	
			SLIDER
	Tom Kazansky.
	
			GOOSE
	    (very impressed)
	No shit. The Iceman....
	
			SLIDER
	Mister to you.
	
	
			GOOSE
	You think you can stay up with us.
	
			SLIDER
	I think, yeah, we'll show you a 
	thing or two.
	
			GOOSE
	This is Evan Mitchell, he steers 
	the thing. 
	
			SLIDER
	So I heard. Steers it pretty close. 
	Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was 
	a good man.
	
			MAVERICK
	Still is..
			SLIDER
	Yeah. That's what I meant.
	
	Suddenly, behind them, a flame shoots up. Someone ducks his head 
	and swallows it. The pilot sets an empty glass on the bar.
	
			SLIDER
	What was that?
	
			GOOSE
	Flaming Hooker. Sort of an 
	institution around here. Or maybe 
	this is the institution, I forget 
	which. It's the house drink. It'll 
	warm the cockles of your heart ... 
	and other things depending on where 
	you spill it.
	
	He motions to the barmaid and she moves over, sets them up. 
	GOOSE holds a demitasse glass. The barmaid pours Drambuie. They 
	look at Goose apprehensively. Goose looks at nearby flyers in 
	Camo fatigues.
			GOOSE
	You can't show fear in front of 
	Marines...They're like Doberman's 
	they'll go for your throat, it's 
	instinctive.
	
	He takes out match and lights it. Maverick holds his arm.
	
			MAVERICK
	You ever done this before?
	
			GOOSE
	What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
	
	
	He downs it all in one gulp, slaps the glass on the bar, still 
	aflame. He stands there, blinking. 
	
			SLIDER
	How was it?
	
			GOOSE
	Could use a dash more jet fuel.
	
	The others are duly impressed. Maverick's gaze falls on Ice 
	watching from the end of the bar - Slider takes one, Maverick 
	takes one too, downs it in a gulp. Sundown, taking up the 
	challenge, motions for one. The barmaid pours it.
	
			GOOSE
	Careful, don't make an ash of 
	yourself...
	
	He tries to drink the flaming concoction. He tries to go for a 
	sip, but it's too close to his face, he tries to tilt the flame 
	away, but that doesn't work. Finally he goes for the gulp. He 
	burns his lip and misses.  He sets his hair on fire. It goes up 
	in a WHOOOSH!!
	
			SUNDOWN
	Yeow!
	
			GOOSE
	Mayday! Down in flames! 
	
	He throws a beer in Sundown's face, quenching the fire. Sundown 
	blinks through the beer.
	
			SUNDOWN
	Thanks, I needed that.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	You guys are not only crazy, you're 
	dangerous!
	
	Ice comes up from the end of the bar. He motions the Barmaid for 
	another; it comes. Goose lights it. He gulps it down, cool as 
	hell.
			ICE
	    (Disdainfully)
	Frat boys.
	
	
	He walks away. Slider goes after him.
	
			MAVERICK
	Who is that guy?
	
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	That's Kazanski.
	
			GOOSE
	No shit! That why they call him Ice?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. 
	No mistakes. Wears you down. After 
	enough time, you just get bored and 
	frustrated, you do something stupid, and 
	he's got you.
	
	Maverick moves in Ice's direction. He passes Wolfman dancing 
	with a girl with bright purple fingernails.
	
	ANGLE - DANCEFLOOR.
	
			GIRL
	Why do you all have such funny 
	names?
	
			WOLFMAN
	You gotta have a call sign that's 
	just your own...never changes...you 
	have to recognize it immediately. 
	Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, 
	break left!"..you react right away.
	
			GIRL
	Why do they call you Wolf?
	
			WOLDFMAN
	   (smiles)
	Oh, I don't know.
	
	Goose comes up with his arm around a girl.
	
			GOOSE
	Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't 
	believe a word I say. Tell her I'm 
	married, will you?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yeah, he's married--but then again, 
	he,s not dead.
	
	Sally laughs and tries to pull Goose back toward the dance 
	floor. Something in Maverick's eyes makes him hang back with his 
	partner.
	ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - DANCERS
	
			GIRL
	Could I get a call sign?
	
	
			WOLFMAN
	Well, I don't know. That depends.
	
			GIRL
	On what?
	
			WOLFMAN
	Well, it doesn't just happen, you 
	gotta do something famous.
	
			GIRL
	Like what?
	
			WOLFMAN
	Oh...I'll think of something.
	
	Maverick smiles at this, but seems on edge... He watches a few 
	pretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits, then 
	turns and walks up to Ice, who sits, drinking with Slider.
	Maverick walks over to him. Ice notices Slider's attention going 
	to Maverick. He turns and grins at him.
	
			ICEMAN
	Figured it out yet?
	
			MAVERICK
	Figured out what?
	
			ICEMAN
	Who is the best.
	
			MAVERICK
	Nope.
	
			ICEMAN
	Need a hint?
	
			MAVERICK
	I think I can work it out on my 
	own.
	
			ICEMAN
	You like to work alone. I've heard 
	that about you. 
	
			MAVERICK
	I've heard of you, too. You were in 
	124 with Bargamian.
	
			ICEMAN
	And you were with Cougar. He was my 
	roommate in flight school.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	He's a good man.
			ICEMAN
	The best.
	
			SLIDER
	You must have soloed under a lucky 
	star. First the MiG, then you slide 
	into Cougar's place.
	
			GOOSE
	It's not Cougar's place. It's ours. 
	
			ICE
	What do you think it was? Was it 
	that MiG contact that did it?
	
			GOOSE
	Did what?
	
			ICE
	Got you here.
	
			GOOSE
	We're here because we're the best 
	flyers in the wing. Not because of 
	some MiG encounter.
	
			SLIDER
	What luck! Guys fly their whole 
	career without seeing a MiG up 
	close...You're famous.
	
			ICE
	You mean notorious.
	
	Something in the way he says it. It's not quite a joke, more an 
	insult. Maverick's about to take the whole conversation too far 
	when something...someone catches his eye. She catches quite a few 
	eyes in this room. She is very pretty and she's walking in on the 
	arm of a Commander. Maverick turns back, but the moment has 
	passed. Ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile. Goose pulls 
	him away.
	
			MAVERICK
	What do these guys think, I made 
	Cougar quit?
	
			GOOSE
	Pay no attention to it. They're 
	just trying to rattle you. It's all 
	psychological. Sit down..and drink.
	
	
	He deposits Maverick at a chair by a table where other pilots 
	cluster watching and listening to Bugs shoot down his wristwatch. 
	Maverick broods...
			BUGS
	We were just really diving down and by 
	then we were right over downtown 
	Haiphong.  It was some great shit. Jack 
	says, "What are you doing?" "What, what 
	am I doing, Jack?" He says, "What are 
	you doing?" I said, "I'm rolling in, 
	Jack." "Bugs, we're at thirty-two 
	hundred feet. Oh shit, we were like 
	zooom... So we scraped down at hundred 
	feet right over--downtown Hanoi!  Oh 
	shit, goddamn it! And blowing down the 
	river. And so once we were there we let 
	down to about fifty feet just going down 
	the river and Jack says... "Bugs... 
	don't ever do that again!" "Okay, right, 
	Jack, I'll never do that again!"
	
	Maverick pays little or no attention. He broods and drinks. 
	Suddenly, Hollywood nudges him, he turns.
	
			MAVERICK
	What, what is it?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Target passing. Check your six.
	
			MAVERICK
	Never mind mine. Check hers.
	
	They turn. Long legs, great ass, beautiful.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Her six is a ten! Uh oh, a turn to 
	engage.
	
	
	
	HIS POV - ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM
	
	Maverick sees a stranger, and somehow he knows, he knows even 
	then.  Wolfman turns, sees her walking too.
	
			WOLFMAN
	Bogey...9 o'clock level.
	
			SUNDOWN
	Nine thirty. Bogey?  You presume 
	that hostile?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	
	Well, we should contact and check 
	it out.
	
	
	She has turned toward them. She passes by. They start to make a 
	move for her. But just then she finds her date at the bar; a 
	distinguished man with Captain's stripes. Their smiles freeze and 
	they slide back in their chairs. Maverick can't stop looking at 
	her...After a while, the intensity of his gaze draws her 
	attention. She feels him. She is nodding and smiling to her date, 
	but her eyes scan the room like radar. A warning tone goes off in 
	his brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him. He feels that 
	thrill of excitement and fear you get when you know you're 
	targeted in someone's scope. Her eyes hold on him for a long 
	moment...long enough, and then sweep by the rest of the room. She 
	turns her attention back to the Captain and laughs at something 
	he says.
	
	
	Over in a corner, Goose chats up a couple of San Diego girls.
	
			GOOSE
	The family unit -- that's the most 
	important thing. It's the only 
	thing you can count on. I'm married 
	--did I tell you that?
	
			FIRST GIRL
	Four times. We don't believe you.
	
			GOOSE
	I've been married since I was 
	eighteen. Why don't you believe me?
	
			SECOND GIRL
	Because you don't look married. 
	
			FIRST GIRL
	You're not even wearing a ring.
	
			GOOSE
	    (big smile)
	I take it off when I'm chasing 
	women. It's the only honorable 
	thing to do.
	
	
	ANGLE - MAVERICK
	
	He's half listening to Bugs rattle on.  His eyes are drawn back 
	to the woman. He tries not to stare. She seems to know a lot of 
	people in the club. He looks away. Hollywood is chatting up a 
	girl with a sincerity that cannot be taught. His line is just as 
	polished as his appearance.
	
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	You don't think about death up 
	there, but you think a lot about 
	the danger. One mistake and you're 
	a smoking hole in the ground.
	
			GIRL
	I never knew it was so dangerous.
			HOLLYWOOD
	Oh yeah, it makes everything down 
	here more meaningful. You feel a 
	certain intensity of life, and you 
	want to grab onto every moment.
	
	Maverick looks up at the bar again. A shock. She (Charlie) is 
	staring right at him, intensely, as her date whispers something 
	in her ear. She notices him, staring back, quickly looks away, 
	embarrassed. She says something to the man. He nods and turns 
	away as someone else grabs his attention. The woman, now wouldn't 
	look this way for anything. She picks up her purse from the bar 
	and walks through the crowd and out of the room. Impulsively, 
	Maverick's up, he follows. 
	
	
	46.  INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE BAR
	
	He breaks out, looks around, doesn't see her. Someone disappears 
	around a corner. He moves after.
	
	CORNER - A door slams shut. Impulsively, before he realizes what 
	he is doing, he's through it. 
	
	
	47.  WOMEN'S ROOM. 
	
	A feminine GASP!  He should have looked at the sign on the door. 
	The realization of where he is hits him too late. She is standing 
	by the mirror, with her make-up out, looking back at him. He's 
	not quite sure what to do. A hasty retreat would be appropriate, 
	if embarrassing. Ah, what the hell, he is a fighter pilot!  He 
	just walks right over to her...no idea what he will say. She's 
	got her lipstick out, twisting it. She looks over at him with an 
	amused smile.
	
			CHARLIE
	Long cruise, was it?
	
	She leans over the sink, puts on lipstick, sees his eyes cover 
	her.
	
			CHARLIE
	Anything I can do to help, Lieutenant?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Lots of things. 
	
	She laughs. He is sort of attractive, but there are other girls 
	in the room, she doesn't want to be too encouraging...She tries 
	not to grin at his embarrassment.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'll bet!
	
			MAVERICK
	Uhhh...Anything I can do for you?
	She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, 
	but she's instinctively attracted.
	
			CHARLIE
	Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
	
	She hands him a makeup mirror. Starts redoing her lipstick. He 
	just stares at her...She looks up at him, than back to her 
	warpaint. Finally, when it comes, it is cool and amused.
	
			CHARLIE
	Now I know why all the girls come 
	here. They know how horny you guys 
	get. But this...is ridiculous.
	
			MAVERICK
	It's not that.
	
	Mock anger. She's toying with him.
	
			CHARLIE
	It isn't?
	
			MAVERICK
	Well, it is. It is that, too.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's a big comfort to me.
	
			MAVERICK
	I could be, too.
	
	 		CHARLIE
	How so?
	
			MAVERICK
	Save you from a big mistake with 
	that other guy.
	
			CHARLIE
	And on to a bigger one with you?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Yeah, most likely.
	
			CHARLIE
	Was there ever a girl who didn't 
	like fighter pilots?
	
			MAVERICK
	I heard of one once.
	
	She laughs again, shakes her head...another cowboy! She gently 
	takes the compact out of his hands, snaps it closed.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'm really flattered, Lieutenant, 
	but I don't go out with pilots.
			MAVERICK
	Then what are you doing here?
	
	Three pretty blondes enter and look at Maverick quizzically but 
	not without interest.
	
			CHARLIE
	I think the question is...what are 
	you?
	
	She tries to keep a straight face as she walks out of the room. 
	
	The other girls look at him expectantly.  A beat.  He just 
	stands there, then realizes he's holding her lipstick. 
	
			MAVERICK
	Hi. I'm here to talk about a new 
	concept in cosmetics...
	
	47A.  WOXOF BAR. She returns, spots the Captain, motioning to 
	her.  Maverick enters, goes to the other end of the bar. He 
	orders a drink. It comes. He drinks it, pays for it, moves off 
	toward the door. Someone backs into his path, he moves quickly 
	and bumps into someone else; her. 
	
			CHARLIE
	Sorry.
	
	She sees it's him.
	
			MAVERICK
	My fault. Should have watched
	where I was going.
	
	Her hand goes to his collar. She adjusts his insignia. She 
	smiles.
	
			CHARLIE
	
	Where's your wing man? Who's 
	watching your six?
	
			MAVERICK
	Uh, nobody, I guess.
	
	One final adjustment.
	
			CHARLIE
	Too bad.
	
	She breaks the spell abruptly, turns away.
	
			CHARLIE
	See you around.
	
	Maverick finds his voice.
	
			MAVERICK
	Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'm with someone. 
	
	
	48.  EXT. "O" CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT
	
	P.O.V. - 
	
	From a car in the parking lot, we see Charlie and the Captain 
	leave the club. They walk directly toward us and stop. She turns, 
	says something polite...a peck on the cheek. He turns away. A 
	dome light briefly illuminates the interior of the car as a door 
	opens. It rocks slightly as someone gets in. Charlie turns back 
	and walks over, taking her keys out. She opens the door to the 
	car and gets in. 
	
	
	48A.  EXT. CAR - NIGHT
	
	She starts the car and pulls away. Suddenly, a figure sits up in 
	the back.
	
			MAVERICK
	I thought he'd never leave.
	
			CHARLIE
	Yeow!
	
	Startled, she nearly drives off the road. She turns to him, 
	startled.
	
			CHARLIE
	You! What are you doing here?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Everybody's got to be somewhere.
	
			CHARLIE
	What if Captain Dawson had come 
	with me?
	
			MAVERICK
	It would have been really 
	embarrassing!
	
			CHARLIE
	How did you know this was my car?
	
			MAVERICK
	Simple deduction. It's fast. It's 
	pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's 
	your color...matches your lipstick.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's all!
	
			MAVERICK
	And I asked someone.
			CHARLIE
	You think you're pretty smart.
	
			MAVERICK
	I think I'm in love.
	
	
	49.  EXT. GUARD GATE
	
	She pulls up at the guard gate, a MARINE CORPORAL is on duty. He 
	sees the pretty girl pull up and stop, leans over helpfully.
	
			MARINE
	Can I help you, Ma'am?
	
	She smiles even more sweetly.
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't know, Corporal. Can you do 
	anything about this lunatic?
	
	The car door swings open. Maverick gets out. The car roars away. 
	He stands in the glare of the spotlight...rocking on his heels, 
	looking across at the guard, who snaps to attention and stares 
	holes in his chest.
	
	
	50.  INT. TOP GUN - NEXT MORNING. 
	
	
	Two guys in flight suits run down stairs past stencils of MiG 
	kills on walls, then down corridor.
	
			FLEX
	Not so fast...my head.
	
	They skid to stop outside a door.
	
	
	51.  INT. HANGAR
	
	Ground crews work on planes in B.G. Jester in middle of lecture.
	Door bursts open. Sundown and Flex skid to a halt when they see 
	whole class looking at them.
	
			JESTER
	Who are you?
	
			SUNDOWN
	I'm Sundown.
	
			JESTER
	Yeah, right. You're late.
	
	
	Viper breaks in, indicating Flex.
	
			VIPER
	And who are you?
	
			FLEX
	Flex 
	
			VIPER
	Flex...? You don't look like Flex  
	to me. You call that muscle? 
	Doesn't look like muscle. Looks 
	like...Pork.
	
	They laugh. Even Sundown has to laugh, scratching his chest.
	
			VIPER
	What're you laughing at? You're 
	Fungus.
	
	Stops scratching.
			SUNDOWN/FUNGUS
	Fungus!
	
			PORK
	Don't make an issue of it, it'll 
	stick.
	
			FUNGUS (Unhappily)
	
	It'll stick anyway. 
	
	Viper turns away...
	
			VIPER
	Now to continue. In this class we 
	will be dealing with F-5's and 
	A4's, as our MiG simulators. 
	Technically the F-5 does not have 
	the thrust to weight ratio of the 
	MiG-21--it also does not bleed 
	energy below 300 knots like the 
	MiG-21 does. The A4 does not turn 
	as well as the MiG-17 but has 
	significantly better visibility.
	
	Maverick looks back to his notes. SFX footsteps...door 
	opening. Viper looks up to back of room door.
	
			VIPER
	Hi, Charlie. Good, our TAGREF's 
	here. Charlie's the most qualified 
	to get into P subs and curves, and 
	VN diagrams.
	
	Maverick turns to see the TAGREF walk forward.  Maverick 
	stares at her as she passes without acknowledging him. He is 
	surprised, embarrassed.
	
			VIPER
	Charlotte Blackwood--code name Charlie-- 
	not your ordinary TAGREF. Charlie has 
	her Ph.D. in astrophysics--she's a 
	civilian contractor so you don't salute 
	her...or anything else. Is that clear?
	
	She walks to the front and starts her presentation. She 
	talks about something very technical, arcane. MiG tactics, 
	technology. As the briefing rattles on, Maverick reacts to 
	her. Goose glances over at him. He, too, recognizes the girl. 
	He looks at his partner. Maverick feels his stare.
	
			CHARLIE
	Hello, I think I have some new data for 
	you...Now a MiG 21 has a problem with 
	the inverted flight tanks. It won't do a 
	Negative G push over. Even below one G, 
	they risk a flame out. Operationally, 
	they will do a zero to one G only.
	
	A snicker from the audience. She hesitates momentarily, goes 
	on.
			CHARLIE
	
	The latest intelligence shows that 
	the most they will do in operation 
	is one....is there something wrong, 
	Lieutenant.
	
			MAVERICK
	I don't think you're altogether 
	right...about the MiG, that is.
	
	She stops--some of the pilots look at him. Viper glares.
	
			CHARLIE
	I beg your pardon.
	
			MAVERICK
	No, I beg yours. But I don't think 
	you're right on that.
	
			CHARLIE
	Why not?
	
			MAVERICK
	I saw one.
	
			CHARLIE
	You saw a MiG 21?
	
			MAVERICK
	I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
	
			CHARLIE
	    (She doesn't believe him)
	Where did you see that?
	
			MAVERICK
	It's classified.
	
	Nervous buzz in the room. Viper goes rigid. Charlie can't 
	believe it.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's what?
	
			MAVERICK
	It's classified. Like Hollywood 
	says, I could tell you, but then 
	I'd have to kill you.
	
	Pork stifles a laugh, the others chuckle. Viper is 
	embarrassed.
	
			VIPER
	Maverick!!!
	
	
	She stops Viper with a glance.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's all right.
	
	She can handle it. She is very cool, not overbearing. She 
	says it calmly. She doesn't want to embarrass him any more 
	than he is, but she has to get the facts straight.
	
			CHARLIE
	 Lieutenant, I have a top secret 
	clearance. The Pentagon sees to it 
	that I know more than you.
	
			MAVERICK
	Not in this case.
			CHARLIE
	    (Flatly.)
	You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes, ma'am.
	
			CHARLIE
	Where were you?
	
			MAVERICK
	On his six.
	
	Little stifled laughs.
	
			CHARLIE
	He was in a 4G Negative dive and 
	you were on his six?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was 
	directly above him.
	
	She stares at him for a moment, then she has him. She goes 
	for the kill.
	
			CHARLIE
	If you were directly above him, how 
	did you see him?
	
			MAVERICK
	I was inverted.
	
	A real buzz in the room.  Ice laughs audibly.
	
			CHARLIE
	You were in a 4G inverted dive with 
	a MiG 21?   (She can't believe it.)
	
	At what range ?
	
			MAVERICK
	Two.
	
			CHARLIE
	Two miles.
	
			MAVERICK
	Two meters.
	
	
	Chuckles, barely suppressed. Goose pipes up to deflect 
	attention.
	
			GOOSE
	One and a half, actually. I got a 
	polaroid.
	
			CHARLIE
	    (Flatly.)
	Lieutenant...
			MAVERICK
	Ma'am?
	
			CHARLIE
	What were you doing there?
	
			MAVERICK
	Giving him the bird.
	
	Open laughter. She thinks it's at her. She grows red.
	
			CHARLIE
	The what?
	
			MAVERICK
	You know. The finger.
	
	He shows her, but she can handle this. 
	
			CHARLIE
	So you're the reason those
	SALT talks failed.
	
	The room breaks into laughter. At him. Now he grows red. 
	Goose puts his hand on Maverick's arm, shakes his head as if 
	to say: "Let it go, pal, she got you". 
	
	She looks at Viper. He doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. 
	He knows there's something here he doesn't control.
	
			VIPER
	Lieutenant!
	
	
			GOOSE
	It's just like he says, sir.
	
			VIPER
	    (He snaps)
	I don't care!
	
	
	51A. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE LECTURE HALL
	
	She walks away. He runs up and stops her.
	
			MAVERICK
	Why didn't you tell me you were a 
	TAGREF?
	
	She studies him coolly for a moment, like a specimen.
	
			CHARLIE
	It never came up.
	
			MAVERICK
	You let me make a fool of myself.
	
			CHARLIE
	You seemed determined to do that 
	anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you 
	were a famous MiG insulter?
			MAVERICK
	Would it have made a difference? 
	
			CHARLIE
	No.
	
			MAVERICK
	What would?
	
			CHARLIE
	You know, I'm assigned to this 
	school. I see sixteen new hotshots 
	every eight weeks. Your attention 
	is flattering, but not really 
	productive. Why don't you keep your 
	mind on flying.
	
	She reaches over and aligns his collar insignia.
	
			CHARLIE
	Why can't you keep this straight?
	
	She smiles at him and walks away. Maverick turns, sees the 
	others sizing him up. Most of them grin. Maverick moves down 
	the corridor past the CO's Office. Viper leans against the 
	
	doorsill. He lights a pipe, laconically eyes Maverick. His 
	tone gives away nothing, like an ELINT probe eliciting a 
	response.
	
			VIPER
	Maverick... Where'd you get that 
	call sign?
	
			MAVERICK
	Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
	
			VIPER
	You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir.
	
			VIPER
	A good man. Good flyer.
	
	Viper turns away. 
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir. Thank you sir.
	
	Maverick watches him for a beat, he's been tested, but he's 
	not sure how or why. He turns to catch up with Goose and the 
	others.
	
	EXT. SKY - LATER
	
	At twenty-eight thousand feet, the two planes circle each 
	other, going in opposite directions. As they jockey for 
	position, they snap past each other like ends of bullwhips.
	
	The earth spins, the horizon appears and disappears. With 
	each hard turn, Maverick and Goose can be heard "grunting" to 
	keep blood in their brains, to keep from passing out.
	
	The fight is hard, physical, and exhausting. The extreme G 
	forces--6.5--flatten them against their seats, causing their 
	heads to weigh over one hundred pounds. Maverick strains to 
	turn his head and track the other jet as it streaks past at 
	Mach One. 
			MAVERICK
	I've lost him -- where is he?
	
			GOOSE
	On your six -- coming hard. Four 
	hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on 
	your six and closing fast!
	Hard left! HARD LEFT!
	
	
	Maverick jerks the stick left, and the F-14 takes an 
	astonishing turn. Jester ROARS past into a wide arc.
	
			GOOSE
	Great move. Great
	
			MAVERICK
	He should've had me.
			GOOSE
	Take it down. Let's bug out of 
	here. Call for a draw.
	
			MAVERICK
	No way. I'll nail him this time. 
	Going vertical.
	
	
	THE PLANE EXPLODES INTO AFTERBURNER - rocketing toward 
	space. Jester is left in direct line with the sun, and his 
	canopy is sprayed with a blinding glare. Going ballistic is 
	dangerous. The plane flys like a bullet, obeying the laws of 
	physics, not the pilot's touch on control surfaces. The 
	ballistic call warns other aircraft that he is, for the 
	moment, out of control.
	
			GOOSE
	He's blind -- you got him!
	
			JESTER
	NO JOY! NO JOY! WHERE ARE YOU?
	I'VE LOST SIGHT.
	
			GOOSE
	He's out of energy! You got 
	control? Unload!
	
	The F-14 peels over the egg, in a backward dive. It rockets 
	down the outside, gaining energy. Over the ROAR of jets, the 
	SCREAM of the wind, Goose shouts data, but it is muffled, a 
	distant voice in a typhoon. Through the canopy, we see 
	Jester, and he hangs in the air like a sparrow in the path of 
	a falcon.
	
	PILOT'S POV - HUD in windscreen - a diamond in a box. 
	Maverick lines up the diamond with Jester, and we hear the 
	high pitched tone BEEPING.
	
			JESTER
	WE'RE BELOW THE HARD DECK. FIGHT'S 
	OFF.
	
			GOOSE
	He's right. We're at ten thousand.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	No way. I got you, sucker. You're 
	going down.
	
	Jester maneuvers, but Maverick keeps him in the gunsight. 
	The BEEPING is louder, faster.
	
			MAVERICK
	In the envelope. FOX TWO MISSILE 
	SHOT. YOU'RE GONE, JESTER, DEAD! 
			GOOSE
	    (stunned)
	Goddamn! We beat him!
	
	There is an edge of anger in Jester's voice.
	
			JESTER
	ROGER FOX TWO. GET YOUR BUTTS ABOVE 
	THE HARD DECK. RETURN TO BASE 
	IMMEDIATELY.
	              
	They are brought up short for a moment, then the thrill of 
	victory gets the best of them. Goose lets out a war whoop. 
	The F-14 sweeps up, rolls into an Immelman..
	
			MAVERICK
	We did it!
	
			GOOSE
	Look, Ma, top of the world!
	
	
	52A.  EXT. MIRAMAR - LANDING PATTERN.
	
	Maverick's Tomcat breaks hard and high, rolls over on its 
	side, wings perpendicular to the ground. Goose sees the world 
	go sideways.
	
			GOOSE
	Ahhh...A little high on the left, 
	don't you think?
	
			MAVERICK
	Right.
	
	He aileron rolls another quarter turn. Inverted, they pass 
	right down the runway.  Goose looks out and insouciantly 
	watches the world go by at 300 knots, upside down.
	
			GOOSE
	Right. Much better. ...Ahhh...what 
	do you call this?
	
	
	
			MAVERICK
	It's a victory roll.
	
			GOOSE
	I wouldn't call it victory.  It's 
	more like...self immolation.
	
	
	52B.  INT. CONTROL TOWER 
	
	Controllers work. Officers watch the landing activity. One 
	old salt, turns from the coffee machine, a cup of steaming 
	Java microns from his lips. A ROAR. VABOOM! The Tomcat roars 
	over. He yelps as hot coffee flys all over his shirt.         
	                                                    52C.

	They complete the roll, bank left, zoom right by the tower, 
	level with the observation window. 
	
	                                                             
	52D.  F-14'S POV. Controllers look out at the F-14, mouths 
	drop open. 
	
	
	52E.  ANGLE GOOSE
	
	He waves jauntily.
	
			GOOSE
	Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in 
	there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at 
	one point I did want a Navy career.
	
			MAVERICK
	Come on, relax...
	
			GOOSE
	You see all those guys with gold on 
	their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I 
	think that was Johnson, Air Boss of 
	the Kitty Hawk! 
	
			MAVERICK
	Come on, we beat an instructor. How 
	many times in your life do you get 
	to do a victory roll? 
	
			GOOSE
	Just once, if they take your plane 
	away.
	
	They roll out, break over the runway.

	52F.  EXT. FLIGHTLINE. 
	
	Maverick and Goose walk by parking Tomcats...Ice is 
	unstrapping, Slider is climbing down. Ice looks at Maverick, 
	says one word.
	
			ICEMAN
	Cowboys!
	
	Maverick keeps walking...Goose hangs back.
	
			SLIDER
	Nice. Always a good idea to show up 
	your instructors.
	He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose 
	indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
	
			GOOSE
	Hey, see any controls back there? 
	   (thinks about team loyalty, 
	   reacts to Jester's glare...)
	And anyway...we beat the Son of a 
	Bitch!
	
	He turns and runs to catch up with Maverick.
	
	
	53.  INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
	
	Pilots half undressed. Maverick and Goose enter the room, 
	carrying their helmets. The students look up at them, and 
	Goose suddenly flashes a thumb's up sign with a grin. The 
	students react with clenched fists, ad libs, high fives, 
	victory punches.
	
			WOLFMAN
	You won?!!!
	
			MAVERICK
	Didn't everybody?
	
	"Oooo" -- they all go "ooo" and laugh.
	                                                 
			WOLFMAN
	No, we...got our butts kicked.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Thirty seconds. That's all it took 
	to blow us out of the sky.

	We went like this, he went like 
	that. I say to Hollywood: Where'd 
	he go? Hollywood says: where'd who 
	go?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	And he's laughing. Right over the 
	radio, He's laughing at us.
	
	Attention turns to the doorway as Ice and Slider enter. Ice 
	gives a brief dramatic pause, then flashes thumbs up and 
	smiles. The students celebrate Ice's win.  Ice handles the 
	attention with the easy composure of one who is used to it. 
	Maverick ignores him and begins to peel out of his G-suit. 
	Ice moves toward his locker.
	                                                      ***
			GOOSE
	You won. 
	Congratulations.		HOLLYWOOD
	Maverick and Goose won too.
	
	Ice talks into his locker.
	
			ICE
	That's not what I heard.
	
			GOOSE
	We won! 
	Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his 
	locker, dismissing them.
	
			ICE
	Below the hard deck doesn't count. 
	You guys are the second team, 
	aren't you?
	
	Maverick gets up, moves to him, starts to say something, 
	when Jester, breaks into the room.
	
			JESTER
	Maverick, Goose. Viper's office. Now!
	
	
	53A. INT. TOPGUN CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CO'S OFFICE.
	
	
	SCREAMING AND YELLING.  A lot of screaming and yelling, 
	muffled by the door.
	
	                                                             
	53B. INT. ANTEROOM. 
	
	Enlisted Yeomen and Chiefs go about their clerical duties in 
	acute embarrassment mixed with curiousity. Behind the CO'S door, 
	someone is screaming his head off.
	
	
	BOOM! The door bursts open. A big, brawling Officer - Johnson, 
	the Air Boss - blasts out, nearly smashing into a female petty 
	officer. She almost spills her coffee. Johnson looks right and 
	left in fury too strong for words. He looks like he wants to 
	smash something. They move out of his way, but he justs blasts 
	through the door and disappears down the hall.
	The enlisted men turn to Viper's office.
	
	
	53D  THEIR POV
	
	Jester stands inside stonefaced. Maverick and Goose are 
	rigid. Viper...with excess calm deliberation, softly walks 
	over, grasps the doornob. He glances in this direction. The 
	glance is totally without expression, and even scarier for 
	that.

	53D. ANGLE ENLISTED (MEN)
	
	In a flash, each man finds something totally engrossing in 
	his work, or something terribly important to do elsewhere. 
	Slowly, steadily, Viper swings his door closed.54.  INT. 
	VIPER'S OFFICE 
	
	He moves over to face Maverick. There is a SILENCE like 
	after a train wreck; nothing but the POPPING of sprung metal 
	and the low GASP of escaping steam. Viper speaks quietly, 
	like a funeral director consoling the living. Makes you want 
	to scream.
	
			VIPER
	Well....That about covers the 
	flyby. 
	
	Jester almost breaks into a grin.
	
			VIPER
	Now...in addition...you broke two 
	major rules of engagement. And... 
	That's ...not good.
	
	
	Maverick gives no response. Viper continues.
	
			VIPER
	Lieutenant Candela lost sight of 
	you, and called "no joy". You 
	failed to respond. 
	
	He stops and looks at Maverick... A beat. Maverick finally 
	nods 
			VIPER
	Why?
	
	
	Maverick is exhausted. It's been a long, rough day. His 
	voice is a horse whisper.
	
			MAVERICK
	I had him in view. I was peeling 
	over the egg, into a dive. He saw 
	me when I moved in for the kill. 
	There wasn't any danger...
	
			VIPER
	    (to Goose)
	Is that how you remember it?
	
			GOOSE
	Yes, sir. By the time we could 
	respond, we were diving right into 
	his view.
	
	Viper is not satisfied with the answer, but he moves on.
	
			VIPER
	The hard deck for this hop was ten 
	thousand feet. Jester, at what 
	point did you call off the fight?
	
			JESTER
	Just below ten thousand.
	
			VIPER
	But you continued to fight.
	
	Another pause, another grudging nod.
	
			VIPER
	Why?
	
			MAVERICK
	We weren't below for more than ten 
	seconds. There was no danger. I had 
	the shot. I took it.
	
			VIPER
	The rules of engagement are not 
	flexible. They exist for your  
	safety. You will obey them.
	Is that clear?
	
	Maverick thinks about continuing the discussion, but the 
	thought is momentary. He quickly cuts his losses, gives Viper 
	what he thinks he wants...He is just on the cusp of too 
	sincere.
	
			MAVERICK
	
	Yes sir, perfectly clear. I guess 
	we were ...I was... just a little 
	over enthusiastic.
	
	Viper measures him for a moment, then lets it go.
	
			VIPER
	I guess you were. Dismissed.
	
	Maverick and Goose leave the room. Viper looks at Jester, 
	picks up Maverick's fitness report. Doesn't read it, looks 
	back at Jester.
	
			JESTER
	I don't know what to tell you, 
	Skip.
	
			VIPER
	Tell me one thing.
	
	Jester waits.
	
	
			VIPER
	...If you had to go into combat, 
	would you want him with you?
	
	Jester turns, walks slowly around the room. The walls are 
	lined with pictures; planes and pilots...history. There are 
	MiG killers, attack squadrons, ground personnel...There's one 
	picture of a Phantom in flight with the backseater mooning 
	the camera. Other pictures show carriers, famous flyers, 
	previous CO's. Finally Jester replys.   
	
			JESTER
	Yep.
	
	Viper slaps shut the fitness report. 
	
			JESTER
	He's seat of the pants... 
	Completely unpredictable -- nothing 
	by the book. All over the sky. But 
	I don't know, Skip, he's really got 
	something.
	
			VIPER
	Yeah, we get one of these guys 
	every damn class.  (laughs) 
	"Maverick!" 
	
	He throws the report on the desk.

	Yup, a wild pony.

	A face appears at 12,000 feet, right in front of their

	They climb out of the simulator - A cockpit sprung on 
	moveable rams, surrounded by a dome on which video images are 
	projected.
	
	As they climb down, Maverick and Goose climb up into the 
	cockpit to take their place.

	Maverick flys the heck out of it. It's real. It lurches and 
	bumps, the NOISES and sights look real. He gets on the tail 
	of a MiG. It breaks, he breaks, then what he does is just too 
	fast to follow. It screams around in a turn. Suddenly, there 
	is a WHUMMP...ALARMS...the lights come on.

	He just shrugs at her and smiles.

	For what?
	
			MAVERICK
	That stuff about the MiG. I was out 
	of line.
	
			CHARLIE
	Apology acknowledged.
	
			MAVERICK
	Is that all?
			CHARLIE
	What else do you want?
	
			MAVERICK
	Um. You.
	
			CHARLIE
	There you go with those moves 
	again.
	
			MAVERICK
	Too aggressive?
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't mix with the boys. I work 
	here. Let's keep it professional.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm special.
	
			CHARLIE
	   (laughs)
	Yes. I'll give you that!
	
			MAVERICK
	Give me a break, I'm asking you 
	out.
	
	
			CHARLIE
	I can't.
	
			MAVERICK
	I thought there was something... 
	That night in the club...
	
			CHARLIE
	Lieutenant...
	
			MAVERICK
	Evan... or Maverick.
	
			CHARLIE
	Maverick...you know the rules of 
	engagement.
	
			MAVERICK
	    (can't believe it.)
		The what?
	
			CHARLIE
	Some one comes up hot on your six, 
	what do you do?
	
			MAVERICK
	What are you talking about?
	
			CHARLIE
	You turn into him, check him out, 
	identify friend or foe.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm not your foe.
			CHARLIE
	And if he's harmless, you 
	disengage.
	
			MAVERICK
	Harmless!
	
			CHARLIE
	Uh hum.
	
			MAVERICK
	What if he's not?
	
			CHARLIE
	You have to shoot him down....If 
	he's smart, he'll turn away before 
	that happens.
	
			MAVERICK
	
	Harmless. Nobody ever called me 
	harmless before...
	
			CHARLIE
	And probably never again. It's 
	nothing personal. It's just...I 
	know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm 
	immune...
	
			MAVERICK
	Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And 
	I don't give up. Everything I've 
	ever wanted I've had to work like 
	hell for. Well, how about it?
	
			CHARLIE
	How about what?
	
			MAVERICK
	How about anything, anything you 
	want to do.
	
			CHARLIE
	Hard to argue with that, isn't 
	it...
	
			MAVERICK
	A date... Coffee... A drink...A 
	walk in the park.
	
			CHARLIE
	What about the plane?
	
			MAVERICK
	What plane.
	
			CHARLIE
	Most of them invite me to sit in 
	the cockpit...play with the levers 
	and things. 
			MAVERICK
	Well, get used to it.
	
			CHARLIE
	Used to what?
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm different. 
	
			CHARLIE
	I'm starting to sense that now.
	
			MAVERICK
	
	You're slow to engage. But you'll 
	come around.
	
	She pushes him out the door
	
			MAVERICK
	Let's make it at eight.
	
			CHARLIE
	Make what?
	
			MAVERICK
	Anything.
	
			CHARLIE
	Okay, anything. Just...go. I've 
	gotta work.
	
	She closes the door, turns back to her screen.

	***
	59A.  BEACH LA JOLLA - DAY
	
	A day off. Pilots, other personnel are enjoying a day at the 
	beach. There are bikinis, and beer, sunfishes and water 
	skiing. The annual Over-the-Line (a variation of softball) 
	tournament is in progress. The team from the Teddy Kennedy 
	Driving School is whipping another known as Scum de Terre. 
	The pilots are doing pretty well at blowing off steam.
	
	59B.  UNDERSEA
	
	Undulating sea grass. Muffled HISS of the surf. A pretty 
	fish comes into view. A spear shoots through it, and nails it 
	to the ocean floor.
	
	59C.  SHORELINE
	
	Two figures pop to the surface and wade in to the beach. 
	Maverick holds the wriggling fish. Charlie is repulsed. She 
	pulls off her mask and snorkle, follows him in to shore..
	59D. THE BEACH
	
	They flop down. He drops the fish in front of her, sees her 
	reaction at watching its death throes.
	
			CHARLIE
	Why'd you do that?
	
			MAVERICK
	   (surprised)
	
	I had the shot.
	
	She looks at him for a moment, then turns away, fiddles with 
	her mask.
	
			MAVERICK
	It dies. We live.
	
			CHARLIE
	You're an animal.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's true. What are you?
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't enjoy watching things 
	suffer.
	
	He smashes the fish on a rock. It is still.
	
			CHARLIE
	No!
	
			MAVERICK
	It's not suffering anymore.
	
			CHARLIE
	   (she looks at him strangely,  
	   half jokes)
	You're horrible
	
			MAVERICK
	You're not, cause you eat frozen 
	meatballs?   (he puts it down)
	Things die. Every time you breathe, 
	you kill millions of tiny 
	organisms. Every time you eat, 
	something had to die. 
	
			CHARLIE
	You don't have to kill it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Somebody does. It's more honest 
	this way. You do your own dirty 
	work.
	
			CHARLIE
	You ever think about killing 
	another human being?
	
			MAVERICK
	About as much as they think about 
	killing me.
	
	
			CHARLIE
	Does it bother you?
	
			MAVERICK
	They know the rules...(this is too 
	strong for her, she turns away, he 
	comes around to her.) That's the 
	deal. That's why you're up there. 
	It's him or me. That's the price of 
	admission. (she draws away) It 
	bothers you, why? You're part of 
	it. (She stiffens, he's losing her. 
	He softens)  Everybody dies. Most 
	people don't get to die for 
	something.
	
	You don't want to confront it, do 
	you. You want to keep it all clean, 
	cerebral... velocity vectors, 
	wing-load diagrams...You ever been 
	up?
	
			CHARLIE
	Flying?
			MAVERICK
	You use your mind to keep things at 
	a distance. You ever just let go?
	
	She doesn't answer.
	
			MAVERICK
	You know what really scares me? 
	Living too long. Losing my hair and 
	my teeth...and my guts and my wind. 
	And my brains...Sitting in a room 
	with my hands in my lap, watching 
	daytime TV. 
	
			CHARLIE
	You don't believe any of this. You 
	don't think you'll ever die.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's it, of course. When I'm up 
	there and doing it, I'm cheating it 
	every second. I'm subverting all 
	laws...gravity...whatever. I'm 
	skating the edge of it.
	
			CHARLIE
	Winston Churchill.
	
			MAVERICK
	
	What?
	
			CHARLIE
	What he said..."There's nothing so 
	exhilarating as being shot at 
	without result."
	
			MAVERICK
	All you've got is one life. I guess 
	it's worth about the same to every 
	body. You ever see an old woman 
	after her husband has died? And the 
	meaningless years of decline 
	stretch ahead...  When you're in 
	the air and doing something really 
	dangerous, you can look ahead... 
	maybe ten seconds. That's your 
	whole future. That's as far as it 
	goes. But imagine what those 
	seconds are worth.
	
			CHARLIE
	What if you kill yourself? Think of 
	everything you'll miss.
			MAVERICK
	There is lots of stuff I don't know 
	about...  Fine wine... great art... 
	the opera. I guess if I live long 
	enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, 
	I'll never miss it.
	
			CHARLIE
	Are you really that brave?
	
			MAVERICK
	    (shakes his head no.)
	I watched my mother die. Cancer. 
	She had a long time to think about 
	it. They say you reach an agreement 
	with death. Come to accept the fact 
	that pretty soon you won't be here. 
	I didn't see that. She... was very 
	brave...braver than I am. You go up 
	there, there isn't time to think. 
	If you make a mistake, you're just 
	a smudge on the ground. Simplifies 
	funeral arrangements.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's just as I thought.
	
			MAVERICK
	What?
	
	
			CHARLIE
	You're totally insane.
	
			MAVERICK
	   (he smiles)
	Thanks very much.
	   (he lifts the fish)
	Care for some suchi?.
	
	
	59E.  THE OTHER END OF THE BEACH - LATER
	
	A killer volleyball game in progress. Maverick and Charlie 
	wander toward it, talking softly to themselves. Goose runs up 
	and grabs him away. 
	
			GOOSE
	Come on, we're next.
	
			MAVERICK
	What?
	
			GOOSE
	Come on, I got over six bucks on 
	the line.
	
	Maverick looks up and sees the other two-man team, the 
	victors, waiting on the other side of the net for them. Of 
	course it had to be Ice and Slider.Charlie sits and watches 
	as the game gets immediately out of hand. In moments, 
	Maverick and Ice rotate to forward positions directly 
	opposite each other across the net. Other revelers turn to 
	watch as it degenerates (?) to more than a game. Maverick 
	glances at Charlie. He seems uncomfortable, but irrevocably 
	drawn into the confrontation. She says nothing, but her 
	attitude is apparent. Back to the game: Slider and Goose set 
	them up, as they try to spike the ball in each other's face. 
	The final point...up over the middle. They both go up, 
	Maverick smashes, Ice blocks, but the ball sails away, off 
	his forearm. For the first time ever, Maverick beats him. He 
	looks over at Charlie, she is staring out to sea. She looks 
	back at him and he's suddenly had enough competition. They 
	call for another game, but Maverick turns away...
	
			GOOSE
	Come on, come on! It's double or 
	nothing.. We're talking twelve 
	bucks American, here.
	
			MAVERICK
	I've had enough...for now.
	
	He grabs Charlie and his gear..
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Come on.
	
			CHARLIE
	Where?
	
			MAVERICK
	You want to go ballistic?
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't know. I don't like being 
	out of control.
	
	
	He looks back at Ice, bouncing the ball and staring at him.
	
			MAVERICK
	Stick with me, you'll get used to it.
	
	
	59F.  EXT. DESERT
	
	The Bike doing 130, 140, 150 mph. Charlie is unfazed. He 
	turns to check her out, she smiles back at him.
	
	CUT TO
	
	59G.  EXT. RUSTIC ADOBE CANTINA - SUNSET
	
	The bike is parked in front.
	
	MONTAGE ON LOCKED OFF CAMERA - to show the passage of time...the 
	latticed terrace, streaks of light. Maverick is feeding a dog. 
	Charlie sits on a rail watching him.
	
			MAVERICK
	I always wanted to fly... ever 
	since I first saw a jet. I wanted 
	to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, 
	then I wanted to fly off carriers, 
	then I wanted Top Gun.
	
			CHARLIE
	And now?
	
			MAVERICK
	And now I want you.
	
			CHARLIE
	You always get what you want?
	
			MAVERICK
	I don't know yet.
	
	
	DISSOLVE
	
	He puts money in jukebox. She watches him...eye to eye 
	contact. The music comes on.
	
			CHARLIE
	I want it understood.
	
			MAVERICK
	Anything.
	
			CHARLIE
	No fooling on base, no signs,
	no comments, no talk. By anyone.
	
			MAVERICK
	Why?
	
			CHARLIE
	I'm a professional. You guys are
	in my line of work.
	
	
	A long beat. He looks at her -- makes the pact: like a 
	sailor.
	
			MAVERICK
	Acknowleged.
	
	She looks at his eyes for any sign of a put-on, insincerity. 
	Finally he smiles at her but she can read it. It's time. She 
	moves in and covers his grin with a gentle kiss.
	DISSOLVE
	
	To them sitting within striking distance at a table. The dog 
	sleeps beneath. Their eyes are now locked. The electricity 
	almost arcs between them.
	
	TCU Scrub pine table. Their fingertips touch.
	
	TIGHT SHOT. Waist to head. Holding, close together, swaying 
	in time with the music. Their lips gently brush.

	62.  EXT. DAY - DESERT - TACTS RANGE
	
	An F-14 swoops over the desert, ROARS over an antenna 
	complex.
	
	The JET.- In it's missile rack, it carries a TACTS 
	transponder. The TACTS Range is an area of the desert 
	completely enveloped by computerized radar. The computers 
	
	calculate a number of aircraft's positions and velocities by 
	means of transponders in the ships and ground stations that 
	talk to each other thousands of times a second.  Using this 
	system, it is possible to track aerial combat instantaneously 
	and give pilots directions and also to play back the combats 
	for analysis.
	
	
	63.  INT. TACTS RANGE TRAILER - DAY
	
	The double viewing screens are five feet high; high 
	technology, state of the art. On the screens are computer 
	animated figures showing jets from various angles. Flight 
	data is displayed. The operators punch buttons to show 
	various points-of-view of the battle: a pilot's p.o.v.; God's 
	p.o.v. from overhead, a long range p.o.v., showing topography 
	of the landscape and height of mountains.
	
	Students and instructors sit on chairs in the peanut 
	gallery, facing Viper at the front of the room. Charlie is in 
	the back.
	
			VIPER
	The bandit has good position right 
	here. All right, freeze here. The 
	moment of choice -- Maverick is 
	defensive. He has a chance to bug 
	out right here....Better to retire 
	and save your plane than force a 
	bad position. Stay in the diamond 
	another three seconds, the bandit 
	will blow you out of the sky...make 
	a hard right, select zone 
	5...(turns to Maverick to drive 
	point home) you can extend and 
	escape. You make a bad choice. Roll 
	forward.
	
	The computerized rendering resumes on the screen.
			VIPER (Con't)
	You perform a split S. That's the 
	last thing you should do. The 
	bandit is right on your tail -- 
	Freeze there...the bandit has you 
	in his gunsight. What were you 
	thinking here, Maverick?
	
			MAVERICK
	I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
	
			VIPER
	Big gamble with a thirty million 
	dollar plane!
	
	
			MAVERICK
	    (smiling)
	No guts, no glory.
	
	It's a joke. Viper doesn't like that answer at all, but some 
	of the students laugh and mockingly whistle at the cockiness 
	of it. They give Maverick the high sign. Slider leans forward 
	to him.
			SLIDER
	Your guts. His glory.
	
	Maverick slumps down in his chair under Viper's glare.  The 
	computer rendering rolls forward again. He glances back at 
	Charlie. She smiles sympathetically at him.
	
			VIPER
	Unfortunately, the gamble worked, 
	or you might have learned 
	something. The bandit never gets a 
	clean shot...Maverick makes an 
	aggressive vertical move here, 
	comes over the top and defeats the 
	bandit with a missile shot. The 
	encounter was a victory, but we've 
	shown it as an example of what not 
	to do. Ice is next.
	
	Another computerized rendering comes up on the screen. 
	Hollywood leans close to Maverick and speaks quietly.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Gutsiest move I ever saw.
	
	Maverick gives him a small nod of appreciation.
	
			VIPER
	And the dumbest...Okay, look at 
	this. It's textbook. Ice takes 
	control of the battle immediately. 
	He never gives the bandit a chance 
	to take the offensive. An early 
	turn here -- excellent. He goes for 
	the jugular, and it's over just 
	that quick. Let's run that again, 
	it's exactly how it should be done.

	76.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY
	
	In full flight gear, carrying their helmets and trying to 
	stuff food down their gullets, the students rush/stumble 
	toward the flight line. Hollywood takes a bit of a sandwich 
	and makes a face.
			GOOSE
	What the hell is this?
	
			MAVERICK
	Don't chew it, you won't have it 
	that long. Easier to clean the 
	cockpit if it comes up in big 
	chunks.
	
	Jester yells from the distance.
	
			JESTER
	On the run. Let's go. Move it!

	A fighter pilot's lunch... a hot 
	dog and a puke.
	
	
	They scurry ahead, overtaking the others.

	I was a victim of circumstance.

	They should have warned you about 
	that one.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	She's kinky for flight suits--said 
	that she'd never seen so many 
	zippers--played with them all 
	night. The noise alone kept me up.
	
			GOOSE
	What'd you do?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Pulled left, rolled out, 
	underneath.
	
			WOLFMAN
	It's kind of ironic. All you guys 
	have women troubles and I don't.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	That's because you don't have any 
	women.
	
			WOLFMAN
	Until last night. Did you see the 
	moves I was making on that girl at 
	the party?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	The girl with the purple 
	fingernails?
	
			WOLFMAN
	That's her--tall hungry woman with 
	fire in her eyes. It was great.
	
			MAVERICK
	It was bad.
	
			WOLFMAN
	Bad?
	
			MAVERICK
	The girl with the purple 
	fingernails was Coogan's sister.
	
	They all laugh. Wolfman looks stunned.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Coogan spent half the night looking 
	for her. He said he was gonna kill 
	the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his 
	sister.
	
			WOLFMAN
	I didn't ruin her.
	
			MAVERICK
	You didn't help.
	
			WOLFMAN
	No, really. She came ruined!...   
	Ya think he knows it was me?
	
			GOOSE
	Seemed not to. But it's hard to 
	know. You never can tell what's in 
	the mind of a psychopath.
	
	Wolfman looks very unsettled.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Hear about Ice?
	
			WOLFMAN
	What now?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	He won again.
	
	Goose walks beside Maverick now.
	
			GOOSE
	Something bothering you?
	
			MAVERICK
	Nothing. Let's just go fight.
	
	
	Wolfman looks very apprehensive as they approach the F-14's. 
	MECHANICS surround both planes, making last minute checks of 
	all systems. Among them is COOGAN, six and a half feet tall, 
	looking mean. Maverick tosses him a wave.
	
			MAVERICK
	Morning, Coogan.
	
			WOLFMAN
	How's it goin', Coog?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Ever find your sister, Coogan?
	
			COOGAN
	You guys know somethin' about that?
	
	Wolfman swallows hard and hurries quickly into the plane. 
	Coogan glares at them all with a look that could kill.

	78.  EXT. F-14'S - DAY
	
	Hollywood leads, Maverick follows. They point their noses 
	down and dive. Two bogies fly side by side at five thousand, 
	outlined against the blue Pacific. Smaller, slower, they seem 
	helpless for a moment. We hear the instructors in the F-5's.
	
	
			VIPER (V.O. filtered) 
	TWO AT SEVEN O'CLOCK, JESTER.

	Holy shit, it's Viper.
	
			MAVERICK 
	Keep your shirt on, he's saying 
	holy shit it's us.
	
	The bogies split. Bogey One hard left. Bogey Two hard right. 
	Hollywood sweeps left, pursuing Bogey One. Maverick hangs 
	back to cover him.
	
	Bogey One makes a strong vertical move. Hollywood stays on 
	him.
			MAVERICK
	STAY WITH HIM, WOOD... YOUR SIX 
	CLEAR!
	
	Bogey One loops and comes down, and Hollywood almost loses 
	him for a moment before regaining the angle.
	
			MAVERICK
	STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
	
			GOOSE
	Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose 
	on!
	
	Maverick looks quickly at three o'clock high, sees Bogey Two 
	returning to the fight. He jerks the stick right, and the two 
	planes make a quick pass.
	
			VIPER
	SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
	
			MAVERICK
	ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY.
	WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

	I'm gonna take him, Goose.
	
			GOOSE
	Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
	
			MAVERICK
	I want him!
	
	Maverick goes suddenly vertical, zooms straight up.
	
			GOOSE
	Hey, come on--hey!
	
	Maverick loops the F-14 down to get the quick angle on Viper 
	in Bogey Two. Viper takes off, running from the fight again. 
	Maverick looks over his shoulder and sees that Hollywood 
	still has a good position on Bogey One. He takes a hard right 
	and streaks off after Viper.
	
			GOOSE
	What what are you doing?
	We're cover!
	
			MAVERICK
	Wood's okay. I want Viper.
	
	Goose looks back at Hollywood and Bogey One.
	
			GOOSE
	But we're cover!
	
	
	Viper streaks across the sky with Maverick close behind. He 
	pushes the throttle forward to ZONE 5 - full afterburner.
	Viper shows all his tricks...hard left, hard right, rolling 
	into vertical, flipping into a dive. Maverick stays with him. 
	
	
			VIPER (To himself)
	Goddamn, rookie, you're all right!

	Maverick turns to get Viper in the diamond. He hears a 
	SIDEWINDER GROWL in his headset.
	
			MAVERICK
	What's the range, Goose. I've got a 
	good tone.
	
	Viper jinks but Maverick stays with him.  Viper is in the 
	diamond, and the TONE GOES CRAZY. But suddenly....
	
			GOOSE
	Two bogies ! Three o'clock high, 
	nine o'clock high! Break!
	
	They come out of nowhere, flashing down toward Maverick--a 
	crossfire ambush. Maverick's eyes are startled.
	
			JESTER
	ATOLL ON THE NORTHERN F-14. HE'S 
	OUT OF THE FIGHT..

	Slaps his helmet like a dolt...
	
			VIPER
	KNOCK OFF THE CHATTER, TOP GUNS. 
	LET'S RTB. VIPER HAS THE LEAD.
	
	
	80.  INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
	
	Silence. Several pilots in various forms of undress. 
	Maverick and Goose sit with their heads down, a hangdog 
	expression on their faces.
	
	81.  INT. DIRTY DAN'S - A BAR - 
	LATER
	
	Maverick mopes at the bar, a figure comes up behind him.
	
			VIPER
	Ya know, that was the best flying 
	I've seen since Nam...(He grins) 
	...Right up to that part where you 
	got killed.
	
	Viper sits down. He's in a jovial, taunting mood.  Maverick 
	watches him guardedly.
	
			VIPER
	Twenty years' experience, I 
	couldn't shake you. You may be a 
	great flyer. I mean that.
	
			MAVERICK
	I lost.
	
			VIPER
	Of course you did. I said a great 
	flyer, not a smart one. You fly 
	reckless. Great instincts. No 
	discipline. That ambush today, you 
	followed your emotions instead of 
	your wingman. Of course you got 
	killed...and well deserved to. It 
	was a really stupid mistake. In 
	battle, it gets people killed.
	
	Maverick nods and stares at his beer.
	
			MAVERICK
	I can take care of myself.
	
			VIPER
	Talent is no holy shield. Von 
	Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. 
	Instincts are not enough. Do it our 
	way. We've worked these things out. 
	The good pilots can become better 
	and the great ones can learn how to 
	stay alive.  (he studies him for a 
	moment)  Why do you have to do 
	everything the hard way?
	
			MAVERICK
	It's my own way. It works for me.  
	I don't care about the rest of that 
	stuff.
	
			VIPER
	Then why are you here?
	
			MAVERICK
	For the same reason you are.
	
			VIPER
	Oh, you mean the thrill!
	
			MAVERICK
	The flying. The fighting.  I'd go 
	up there ten times a day to fight. 
	I'd win at least nine of them. 
	That's all I want to do. It's what 
	I do best. I am real good.  Just 
	give me the jet.
	
	Viper studies him,
	
			VIPER
	It's not a gift, just a loan...
	
	He finishes his beer, then rises.
	
			VIPER
	Nine out of ten is okay, as long as 
	it's only fun and games. But this 
	isn't about that. This is serious 
	business. It is dangerous up there! 
	At 500 knots, things can change a 
	lot in a second. Discipline is what 
	protects us.
	
	He signals the bartender and drops some money on the bar. He 
	stretches, looks around. 
	
			VIPER
	It was a good day. You learned 
	something. You lost and you're 
	still alive to think about it. And, 
	you lost your wingman. That's a 
	cardinal sin...don't ever do it 
	again. You owe Hollywood an apology 
	and you owe me a beer.
	
	Viper touches Maverick's shoulder as he moves away. It was 
	just the gesture Maverick needed, for he seems to relax from 
	his tension. He sips his beer alone.
	
	
	82.  INT. SAN DIEGO AIRPORT - NIGHT
	
	Maverick and Goose move through the terminal, 
	anxious/expectant looks on their faces.
	
			GOOSE
	Relationships are a bitch, here. 
	It's hard enough to concentrate 
	...under the pressure. Having a 
	woman here is asking for it.
	
			MAVERICK
	I guess that's what I'm doing, 
	then.
	
			GOOSE
	Where do you find the time? Where 
	do you find the energy. It's tough 
	enough to keep your mind on school. 
	A woman here is a real pain in 
	the...
	
	
	A pretty woman emerges from the crowd and spots them first. 
	She rushes them, happily, carrying her sleepy four-year-old, 
	RICKY. Goose undergoes an immediate change, beaming a big 
	smile that he has practiced on her for years. She sets down 
	the kid.
	
			GOOSE
	...butt...Hi, honey, God, am I glad 
	to see you! I missed you.
	
	Goose wraps his arms around Carol, smack, a kiss. She smiles 
	at Maverick, turns back to Goose.
	
			CAROL
	I had to come, Willard, I got so 
	lonesome I just couldn't stand it.
	
			GOOSE
	Sure, honey, I understand. It's 
	great to see you. Hey where's your 
	backseater, where's the world's 
	smallest RIO..
	
	He looks all around and then down at the kid, hiding shyly 
	behind his mother's skirts. Goose grabs up the kid and zooms 
	him around, a game they've played before, every six months or 
	so. The kid laughs happily.  Maverick just sort of smiles to 
	himself and shakes his head.
	
	83.  OMITTED
	
	84.  A POOL (OR BEACH)
	
	Maverick comes to the surface. She enters frame by the side 
	of the pool.  She hands him a split fresh pineapple. He eats 
	it in the  most salacious manner possible. He's so contented, 
	he's babbling.
	
			MAVERICK
	Food...and you...my F-14!
	
			CHARLIE
	In that order?
	
			MAVERICK
	Well no...inverse order.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'm still second best.
	
			MAVERICK
	You ever fly an F-14?
	    (She laughs.)
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't fly in anything that
		doesn't show movies.
	
	He gets out, grabs a towel, moves over to some chairs. His 
	flight suit is draped over one. He moves it to sit down.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Ahhh, you'd love it. Night carrier 
	landings! The most dangerous thing 
	you can think of! ...next to 
	you...And the most exciting. You're 
	living at one hundred and ten per 
	cent. Greatest high in the world... 
	
	
			CHARLIE
	Danger?
	
			MAVERICK
	    (of course).
	Yeah! 
	
			CHARLIE
	Doesn't it ever bother you?
	
			MAVERICK
	Why, what's gonna happen?
	
	His flight suit slips onto the ground. Charlie retrieves it. 
	As she lifts the suit, something falls out of the pocket. 
	Looks like a gold coin. She picks it up. Maverick is drying 
	his hair. She holds the object out to him, questioning. He 
	sees it, quickly takes it, stuffs it back into his pocket.
	
			MAVERICK
	Lucky charm.
	
			CHARLIE
	What do you take me for? It's a 
	Navy Cross.
	
			MAVERICK
	Just good luck.
	
			CHARLIE
	Where'd you get it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Pawn shop. What's to eat?
	
	He roots through a picnic basket.
	
	
	84A.  MONTAGE - PREFLIGHT ACTIVITY
	
			VIPER (V.O.) 
	...MiG sweep over the water.  You 
	will proceed down the one-seven 
	-zero degree radial looking for 
	MiGs. You will engage all that you 
	find, destroy them, and return to 
	base. Maverick, has the lead. Any 
	questions? All right, let's go. 
	Move like you've got a 
	purpose....
	
	85.  EXT. CLOUD COVER - 
	20,000 FT. - DAY
	
	Four F-14's fly in formation over the Pacific, searching for 
	(MiGs). They spot them, engage. The combatants fly scissor 
	patterns, slashing past each other, angling for position.
	
	We hear the VOICES OF COMBAT from the planes, a barrage of 
	information exchanges between pilots and RIO's. Maverick and 
	Ice swoop close together on each other's wing--moving on each 
	other, testing, they glance at each other and nod. The 
	Challenge...the fight is on. Suddenly an F-5 rises up out of 
	the clouds in front of them--Ice has the advantage and rolls 
	in on him.
	
			ICE
	ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
	
			MAVERICK
	SHIT!!
	
	The F-5 sees his pursuers. Goes into a hard left.
	
			ICE
	MIG'S IN A LEFT. MIG'S IN A 
	LEFTHAND. I'M ENGAGING.
	
	
	Ice struggles against the G's to bring his nose to bear. 
	They go around into a Lufbery--a tight circle, Ice has the 
	advantage. He is closer to the F-5's tail than the F-5 is to 
	his. But he can't close, can't line up the shot. He grunts 
	and strains as the G force pushes him down.
	
			MAVERICK
	COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M 
	IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
	
			ICE
	STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M 
	ENGAGED. I'M IN.
	
	Maverick maneuvers close to their left circle.
	
			ICE
	GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. 
	GET OUT OF THERE.
	
			MAVERICK
	FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
	
			ICE
	GET LOST!
	
			MAVERICK
	YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- 
	I'M COMING IN.
	
			ICE
	IT'S MY SHOT.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY 
	WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
	
			ICE
	STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, 
	MAVERICK.
	
			MAVERICK
	YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
	
	
	MAVERICK - ABOVE.
	
			MAVERICK
	ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
	
			ICE
	NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
	
	
	Maverick is pulling a log of G's, but can't target his 
	weapons, he continues to turn in a hard circle, going round 
	and round without gaining. He can't bring his nose to bear.
	
			MAVERICK
	IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
	
			ICE
	NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
	
	Ice stays.
	
			MAVERICK
	COMING IN.
	
	Maverick dives down between the two planes pulling 6.5 G's, 
	exposing his underside to Ice. All Ice sees is belly. 
	Obviously, in this attitude Maverick can't see him.
	
			ICE
	    (under breath.)
	Sonofabitch.
	
	He slams the stick hard right in toward Maverick. 
	Ice quickly rolls up right, in front of him.
	
			ICE
	LOOK OUT!
	
	
	Maverick sees him flash into his view. He has to slam the 
	stick forward to avoid collision. He swings by real close. 
	Too close.
	
			GOOSE
	Oh, no!
	
	
	
	They pass through Ice's turbulence. The blast distorts the 
	airflow to Maverick's left engine. BOOMBOOMBOOM. The engine 
	flames out. Full thrust on the right, engine swings the tail 
	around in a yaw. Maverick slams the stick right to correct 
	but too late.
	
			GOOSE
	Plane's coupling up! Plane's 
	coupling up!
	
	
	The plane couples one yaw to the next--the tail swings 
	around-- which becomes an ever increasing flat spin, like an 
	out-of -control frisbee.
	
			GOOSE
	This is not good!...(Rising panic) 
	We're low!
	
	
	Maverick is pinned to the instrument panel by centrifugal 
	force, desperately tries to reach back for the ejection 
	lever--but is falling short by about a foot.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm pinned to the panel.
	
			GOOSE
	Time to go.
	
			MAVERICK
	I can't eject.
	
	
	The plane is spinning ever faster, out of control. He drops 
	the gear. Still spins. Goose is closer to center of spin--G 
	forces are less. He reaches behind him for the eject handle, 
	starts the eject sequence.
	
			GOOSE
	3000 feet. I'll do it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
	
	
	85A.  BOOM - A HURRICANE OF WIND AND NOISE
	
	The canopy BLASTS away--but is held spinning above the 
	cockpit by the vortex of the sinking jet. Goose glances up at 
	it.
	
			GOOSE
	1000.
	
			MAVERICK
	Let's go. Eject.
	
	
	Goose yanks the ejection handle. Things happen in a split 
	second. Goose is fired up and out by the rocket under his 
	seat. Almost instantly he impacts the spinning canopy. A 
	sickening CRUNCH. The canopy is knocked away. Maverick is 
	slammed back in his seat as the ejection seat straps wind up. 
	He is BLASTED out of the plane just before it spins in.
	
	
	85B.  TIGHT ON MAVERICK AS HE TUMBLES IN SLOW MOTION
	
	He's in shock..the loud THUMPING of his heart, labored 
	breathing, a scream that stays in his mind.
	
	Instinctively, he gropes for straps. He releases the pilot 
	seat, it tumbles away. His chute streams, balloons open, 
	snapping his body like a bullwhip.  He drifts momentarily, 
	then plunges into the sea.
	
	
	85C. UNDERWATER
	
	His face, distorted in the water; wild eyes, disoriented, 
	choking for air. He reaches out, finds nothing to grab.
	Suddenly, he is yanked hard to the side.
	
	
	85D.  SURFACE 
	
	The parachute is caught by the wind, and dragged, pulling 
	Maverick along beneath the surface. He is twisting in the 
	water, turning over and over, trying desperately to slip out 
	of the tangled straps. He finally hits the surface of the 
	water and sucks air into his lungs. With the end of his 
	strength, he hits the release snaps and breaks free from the 
	parachute. It whips away like a kite in a typhoon.
	
	The sea is choppy and rough. He struggles as his equipment 
	drags him under. He twists, finds the inflatable raft 
	attached to his harness. Maverick pulls the cord, and the 
	raft hisses open. He pulls his body into the six-by-two foot 
	raft and collapses, completely exhausted. The survival has 
	been almost without thinking: an instinctual physical 
	struggle.
	
	
	85E.  TWILIGHT
	
	Maverick begins to focus on the situation. He stains the 
	water with dye, then sees another parachute floating nearby. 
	Paddling to the parachute, he reaches over the side and 
	begins to pull on the heavy cords that are submerged in the 
	water.
	
	A great struggle. The weight is extremely heavy. Finally, he 
	pulls a body to the surface. Goose. Goose is dead. Maverick 
	releases the parachute and pulls Goose into the raft on top 
	of him. He holds Goose in his arms. His mind shuts down 
	again.
	
	From high above the ocean, we see the debris on the water. 
	An oil slick, pieces of honeycomb titanium, and the small, 
	helpless figure in the raft.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	86.  EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
	
	Searchlights skim over the black ocean. A brilliant light 
	flashes as Maverick pops a pencil flare. Helicopter blades 
	flick powerfully. The lights of the choppers descend toward 
	the wreckage area, scanning the debris, searching for life. 
	The spotlights find Maverick and Goose in the raft.
	
	The draft from the chopper churns the water. A FROGMAN drops 
	from the chopper and hits with a heavy splashes. He surfaces 
	and swims to the raft as a rescue harness is lowered.
	
	Maverick watches curiously as he starts to examine Goose. He 
	hugs Goose closer and looks threatened.
	
	
			FROGMAN
	Let him go, sir. Take it easy.
	
	He tries to pry Goose free, but Maverick has a death grip on 
	the body.
	
			FROGMAN
	Sir! Let him go. It's all right. 
	Let him go.
	
	
	Maverick glares at the man as he bobs in the water.
	
	Another long moment, then Maverick releases Goose. The 
	frogman quickly straps Maverick into the harness. 
	
	HIS POV. - He watches the lifeless body in the water as he 
	is pulled up and away. He shivers from the cold.
	
	
	87.  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Extreme CLOSE ON Maverick's face. He is emotionless. His 
	eyes are flat and absolutely without expression. There is 
	complete silence in the room. Then we hear the quiet, calm, 
	probing voice of Viper.
	
			VIPER
	How do you feel?
	
			MAVERICK
	All right.
	
			VIPER
	Goose is dead.
	
			MAVERICK
	I know. I was there.
	
	
	
	Not one sign of emotion from Maverick. Not one tone of 
	expression. We see Viper now, and his face is strained from a 
	very long day.
	
			VIPER
	If you fly jets long enough, 
	something like this happens to you. 
	No one escapes it. It touches us 
	all.
	
	Maverick looks at Viper, and his eyes are very disturbed.
	
			MAVERICK
	He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
	
			VIPER
	My first squadron in Vietnam, we 
	lost eight out of eighteen planes. 
	Ten guys. The first one kills you, 
	but there'll be others--you can 
	count on it.
	
	
	No reaction from Maverick. He can't quite face up to that 
	reality right now.
	
			VIPER
	You've got to put him in the box.
	
	
	Maverick is watching Viper, but he doesn't have anything to 
	say.
	
	
	88.  EXT. CHARLIE'S SPORTSCAR - NIGHT
	
	The RADIO plays John Lennon; "Stand by Me". Maverick opens 
	his eyes, doesn't know where he is for a moment.
	
			CHARLIE
	...they say you're alright.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm fine.
	
			CHARLIE
	This is it, then.
	
			MAVERICK
	What?
	
			CHARLIE
	The dark side. The price you pay 
	for all the fun you're having. You 
	knew about it, of course. Didn't 
	you?
	
			MAVERICK
	He was a friend of mine. A good 
	guy...great guy. It was my 
	fault.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's not what I hear.
	
			MAVERICK
	I was flying...my responsibility.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's what you get flight pay for.
	
			MAVERICK
	Maybe I shouldn't take it.
	
			CHARLIE
	    (In surprise)
	Why? You act like you didn't know 
	one day this would happen.
	
			MAVERICK
	Not to me.
	
			CHARLIE
	You knew it. You all do. It's part 
	of it. Maybe the most important 
	part.
	
	
	88A.  ON THE BEACH - NIGHT AND FOG 
	
	Charlie's car pulls up. They get out and walk down toward 
	the water. Maverick seems dazed. She is softly taunting.
	
			MAVERICK
	Where are we?
	
			CHARLIE
	Where are we? You know where we 
	are. It's called the beach. It's 
	where life first crawled up out of 
	the sea. I come here sometimes... 
	when I feel like crawling back in.
	
			MAVERICK
	You don't have to do this.
	
			CHARLIE
	Do what, show you a good time?
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm not good company. I should be 
	alone.
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't think so, but if that's 
	what you want...
	
	They stand there, not making a move.
	
			MAVERICK
	No.
	
			CHARLIE
	What do you want?
	
			MAVERICK
	I want it back.
	
			CHARLIE
	What?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yesterday.
	
	She turns, nods out, past the moon.
	
			CHARLIE
	You look way out there. Out past 
	the date line. West becomes East, 
	all things change. You cross the 
	line...today becomes yesterday...or 
	tomorrow, I forget which.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's what I want.
	
			CHARLIE
	Of course the line's just 
	imaginary. You can cross it twenty 
	times...nothing really changes.
	
	She turns and walks along the surfline.
	
			CHARLIE
	On the beach... It's what they say 
	when Navy men retire...He's "On The 
	Beach". I always liked that. I had 
	a picture...in my head... all these 
	old guys wandering around here, 
	looking out into the past.
	
	He walks to the surf, kicks the sand with his bare feet.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	If we knew then, what we know now, 
	we might never have come up out of 
	there.
	
	He turns to her. She just looks at him.
	
			CHARLIE
	You don't believe that.
	
			MAVERICK
	Hardly ever.
	
			CHARLIE
	Only when you're depressed. Then it 
	passes.
	
			MAVERICK
	It does.
	
			CHARLIE
	Everything passes. Immutable law of 
	the Universe.
	
	
	He picks up a piece of flotsam, a twig, worn smooth.
	
			CHARLIE
	This too...shall pass. You put as 
	much life as you can between it and 
	you. You start piling up experience 
	between then and now.
	
	He turns and walks.
	
			MAVERICK
	What do you do when you come here?
	
			CHARLIE
	I sit. I think. I play games.
	
			MAVERICK
	What kind of games?
	
			CHARLIE
	I like to play "reality".
	
	She stops and turns.
	
			MAVERICK
	How do you play reality.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's strip reality, actually, like 
	what the pilots always want to 
	play.
	
			MAVERICK
	  (this gets a small laugh)
	Strip reality! How do you play 
	that?
	
			CHARLIE
	It's like strip poker, only, 
	without the bluffing. (he laughs 
	again) One person says something 
	and if the other one accepts that 
	it's true, the one who says it, 
	gets to take one item of clothing 
	off.
	
			MAVERICK
	You're crazy. (She stops, he goes 
	on, softer) That's a pretty silly 
	game.
	
			CHARLIE
	Not as silly as some. You know the 
	silliest one? ...that we are gods. 
	That we control events on the 
	beach... that we can turn back 
	time...
	
	She moves in close.
	
			CHARLIE
	Want to play the game? 
	
			MAVERICK
	How does it go?
	
			CHARLIE
	You say the truth. (a beat...)    
	Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want 
	to win the game, don'tcha?
	
			MAVERICK
	What truth?
	
			CHARLIE
	The big one. The one that's most on 
	your mind.
	
	A long pause...it comes hard.
	
			MAVERICK
	Goose is dead.
	
			CHARLIE
	    (she nods)
	True.
	
			MAVERICK
	Now?
	
			CHARLIE
	Take something off.
	
			MAVERICK
	Off me or off you?
	
			CHARLIE
	That's up to you.
	
	
	He takes the ribbon from her hair. It falls down over her 
	face and shoulders. Now it's her turn.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's dangerous...what you do.
	
	He nods. She slowly loosens his tie and pulls it from around 
	his neck.
	
			MAVERICK
	It was my fault.
	
	
	She says nothing, stands looking into his eyes. He slowly, 
	as if in a trance, takes her blouse off.
	
			CHARLIE
	You can't bring him back.
	
	She takes off his shirt.
	
			MAVERICK
	It was my fault.
	
	
	
	He starts to reach for her. She pulls back.
	
			CHARLIE
	Nope. Already used that.
	
	She turns and thinks for a moment, looking at the moon.
	
			CHARLIE
	Your life goes on.
	
	
	Rather than struggle his T shirt over his head, she grabs it 
	with both hands. She leans in close and bites it. She grabs 
	both sides of the tear and slowly rips it off his body.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	What does it mean?
	
			CHARLIE
	   (shakes her head no)
	That wasn't fair. It was a 
	question. Penalty round!
	
	
	She drops her skirt.
	
			CHARLIE
	You didn't mean it. You didn't 
	think. You'd do anything to take it 
	back.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's three.
	
			CHARLIE
	And that's one!
	
	
	She unbuckles his belt, slowly slides it off. She unzips his 
	pants, they fall.
	
			MAVERICK
	One more.
	
			CHARLIE
	Your watch.
	
	She unbuckles it.
	
			MAVERICK
	You owe me one.
	
	
	He rests his head on her shoulder, unhooks her bra. She 
	shrugs it off.
	
	They stand on the beach in shorts and bikini bottom, looking 
	into each other's eyes.
	
			CHARLIE
	Looks like a tie.
	
			MAVERICK
	Who's gonna win?
	
			CHARLIE
	We'll say it together. On the count 
	of three...One...two...
	
	Leaning in, softer and harder...they both jump the gun.
	
			BOTHTOGETHER
	I love.ove y.you.
	
	They embrace madly and sink to the sand. From the distance 
	it looks like a strange slithering creature crawling back to 
	the sea.
	
	
	89.  INT. GOOSE'S ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The lights are out in Goose's room at the Bachelor Officers' 
	Quarters. The door opens, and Maverick enters. He sets a 
	cardboard box on the bed.
	
	Silently, Maverick gathers together Goose's few personal 
	possessions. He fills the box with clothes, books, a clock, a 
	radio, a walkman, and articles from the bathroom. He examines 
	each closely, like an artifact...as if he might find some 
	message or meaning in them. He fumbles them into the box. He 
	can't see too well, his eyes are full of tears.
	
	Maverick closes the box and carries it to the door. He takes 
	one last glance around, then leaves and closes the door 
	behind him.
	
	
	89A.  INT. BOQ RECEPTION AREA                      *
	
	Carol and the kid, stand, staring at a silent TV. Carol 
	looks dazed, lost. Maverick walks in, finds her. An awkward 
	silence while they both try to think of something to say. 
	Maverick hands the box to Carol.
	
	90.   OMITTED
	
	89B.  CLOSE UP - MAVERICK.
	
	He sits staring right through us...the thousand-yard stare. 
	A strange white unreal light washes over him. The only color, 
	the Navy and gold of the stripes on his shoulderboards. A low 
	rumbling mumbling filters through the HISS of surf or fans or 
	something...Snatches of low whispered 
	conversation....disregard of...basic air-safety 
	principles...too aggressive...incident.... 29 July...within 
	performance parameters... disciplinary action...tactical 
	doctrine.... even reckless at times... 
	conjecture...unsupported ...benefit of the doubt...
	
	Maverick's 
	eyes slowly focus. The light attenuates. The surrounding 
	image becomes denser. Things become real.
	
	
	89C.  INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - MAVERICK'S POV
	
	A BOARD OF INQUIRY, a COMMANDER and other NAVY OFFICERS 
	seated behind tables at the front of the room. Maverick faces 
	them, wearing dress whites. Viper is also present. The 
	Commander looks at each of the Officers. They each nod, in 
	turn, indicating readiness. The Commander turns to Maverick, 
	and states for the record:
	
			CDR.
	The Board of Inquiry finds that Lt. 
	Evan Mitchell was not at fault in 
	the accident of twenty-nine July.
	
	No response from Maverick, one way or the other. Viper 
	studies his face with concern.
	
			CDR.
	 Lt. Mitchell's record will be 
	cleared of this incident.
	
	
	Still no response from Maverick.
	
		CDR.
	Lt. Mitchell is restored to flight 
	status without further delay. These 
	proceedings are closed.
	
	Maverick doesn't respond.
	
	
	91.  INT. MAVERICK'S ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Maverick lies on his bunk and stares at the ceiling. The 
	phone next to his bed is RINGING.  It RINGS EIGHT OR NINE 
	TIMES, then stops. He makes no move to reach for it. 
	
	
	92. through 95. OMITTED
	
	
	94A.  INT. COCKPIT - F-14 ON FLIGHT LINE
	
	Maverick sits in the cockpit staring at the controls while 
	the ground crew preps the aircraft for flight. Coogan helps 
	him strap in. He speaks solicitously to Maverick. It is 
	unheard over the JET NOISE and RADIO BABBLE. Maverick looks 
	at the cockpit as if it's a strange territory, suddenly 
	foreign to him. He grabs the stick like it's some peculiar 
	talisman. He turns and looks aft. He seems surprised that it 
	moves the control surfaces in the tails.
	
	96.  INT. F-14 - DAY
	
			FUNGUS
	BOGEY AT TEN O'CLOCK LOW. YOU'VE 
	GOT THE ANGLE -- PIECE OF CAKE.
	
	
	Maverick checks ten o'clock low. He is disturbed. He tries 
	to make the move, but he is a man with no secret: he is 
	afraid.
	
			FUNGUS
	ENGAGE, MAVERICK - ANYTIME.
	
	
	The bogey abruptly turns into him. Maverick hesitates. Then 
	suddenly, he jerks the stick hard right and takes the F-14 
	away from the bogey at great speed. Fungus is startled.
	
			FUNGUS
	WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN 
	THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
	
		MAVERICK
	DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
	
			FUNGUS
	WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO 
	LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
	
			MAVERICK
	NO. NO GOOD.
	
	
	96A.  INT. FLIGHT LINE - DAY
	
	Jester walks up to Viper who waits near an F-5.
	
			JESTER
	He just won't engage. He can't do 
	it, Skipper. He can't get back on 
	the horse. 
	
			VIPER
	It's only been a week. Keep sending 
	him up.
	
			JESTER
	I've seen this before.
	
			VIPER
	So have I.
	
			JESTER
	Some guys never get it back.
	
	
	He walks off.
	
	
	
	97. through 102.  OMITTED
	
	
	103.  INT. LOCKER ROOM - IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
	
	Maverick grabs his stuff out of the locker, throws them in a 
	bag. He glances up as Fungus enters, continues to pack.
	
			FUNGUS
	What are you doing?
	
			MAVERICK
	Saving them some paperwork.
	
			FUNGUS
	Since when did you care about  
	paperwork? 
	
	Maverick walks away. Fungus hesitates, then follows him.
	
			FUNGUS
	If I could fly like you I'd have 
	everything I want. If I could fly 
	at all. I can't fly. I can't fly 
	like that. Nobody can. Whatever it 
	is, you've got it!
	
			MAVERICK
	Not anymore. 
	
			FUNGUS
	So, you're scared--so what? You 
	ever get a good look at me in the 
	back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
	
	Grabbing the suitcase, Maverick brushes past Jester and 
	walks up the corridor. Jester and Fungus watch him go. Fungus 
	goes to the phone.
	
	
	104.  EXT. SAN DIEGO AIRPORT - NIGHT
	
	Charlie parks her car, jumps out, and runs toward the main 
	entrance to the terminal.
	
	
	105.  INT. TERMINAL
	
	Charlie hurries through the crowd, bumping past people, 
	searching frantically for Maverick in the huge terminal. She 
	moves past bench after bench, and her eyes flick in all 
	directions. A quick glance at the souvenir shop, the coffee 
	shop, and then she heads for the bar.
	
	Maverick is there, sitting alone in a booth with his 
	suitcase beside him, staring into a drink. Charlie composes 
	herself, then walks to the booth and sits down across the 
	table from him. Maverick does not look pleased.
	
			CHARLIE
	Never liked fighter pilots anyway. 
	
	
	
	He looks up trying to be angry, but he can't help it, she 
	makes him laugh.
	
			MAVERICK
	You came to the right place.
	
	The waitress comes up.
	
			MAVERICKWhat are you having?
	
	Turns to the waitress.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'll have what he's having... 
	Hemlock, is it?
	
	The waitress departs. He tries not to smile, but can't help 
	it.
	
			CHARLIE
	You weren't gonna say goodbye?
	
			MAVERICK
	I was, later. 
	
			CHARLIE
	Long distance? I wouldn't do that 
	to you. I'd at least talk to you.
	
			MAVERICK
	I didn't want to see you. I mean, I 
	did...but I didn't..
	
			CHARLIE
	I know exactly what you mean.
	
			MAVERICK
	How could you?
	
		CHARLIE
	I've got a gift just like you do. 
	My gift is I just know what people 
	mean, even if they can't say it. It 
	helps when you're trying to 
	communicate with fighter pilots. 
	Like what you just said was "I'm 
	embarrassed, I feel I've done 
	something wrong, that I've failed, 
	and I don't think I can live up to 
	the expectations of a wonderful 
	interesting, intelligent woman like 
	yourself." That about it?
	
			MAVERICK
	    (laughs)
	...Something like that.
	
	
			CHARLIE
	And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by 
	myself for awhile, like until I can 
	think of a new career...hotel 
	management or something...
	
			MAVERICK
	Big talk for someone who's never 
	been shot off her computer.
	
			CHARLIE
	Hey, I never said I was a fighter 
	pilot...I never claimed to think it 
	was fun to be shot off the end of a 
	ship in a storm. I can find 
	contentment in a good book. I don't 
	have to roar by someone at Mach two 
	with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I 
	just get happy being with the right 
	man.
	
			MAVERICK
	I hope you find him.
	
			CHARLIE
	I think I have... I could be wrong. 
	I have been before. Just remember 
	one thing. If you're not Top Gun, 
	if you're not fighting jets, you're 
	not gonna be able to act like a 
	fighter pilot... You're gonna have 
	to act like the rest of us. You're 
	gonna have to master humility. For 
	you guys, that's the toughest 
	maneuver of all.
	
	She gets up...lays a bill out for the drinks...
	
			CHARLIE
	So long, Sailor. See you on the 
	beach sometime.
	
	
	She swings away. Her wake sucks in the stares of every man 
	in the place. Then they look over to Maverick, quick flicks 
	of envy in their eyes. He stares them back and can't quite 
	meet their eyes.
	
	
	106.  EXT. BEACH AT VIPER'S HOUSE - LATER
	
	Viper is tugged down the beach by a three year old kid. They 
	come across one creature who's had a bad night...Viper spots 
	him, he spots Viper, and Viper moves toward him. Tim, Viper's 
	kid, wants to head for the sea and pulls his father in that 
	direction. He stops, puts his hand on his hips like he's seen 
	the pilots do. 
	
			TIM
	Dad...Of all the aminals in the 
	ocean, which one's the baddest?
	
	
			VIPER
	I don't know, Tim. You'll have to 
	ask them.
	
	Viper turns to the creature, Maverick, and shrugs.
	
			VIPER
	Runs in the family...
	
	Maverick stands up. 
	
			MAVERICK
	Skipper, sorry to bother you.
	
			VIPER
	No bother.
	
			MAVERICK
	I called your house.
	
			VIPER
	My wife's house.
	
			MAVERICK
	She said you took your kid to the  
	each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or 
	beach or the ballgame. Y'have the 
	option...(Maverick thinks for a 
	beat. Segues to the question...) 
	What about me?
	
	Viper turns, they stroll together.
	
			VIPER
	We can send you back to your 
	squadron with nothing noted on your 
	record except "CNC" --course not 
	completed, no explanation required. 
	Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your 
	career, but people always wonder 
	about things like that.
	
			MAVERICK
	Or....
	
			VIPER
	Or you can quit.
	
			MAVERICK
		I don't know...
	 
			VIPER
	I didn't know either. That's why I 
	told Jester to prepare your papers.
	
	Maverick looks irritated. Viper stops at an icecream vendor 
	and orders three with a gesture.
	
			MAVERICK
	You've already made up your mind.
	
	
			VIPER
	It's no disgrace, kid. That spin 
	was hell. It would wreck anyone's 
	confidence. You could be a good 
	pilot again someday...
	
			MAVERICK
	    (starts to get his back up)
	You think I should quit?!
	
			VIPER
	I didn't say that. That's up to 
	you. But I have responsibility for 
	the other guys up there, not just 
	you. They need to know you're all 
	right...that they can depend on 
	you.
	
	
	The vendor hands them icecream, they take it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Here, let me get this. We'll be 
	even.
	
	He reaches into his pocket for change, comes out with a 
	handful. Slams it on the counter, stars picking the proper 
	change out. Viper spots something and reaches for 
	it...Maverick sees and tries to block it, but Viper comes up 
	with the Navy Cross.
	
			MAVERICK
	Lucky charm.
	
	But Viper recognizes it for what it is.
	
			VIPER
	Sometimes it's luck, but in this 
	case, he earned it... I served with 
	your old man.
	
			MAVERICK
	I know.
	
			VIPER
	VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me 
	of him. You're just like he was, 
	only better...and worse.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm nothing like him.
	
			VIPER
	You may not think so, but you are.
	
			MAVERICK
	He was by the book, all the way.
	
			VIPER
	They waved him off. He thought he 
	knew better. He hit the 
	ramp.
	
			MAVERICK
	I never heard that.
	
			VIPER
	Not something they tell dependents.
	
			MAVERICK
	It's not true.
	
	
	Viper looks at him, for a long beat, throws his icecream 
	away.
	
			VIPER
	Why would I lie?
	
	He turns, walks away. Maverick stands there for a moment, 
	thinking, then catches up to him, stops him...struggles with 
	the thought...as Viper breaks in...
	            
			VIPER
	You start on a wrong heading... the 
	more you stick to it, the further 
	you get from your target. A good 
	pilot always questions himself, 
	always questions his judgments, 
	stays alert for drift and makes the 
	corrections...You may find a little 
	discipline helps with the fear. You 
	don't have to be alone up there.
	
	A pause...quiet intensity.
	
			MAVERICK
	How can I go on? I feel so... 
	responsible.
	
			VIPER
	Kid, the plain fact is...you are. 
	I'm not gonna stand here and blow 
	sunshine up your ass. Technically, 
	they absolved you. You and I know 
	what really happened. You pushed 
	it. You are responsible and you'll 
	always carry that. You know what, 
	I'll carry it too. I should have 
	taken you out of that cockpit.
	I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... 
	I always try to find something 
	worthwhile in someone's death. It's 
	no trade-off. It's not one for one. 
	What you learned isn't worth his 
	death. It couldn't be. But maybe 
	there is some value in it. I know 
	it's the first thing I've ever seen 
	that's really gotten to you. Now 
	the question is, what will you do 
	with it. If it gets you out of 
	flight status...so you don't kill 
	yourself or anybody else...that's 
	good. That's one good thing. You 
	were an accident waiting to 
	happen.
	
			MAVERICK
	You think I shouldn't fly.
	
			VIPER
	I didn't say that. That's up to 
	you. I think that if you do, if you 
	choose to come back, you'll be a 
	better pilot... a better man.
	
			MAVERICK
	Would you take me back? Would they?
	
			VIPER
	I'll have to think about it. I 
	don't know about them. I do know 
	one thing, We've got a lot invested 
	in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even 
	more than those other guys, Naval 
	Aviation needs a very few, very 
	good men.

	115.  INT. TOP GUN OFFICE  
	
	LOUD ROCK AND ROLL. The graduation ceremonies are in full 
	swing...They consist of informal ribbing, laughing, and a lot 
	of talking with the hands. every now and then, the name Goose 
	comes up and a shadow passes across a face. For the most 
	part, they press on, having a good time. Fungus shrugs at 
	someone's question and looks around.
	
			FUNGUS
	I don't know where he is...
	
			PORK
	What are his plans?
	
			FUNGUS
	I don't know.
	
	Ice stands proudly holding the Top Gun plaque as others 
	congratulate him...Hollywood looks up as the door opens, 
	Maverick is there.  He looks uncomfortable, unsure. He sees 
	Ice with the plaque. Fungus moves over to him, brings him in.
			FUNGUS
	I'm glad.
	
			WOLFMAN
	Good to see you, man.
	
	One by one, they come over, shake his hand. Viper stands 
	there, looking pleased but gruff. Maverick walks over, shakes 
	his hand. The party starts to pick up. A real celebration, 
	now. 
	
	Jester enters, a sheaf of messages in his hand. He takes 
	Viper aside for a word. Viper nods at him. The group's 
	attention gradually swings onto them. They quiet down 
	instinctively. Viper finally turns to them.
	
			VIPER
	Gentlemen, you know how I hate to 
	break up this party before it has a 
	chance to get really out of hand...
	    (more serious)
	...but there's a major flap on.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	We're being called back?
	
			VIPER
	You're on your way. Don't bother 
	going to BOQ. Your bags are packed.
	
	He hands them orders. Someone turns the music back up... as 
	they shake hands all around, the music grows, becomes purer 
	as the background voices drop out.

	don't know who they are.  All I 
	know is that it's our ship, and our 
	orders are to escort it out of the

	Stinger circles an area on the map.
	
	
	117A.  TOMCAT ON THE DECK - MAVERICK
	
	He studies his copy of the same map, headings and vectors 
	pencilled in.
	
			STINGER (V.O.) 
	This is "Bullseye". A rescue 
	operation is to begin within the 
	hour. Your mission is to give air 
	support to that rescue. There are 
	MiGs in the area, and tensions are 
	high. If you witness a hostile act 
	you will return fire. We will be 
	covering 360 degrees of the compass

	SAR.
	
	
	He comes out of clouds at 1500, nothing but empty water 
	below.
			ICE
	Do you have them? Did they get out 
	or not?
	
			SLIDER
	    (confusion)
	No contact. I don't know.  
	
	
	121.  EXT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
			MAVERICK
	VOODOO, GHOST RIDER ONE. I'M ON THE 
	WAY. WAIT FOR ME.
	
	
	122.  THE SKY - MIGS AND TOMCATS CIRCLE
	
			SLIDER
	THEY GOT WOLF, THEY GOT WOOD. THEY 
	GOT THEM..  
	
			ICE
	MUSTANG, GHOST RIDER. PERMISSION TO 
	FIRE.
	
			STRIKE (V.O.) 
	GHOST RIDER,  THIS IS MUSTANG. 
	PERMISSION TO FIRE. PERMISSION TO 
	FIRE.
	
			ICE
	ROGER. ENGAGING. I HAVE THE LEAD.
	
	
	122A.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
			FUNGUS
	Let's go! Dive on those bastards!  
	
	Maverick hesitates.
	
			FUNGUS
	Come on, man, engage. This is it. 
	Get your nose in there.
	
	Maverick hesitates again. He sees the hornet's nest below; 
	planes all over the sky.
	
			FUNGUS
	Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. 
	Take him. Pull on the goddamn 
	stick, man!
	
			MAVERICK
	Okay, okay.
	
			FUNGUS
	Don't tell me okay. Do it!
	
	Maverick draws a breath, then forces himself to pull the 
	stick over. The F-14 rolls in hard toward the battle. 
	Suddenly, the cluster breaks apart. The MiGs break in every 
	direction as Maverick BLASTS through their formation. 
	Something comes up through the clouds. A MiG BLASTS by. 
	Another rolls in and locks onto them.
	
	The MiGs swarm toward the TOMCATS, coming from every 
	direction. CANNON FIRE erupts from one of the MiGs.
	
			MAVERICK
	MAVERICK'S EMGAGED. HARD LEFT, ICE, 
	PADLOCK THE EASTERN SECTION.
	
	The F-14's execute a left oblique turn in unison. They come 
	down in a section attack with their cannons blazing. From 
	Maverick's cockpit, everything looks choppy:  MiGs slide past 
	at incredible speed. Cannons BLAST, as the planes scramble 
	for position.
	
	Out-numbered four to two, Maverick and Ice fight 
	defensively. Maverick has the angle on a MIG, when Fungus 
	spots a missile launch.
	
			FUNGUS
	BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! 
	FLARES!
	
			MAVERICK
	BREAKING LEFT!
	
	Maverick releases a flare as he takes the F-14 into a hard 
	left. The missile tracks the heat of the flare and sails out 
	of the area, missing the Tomcat and falling toward the sea.
	
			ICE
	TWO MIGS ON MY TAIL, MAVERICK. I'M 
	DEFENSIVE.
	
	Maverick jerks his stick right and streaks toward Ice. He 
	cuts off one of the MiGs with CANNON FIRE, driving it down 
	toward the deck. Ice goes into vertical and comes around to 
	gain an angle on the other MiG. His RIO is in position to 
	check Mav's rear. 
	
			SLIDER
	MAVERICK! SIX O'CLOCK!
	
	Maverick turns to look and jerks a hard left. The MiG is on 
	him, CANNON BLAZING. Ice Yo Yos inside and cuts the MiG off. 
			ICE
	FOX ONE.
	
	He fires a sidewinder. The MiG turns hard, the missile sails 
	away.
	
	
			SLIDER
	BANDIT, THREE O'OLOCK HIGH!
	
	Ice's F-14 is suddenly caught in a HAIL OF CANNON FIRE as a 
	MiG sweeps down from three o'clock. He breaks, dives. The 
	jets streak across the sky, low to the deck, skimming the 
	surface.
	
			FUNGUS
	ICE'S  DEFENSIVE, HELP HIM OUT.
	
	Maverick's F-14 Rollaways in and intercepts the bogey on 
	Ice's tail.
	
			MAVERICK
	REVERSE RIGHT.
	
	Ice turns right, the MiG bugs and jerks into vertical.  
	Maverick swoops after him.
	
			FUNGUS
	STAY WITH HIM. YOUR SIX IS CLEAR.
	
	
	Maverick closes, jerking left, right, twisting and turning, 
	staying on his tail. 
	
	
	122B.  MAVERICK'S COCKPIT
	
			FUNGUS
	ONE ON OUR SIX! BUG OUT! BUG OUT!
	
	BULLETS fly by Maverick's F-14 from the MiG on his six. He 
	pulls a hard left, then takes the plane straight up. We hear 
	instructions shouted by Fungus, but it is all obscured in the 
	SOUNDS AND FURY OF THE BATTLE. Maverick peels over the top 
	and comes down like a comet. A series of passes at the MiGs. 
	As they come by, one of the MiGs pulls up, 
	
			MAVERICK
	OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH. 
	
			ICE
	LOOK OUT! 
	
	
	They look up. An MiG 21 is coming down, belly to them, close 
	to a mid-air collision.
	
			MAVERICK
	JESUS!
	
	
	He pushes down. The MiG ROARS BY. The whole airplane goes 
	"BOOOMMMM" it's that close.
	
			FUNGUS
	OHHHHH SHIT!
	
	The shock, the air pressure SLAMS them as it goes by, 
	missing by 4-5 feet. Maverick pulls back in, sees a MiG 21 
	below. It takes off, bugging out. Ice goes after him. The MiG 
	maneuvers, jerking hard left, hard right, twisting  up, down.
	
	Ice is right in his shadow. They come in hard and low over 
	the sea. He has the MiG in the diamond.
	
			ICE
	GOOD TONE, FOX ONE
	
	The MiG starts turning.
	
			ICE
	Ah Nuts!
	
	
	The missile goes by the tail.
	
			ICE
	Son of a bitch!
	
	Then his tail comes off, the airplane goes over, a chute 
	comes out. The MiG EXPLODES into a thousand small pieces. 
	They roar by the MiG pilot hanging in his straps.
	
			SLIDER
	JESUS!  HEY SPLASH ONE, SPLASH ONE 
	BANDIT! SPLASH THAT SUCKER!
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT ONE HERE. ON THE NOSE.  
	COMING DOWN. 
	
	Rolling down on him, good SIDEWINDER TONE. The MiG'S sense 
	him, they break, one guy down low. 
	
			ICE
	ON THE NOSE?
	
			MAVERICK
	GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
	 
	He squeezes the trigger.
	
	
	123.  EXT. THE MISSILE STARTS TO GO 
	
	The vapor trail comes off, the MiG 21 turns like he's been 
	bounced off a rubber wall, comes around on the missile, beats 
	it. The missile flies by him. 
	
	
			MAVERICK
	AH, SHIT! GODDAMN IT!
	
	MiG comes back turning into him.
	
			FUNGUS
	THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT ONE COMING UP.
	
			FUNGUS
	AND HE'S GUNNING.
	
	He looks back. 30 millimeter tracers go by; they just kind 
	of float. He breaks, hits airbrakes, the trailing MiG dives 
	through.
	
	Suddenly another MiG appears, rocketing straight for him. 
	They close at 900 knots--VABOOOM!--They pass nose to nose, 
	canopy to canopy. Both planes pitch straight up, trying for 
	the altitude advantage.
	
			MAVERICK
	Zone 5 burners.
	
	The F-14 outclimbs the MiG sitting on its tail, full 
	thruster, it rockets straight up, away from the planet.  
	Maverick has the advantage. Suddenly, his F-14 runs out of 
	energy. FUNGUS is the first to call it.
	
			FUNGUS
	We're ballistic! Ohhhhhh Shit!
	
	The plane backs down on itself, backs into its own smoke as 
	it flips over, falls away...He catches it, just regains 
	control, when...A ROAR. He looks up.
	
	SECOND MIG coming down. Right on him. It fills the Canopy! 
	Instinctive - A Push to miss him, Maverick breaks fast down 
	into him, a last ditch maneuver, and the airplane 
	DEPARTS...the roll rates and the pitch rates combine and it 
	tumbles over the top; the airplane just goes end-over-end. 
	They are being slammed and rattled all over the 
	cockpits...bone-jarring, neck-snapping whips. SHRIEKS and 
	SCREAMS from the airframe. Terriflying?
	
			FUNGUS
	Ohhh Mother!
	
			MAVERICK
	    (strangely calm)
	Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a 
	slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, 
	I've got it.
	
	
	Fungus is getting his teeth rattled. He's helpless, he has 
	no controls, there's nothing he can do but hold on.
	
	
			FUNGUS
	Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? 
	Are you CRAZY?
	
			MAVERICK
	Roger, I've got it. 
	
	The plane's gyrations are rattling Fungus's helmet off the 
	canopy. 
	
			FUNGUS
	You've got it?   Good!  Cause for a 
	minute there, you had me worried.
	
	It yaws and rolls, starts into a spin.
	
			FUNGUS
	Now have you got it?  Have you 
	still got it?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yawing right.
	
			FUNGUS
	I know!
	
			MAVERICK
	Rudder's left, stick's forward.
	
			FUNGUS
	Swell! Passing ten thousand!
	
	
			MAVERICK
	I've got it -- hold on!
	
			FUNGUS
	Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your 
	harness!
	
			MAVERICK
	I can recover. Hold on!
	
	They're in a progressive spiral, nose low.  The altimeter 
	unwinds, speed picks up. The G forces are forcing them away 
	from the axis of spin, jamming Maverick against the 
	instrument panel at the front of the cockpit. 
	
			MAVERICK
	You with me?
	
	Fungus, also, is jammed to his panel.
	
			FUNGUS
	Right behind you. 
	
	He is closer to the center of spin and less strongly held. 
	It doesn't do much good, however, he can't control the plane. 
	The only thing he can reach is the yellow and black loop; the 
	ejection handle. He reaches for it.
	
			FUNGUS
	Speed's up to 150. 
	
	Fungus's eyes are wide.  The earth grows larger as it rises 
	towards them. G forces flatten them. They've long since lost 
	the MiG. Nobody but an idiot would try to follow them in this 
	maneuver.
	
			FUNGUS
	5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
	
			MAVERICK
	Okay.
	
	
	The earth grows larger.
	
			FUNGUS
	4500. Critical point.
	
	
	FUNGUS grabs the ejection handle with both hands.
	
			MAVERICK
	No! Not again!
	
			FUNGUS
	What are you talking about,
		we gotta go!
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm not losing it again!
	
	The jet is standing on its nose, gaining speed, plunging 
	towards the ocean.  
	
			FUNGUS
	Gotta go, man.
	
			MAVERICK
	280, 290, 300 knots.
	
			FUNGUS
	3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man.  
	3,000 feet, we gotta go!
	
			MAVERICK
	You go. I'm staying with it.
	
			FUNGUS
	I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
	
	Then, just as suddenly, as he's about to pull...Maverick 
	catches it. The plane responds. They're out of the spin. He 
	gets control. Fungus sits there dumbly, hands on handle. 
	Still not believing...
	
			FUNGUS
	ONE....ONE....ONE...
	
	
	SEA LEVEL 
	
	Maverick stops the tumble, pulls the nose up quickly and the 
	F-l4 sweeps into level flight no more than a hundred feet 
	above the deck. He comes up and looks right at Ice. Ice is 
	down low. He comes around, a MiG-21 all over him like a cheap 
	suit. A flick, a whip, and Maverick in perfect position, 
	rolls right in on the MiG. Fungus looks like he just saw 
	Jesus. 
	
			FUNGUS
	What  in  the  Christ...was that? 
	
	He looks at the Mig target set-up in front of him in awe.
	
			FUNGUS
	Did you plan that? Was all that 
	something you planned?
	
	
	Maverick's acquired the target and is all business. 
	
			MAVERICK
	ALL RIGHT, ICE. COME HARD 
	STARBOARD, THEN EXTEND TO THE EAST. 
	
	
	Fungus is still lividly frazzled.
	
			FUNGUS
	Because...if that was... Next time 
	you tell me first.
	
			ICE
	ROG.
	
	Maverick breaks down, Ice zooms up, breaks in and takes the 
	MiG the other way. Maverick Yo Yo's in, comes right up behind 
	the MiG, as the MiG starts acceleration. 
	
	
	Maverick rolls in on Ice and the MiG. 
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD 
	TONE ON IT.
	
			ICE
	I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF  
	A SHOT?
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
	
			ICE
	WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
	
			MAVERICK
	WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2 
	
	The MiG fires.
	
			MAVERICK
	HE FIRED, BREAK NOW!
	
	Ice breaks left, drops flares. The MiG's missile follows the 
	flares. Maverick FIRES. The missile doesn't twitch. It flys 
	right up the tail pipe of the MiG, the canopy flies off, the 
	pilot comes out of it, and then the MiG blows up, We go right 
	through the fire ball. VVVARRRUOOMMM!
	
			MAVERICK
	He's out! We got him!
	
	The MiG rolls into the ground...KABOOM!  They swoop by the 
	pilot, hanging in his straps...He watches them, dumbly. 
	Fungus waves. 
	
			FUNGUS
	What a dope! Maybe they'll
		give him another plane...and we
		can shoot him down again.
	
	Maverick and Ice join up, light it, stand on their burners 
	and blast straight for the sun.
	
	
	MAVERICK'S F-14 
	
	Without warning, a triple roll, as the elation hits him.
	
	
	125.  INT. MAVERICK'S COCKPIT 
	
			FUNGUS
	What is it? What's wrong?
	
	
	Fungus nervously looks around at his circuit breakers.
	
			FUNGUS
	Is there something I should know?
	
			MAVERICK
	Just relax.
	
			FUNGUS
	Is it the plane?
	
			MAVERICK
	The plane is fine.
	
			FUNGUS
	Is it you?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We 
	did it...Damn! We sure did it!
	
			MAVERICK
	HELLO MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK. 
	I'VE GOT A MESSAGE FOR STINGER. 
	
			STRIKE 
	(V.O.) 
	ROGER, MAVERICK. GO AHEAD.
	
			MAVERICK
	TELL STINGER MAVERICK HAS GOOD NEWS 
	AND SOME BAD NEWS. THE GOOD NEWS IS 
	THAT ICE GOT A MIG. THE BAD NEWS IS 
	THAT MAVERICK GOT TWO!
	
	He looks over at Ice.  
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOTTA HAVE ONE.
	
	
	126.  INT. ICE'S COCKPIT
	
			SLIDER
	We're low on fuel, Ice.
	
	Ice considers for a moment, then responds.
	
			ICE
	I know. I know....Aw hell, let's do 
	it!
	
	
	127.  INT. MAVERICK'S COCKPIT
	
			FUNGUS
	You're not supposed to...
	
			MAVERICK
	But I have to!
	
			FUNGUS
	Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right 
	behind you.
	
			MAVERICK
	MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST 
	A FLYBY.
	
	
	128.  PRI-FLY BRIDGE - (Primary Flight Control)  USS KITTY 
	HAWK
	
	The Air Boss speaks to Maverick over the UHF. The Admiral, 
	the XO and other officers watch and listen.
	
			AIR BOSS
	NEGATIVE, GHOST RIDER, THE 
	PATTERN'S FULL.
	
			MAVERICK (V.O. filtered)
	MUSTANG, THIS IS GHOST RIDER. 
	REQUEST A FLYBY FOR TWO.
	
			OFFICER
	Who is that guy?
	
	
			ADMIRAL
	Mitchell...
	
			XO
	   (surpressing a grin)
	...Likes to break at 600, 'stead of 
	300 knots. The Air Boss hates him. 
	One time, he came over the deck at 
	two hundred, shakes the shit out of 
	the bridge. Lifted Johnson right 
	off his feet.
	
	
	129.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
	He glances over at Ice, who gives him thumbs up.
	
			MAVERICK
	BOSS, YOU BETTER CLEAR IT OUT,
		WE'RE FIVE MINUTES OUT
		AND WE'RE DOING IT!
	
	
	130.  INT. PRI-FLY BRIDGE
	
	The Admiral looks out over the water and smiles.
	
			MAVERICK (V.O. filtered)
	TEN MILES ASTERN, BOSS. HOW ABOUT 
	IT?
	
	
	The Air Boss is livid. He clenches the mike.
	
			AIR BOSS
	MUSTANG TO GHOST RIDER!...
	
	Just then the Admiral pipes up.
	
			ADMIRAL
	Johnson!
	
			AIR BOSS
	Yes, Sir, Admiral?
	
			ADMIRAL
	Give him his flyby.
	
	
	The Admiral looks at the others, tries to surpress his own 
	grin. He slides into his (borrowed) command chair, looks into 
	the wind. On the back of the chair, a clue; his name and 
	rank:  RADM. Buford Clancy, "BOOMER"
	
	The AIR BOSS burns, but has no choice. 
	
			AIR BOSS
	    (really pissed off)
	 ROGER, GHOST RIDER, YOU'RE CLEAR.
	
	131.  EXT. 
	KITTY HAWK DAY
	
	Sailors line the deck and search the sky. They crane their 
	necks from their battle stations, sweating into the sun, 
	watching for the approach of F-14's. Someone sees it--he 
	points and SHOUTS. The F-14 appears, and every man stands and 
	CHEERS.
	
	
	132. POV -
	
	WE COME SCREAMING IN, 5 FEET OVER THE WATER, throwing up 
	rooster tails behind. WE SPLIT OFF and ZOOM along each side 
	of the carrier, at 100 feet and ROLL IT.
	
	
	133.  INT. PRI-FLY BRIDGE--VVVAAAAABBOOOOM!
	
	It lifts the Air Boss right off his feet. The walls warp, 
	dust sifts from the overhead. The whole tower just goes BOOM!
	
			AIR BOSS
	Goddamn that guy!"
	
	
	134.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
	
	They break at 500 knots. Ice is first down over the ramp, 
	waved in.  The F-14 comes in a little rocky. It bounces hard 
	but grabs the wire, then jerks to a sudden halt. The sailors 
	CHEER AND APPLAUD, throwing fists of victory into the air, 
	straining to get a look at Ice as the crew directs his plane 
	off to the side. Opening the canopy, Ice and Slider unstrap. 
	Stinger and the others are there. Guys are climbing up, 
	climbing all over the airplane. They're already painting a 
	MiG on the side, and they're looking at Ice in awe.
	
	
	135.  POV - MAVERICK - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - AS HE LANDS
	
	He catches the wire, the view slams down toward the deck as 
	the plane arrests, then comes up...He releases the cockpit 
	and can hear the ROAR OF THE CROWD...
	
	
	136.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
	
	He swings the nose around past Ice's. Ice's plane is covered 
	in colored jerseys as the ground crew pulls him out. 
	Maverick's plane swings towards the PRI-FLY BRIDGE. Pilots in 
	flightsuits pour from the deck hatch APPLAUDING... 
	
	
	137.  HE CUTS HIS ENGINES AS THE GROUND CREW SWARMS
	
	As Maverick and Fungus climb down, they see their wingmen on 
	the deck. Ice is looking in Maverick's direction. His face is 
	inscrutable. Maverick gets mobbed, but pushes over to Ice. 
	They stare at each other for a moment, eye to eye even as 
	they are buffeted by the crowd. Finally, Ice breaks...a grin.
	
	
			ICE
	I guess I owe you one.
	
			MAVERICK
	You don't owe me anything.
		We're on the same team. 
	
			ICE
	You saved our lives. You did it! 
	
			MAVERICK
	We did it.
	
			ICE
	You're a hell of a flyer.
		    (he can't resist)
		You can be my wingman any time.
	
			MAVERICK
	    (laughs)
	No. You can be mine!
	
	Now Ice laughs. Nobody's ever gonna win on this one. But Ice 
	smiles at him...It's now a running joke between them.
	
			ICE
	Whatever you say, Commander.
	
	
	He and Slider snap to and proudly salute. Maverick 
	hesitates, then returns it. As Ice and Slider snap it off, it 
	turns into the pilot's salute, they give them the bird. 
	Maverick and Fungus laugh and return the compliment. 
	
	As they are mobbed by sailors, Maverick is elated to see two 
	familiar figures: Hollywood and Wolfman turn from their 
	battle damaged TOMCAT on the forward elevator as it sinks out 
	of sight below decks.
	
	
	138.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
	
			FUNGUS
	What happened to you?
	
			WOLFMAN
	He got our radio, and an engine. We 
	were lucky to make it back.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Not luck. Skill.
	
	
	ANOTHER ANGLE
	
	Stinger rushes up, grabs Ice and Maverick in a bear hug.
	
			STINGER
	MiG killers! You name it, boy. 
	Sky's the limit. You name it. A 
	medal. Anything you want. Anything.
	
	
			ICE
	MiG killers!  What else is there?
	
	Maverick grins, turns away from them.  He he looks out, at 
	the dying sun glinting over the sea. He thinks how beautiful 
	it is out here! Fungus grabs him from behind.
	
			FUNGUS
	You hear that? Anything we want. 
	Anything...Well???
	
			MAVERICK
	Well what?
	
			FUNGUS
	What do you want?
	
			MAVERICK
	What do I want?
	
			FUNGUS
	What do you want?
	
			MAVERICK
	     (he thinks.)
	Any more MiGs?
	
	Stinger shakes his head no.
	
			STINGER
	They don't seem to want to come up 
	anymore. There's nothing on the 
	scopes. In fact, everybody's 
	denying the incident ever happened. 
	So...what is it?  What do you want?
	
	
	Maverick turns away, considering the options.
	
	
	139.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK - ANOTHER ANGLE
	
	Another Tomcat rolls up to park nearby. He looks 
	at the plane. Over the deck LOUDSPEAKER, comes the 
	final call to the F-14:
	
			LSO (V.O. filtered)
	    (a touch of sarcasm)
	OKAY, GENTLEMEN. YOU CAN CUT YOUR 
	ENGINES...YOU HAVE ARRIVED....
	
	
	WWHHHEEEEZZZZEEERRRRRUUUUUMMMMMMMMM...
	
	AS THE ENGINES FADE, SO DOES THE PICTURE.
	
	
	FADE IN - WEEKS LATER
	
	140.  EXT. DAY - FLIGHT LINE MIRAMAR - TOPGUN
	
	Viper, Jester and others walk out of hangar to watch a wing 
	return.
	
	
	141A.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY
	
	THEIR POV. Suddenly an F-14 breaks, ROARS in over the field 
	inverted, a hundred feet off the ground.
	
	
	142.  FLIGHT LINE MIRAMAR - DAY
	
			JESTER
	Who's the hell is that?
	
			VIPER
	Three guesses.
	
			JESTER
	Well, he's in trouble and he didn't 
	even get here yet.
	
	
	Jester looks over at an admiral, who steps out of a staff 
	car, squints up at the swooping plane, turns, barks an order 
	to his driver, jumps in the car and SLAMS the door, the car 
	takes off.
	
	
	143.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - FURTHER DOWN THE RUNWAY
	
	MP jeeps - lights flashing, pull out and head for the flight 
	line.
	
			VIPER
	Come on.
	
	They head for the hangar
	
	
	144.  OVER THE END OF THE RUNWAY
	
	The jet breaks at 500 knots and sets down neatly on the 
	tarmac. The rest of his flight follows in perfect formation.
	
	
	145.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - MAVERICK'S JET -PULLING UP
	
	He unbuckles his straps, takes his helmet off. He looks over 
	at the approaching caravan.
	
			FUNGUS
	I think they know we're here.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Let me do the talking.
	
			FUNGUS
	Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do 
	the talking! 
	
	He stands up in the cockpit, gives a snappy salute.
	
			FUNGUS
	Why Admiral....How really good it 
	is to see you!
	
	
	Maverick turns away. As he backs down the steps, a jeep 
	screeches up, doors slam open, footsteps.
	
			A VOICE
	Who's in charge here?
	
			MAVERICK
	I am.
	
	He's answered automatically, but now it hits him. He knows 
	the voice. He turns.
	
	HIS POV - CHARLIE, HANDS ON HIPS
	
			CHARLIE
	Not for long, you keep that up.
	
	He hops down, stands there speechless, grinning happily at 
	her.
	
			CHARLIE
	Well?
	
			MAVERICK
	Well what?
	
			CHARLIE
	You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, 
	you got your MiGs....You're our new 
	Top Gun instructor...Now what?
	
			MAVERICK
	Oh...I'll think of something... 
	What are you doing here?
	
			CHARLIE
	I live here, remember?
	
			MAVERICK
	Right on the flight line?
	
	He's got her on that one. She laughs.
	
			CHARLIE
	Everybody's got to be somewhere.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Maybe your somewhere's with me...
	
	He puts his arms around her. Self-conscious, she pulls away, 
	a little embarrassed to show this on the flight line. He 
	laughs.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's okay. I always look forward 
	to a challenge. 
	
	
	Now she laughs back and puts her arms around him. She kisses 
	him and now she doesn't give a damn who sees it.

______________________________________________________________________________


                                "TOTAL RECALL"

        FADE IN:

1       EXT. DESERT - DAY

        All we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame-orange
        sky...almost like the sky from the burning of Atlanta in
        "Gone with the Wind".

        SUPERIMPOSE:  Presenter credit.

        PAN DOWN lower and lower until we see the terrain below...
        the desert.  There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and
        odd-shaped rock formations.  The air is filled with red dust,
        which alternately obscures and then reveals the image.
        CAMERA MOVES FORWARD optically - enlarging the film grain in
        the process.

        SLOW DISOLVE

        OPENING CREDITS BEGIN.

        ANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre
        rocks.  Dust.  Sound of wind.  CAMERA MOVES FORWARD again.
        DISSOLVE.

        ANOTHER LANDSCAPE, but this time, in the distance are some
        enormous plastic domes.  Sunlight striking them and reflect-
        ing causes brilliant rainbows.  CAMERA optically tracks
        toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion
        through the red dust.  DISSOLVE...

        ANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the
        arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.  (It is
        reminiscent of the Egyptian sphinx, but both body and face,
        though gargoyle-like, are different in design.)  There are
        some large pyramids not far from the sphinx.  CAMERA MOVES
        optically FORWARD.  DISSOLVE.

        CAMERA is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front.
        It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move)
        towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems.

        As CAMERA APPROACHES one of the eyes, it appears to be
        stained red glass, as in a temple.  Suddenly there is a
        terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of
        fragments which hurtle toward the camera...


2       INT. CATACOMB BELOW "SPHINX" - DAY

        A MAN wearing a LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL SUIT is RUNNING THROUGH
        THIS LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES under him,
        as if in an earthquake.  We cannot clearly make out his face,
        especially since he wears some kind of BREATHING APPARATUS
        over a portion of it.

        The surface of the tunnel's "walls" is curious;  the walls
        are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two
        different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material
        and red quartz, which glistens like crystal.

        The man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear-
        fully, as he runs.  His HANDS are SPLATTERED with BLOOD.
        Because of this, the RED GLOW, the air of FEAR to the man,
        and the GROUND HEAVING and BUCKLING, there is almost a
        SATANIC suggestion to the scene.

        Suddenly, up AHEAD of the man, there appears a BRILLIANT
        WHITE LIGHT.  He SEES IT, and runs even faster towards it.

        We are ALMOST UP TO THE LIGHT, and we SEE HANDS REACHING
        OUT OF THE LIGHT TOWARDS US... that seem to beckon him to
        SAFETY.

        ABRUPTLY, the ENTIRE SCREEN GOES RED, BUT IN REVERSE NEGATIVE;
        with YELLOW LAYOVERS.  (So that all the images we see --
        ENTIRE FRAME -- are small YELLOW AREAS diffused on a RED
        BACKGROUND.)  It is much like looking at a tableau made out
        of molten lava.

        SUPERIMPOSE MAIN TITLE:

                                TOTAL RECALL

3       INT. BEDROOM IN SMALL APARTMENT - MORNING

        DOUGLAS QUAIL and his wife KRISTEN, are asleep in bed.

        Gradually the room lights BRIGHTEN.  The CLOCK CHIMES and
        begins SPEAKING in a soft, feminine voice.

                                 CLOCK
                           (sweetly)
                   Tick, tock, seven o'clock.  Time
                   to rise and open your eyes.

        They don't budge.  Shortly, the clock CHIMES again.

                                 CLOCK
                           (continuing)
                   Tick, tock, seven-oh-one.  Time
                   to get up, the day had begun.

        Quail's wife stirs.  Maddeningly, the clock CHIMES a third
        time.

                                 CLOCK
                           (continuing)
                   Tick, tock --

        Quail reaches out and shuts the clock off.  Then he sits up
        in bed.

        He swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the
        edge of the bed.  He puts on his glasses and sits, lost  in
        thought.

        He is a good-looking but conventional man in his early
        thirties.  He seems rather in awe of his wife, who is
        attractive and rather off-hand towards him.

        Kirsten pulls on her robe, lights a cigarette, sits fishing
        for her slippers.

                                 QUAIL
                   I dreamed about Mars again... it
                   was bizarre, yet is was so real...

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (casual)
                   It's your time of the month again.

        Quail looks at her quizzically.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing;
                            world-weary air)
                   At least once a month.  Douglas
                   Quail's obsession.  For twelve
                   years you've been talking about
                   Mars.

                                 QUAIL
                   People do go to Mars, you know.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   That's right, Douglas.  But not
                   you.  Not us.

        Quail looks crestfallen.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing;
                            disdainful)
                   As it is, we can barely scrape by
                   on your lousy ten thousand a week.

        She leaves the room.  He meditates on what she said,
        depressed.


4       INT. KITCHENETTE - MORNING

        Quail and Kirsten sit at a small table, eating breakfast.
        On the WALL is projected the front page of a NEWSPAPER.

        Drinking his coffee, Quail studies the wall with the air
        of a man who had his "node stuck in a newspaper," ignoring
        his wife.

        The newspaper headline reads:  "RIOTING ON MARS OVER WATER
        TAX."

        His wife is reading a different article:  "Four Women Rape
        Man in Park."

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (mumbling)
                   What do they expect ... the
                   way men dress these days ...
                   then they scream rape.

        Quail is absorbed in his own paper and doesn't hear her.

                                 QUAIL
                   You know -- let's really do it.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Rape men in the park?

                                 QUAIL
                   No.  Go to Mars.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (withering)
                   Go to hell.

                                 QUAIL
                   We can pool our savings and
                   I've got some sick leave
                   coming, besides my regular
                   vacation...

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (interrupting;
                            corrects herself)
                   ...more of a half-wit.  For
                   a start a war could break out
                   there any day ...

        She gestures toward the TV screen where Martian police
        are keeping protesters behind a barrier.  Some have signs
        reading "A FREE MARS", "DOWN WITH COHAAGEN", "EARTH - OUT"
        etc.

                                 QUAIL
                   That's just media talk.  They're...
                           (indicating
                            the protesters)
                   ...just a minority.  They're
                   powerless.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Well, there's a lot of things
                   we need around here before
                   we waste our money on a trip
                   to Mars.  We're broke.  I'm
                   just a slave around this dump.
                   Now if you were capable of
                   finding a better job....

        The kitchen clock chimes and talks.

                                 CLOCK
                   It's now eight.  You'll be
                   late!

                                 QUAIL
                   I'll be late!

        He jumps up quickly from the table, picks up his coat and
        briefcase, kisses KIRSTEN's perfunctorily offered cheek
        and leaves.


4A      EXT. CITY - EARLY MORNING

        CAMERA TRACKS with Quail as he walks along the busy modern
        street towards a subway station.  Modern cars (out of focus)
        pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail.  There is a
        plaintive tune being played on violin.  Quail pauses and
        gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on
        briskly.


5       INT. SUBWAY STATION - EARLY MORNING

        Quail enters the station.  Everybody must pass through a
        weapons check before proceeding to the platforms.

        TWO ARMED GUARDS stand at either side, as commuters pass
        through an electronic beam.  On a screen, the entire body
        of each person is seen in X-ray.  All of them are clearly
        carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket.

                                 GUARD
                   No weapon again, Mr. Quail?

                                 QUAIL
                   I keep forgetting, Herb.  They
                   frighten me.

                                 GUARD
                   Yeah?  Well, it's the law,
                   Mr. Quail.  Has been since
                   1990 they tell me.  Tomorrow -
                   ya carry ya gun or ya get
                   reported.

        GUARD gestures to his associate.  They've obviously been
        through this with Quail before.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay.  Herb, okay.

        Quail walks on to the track area.  The train arrives.
        Signs above each approaching car say "CAR FULL", "ROOM
        FOR 10 PERSONS", etc.  Quail goes to a carriage marked
        "NEW CAR".


6       INT. URBAN TRANSIT TRAIN - DAY

        The doors open and the crowd surges on.  Quail grabs a
        seat.  At intervals throughout the car are VIDEO MONITORS
        on which a NEWS BROADCAST is showing.

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                   -- more violence today from Mars's
                   strike-torn ore colonies --

        Everyone ignores the broadcast -- except Quail, who perks
        instantly at the word "Mars."

        The NEWSCASTER is a young black man.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                           (continuing)
                   ...but Earth Intelligence Operations
                   Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly
                   worried about the damage to Mars's
                   all important tourist
                   industry was today dismissive
                   of the dissident groups....

        TV scene switches to a press conference.  COHAAGEN, sur-
        rounded by AIDES, steps in front of a podium packed with
        news network microphones and cameras.  Cohaagen is a
        striking, intense man with an obvious air of power.

                                 COHAAGEN
                  We're dealing with a bunch of
                  extremists and unrepresentative
                  lunatics.  Mars is a happy and
                  prosperous protectorate of Earth...
                  and will remain so.

        The train stops at another station and more people pile on.
        Quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies
        passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the
        image.

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                   There have been some criticisms,
                   sir....

                                 COHAAGEN
                   I have no further comment.

        The news conference ends and a bright looking young man
        comes on the screen.  Quail continues to watch, though
        not as interested, initially, as he was by the Mars story.
        Few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                   Good morning, commuters.  This
                   portion of your trip is brought
                   to you by Rekall, Inc.  Do you
                   have a dream that never came
                   true?  Do you aspire - but
                   only perspire?  Has the great
                   adventure passed you by?  Then
                   come to... REKALL, where what
                   might have been will have been.
                   For the memories of a
                   lifetime... REKALL.

        Quail watches the commercial through to the end, but doesn't
        seem to take it very seriously.  He glances away as a card
        comes on the screen with REKALL's numbers.


6B      INT. QUAIL'S OFFICE - DAY

        Quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive
        of a room.  Numerous people are typing information onto
        the screens.  Quail pauses in his typing, thoughtful.  He
        then types in a little more information, then pauses again.
        On the screen, a sentence types itself...

        WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED?  REQUEST MORE INFORMATION.

        Quail read it and continues.


9       INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - REKALL - DAY

        Scene opens on a CU of McCLANE, a genial, bubbling, enthus-
        iastic man.

                                 McCLANE
                   We're all dreamers, Douglas.
                   But here at Rekall, dreams
                   are our business.

        He presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which
        they are seated appear to be in outer space.  Countless
        stars glitter all around.  Startlingly, a comet whizzes by.
        Quail is amazed.  McClane grins and presses the button
        again.  The scene changes to a beautiful underwater coral
        reef.  Multi-colored fish swim around the chairs and desk.

                                 QUAIL
                   But... is the process really
                   that effective?  A false
                   memory!?

                                 McCLANE
                           (shaking his head;
                            smiling)
                   We prefer the term "extra-
                   factual implant".  Your
                   memory will be complete in
                   every way.  You will have
                   gone to Mars.  We guarantee
                   that.

                                 QUAIL
                   Is it in any way dangerous?
                   I mean, the medical techniques?

                                 McCLANE
                   Not when you deal with
                   qualified operators - like
                   us.

        He presses the button again and the normal office returns.
        Quail looks around, impressed.

                                 QUAIL
                   It's just - incredible.

                                 McCLANE
                   And look at our follow-up
                   program!

        He puts items on the desk as he talks.

                                 McCLANE
                           (continuing)
                   Space-flight ticket stub...
                   passport... vaccination
                   certificates... matchbooks
                   from Martian Nouvelle Cuisine
                   Restaurants, souvenirs, post
                   cards... even names of people
                   you met - now back there -
                   who you can call and discuss
                   your trip with... by the way,
                   we plant these things where
                   you'll come across them at
                   random in the future.

                                 QUAIL
                   But... I'll know I hired you.
                   That'll destroy the whole
                   illusion.

                                 McCLANE
                           (smiling; self-
                            satisfied)
                   But you won't remember me, or
                   having been here.

                                 QUAIL
                   I won't?

                                 McCLANE
                   Your money back if you do!
                   We've never paid out yet.

        Quail slumps backs in his chair, overwhelmed.

                                 McCLANE
                           (continuing)
                   And we have a special this
                   month, for only two-hundred
                   thousand dollars more.

        At the press of a button, a list appears on the wall...

        A14  MILLIONAIRE PLAYBOY
        A15  SPORTS HERO
        A16  INDUSTRIAL TYCOON
        A17  INTELLIGENCE AGENT

                                 McCLANE
                           (continuing)
                   You can have a new identity
                   for the duration of the trip.
                   Pick one.

        Quail's eyes linger on "Intelligence Agent."

                                 QUAIL
                   "Intelligence Agent"... wouldn't
                   that be dangerous?  I might
                   attack....

                                 McCLANE
                           (airily)
                   No.  No.  You're a retired
                   agent.  Mars was your last
                   mission and you're never to
                   break your cover.  But you'll
                   have got the girl, killed the
                   baddies, and saved the
                   Universe.  Not bad, eh?

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't know... about the
                   whole thing... it's all such
                   a fake.  I won't really have
                   gone.  I won't really....

                                 McCLANE
                           (kind but firm)
                   Let's face it, Douglas, you,
                   and millions of people like
                   you have no chance of ever
                   getting to Mars and you'd
                   never qualify as a secret
                   agent for EIO.  This - REKALL
                   - is the only way to achieve
                   your dream.

        He gets up and walks around to Quail's chair.

                                 McCLANE
                           (continuing)
                   Think about it, Douglas.
                   Think, too, what a terrible
                   boor a real holiday is.
                   Lost tickets, endless arguments,
                   lousy hotels, missed connections,
                   rotten weather... Rekall will
                   supply you with perfect, happy
                   memories.

        Quail is thoughtful, willing to be totally convinced.


9A      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Quail is sitting, distracted, in an uncomfortable modern
        chair.  Kirsten is watching a near-pornographic film on
        TV.  She casually lights a cigarette.

                                 QUAIL
                   You know that's illegal.

                                KIRSTEN
                   Yeah?  Who's going to report
                   me?  You?... wimp....

        She watches a torrid love scene on the video.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   Screwing around's illegal,
                   too.  But just give me half
                   a chance...

        Quail looks at her with distaste.  His expression changes
        to one of resolve.


10      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY

        Quail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch, alongside
        some strange-looking lab equipment, wearing a hospital-type
        smock.  In the b.g. hovers a TECHNICIAN, adjusting some
        instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc.) -- that
        apparently relates to the lab equipment next to Quail.  The
        room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting.

        Quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the
        instrumentation next to him -- as one always does at the
        dentist's, looking at the drills.

        The door opens abruptly, in walks a cute-looking LITTLE
        OLD LADY, wearing a JOGGING SUIT.  (A RUTH GORDON-TYPE.)

                                 OLD LADY
                   Hi, I'm Doctor Sophie Lull.
                   Sorry I'm late.
                           (walks toward
                            coat closet)
                   I'll be right with you.

        She dons a white medical smock that covers her jogging
        suit, then slings on heavy, lead-lined protective vest.

                                 QUAIL
                           (looking at
                            instrument
                            console)
                   This really going to work?

                                 LULL
                   It the Pope Martian?

        Lull's assistant, the TECHNICIAN in b.g., who had been
        steadily working on the instrumentation, now looks over
        at Lull.

                                 ERNIE (TECHNICIAN)
                           (at machine)
                   Okay -- that's it.

        Now, Lull extends a long rubber tube, a hypodermic needle
        attached to it.  Quail eyes it warily.  She swabs the back
        of his hand in preparation, notices his apprehension.

                                 LULL
                   Now, just relax, kid.  This
                   ain't gonna hurt.  Just a
                   controlled drip of Narkadine.
                   When you're under, I'll just
                   ask ya a few questions, nothin'
                   real personal, just full
                   details of yer private life
                   so's we can tailor the
                   wish-fulfillment program to
                   your needs.

        She injects the needle into his hand as she speaks, tapes
        it down.

                                 LULL
                           (continuing)
                   See?  Painless.  I didn't feel
                   a thing.  Hey, you're a nice
                   kid... you like a little
                   somethin' extra?

        Quail, embarrassed, starting to go under, nods.

                                 LULL
                           (continuing;
                            pleased)
                   Good!  Kid -- have I got a
                   girl for you!  She's gonna
                   like you.  You're good-lookin'.
                           (beat)
                   Gettin' sleepy?
                           (he nods)
                   Good.  Now, what's the first
                   thing you think of when you're
                   thinkin' about Mars?

                                 QUAIL
                           (wistfully)
                   Well... I'd like to see the
                   Martian Sphinx...

                                 LULL
                   Okay -- you will, Dougle!  I
                   want ya to start counting
                   backwards from a hundred for
                   me.

                                QUAIL
                           (sleepily)
                   One hundred... ninety-nine...
                   ninety-eight... ninety-seven...
                   ninety-six... ninety-five....

        His voice drops off; his eyes close.  Lull studies him,
        adjusts some instruments, then turns to Ernie, glancing
        briefly at a typed sheet in front of her.

                                 LULL
                   Okay, Ernie, the trip to Mars;
                   number sixty-two... and throw
                   in that blonde... We'll give
                   him a real good time.

                                ERNIE
                   Sixty-two... and... the blonde...

        He takes two discs and inserts the first one into a machine.

                                 ERNIE
                   Boy, is this one wild.  He
                   won't want to come back.

        Ernie inserts the second disk.

                                 LULL
                   Dougie?  This Sophie Lull.
                   Can ya hear me?

                                 QUAIL
                   ...Sophie....

                                 LULL
                   Good! ... I'm gonna ask ya
                   a few more questions now.  Ya
                   think you'll be able to
                   answer 'em?

                                 QUAIL
                   ...Yes....

                                 LULL
                   Attaboy!  To begin with, I
                   wanna ask ya; -- You sex
                   life.  How many orgasms a
                   week?


11      INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - DAY

        McClane has several file drawers open and is removing diverse
        objects and placing them on his desk.

        These items apparently are objects Rekall, Inc. intends
        to "plant" for some client of theirs to find (perhaps
        even Quail) -- as part of his fantasy.

        While he is putting these things on his desk, the PHONE
        BUZZES.  He answers it.

                                 McCLANE
                   Yes?

                                 LULL (V.O.)
                           (filtered;
                            tense)
                   Howie?  Listen, you'd better
                   get in here.

                                 McCLANE
                           (not too
                            concerned)
                   Not another schizoid embolism.

                                 LULL (V.O.)
                           (filtered)
                   You'd better get in here.


12      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY

        McClane come quickly in, brushing the swinging door open.

        Lull and Ernie look up as he enters.  Quail lies on the
        couch, breathing slowly and regularly, his eyes closed.
        McClane looks queryingly at Lull, who motions him to
        silence.

                                 LULL
                           (bends over
                            Quail)
                   Quail?  Dougie, can you hear me?

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes.

                                 LULL
                   Tell McClane what you told us.

        McClane glances sharply at Lull, then turns to Quail.

        Quail's eyes open and scan the room.  They settle on
        McClane.  These eyes have changed:  they have become
        cold and steely.  In fact, Quail's entire personality
        seems to have changed -- his face has acquired a flint-
        edged hardness.  He is chillingly menacing.

                                 QUAIL
                           (a deadly
                            voice)
                   All of you in this room are
                   dead.

                                 McCLANE
                           (not quite
                            taking it
                            seriously)
                   What's he talking about?

                                 QUAIL
                   You've broken my cover.

                                 McCLANE
                   What is this?...

        McClane's eyes flash angrily at Lull.

                                 LULL
                   The Narkadine cracked a memory
                   cap.  Mars --
                           (she's scared)
                   He's really been there.

        There is a chilly silence in the room as McClane digests
        this.

                                 McCLANE
                   Forced suppression?

                                 ERNIE
                   With spontaneous breakthrough.

                                 McCLANE
                   Holy shit.

        They stare at Quail as if he's a ticking bomb.

                                 QUAIL
                           (coldly)
                   You've compromised the Sphinx
                   Project.  You'll have to be
                   silenced.

        Now they're all panicked.

                                 McCLANE
                   Wait a minute.  Quail --

                                 QUAIL
                   My name isn't Quail.

                                 McCLANE
                   Listen... whoever you are...
                   sir....
                           (almost
                            pleading)
                   ...This is all an accident.
                   We'll destroy all the records.
                   No one will know.  I swear it.
                   Believe me.

                                 QUAIL
                   I believe you, but that won't
                   stop E.T.O. from killing you.

        The Rekall people stare at each other in quiet horror.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Killing you... killing you...
                   killing you....

        His voice trails off, his eyes close.

                                 LULL
                           (intensely)
                   He wants a false memory
                   implanted -- of a trip he
                   really took.
                           (pause)
                   Someone at Earth Intelligence
                   Operations erased his memory.
                   All he know was going to Mars
                   meant something special to
                   him.

                                 ERNIE
                   What do we do?  Graft a false
                   memory pattern over the real
                   memory of the same thing?

                                 LULL
                           (shaking her
                            head)
                  Uh-uh... That could promote
                  a partial breakthrough of
                  the real trip.

                                 McCLANE
                           (overlapping)
                   Revive him without any false
                   memory implantation and get
                   him out of here.

                                 LULL
                   Why don't we just wipe out
                   the memory of his visit
                   here?

                                 McCLANE
                           (nodding;
                            relieved)
                   Yes.  Good.  I'll destroy
                   his file and cancel his fee.
                   I have a feeling that the
                   longer he doesn't know who
                   he is, where he's been,
                   where he's going and who we
                   are, the better off we'll
                   all be.  I'm taking a holiday.
                   A real one.

        He leaves.  The others stare after him, looking very grim.


12A     INT. RECEPTION AREA OF REKALL - DAY

        A dazed and disoriented Douglas Quail comes out of an
        inner door and walks through the lobby towards the exit
        door.

        An attractive RECEPTIONIST, her bare breasts visible
        through a clear plastic blouse, watches him; she then
        looks toward McClane who has half-opened the door to view
        Quail's progress.


12B     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

        Quail travels down.  Uncomprehendingly, he looks out at
        the city.


12C     INT. BUILDING FOYER - DAY

        Quail stumbles through the fairly crowded foyer, oblivious
        to anything around him.  A red-headed man may or may not be
        watching him.  He makes a phone call from a pocket phone.


12D     INT. ROBOT TAXI CAB - AFTERNOON

        Scene open on Quail, in the back of the cab; he looks
        around, slowly coming to his senses.

                                 QUAIL
                   Where am I?

                                 DRIVER
                   Travelling south along Third
                   Avenue, passing Fourty-third
                   street.

        Although the driver's voice is a little mechanical (flat
        in tone) he is filmed from Quail's POV, and it isn't
        obvious he is anything other than an ordinary cab driver.

                                 QUAIL
                   Where am I going?

                                 DRIVER
                   Thirty-three thirteen "G"
                   Street, Sector "L", Twin
                   Towers, Apartment six-thirty-
                   five.

                                 QUAIL
                   How did I get here?

        Camera now cuts to a shot in front of the driver.  He is
        a fairly human-like robot.

                                 DRIVER
                   I don not understand the
                   question, sir or madam.

                                 QUAIL
                   How did I get into this cab?

                                 DRIVER
                   You stepped into it in the
                   normal manner, sir or madam.


15      INT. CORRIDOR OF QUAIL'S APARTMENT - DAY

        The reception area and hallway leading to the elevators is
        smart and clean, though not lavish.  A uniformed and armed
        DOORMAN is standing by the entrance door.

        Filmed from the elevator end of the area, we see the cab
        pull up and Quail alight and enter the building.  He nods
        to the doorman and approaches the elevators.  As he reaches
        them a MAN steps out from behind the camera.  A 2ND MAN
        enters from a door opposite the elevators.  Quail looks
        at them and becomes quite panicky.

                                 1ST AGENT
                   Aren't you the man from Mars?

        He takes a modern, lethal gun from his pocket.  Quail turns,
        but the other man is behind him.

                                 2ND AGENT
                   Don't give us a reason to
                   kill you.

        Quail looks toward the doorman, who is paying little
        attention to the events.  As the two men edge Quail towards
        the door, he call out...

                                 QUAIL
                   Mr. Zimmer...Mr. Zimmer...
                   help me... they're...

        But the doorman turns calmly away.


16      INT. BASEMENT CAR PARK - DAY

        The two men lead Quail past a number of cars to their own
        vehicle.

                                 QUAIL
                   Where are you taking me?

                                 1ST AGENT
                   You told everyone at Rekall
                   about you trip to Mars.
                   Where you went, who you worked
                   for, what you did --

                                 QUAIL
                   But I didn't... Are you telling
                   me... I did go to Mars?  I
                   don't remember?

                                 1ST AGENT
                   You've remembered too much.
                   The Sphinx Project, for a
                   start....

                                 QUAIL
                           (confused;
                            remembers only
                            fragments)
                   Sphinx?... No, no, I don't,
                   I... What about the people
                   at Rekall?  I don't recall
                   Rekall but you said if they
                   know what I did?  Why don't
                   you ask them?  They'll tell
                   you I didn't...

                                 1ST AGENT
                   They've been taken care of.

                                 QUAIL
                   What do you mean?

        Neither man bothers answering.  They arrive at their car
        and open the door for Quail.  He hesitates.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   What are you going to do with
                   me?

                                 1ST AGENT
                   Get in the car.

        He slaps Quail hard across the face.  Quail is terrified.
        He is tearful with fear.

                                 QUAIL
                   My God!  No!  You're going to
                   kill me!

        He cringes.  His hands across his face.

                                1ST AGENT
                   No one's going to kill you if
                   [you do what you're told.]
                   We're visiting E.I.O. for some
                   new tests.  Now get in, or do
                   we start playing rough?

                                 QUAIL
                   No!  It's not my fault!  You
                   can't do it!

        They start to force him into the car physically.

        Suddenly, Quail stops cringing.  the FEAR DISAPPEARS FROM
        HIS FACE, and is replaced by an odd, thoughtful expression.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Wait a minute, I remember --

                                1ST AGENT
                   What, Quail?  What do you
                   remember?

                                 QUAIL
                   On Mars... they tried to kill
                   me... And....

        QUAIL TRANSFORMS INTO A HIGHLY SKILLED KILLING MACHINE.

        In an instant, he karate-chops both agents across the
        windpipe, and they crumple to the ground.

        Quail steps back.  He stares at the two bodies, incredulous;
        then stares at his own deadly HANDS.  It is as though they
        belong to someone else.

        Then, leaving the two agents sprawled across the alley, he
        races back into the basement door of his building.


18      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - EVENING

        Kirsten is watching another pornographic video when Quail
        bursts in.  He is still disoriented.

                                 QUAIL
                   Did you know I've been to
                   Mars?

        Kirsten gets up and turns off the movie.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   What!  This stupid obsess...

                                 QUAIL
                           (interrupting)
                   I think I've been.  I vaguely
                   recall...

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Doug, you've got to forget...

                                 QUAIL
                           (interrupting)
                   Forget?  Remembering is the
                   problem I must've been
                   to one of those artificial
                   memory places...

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Oh my God...

                                 QUAIL
                   But something went wrong...
                   something about a real
                   memory... and then those
                   men...  tried to kill me.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   What men?  Doug, you're crazy.

        She starts to mix a drink from a well-stocked cabinet.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   You're here now.  They didn't
                   kill you.

                                 QUAIL
                   No.  That's what's so amazing.
                   I killed them.  I think...

        Kirsten stops pouring her drink and look at him sharply.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Where?  Where are they?

        Quail points down with his finger.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   Doug!  It's something they
                   put into your mind at the
                   memory place.  Fantasies.
                   That's their business.

        She sips her drink.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   You're a computer operator.
                   You're a bore.  You're a
                   wimp.  You're not a killer.

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm involved somehow with
                   E.I.O.  It's true.  It's no
                   fantasy.

        He walks around the apartment drawing curtains and putting
        out the lights.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Doug, I want you to see a
                   doctor.  Now Alec and Shirley
                   Turnbull have a good man.  He
                   helped Alec through his
                   breakdown.

                                 QUAIL
                   For fuck's sake, this is no
                   breakdown!

        Kirsten is taken aback at his use of language.  He strides
        into the bathroom and slams the door.  She turns on one
        lamp, goes to a telephone and dials.


19      INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT

        Quail takes a washcloth, turns the hot water up full and
        soaks the cloth under the steaming water.  Using it as a
        compress, he presses it against his face and his neck, to
        drain off some of the tension.

        He turns off the water.  Towelling his head dry, he opens
        the bathroom door.

        The instant he does this, a blinding white BURST OF LIGHT
        comes arcing into the bathroom, and the back wall crinkles
        and CHARS into a swatch of blackness.

        QUAIL DIVES OUT THE DOOR, just as ANOTHER BOLT incinerates
        the spot where he was standing.


20      INT. LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT

        THE ROOM IS IN TOTAL DARKNESS.  The only thing visible is
        the pale rectangle of the balcony window, with the curtains
        drawn over it.

        QUAIL and his ASSAILANT cannot be seen -- but they can be
        HEARD.  There is the sound of a SCUFFLE -- the meaty THUD
        of a FIST CONNECTING WITH FLESH -- and a painful GRUNT as
        someone's breath whooshes out.

        The LIGHT COMES ON.  Quail is standing with one hand on the
        lamp, and the other twisting KIRSTEN's arm up behind her
        back.  A pistol lies on the floor.  Quail is totally stunned.
        He releases her arm, shoving her away from him, at the same
        time scooping up the pistol.

                                 QUAIL
                   My God!  Did you say I need a
                   psychiatrist?

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (coolly)
                   I haven't seen you move that
                   fast since I've known you.

                                 QUAIL
                           (outraged)
                   How could you do it?  After
                   eight years!

                                 KIRSTEN
                   I'm not your wife, Quail.

                                 QUAIL
                   Not my wife!  You are out of
                   your mind.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (indifferent;
                            nursing her
                            arm)
                   It's a false memory implant.
                   I never saw you before six
                   weeks ago.

        Quail is totally disoriented.

                                 QUAIL
                   Why are you lying like this?

                                 KIRSTEN
                   No, Quail.  It's true.  You
                   work for E.I.O.  So do I.

        As she speaks, she walks to a picture on the wall and from
        behind it pulls out a small wallet.  She flips it open to
        show him her E.I.O. badge.  He looks down uncomprehendingly
        at the holographic lettering "Earth Intelligence Organisation".

                                 QUAIL
                           (indicating their
                            surroundings)
                   But why all of this?

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (shrugging)
                   We had to watchdog you...make
                   sure the erasure took.  A wife
                   seemed like a good idea.

                                 QUAIL
                   But I remember it!  All of
                   it!... Us!

                                 KIRSTEN
                   All implanted.

                                 QUAIL
                   Our friends... my work...
                   eight years.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   The job's real -- you've had
                   is six weeks -- since you got
                   back from Mars.

        He sits down, holds his hand to his head.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   It's all a fabrication, Quail.
                   Everything you know.

                                 QUAIL
                   This is crazy!  If all my
                   memories are false, who am
                   I?  What am I?  Jesus... it's
                   like I don't exist.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   You exist, all right.
                           (very cold)
                   That's the problem.

        A pause as Quail mentally gropes frantically, for what to
        do next.

                                 QUAIL
                   Why did you try to kill me?
                   Why does E.I.O. want me dead?

                                 KIRSTEN
                   They don't particularly.  That
                   was my idea.  This assignment was
                   boring me to death.  The
                   personality they gave you
                   wasn't too thrilling.

                                 QUAIL
                   Well, what did I do on Mars
                   that they have to keep me from
                   telling?

                                 KIRSTEN
                   I've no idea.  I just work
                   here.

                                 QUAIL
                   All right... I'm leaving.
                   Don't try and follow me --

                                 KIRSTEN
                   I don't have to follow you.
                   You can't get away from E.I.O.
                   Nobody does.

        Quail looks at her as if seeing her for the first time.

                                 QUAIL
                   No wonder you got the role as
                   my bitchy wife -- type casting.

        He leaves.  Kirsten smiles secretively.  She goes to a
        drawer, opens it and removes a tiny instrument that looks
        like a TV channel-changer.  There is a very small light
        on the instrument, which begins flashing on and off, as
        the instrument  begins to make BEEPING SOUNDS.


21      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Quail walks briskly out onto the street, controlling his
        paces, trying not to look suspicious.  After a beat, he
        heads for the nearest subway entrance.


22      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

        Now underground, Quail tries to blend in with the other
        subway people.  He heads toward the weapons check.


23      EXT. STREET SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        An OFFICIAL VEHICLE slams to a halt next to the subway
        entrance and a whole load of INTENSE MEN pours out of it.


24      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

        Quail now shuffles along in a lineup of people waiting
        to get through the WEAPONS CHECK.  He tries to control
        his nervousness.  He passes.  The guard smiles at him,
        pleased to see he has remembered his gun.


25      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

        All the men with guns drawn come pouring down the subway
        stairs.  The SUBWAY COPS and WEAPONS CHECK are stunned to
        see four large men brandishing guns push their way through
        the weapons check gate without seeming to notice them.  One
        gunman flashes a HOLOGRAPHIC BADGE ENCASED IN PLASTIC at
        them.

        The gunman reach the bottom of the stairs and race closer
        to the subway train, which is just departing.  The men
        halt abruptly.

                                 FIRST GUNMAN
                   Fuck it!

        The second gunman adjusts a small plug - a radio receiver -
        in his ear.

                                 SECOND GUNMAN (EARPLUG WEARER)
                   We won't be able to track him
                   again until he comes up above
                   ground!


26      INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

        Quail sits in the subway car as it barrels through the
        night, not knowing exactly where he will go.  He is
        confused, distraught.  A commercial comes onto the video.

                                 TV AS VOICE OVER
                   Tired?  Exhausted?  Need a

                   memories, experience the real
                   thing.  Daily departures on the
                   space shuttle to Mars.  Visit
                   the wonders of....


27      EXT. SUBWAY STOP - NIGHT

        Quail emerges from underground and looks around.  The
        streets are almost deserted.


28      INT. MOVING OFFICAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        THE GUNMEN SIT IN THE OV.  The one with the ear plug
        [suddenly talks.]

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   Coming in again.  Loud and
                   clear.

        He looks down at an illuminated street map built into the
        car's dashboard.


28A     EXT. SUBWAY STOP - NIGHT

        A cab comes into view.  Quail quickly hails it and jumps
        in.  Cab moves off.


28B     INT. CAB - NIGHT

        Quail is still pondering what to do next.  He glances out
        one window, though not at anything in particular.  Suddenly,
        the silence is shattered as bullets rip through the window
        on the other side.  Quail ducks to the floor.


28C     EXT. CAB - NIGHT

        A wide shot shows that the cab is being fired on by a man
        leaning from the window of an official patrol vehicle.  He
        is aiming at the tires and driver, rather than directly at
        Quail.


28D     INT. CAB - NIGHT

        Bullets are still pouring in.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                           (unemotionally)
                   You are being fired on, sir
                   or madam, please leave the
                   cab at once.

        From the floor, Quail pushes the door handle and rolls
        out onto the street.  The pursuing car occupants fail to
        notice his exit.


28E     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        Cars continue, as Quail picks himself up from the gutter
        and moves off down a narrow side street.


28F     INT. CAB - NIGHT

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                   [Please....]

        Bullets rip into the robot driver's neck, severing the
        head from the body.  The head hits the window then bounces
        back onto the front seat.  It continues talking.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                           (continuing)
                   ...leave the cab as bullets
                   are hitting the vehicle in
                   considerable quantities.


28G     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        The taxi mounts the footpath and smashes through the display
        window of a store.  Clothes models are scattered and broken.
        When the noise abates, the severed head of the robot driver
        is lying among the dummies.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                   This company, sir or madam,
                   will institute legal action
                   for damages...


29      EXT. STREET - "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL - NIGHT

        Quail emerges from the side street and sees "End of the
        Line" Hotel.  It is clean, bland, middle class.  He quickly
        crosses the road and enters.


29A     INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

        The foyer is brightly lit and empty.  Quail approaches the
        DESK CLERK, who is reading a book.  "Dr. No", marked, in
        flowing script, "from the classic series".

                                 DESK CLERK
                           (without looking
                            up)
                   Help you, sir?

                                 QUAIL
                           (handing over
                            money)
                   A room for the night.

                                 DESK CLERK
                           (reluctantly
                            putting down
                            the book)
                   ID.

                                 QUAIL
                           (handing over
                            money)
                   Here's ten thousand.  Forget
                   the ID.

        DESK CLERK looks up at him, with interest.  His hand
        hovers over the money.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   I have a liaison with a
                   lady... and I'm married...

                                 DESK CLERK
                   I understand, sir.  Nothing
                   like a bit on the side, eh?
                   Bit of fugitive flesh.  The
                   greatest aphrodisiac is a new
                   body, wouldn't you say, sir?

        Quail looks at him with distaste but is only anxious to
        be given the key to his room.  He says nothing.


30      INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail unlocks the door and enters.  No sooner does he
        relock the door then THE PHONE RINGS.  He freezes, stares
        at it for three rings, then picks it up.

                                 QUAIL
                           (into receiver)
                   I told you, I don't want to
                   be disturbed.

                           (filtered)
                   If you want to live, don't
                   hand up.

        Quail is stunned.  He says nothing, but doesn't hang up.

                                 TELEPHONE VOICE
                           (continuing;
                            filtered)
                   They've got you bugged...
                   They're gonna find you.
                   Faster than you can say "Back
                   Rodgers".
                          (quickly)
                   And don't bother shaking down
                   your clothes -- the monitor
                   is embedded in your skull.

                                 QUAIL
                           (reeling)
                   Who are you?  What the hell
                   is this?


30A     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

        The man telephoning Quail is calling from a bar.  Occasion-
        ally people pass him on their way to the toilets.  He is
        youngish and conservatively dressed.  He speaks rapidly
        and urgently.

                                 TELEPHONE VOICE
                   Take a wet towel and wrap it
                   around your head.  That will

        Quail puts the phone down and rushes to the bathroom.


30B1    INT. PATROL CAR - NIGHT

        The earphone wearer and driver are moving in on the signal
        generated by Quail's bug.  Suddenly, the small illuminated
        cross on the dashboard map cuts out.

                                 EARPHONE WEARER
                   Shit!

                   It's gone!  Some...malfunction...

        Unscientifically, he prod the screen.

30B2    INT. QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail rushes back into the room with a wet towel,
        turban-like, wrapped around his head.  He rapidly picks
        up the phone.

                                 QUAIL

        The man on the phone looks around anxiously.

30E     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

        Scott Stevens hangs up the phone.  He looks around
        cautiously, then walks a few steps to the mens room.


30F     INT. MENS ROOM - NIGHT

        Scott Stevens walks to the row of troughs and begins to
        urinate.  The room is empty.  He hears a noise and looks
        around.  Two EIO men are standing there aiming lethal-looking
        high-velocity weapons at him.  One of them is the red-headed
        man we've already seen.

                                 1ST MAN (RED-HEADED)
                   Well, look at that.  He's
                   really got his hands full.

                                 2ND MAN
                   Not so full, so I've heard.

        Still urinating, the frustrated Scott Stevens can only look
        back over his shoulder.  Laughing, both men open fire,
        riddling him with bullets.  He collapses in an undignified
        heap, his head in the water at the base of the trough.


31      INT. "END OF THE LINE" CORRIDOR - NIGHT

        Quail, with towel around his head, glances up and down the
        corridor -- spots a sign that says "FIRE EXIT".  He races
        towards it.


32      EXT. "END OF THE LINE" FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        The OV slams up in front of the hotel and a carload of
        MEN tear out of it and barge into the hotel.


32A     INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

        The startled clerk jumps to his feet as the group of
        armed men enter rapidly.

                                 EARPHONE WEARER
                   Quick.  The guy who checked
                   in fifteen minutes ago.

                                 CLERK
                           (nervous)
                   Room...thirty-six.

        Most of the armed men instantly head off up the stairs,
        their weapons at the ready.  Clerk watches, astonished.

                                 CLERK
                           (continuing)
                   He was only meeting a lady...
                   Aren't you guys overdoing it
                   a bit?


32B     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

        Quail is walking along briskly, still with the towel
        around his head.  A few passers-by look at him curiously.
        He puts his hand together and greets them Indian-style.


33      EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON STREET SIGN

        which reads: "PARK AVENUE / 58TH STREET".

        PULL BACK to reveal "The Lucky Stub Pawnshop".  WINOS
        lurk on the corner.  Park Avenue has deteriorated into
        a slum.

        QUAIL ENTERS FRAME, and approaching the pawnshop, stepping
        over a BUM in a doorway.


34      INT. PAWNSHOP - NIGHT

        Quail is just entering; an old-fashioned BELL overhead,
        tripped by the door opening, announces his entrance.

        At once, an immense FAT MAN emerges from the back room.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                   You wanta camera?  I got some
                   good, top-quality ones.  You
                   want silk rugs?  Handmade last
                   century in Iran...all perfect.
                   You want videos?  Old movies...
                   classics...all those Vietnam
                   war ones...real quaint stuff...
                   you want...

                                 QUAIL
                           (interrupting;
                            awkwardly)
                   I'm Hotchkiss...I came for
                   the...Grecian candlesticks...

        The Fat Man studies him warily for a long moment; then
        he disappears through the curtain.

        In a brief moment, he emerges again, carrying a small,
        "makeup-sized" case, as well as two large candelabra.

        The Pawnbroker puts the case on the counter.  Quail looks
        at the case with curiosity.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   I wonder if you could tell
                   me...

        They both look around as someone enters.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                   I trust these will look well
                   in you... mosque.


35      INT. FLOP HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON HANDS

        Opening up the small case.

        PULL BACK to reveal they are Quail's hands.  The hotel
        room he's now in is obviously a different one than the
        last one we saw him in.  The room is large but run-down,
        the walls are peeling, the architecture is much older,
        etc.

        Quail examines the contents of the case:  there are CREDIT
        CARDS and also MONEY, several stacks of bills, neatly
        tied -- some of it the conventional green, but most of
        it red.


        CLOSE ON RED MONEY

        On the face of it is printed:  "MARS FEDERAL COLONY".

                                 QUAIL
                           (mutters)
                   Martian money....

        Quail thumbs through the money, and whistles softly to
        himself as he sees how much there is.

        Also in the case are:  TWO PASSPORTS;  a small CASSETTE
        RECORDER;  a rolled-up LEATHER POUCH and a spray can of
        some sort;  and a strange thing that looks like a silver
        mask.  He examines the face mask, studies BLACK LETTERS
        WRITTEN ACROSS IT (which we are not close enough to read)
        and then puts it aside.  Another item now catches  his
        eye:  a wristwatch.  He sees a conspicuous red button on
        the side of the watch, and PRESSES IT.  INSTANTLY, TO HIS
        SHOCK, QUAIL SEES A MAN MANIFEST HIMSELF HIMSELF OUT OF
        THIN AIR AND STAND THERE IN THE ROOM A FEW FEET AWAY FROM
        QUAIL:  he's an EXACT HOLOGRAPHIC DUPLICATE of Quail --
        down to the clothes Quail is wearing now.

        The image stands and watches Quail.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   What the hell...?

        Quail smiles, presses the red button again.  There is a
        HUMMING SOUND -- and the man FADES INTO THIN AIR -- like
        a television set being turned off.

        Quail looks bemused.

        Now he unrolls the leather pouch and looks inside.  There
        he finds what look like SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS;  a sponge,
        a long piece of wire doubled over, with some attachments
        and a tiny METAL HEAD on one end, and some tubes of salve.

        He turns on the cassette recorder.

        The VOICE he hears on the cassette TAPE is HIS OWN!

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)
                           (Quail's voice)
                   "Hauser, this is Hauser -- or
                   whatever you think your name
                   is now.  If you're listening
                   to this, I'm talking to myself.
                   Your memory's been erased and
                   you've got a wet towel around
                   your head.
                           (he does)
                   "The first thing you've got to
                   do is get rid of that bug in
                   your head."


36      INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

        The sound of the tape continues as Quail follows
        instructions - pushing the wire up into a bloody portion
        of his neck, just below the ear.

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)
                   The monitoring device is
                   located in your left maxillary
                   sinus cavity.  Make a small
                   incision in your neck just
                   below the left ear, and
                   insert the wire up into the
                   sinus.  The head is
                   self-guiding.  Just shove.

        Quail makes a face.

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)
                           (continuing)
                   You won't feel a thing.  The
                   spray cartridge contains a
                   local anesthetic and a blood
                   coagulant.  Careful, it's my
                   neck, too.

        Holding the wet towel against his neck, Quail slowly
        withdraws the wire.  On the end of it is a tiny, metal
        bead, the Transmitter.


37      INT. MOVING OFFICIAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        The man with the ear plug suddenly reacts.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   It's come on again.

                                 DRIVER
                   Where?

        The 1st man quickly check the map-grid in the dashboard.
        A small bright 'x' is flashing.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   He's in that old flophouse.
                   Plaza Hotel.  Central Park
                   South.


37A     INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Quail is anxious to get rid of the transmitter.  He looks
        around and notices a rat trap near a rat hole in the
        skirting board.

        He carefully - avoiding springing the trap - removes the
        piece of cheese and pushes the transmitter inside.  He
        then throws the cheese into the rat hole.


38      INT. MOVING OFFICIAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        The car is moving swiftly through the streets.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   Boy, he's really moving
                   around.

        A CU of the screen shows the small 'x' moving in circles.


38A     EXT. HOTEL SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        The car pulls up.  Another follows it.  Armed men leap
        out from both.  The EARPLUG WEARER indicates they should
        go down an alley at the side of a service door.  They
        advance cautiously, guns at the ready.  They see no one.
        The EARPLUG WEARER indicates another, even narrower, alley
        leading off to one side.  Two of the men sneak cautiously
        up to it, their guns at the ready.

        A large rat scurries out from behind overfull garbage
        bins.  Furious, they fire.  The bullets rip the bins to
        shreds, scattering refuse everywhere.  The rat is killed.
        They all stare in disbelief.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   Ya dirty rat!


40      INT. E.I.O. HEADQUARTERS - MEMORY LAB - NIGHT

        OPENING CLOSE on a MONITOR SCREEN slated "HAUSER/QUAIL"
        followed by a serial number and some dates.  The slate
        vanishes, replaced by a scene of Quail -- undergoing
        some KIND OF MILITARY TRAINING.

        PAN to OTHER MONITORS, all depicting Quail in other
        action scenes -- on some kind of mission, driving a car,
        etc.

        TECHNICIANS man the monitors, scrolling through them in
        fast-forward and fast reverse as if searching files.

        The technicians turn as Cohaagen and his aides enter.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (demands)

                   We're running every one of
                   his memory tapes for the past
                   fifteen years.  Nothing yet,
                   sir.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   There must be something -- some
                   place he would go, some friend
                   he would run to.

        The red-haired E.I.O. man joins them.

                                 RED-HEADED MAN
                           (to Cohaagen;
                            quietly)
                   They lost him.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Again?!

        The red-headed man nods.

                           (continuing)

                   Absolutely, sir.  He thinks
                   he's Quail, a computer...

                   Then how do you explain what
                   he's doing?

                                 SUPERVISOR
                   Just his instincts.  He was
                   well trained by E.I.O.... Maybe
                   the memory cap's fractured.
                   Portions of his prior identity
                   could be leaking through.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (very anxious)
                   He'll remember Mars?  The
                   Sphinx Project?

                                 SUPERVISOR
                   Fragments.  Nothing more.
                   Nothing he could piece together.
                   I did advise terminating him,
                   rather than implanting an
                   identify alternative.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   What do you think I am?  A
                   barbarian?  We're not living
                   in the twentieth century!

        He looks at the video screen again.  An image has flashed
        onto it of an attractive Eurasian girl.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (continuing)
                   Hold it there.

        He studies the picture, which changes to show the same
        girl from different angles.


42      INT. SPACE PORT - DAY

        Passengers are boarding a COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT.  In
        addition to the STEWARDESSES checking their tickets, there
        are two PLAINCLOTHES MEN checking every passenger.  They
        carry some kind of small, portable ELECTRONIC DEVICE that
        they shine in the face of each passenger going through.
        (It gives off a BLUE BEAM and HUMS.)

        The passengers are a diverse group - businessmen, officials,
        government people, etc.  There is also a large tour group
        consisting of a predominately middle-aged and determinedly
        jolly crowd, many of them carrying duty-free bags.  They
        are being marshaled by an harassed TOUR ORGANIZER, who is
        carrying aloft a hand-painted sign... "MARTIAN TOUR GROUP".

        The last of the passengers board the spacecraft.  The
        chief PLAINCLOTHES MAN nods to an official and the door
        begins to close.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1
                   If he had to travel to Mars
                   with that bunch, I'd be sorry
                   for him.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #2
                   We couldn't have missed him?

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1
                   No way.  Let's get a coffee
                   before the next shuttle.


43      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT

        One of the PASSENGERS -- a middle-aged WOMAN - unbuckles
        her seat belt and heads for the restroom, carrying her
        handbag, and some clothes on a hanger.


44      INT. LAVATORY - IN FLIGHT

        The woman locks the door and turns to the mirror.  She
        opens her bag, takes out a spray container, SPRAYS HER
        FACE with it, and takes out -- the SILVER FACE MASK we
        saw in Quail's emergency kit.

        She holds the mask to her face.  There is a SIZZLING
        NOISE, and SMOKE rises from behind the mask.

        She lowers the mask.  Her face is now that of QUAIL.
        He tears up a passport and drops it down a chute.

        He reaches inside his dress, starts to REMOVE his "FALSIES."

        CLOSE ON MASK

        We can read the BLACK LETTERING written across it now:
        "LASER FACIAL".


45      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT

        Quail exits from the lavatory and glances toward the
        ebullient tour crowd.  He turns and looks in the other
        direction and sees a video theater advertising "ROCKY 36"
        with Sylvester Stallone III, Jnr.  He isn't too excited,
        but heads towards it.  He pauses a little when an
        announcement comes over the intercom.

        A LITTLE BELL sounds, followed by INTERCOM STATIC.  Quail
        looks up.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                   Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll
                   glance out the starboard
                   viewports, you'll behold an
                   indeed awesome sight --

        Quail goes to a viewport and PEERS, transfixed.  He is
        seeing... at last... the object of his obsession.


46      EXT. SPACELINER - IN ORBIT AROUND MARS

        The SPACELINER -- which we have deliberately not seen before
        this moment for dramatic effect -- banks and turns, suddenly
        bringing into view -- MARS.

        AN IMMENSE ORANGE GLOBE -- so close it looks like it's
        going to fall on us.  It dwarfs the spaceliner.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                   Those long gorges you see,
                   clearly are the legendary
                   canals of Mars....

        The liner drops toward the surface of Mars.  Below:  a
        NETWORK OF INTERSECTING LINES crisscross the planet.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                           (continuing)
                   Of course, they are not manmade
                   canals, but vast natural chasms
                   ...many deeper and larger than
                   the Grand Canyon.  Though
                   utterly without moisture now,
                   scientists have determined
                   that they were formed by
                   massive flooding millions of
                   years ago.


47      INT. SPACELINER

        Quail stares, his brow furrowing as if with some deep
        hidden memory he can't quite recall.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                           (continuing)
                   Surface temperatures at the
                   Martian equator is minus
                   one-hundred and twenty degrees 
                   Centigrade -- in winter.
                   Fortunately, this time of year
                   it's slightly more seasonable:
                   Sixty degrees, Fahrenheit,
                   outside the domes.
                           (beat)
                   Please remember, folks, that
                   outside the domes you'll need
                   to carry your own personal
                   oxygen supply at all times.
                   The atmosphere of Mars is
                   almost a vacuum.  Thank you
                   for flying with Interstellar
                   and we hope your stay will be
                   a pleasant one.


48      EXT. MARS - OUTER SPACE

        CAMERA follows the spaceliner until the ENTIRE FRAME is
        filled with the RED-ORANGE sands of MARS.


49      EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - DAY

        An endless expanse of boulder-studded red sand, under
        a red-orange sky.

        The desert is cut by a ROAD, which snakes across the
        rocky terrain.  Some surface TRAFFIC moves along the
        road (all pressurized vehicles since the atmosphere
        of Mars is almost a pure vacuum) - including the
        MARSPORT BUS.

        PAN WITH THE BUS - TO REVEAL

        A CITY UNDER A DOME.

        In the midst of the stark, trackless landscape -- it's
        midday, scorching -- rises a huge weatherbeaten GEODESIC
        STRUCTURE, its glass surface scarred by sandstorm damage.
        Its feeling is like an old Western, when Clint Eastwood
        rides into Tombstone -- the raw, forbidding vistas, with
        a tough town carved out of the wilderness.


50      INT. MARSPORT - DAY

        Quail is looking out at the desolate landscape.  The TOUR
        ORGANISER, an amiable middle-aged man sits beside him.
        It is possible he is not a married man.

                                 QUAIL
                   It's no Garden of Eden.

                                 TOUR ORGANISER
                   No.  Quite a bit to see, though.
                   The canyons, the old Sphinx...

                                 QUAIL
                   What do you know about that?

                                 TOUR ORANISER
                   Not much, really.  Millions
                   of years old.  Bit like the
                   one that used to be in Egypt,
                   you know...

                                 QUAIL
                   Yeah.  Got destroyed in the
                   Arab wars... What about this
                   independence movement?

                                 TOUR ORGANISER
                           (dismissive)
                   Not worth worrying about.
                   Mostly descendants of the
                   original colonists from Earth.
                   Now they want self-rule so they
                   can sell us all the minerals...
                   I don't think we've met.  You
                   with our group?  Takes me a
                   while to know everyone.

                                 QUAIL
                   Sure.  Douglas Quail.

                                 TOUR ORGANISER
                   Richard Toltz.
                           (they shake hands)
                   Well, Doug, I hope we'll see
                   a lot more of each other.


55      EXT. CITY (UNDER THE DOOM) - DAY

        The bus pulls up outside a modern tourist hotel.  The
        buildings surrounding it have a much more improvised,
        temporary look.  Most are pre-fabricated structures.
        The streets are crowded and there is a "frontier-town"
        atmosphere.  Stalls sell fruit and vegetables, also water
        and air containers.

        A lot of greenery is evident - this is to absorb CO2 and
        emit oxygen, thus helping with the air supply under the
        dome.

        Some small, ragged boys look at QUAIL as he looks around
        before going inside the hotel.  Suddenly, one of them throws
        a small sack at him.  It hits his chest and leaves a yellow
        stain.  The hotel DOORMAN chases the boys away....

                                 BOY
                   Smogpsucker!

        From the other side of the street, a gang of URCHINS with
        a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant PATRIOTIC
        SONG.

                                 DOORMAN
                   You know how it is, sir.  Some
                   of these red-asses are a bit
                   prejudiced.

                                 QUAIL
                   Prejudiced?  Against what?

                                 DOORMAN
                   Earthmen.

        The street song has swelled, adult MINERS and CITIZENS
        joining the belligerent chorus.

                                 QUAIL
                   What are they singing?

                                 DOORMAN
                   The Martian National Anthem.

        Quail tips the doorman, enter the hotel.


57      INT. MARS HILTON LOBBY - DAY

        Quail passes several kiosks -- a magazine stand, currency
        exchange, clothing store, shoeshine stand.  A SHOESHINE
        BOY looks up at Quail.

        Quail walks past, enters the main lobby.  The atrium
        entryway is absolutely fabulous; a complete contrast to the
        dirty, Casbah-like streets.  AFFLUENT-LOOKING PEOPLE in
        spotless linen fill the lobby.

        Quail stops to examine a large ROTATING DISPLAY sitting on
        a table in the middle of the lobby.  It is a stand-up model
        of a SPHINX.  Across the top is written "THE FIRST WONDER
        OF MARS".  A recorded VOICE repeats a canned speech --

                                 CANNED VOICE
                   "...the Martian Sphinx...
                   only evidence of non-human
                   civilization ever discovered
                   ...age estimated at over
                   eighteen million years...


        CLOSE - SHOESHINE BOY

        He stares at Quail.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Quail approaches the Registration Desk.

                                 CLERK
                   Nice to have you back with us,
                   Mr. Hauser.

        Quail is startled to be recognized -- particularly by
        this name.  He tries to stay casual.

                                 QUAIL
                   Nice to be back.
                           (pick up pen)
                   I'm flattered you remember me.

                                 CLERK
                   Part of my job, sir.

                                 QUAIL
                           (starts to sign;
                            hesitates)
                   Do you remember my first name,
                   too?

                                 CLERK
                   Charles.  Charles Hauser, right?

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm impressed.
                           (now he signs)
                   Listen.  I need transportation
                   to the... uh... the Sphinx.
                   Can you arrange it for me?

                                 CLERK
                   I'm sorry, sir.  But Earth
                   government has sealed off the
                   excavation site completely.
                   No one but survey teams and
                   archaeologists are allowed
                   closer than twenty miles.

        The Clerk taps a few keys on a computer.

                                 CLERK
                   Oh...
                           (spots something
                            on the computer)
                   Do you want the item you left
                   with us?

                                 QUAIL
                   What item?  Oh... yes, please.

        The Clerk turns to the safe, retrieves an envelope. He
        hands it -- and an ELECTRONIC ROOM KEY -- to Quail.


58      P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - THE SPHINX

        Far in the distance, a dusty red structure squats amid
        barren dunes.  We see vehicles, scaffolding, a fortified
        perimeter.


59      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

        Quail stands at the window, looking through binoculars.
        He lowers them irritably, tosses them on the bed.

        Quail tugs the envelope from his pocket, tears it open.
        Inside is a single slip of paper, on which is written
        in longhand:

                                 "MELINA NOEL
                           Last Chance Air Station
                        Kilometer 61   Gird Square T9"


60      EXT. MARS HILTON - SUNSET

        It is now sunset on Mars and it's literally of inearthly
        beauty.  The sun is bold and blood red;  the foggy, drip-
        ping glass of the Dome tints the light into strange colors.

        Quail emerges from the hotel, properly attired now in a
        white tropical suit, and starts for the taxi stand.

        Behind him, also emerging from the hotel, is the Shoeshine
        Boy.  He keeps out of sight -- but is definitely tailing
        Quail.

        As Quail nears the first solar-powered taxi in line, he is
        approached by an amiable-looking CALYPSO GUY wearing a West
        Indian shirt and bright straw hat.

                                 CALYPSO GUY (BENNIE)
                   Need a cab, boss mon?

        Quail hesitates, unsure of the protocol.

                                 BENNIE
                           (continuing)
                   Mine's right around the corner.

                                 QUAIL
                           (indicating first
                            cab in line)
                   That one's closer.

                                 BENNIE
                   But I out-hustle him, right?

                                 QUAIL
                           (smiling)
                   Right.

        TWO CABBIES exchange curses as Quail, wary, follows the
        Calypso Guy around a corner, climbs into the small solar
        car.


62      EXT. CITY DOME - AIR LOCK - SUNSET

        An AIR LOCK whooshes open underneath a Checker Cab sign.
        Bennie and Quail emerge in the solar-powered car -- set
        off into the desert.


63      EXT. DESERT - SUNSET

        The taxi traverses the same type desert that Quail crossed
        a few hours ago.  Only now is looks completely different.
        The late light tints everything in pastel shades, Quail is
        awed by the grandeur of the Lawrence-of-Arabia-like setting.


68      EXT. DESERT TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

        Quail and Bennie's taxi approaches a brightly-lit oasis in
        the middle of the desert.  There's a cafe, repair facilities
        and a huge parking lot -- all under a garish neon sign:
        "LAST CHANCE AIR STATION AND ASLOON - EAT HERE AND GET GAS".

        Quail and Bennie's taxi pulls in and parks.  In the lot is
        a collection of strange and colorful vehicles:  huge ore
        trucks that pull eight trailers, mountain prospecting jeeps,
        Grapes-of-Wrath jalopies.  Quail and Bennie disembark, wear-
        ing breathing masks, and enter the main building.


69      INT. LAST CHANCE AIR STATION - NIGHT

        The joint is a combination saloon/cathouse/casino.  There
        are slot machines, HOOKERS, MINERS and HOMESTEADERS; it is
        like a Nevada brothel -- packed with wild and woolly indi-
        vidualists, the equivalent of Old West trappers, prospectors
        and cowboys -- but with a space-age look.

        Quail and Bennie elbow their way to the bar.  Fragments of
        conversation are overheard.

                                 MINER #1
                   ...if that intergalactic little
                   Napoleon thinks I'm sellin' and
                   clearin' outta here, he can
                   think again!

                                 MINER #2
                           (with a laugh)
                   ...watcha gonna do when he cuts
                   off the air, Luke?

                                 MINER #3
                   ...you'll be breathin' red dust
                   and shittin' bricks.

        Bennie and Quail pass another group.

                                 MINER #4
                   ...my wife ain't goin' on
                   one of those space shuttles...
                   she hates flyin'...

                                 MINER #5
                   ...aw, come on... flyin's
                   safer'n crossin' the road...

                                 MINER #6
                   ...yeah, there ain't been a
                   real disaster since that
                   collision off Phobos, nigh on
                   twenty years ago...

                                 MINER #4
                           (alarmed)
                   ...well, that killed twelve
                   thousand...

                                 QUAIL
                   What is this, Bennie...
                   Tombstone?

                                 BENNIE
                   Sorta.  Bunch of miners out
                   here got their own claims, from
                   way back.  Cohaagen's buyin' em
                   all up, says he's gonna cut off
                   the air an' water if they won't
                   sell...

        Quail attracts the attention of the BARTENDER.

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm looking for Melina Noel.

                                 BARTENDER
                   You've found her.

        His nod indicates an area behind Quail.  He turns to see
        an attractive waitress placing drinks on tables.  She
        doesn't notice Quail.  He walks toward her through the
        crowd.  Bennie watches, then tactfully slips away.

        MELINA turns to return to the bar and runs straight into
        Quail.  She stops, obviously astonished to see him.

                                 MELINA
                   You bastard!

        Almost in tears, she pushes her way through the crowd to a
        billiard room, which is separated from the main bar by
        swinging doors.

        There are no occupants and it is almost in darkness.  Quail,
        bewildered, follows her.  Inside the billiard room he turns
        on the lights which illuminates the area of the table.

        (NOTE:  As Quail and Melina speak, the activity in the
                outside bar can be seen above the swinging doors.)

        Melina is still fighting back tears.  Quail stops in front
        of her, unsure about what to do.  He has no recollection
        of how well he might have known this woman.

        Suddenly, she slaps him hard across the face.

                                 MELINA
                           (quietly)
                   You bastard...

        He rubs his painful cheek. 

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   That's new -- the innocent
                   look.
                           (bitter sarcasm)
                   You didn't have that one
                   before.
                           (beat)
                   Well?

        Quail is speechless.

                                 QUAIL
                   Well, uh... I...

                                 MELINA
                   All right, I'll say it for
                   you.

        He looks relieved (but tries to cover).

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   Don't worry.  I got the note.
                   You discharged your obligation.

                                 QUAIL
                   What note?

                                 MELINA
                   Oh, the usual one.  "Must
                   return immediately to Earth...
                   the wife needs me..."

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't have a wife.  Well,
                   I do - but not a real wife.
                           (getting
                            desperate)
                   Hell... look... someone else
                   sent that note.  Someone who --

                                 MELINA
                   What are you here for?!

                                 QUAIL
                   For you!  I don't even know
                   why --

        Melina bursts into tears.  Quail rather tentatively puts
        his arms around her.  She welcomes this at first, but then
        pushes him away.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Whoever I was, I must have
                   been a helluva guy.

                                 MELINA
                   "Whoever you were"???

                                 QUAIL
                   Listen.  I've for to tell  you
                   something.  I beg you to
                   believe me... help me --

        All Melina's suspicions come rushing back.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Something happened to my mind.
                   Memory suppression, false
                   implant, I don't know
                   what --

        Melina backs off.  Quail grows more desperate.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   What I'm saying is... I don't
                   remember you.  I don't remember
                   us.  I don't remember me --

        Melina's expression grows dead hard.

                                 MELINA
                   [And I thought...]

                                 QUAIL
                   Who is us?

                                 MELINA
                           (ignoring the
                            question)
                   Memory erasure is what they
                   use on agents.  Go away.

                                 QUAIL
                   Wait... I was an agent -- I'm
                   not now -- just tell me who
                   I am!  How did we know each
                   other?  Why are they trying
                   to kill me?!

        He takes a step toward her, nearly frantic.

                                 MELINA
                   I'm not trusting you again.

                                 QUAIL
                   You loved me once, you must
                   have --

                                 MELINA
                   That you was a liar.  Who you
                   are now I don't even know.

                                 QUAIL
                   Please, Melina --

                                 MELINA
                           (tears starting)
                   Get out!

                                 QUAIL
                   I need your help --

                                 MELINA
                           (crying quietly)
                   Get out!  Get the hell away
                   from me!

        Quail gives up; goes through the doors and leaves.  Melina
        slumps her shoulder against the table and cries.


77      INT. LAST CHANCE AIR STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

        Quail enters from the cafe.  Bennie is kneeling beside his
        taxi, repairing a tire.  He look up, sees Quail approach.

        On his right hand, Bennie has a mechanical device
        capable of spinning 360 degrees.  He uses it to twirl
        a lug nut tight on his tire.  As Quail approaches,
        Bennie removes the TOOL ATTACHMENT from his HAND,
        tosses it into a kit beside the taxi.

                                 BENNIE
                   You don't look so good, boss.
                   All over the Universe, women
                   is an awful curse.

        He opens the door for Quail, beams.


80      INT. SOLAR-POWERED CAR - NIGHT - MOVING - DESERT BACKGROUND

        Quail still broods, Bennie tries to cheer him up.

                                 BENNIE
                   It's a tough planet, boss.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yeah, right.

                                 BENNIE
                   Some guy really screwed her -
                   screwed her up real good.
                   Some Earthman.  Just hopped
                   on a space shuttle.

        Bennie bright tone isn't improving Quail's mood.

                                 QUAIL
                   Listen, Bennie.  You're pretty
                   well informed?

                                 BENNIE
                   If that means I know it all,
                   you're right, boss.

                                 QUAIL
                   What do you know about the
                   Sphinx?

                                 BENNIE
                   I don't know nothin'.  Not
                   about the Sphinx.  That's out
                   of the ball park.

                                 QUAIL
                   I have to get there.  Can't
                   you help me?

                                 BENNIE
                   No can do, mon.  You want
                   women, cigarettes, red-market
                   money, booze, even air or
                   water... Bennie's your man.
                   But the Sphinx... that's
                   E.I.O. --


80A     INT. CITY UNDER THE DOME - NIGHT

        The solar car is moving through the crowd, when suddenly
        SIRENS approach on a cross street.  Bennie brakes and stops.
        He and Quail watch as POLICE MOTORCYCLES clear a path for a
        huge, GAS-POWERED LIMO.  MINERS on the sidewalks shout
        CURSES, OBSCENITIES --

                                 BENNIE
                   Well... look at that one, eh?

                                 QUAIL
                   What?

                                 BENNIE
                   Big cheese in town.  Big
                   smelly cheese.

                                 QUAIL
                   Cohaagen?  But isn't he often
                   here?

                                 BENNIE
                   No way.  That cat just cheat
                   the Martian workers without
                   ever leavin' his place in
                   Beverly Hills.  Somethin' must
                   be cookin'.

        Quail keeps his face in shadow and watches Cohaagen with
        curiosity as he passes.  Cohaagen is lit up briefly by a
        street lamp.  His face makes an impression on Quail, who
        perhaps faintly remembers him in the past.


82      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail enters, turns on the lights, locks the door.  He
        checks all the rooms.  Then he crosses to the dresser,
        studies himself in the mirror.  He looks haggard.

        Quail opens a drawer, takes out his "emergency case," sets
        it on top and opens it.  He removes a shoulder holster and
        pistol, sets them aside.  He takes out a tape recorder.

        He sets the recorder down gingerly, as if somewhere in
        there were contained the answers to all his questions.
        He's just about to activate it, when he hears a KNOCK at
        the door.

        Quail freezes.  Another KNOCK.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                           (through door)
                   Mr. Hauser...

                                 QUAIL
                   Who is it?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   Mr. Hauser, I want to talk to
                   you... about Douglas Quail.

        Quail ditches the recorder and the "emergency case" into
        the drawer -- everything except the PISTOL.

        Quail approaches the door very cautiously (from the side --
        out of the line of fire).

                                 QUAIL
                           (tensely)
                   Who are you?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   My name is George Edgemar.
                   I work for Rekall, Incorporated.

                                 QUAIL
                           (stunned;
                            incredulous)
                   Rekall??

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   Yes.  It's difficult to
                   explain... Could you open the
                   door, please?  I'm not armed.

        Quail opens it carefully, his gun at the ready, but out
        of view of the person at the door.

        A dignified-looking GENTLEMAN stands there, calm and
        pleasant, wearing an Earth-style business suit.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   Hello, Mr. Quail.  May I come
                   in?  I won't be offended if
                   you prefer to keep the gun
                   you're holding trained on me.

        He can't see the gun, but somehow knows.

                                 QUAIL
                   All right... come in.

        Quail does keep his gun trained on the man.  The man enters,
        holding in his outstretched hand -- a business card.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   My card, Mr. Quail.

        Quail frisks him, then takes the card, glances at it.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay -- so you're Doctor
                   George Edgemar of 'Rekall,
                   Inc.'  So?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   As I said... this is going to
                   be very difficult -- for both
                   of us.

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm listening.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   Mr. Quail... I'm afraid you're
                   not really standing here at
                   this moment.

                                 QUAIL
                   Sat that again.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   I said, you're not really
                   here.  Neither am I.  We're
                   both in the Memory Studio --
                   in the offices of Rekall, Inc.
                   On Earth.

        Long pause.

                                 QUAIL
                   Are you trying to tell me that
                   this is all part of some...
                   artificially injected fantasy?
                   That I never really left Earth?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   No, not quite.  We didn't give
                   you this.  You're creating it
                   yourself --
                           (pauses, choosing
                            his words)
                   Remember the option we offered
                   you?  Intelligence agent?
                   Something inside you liked
                   that idea, fastened on it.
                   What you're experiencing now
                   is a free-form delusion that
                   you yourself are fabricating.

                                 QUAIL
                   What is this shit you're
                   giving me?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   This is not -- shit, Mr. Quail.
                   It's the truth.
                           (beat)
                   I know it's very hard for you
                   to accept, but you're having
                   a schizophrenic reaction...
                   we can't snap you out of the
                   Narkadine.  You're in a world
                   of your own fantasy.

                                 QUAIL
                   Then how the hell can you be
                   in my dream -- if you know it's
                   just a dream?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   I've been artificially
                   implanted -- like the first
                   part of your fantasy.  I'm
                   actually monitoring your dream
                   at a psychoprobe console.
                   This is a last resort.  When
                   somebody gets stuck in their
                   own fantasy, we send in
                   someone after them.  A
                   specialist, like myself.

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't believe a word you're
                   saying.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   I was afraid you'd think that.
                   I'm sorry to have to do this,
                   but you really are stuck.
                           (calls out)
                   Doctor Noel, would you come in
                   now please?

        The door starts to open.  Quail pivots and points his
        gun at the opening door.

        MELINA walks in, carrying a CLIPBOARD.  She looks at Quail
        with professional detachment.

                                 MELINA
                   Yes, Mr. Quail, I'm afraid
                   it's all true.

        Quail is staggered.

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   I tried to break through to
                   you earlier, but you just
                   molded me into your fantasy.
                   Sometimes it takes Dr. Edgemar
                   to get through to a client as
                   tough as you.

                                 QUAIL
                           (wavering)
                   So what's supposed to happen
                   now?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   Just do exactly as we tell
                   you.

                                 QUAIL
                           (stares at him
                            coldly)
                   Somehow that doesn't appeal
                   to me.

                                 MELINA
                   Please, Mr. Quail... try to
                   cooperate.  You're having a
                   schizophrenic embolism.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   If we can't get you out now...
                   you may never come out of it.
                   Your wife calls every day --


        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Even more suspicious.


        TWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR

                                 QUAIL
                   If this is a fantasy, there'll
                   be no real consequences when
                   I pull this trigger.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   But there will by consequences
                   inside your mind.  Consequences
                   that won't hurt me... but could
                   be fatal to you.
                           (beat)
                   If you shoot me, you'll wipe
                   me out of your fantasy -- I
                   can't come back again.  Because
                   to you, I'll be dead.  I can't
                   help you get back to reality.
                   You'll be stuck in permanent
                   psychosis.


        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Trembling, holding the gun point blank in Edgemar's face.


        CLOSE - EDGEMAR

        Showing no fear of tension whatever.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   You're going to lower the gun,
                   Mr. Quail.  You're going to
                   hand it to me --


        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Straining desperately to find the true "reality."


        EXTREME CLOSEUP - TRIGGER OF GUN

        Quail's finger on it.


        TWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR

                                 EDGEMAR
                   You're going to do exactly
                   what I tell you --

        Quail PULLS THE TRIGGER!


        REVERSE ANGLE - BACK OF EDGEMAR'S HEAD

        We SEE the results of the gunshot from this angle only,
        and so BRIEFLY as to produce an almost SUBLIMINAL effect:
        the back of Edgemar's head blows off --

        He collapses to the floor.

        Melina LEAPS at Edgemar's falling form and CLAMPS HER HANDS
        over Edgemar's RIGHT HAND!

                                 MELINA
                   Watch out, Charles!  There's
                   more of them in the hall!

        Quail spins toward the door just as it BURSTS OPEN.  A man
        enters, firing, but Quail has fallen to the floor and
        returns the fire.  He staggers back out into the corridor
        and slams against the wall, dead.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                           (from hall)
                   You've had it, Hauser!  Throw
                   out your weapon if you want
                   a past!

        Melina is still crouched by Edgemar's body, holding his
        HAND for some reason.  Her CLIPBOARD dangles by her side.

                                 MELINA
                           (whispering)
                   There's an explosive in the
                   clipboard!  He has a dead-man
                   switch in his hand!

        Squeezing Edgemar's hand shut with one of hers, she holds
        up her other wrist -- to show that the CLIPBOARD IS BOUND
        TO HER WRIST BY A CHAIN!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   What do you say, Hauser?  We
                   haven't got all night!  Hauser?

        Quail (Hauser) SHOOTS OFF the chain.

                                 QUAIL
                   What happens it I come out?

        Quail takes the CLIPBOARD from Melina and eases himself to
        the side of the doorway.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   We'll put in a word with the
                   big boys.  Maybe you'll just
                   get exile to Venus.

                                 QUAIL
                   All right.  Here comes the
                   weapon.

        Quail reaches around the corner and SAILS THE CLIPBOARD into
        the hallway.  Melina lets go of Edgemar's hand --

        There is a TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION in the hallway,


83      INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

        Quail comes out in crouch, ready to shoot.  On the floor
        lies a DEAD MAN and the body of the Shoeshine Boy, sprawled
        grotesquely.  The hallway is filled with smoke.  The floor
        covered with debris.  Plaster falling from the ceiling.

        All over the hotel, ALARMS begin BLARING.


84      INT. QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail strides back in, icy-furious.  He seizes Melina by
        the wrist and drags her after him into the corridor.


84A     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

        Two more E.I.O. men appear but Quail shoots them while
        dragging Melina down the hall in the opposite direction.
        He pushes open the door leading to the staircase.


84B     INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina run down the stairs.  On the next landing
        is a service elevator, from which a waiter is emerging
        carefully carrying a tray with hors d'oeuvres and champagne.

                                 QUAIL
                   Back in, quick!

                                 WAITER
                   Wouldn't you prefer your order
                   in your room, sir?

                                 QUAIL
                   In!

        Quail bundles the waiter unceremoniously back inside the
        elevator.


84C     INT. LIFT - NIGHT

        Quail presses the basement button.  As he talks to Melina
        he opens the champagne and pours two glasses.  The waiter
        is too frightened to protest.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay.  Answers!  Now!

                                 MELINA
                   They kidnapped me.  Said
                   they'd kill you if I didn't
                   cooperate.  I told them I
                   didn't care, but then when
                   I realized they meant it...

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't know why they're
                   after me, but what's your
                   connection with all this?

                                 MELINA
                   We were together before.

                                 QUAIL
                   Believe me, I'm really sorry
                   I can't recall the details
                   of that encounter.

        The elevator has reached the basement.  They rush out.


85      EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HILTON - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina run from a basement door into an alley.

        A solar car whips out in front of them.  Quail and Melina
        leap aboard.

                                 MELINA
                   Go, Bennie, for God's sake!


86      INT. BENNIE'S SOLAR CAR - NIGHT

        Bennie weaves as fast as he can in and out of the traffic,
        Quail and Melina ducking out of view in the passenger seat.

                                 BENNIE
                           (glances in
                            mirror)
                   Bad news, boss lady.

                                 MELINA
                   What?

                                 BENNIE
                   Black cruiser just pull out
                   behind us.


86A     EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

        A large gas-powered official-looking car is pushing its way
        through the crowds and traffic behind them.


86B     INT. BENNIE'S CAR - NIGHT

        Quail is aiming his gun at the following car.

                                 BENNIE
                   Forget the shooter, boss.  I
                   lose 'em for you.

                                 QUAIL
                   Lose them?  In this?

                                 BENNIE
                   Hang on!

        Bennie reaches down, grasps a KNOB.  He yanks it, like
        someone starting an outboard motor -- and an ear-splitting
        LOUD ENGINE roars to life.

        Bennie opens the throttle and the solar car HURTLES DOWN
        THE STREET.  Quail and Melina are thrown back in the seat.


87      EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        GUNFIRE blazes all around the car.  Quail FIRES back at
        the pursuing car.

                                 QUAIL
                           (shouts over
                            GUNFIRE)
                   You're gonna get a ticket
                   for that engine, Bennie --

                                 BENNIE
                   Yutani 650 -- you like it,
                   boss?  Nothing like the old
                   gas when you want a bit of
                   speed.

        BULLETS from the cruiser rip through the car.

                                 MELINA
                   You better have two aces,
                   Bennie.
                           (glances behind)
                   There's a second cruiser --
                   and it's gaining --


87A     EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

        Bennie's car hurtles through the crowds with the official
        car gaining on it.  Bennie takes a corner sharply near a
        huge water selling stand.  The official car brakes to make
        the same turn, but clips the side of the water stand.  The
        water container tips and empties water through the open
        roof (i.e. through which one of the Agents has been firing)
        so that the car completely fills.  The driver continues the
        chase, but the occupants are now submerged.  They frantic-
        ally open the windows while continuing to follow Bennie's
        car.


88      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

        The solar car rushes down what appears to be a dead-end
        street, with the official vehicle (water pouring out of
        the windows) in pursuit.

        At the end of the street, however, Bennie doesn't stop but
        continues going into a large opening.  It is an abandoned
        mine.  The bigger car follows him, but won't fit.  The
        roof is smashed to pieces as the vehicle is wedged into
        the narrow opening.

        The second official car pulls up behind.  A chauffeur jumps
        out and opens the rear door.  Cohaagen steps out.  He sur-
        veys the scene.  The four men in the wrecked car clamber
        their way backwards out of the wreckage.  They are covered
        in blood and their clothes are in shreds.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   I take it, then, you've failed
                   to get him again.

        Cohaagen turns to an associate, EMILE, a youngish,
        well-dressed executive type.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (continuing)
                   Proceed with Operation Sphinx.

                                 EMILE
                   But, sir...

                                 COHAAGEN
                   With him...
                           (gestures toward
                            the mine)
                   ...on the lose, I'm not
                   taking any more chances.
                   Operation Sphinx will flush
                   him out.



93      INT. OLD MINE - NIGHT

        The solar car proceeds along the tunnel.  It enters an area
        full of smoke.  Dozens of men are sitting around smoking
        cigarettes, pipes and cigars.  Quail looks at them in
        amazement.

                                 QUAIL
                   What's all this?

                                 BENNIE
                   Nothin', boss.  Just old
                   smokies.  Only place they
                   can come for a puff.  It's
                   all banned topside.

        They have now climbed out of the car.  Quail looks
        searchingly at Melina and Bennie.

                                 QUAIL
                   So you two are into something
                   a bit more serious than the
                   taxi and truck-stop business.

                                 BENNIE
                   That's right, boss.

        He unzips his jacket to reveal a T-shirt with "MARTIAN
        LIBERATION FRONT" (and an appropriate symbol) emblazoned
        on it.

                                 QUAIL
                   My God!... T-shirts.  They
                   died out on Earth years ago.

                                 BENNIE
                           (hurt)
                   Well, maybe we ain't fashion
                   leaders, boss.

                                 MELINA
                   No.  But we still believe in
                   a free Mars.

        They walk as they talk - into a room off the main tunnel.
        It is adorned with "FREE MARS" and "MARTIAN LIBERATION
        FRONT" posters.  A group of people are printing T-shirts
        and leaflets.  They exchange greetings with Melina and
        Bennie.

                                 QUAIL
                   So where did I fit into all
                   this?

                                 MELINA
                   You - when you were Charles
                   Hauser with E.I.O -
                   infiltrated our group.  I
                   guess Cohaagen didn't trust
                   you any more when you and
                   I...

        Her gesture suggests their liaison.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yeah.  And I can't even
                   remember it.  We'll have to
                   arrange a return bout.

                                 MELINA
                   ...so he had your memory
                   wiped and fixed you up with
                   a new identity.

                                 QUAIL
                   But - the Sphinx.  Why is
                   that stuck in my mind?  Why's
                   it so important?

                                 MELINA
                   I don't know.

                                 BENNIE
                   Just an ole heap o' stone,
                   boss.

                                 QUAIL
                   It's more than that, Bennie,
                   I know it's more.  Somehow
                   it's connected.

        He slumps into a chair with frustration.

                                 MELINA
                           (reflecting)
                   Maybe there's a way  you can
                   get your memory back.

                                 QUAIL
                   How?  What?  Where?  When?

                                 MELINA
                   A bit of Martian Wisdom.
                   We're not all stupid
                   colonists.


99      EXT. CITY - NIGHT

        Bennie, Quail and Melina are walking in a crowded area
        of town.  Water sellers and food stalls are everywhere.
        An ARMORED LOUDSPEAKER VEHICLE appears, broadcasting to
        the crowd.  It is also swinging a powerful searchlight
        along the footpaths and streets.

                                 VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER
                   ...all residents are to
                   report to their nearest
                   space-travel agent within
                   twelve hours, all residents
                   will be departing on shuttles
                   within twenty-four hours.  Air
                   and water supplies will be cut
                   off at that time.  I repeat...

                                 MELINA
                   He's doing it!

                                 QUAIL
                   What?  Why?

                                 MELINA
                   Clearing everyone out!  It's
                   been rumored for months...

        The searchlight approaches Bennie, Quail and Melina.  Bennie
        ducks into a doorway, while Quail grabs Melina and kisses
        her passionately.  The light sees only the back of his head.
        She responds warmly to his kiss.

                                 QUAIL
                   Wow.  I can see why I was
                   willing to betray E.I.O.

                                 MELINA
                   I though you believed in
                   our cause?

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes.  Of course.  That, too.

        They move into the crowd.  The message on the
        loudspeaker is repeated.


101     INT. KUATO'S SANCTUARY - NIGHT

        The interior of the room is an amazing contrast to its
        ghetto exterior.  The decor is a baroque combination of
        Middle Eastern opulence and 21st century flash.  It looks
        like something out of "The Arabian Nights".

        A man enters from another room.  Although the man's features
        are East Indian, he is very much a Peter Lorre type;  he
        wears a small fez cap and a white linen robe with a cowl
        draped around the back of his neck.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                           (nodding to
                            Quail)
                   Your servant, Fahreem Kuato.
                   I greet you by the
                   twenty-seven names that still
                   remain, praying that you cast
                   jewels into the darkness and
                   given them to glow with the
                   colors of life.

        As Kuato speaks, Quail, unimpressed, talks, sotto voce,
        to Melina.

                                 QUAIL
                   What use is this weirdo?

                                 MELINA
                   Ssssh...there are skills on
                   mars that Earth has forgotten.

                                 KUATO
                   No need to introduce yourself,
                   Mr. Quail.
                           (smiles at Quail's
                            surprise)
                   Tolerate my presumption, but
                   it does not tax my powers to
                   know that you are the most
                   sought-after man on two
                   worlds.

        From the street the sound of loudspeakers giving information
        about Quail and Co. can be heard.  Searchlight beams
        occasionally sweep past the windows.

                                 KUATO
                           (continuing)
                   This way, my dear man.  We
                   have much to accomplish --
                           (ominously)
                   -- and very little time.


102     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT

        A Bysantine salon filled with enormous Oriental pillows.

        (NOTE:  In the scenes inside Kuato's sanctum, the loudspeaker
                vans in the outside streets can be heard from time to
                to time.  They are repeating the evacuation message
                from scene 99, but alternating it with a call for the
                apprehension of Quail and Melina...

                                 VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER
                   ...for information leading to
                   these arrests, first-class
                   travel to Earth will be
                   provided plus a weekend at
                   the Leningrad Disneyworld,
                   all expenses paid.  I repeat,
                   an Oriental girl and Earthman,
                   possibly to be found in the
                   company of a black taxi driver.
                   These are dangerous subversives
                   and sworn enemies of the
                   glorious Peoples Republic of
                   Mars...)

                                 KUATO
                   The turbulence you hear
                   outside is but a reflection
                   of the turmoil within you.
                   You have brought it to Mars
                   in your search for yourself.

        Kuato takes a seat on the pillows, invites the others to
        join him.  Quail hesitates.

                                 QUAIL
                   And you're going to help me
                   by reading my mind?

                                 KUATO
                   Indubitably.  There is only
                   small matter of a fee.

        THREE RESPONSES COME TOGETHER.

                                 QUAIL
                   A fee!

                                 KAUTO
                   Naturally.

                                 MELINA
                   This is for our cause!

                                 KUATO
                           (soothingly)
                   Income before ideals.  Shall
                   we say five-hundred-thousand
                   dollars?

                                 QUAIL
                           (appalled)
                   Five-hundred-thousand Martian
                   dollars, that's...
                           (think,
                            calculating the
                            exchange rate)

                                 KUATO
                   Not Martian dollars, Mr.
                   Quail - Earth dollars.

                                 MELINA
                   That's interplanetary robbery!

                                 QUAIL
                   With today's exchange rate...
                   that's over two million
                   Martian dollars!

                                 KUATO
                           (suave)
                   What price do you put, Mr.
                   Quail, on the future of the
                   solar system?

                                 BENNIE
                   Aw, come off it, man.  Just
                   for a bit of mumbo-jumbo
                   with a crystal ball.

                                 KUATO
                           (his manner
                            slipping)
                   Listen, buster, we're talking
                   heavy stuff here.  You try
                   and work out what's with this
                   guy!

        He jerks his thumb toward Quail.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay!  Okay!  I'll pay it,
                   but the Interstellar Trade
                   Practices Commission might
                   be interested in this.

        Everyone calms down.

        Kuato smiles.  He extinguishes all the lights save one
        small blue one, which illuminates the room eerily, like
        a seance.

                                 KUATO
                   Retrieving the past is like
                   walking backwards along a
                   perilous road.  The
                   half-recalled, the
                   half-forgotten, the repressed,
                   the fantasies, the triumphs,
                   joys, failures, betrayals...

        He closes his eyes and concentrates.

                                 KUATO
                           (continuing)
                   Yes... I can feel it... a
                   wall.  Erasure techniques are
                   so brutal.
                           (frowns; scans
                            harder)
                   Blocks.  Side channels.
                   Future and past all jumbled.
                   I shall have to enter deep
                   trance to break through.
                           (rising)
                   I will be scanning you through
                   the Oracle Head.

        Kauto turns around and sits down with back toward Quail.
        He reaches up and lowers his cowl, REVEALING:

        A TINY LITTLE HEAD GROWING OUT OF THE BACK OF HIS NECK!

        The head's eyes are closed in sleep.  It is utterly hairless
        and looks like one of those dolls made from dried apples; a
        shriveled, ancient-looking yellow little ball.

        The LITTLE FACE TWITCHED, YAWNS and OPENS ITS EYES, BLINKS.
        It looks at Melina, then at Quail.

        It opens its toothless little mouth and SPEAKS.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                   Do not fear me.  I need your
                   openness...

        ZOOM IN ON QUAIL'S EYES.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                           (continuing)
                   Open you thoughts to my
                   presence...

        CONTINUE ZOOM UNTIL ENTIRE FRAME is filled by QUAIL'S EYE.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                           (continuing)
                   Open...

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


        BLACKNESS BROKEN BY PULSES OF WHITE LIGHT

        The alternations between dark (ACTION) and white (LIGHT)
        are RHYTHMICAL so as to create a hypnotic, dream-like
        feeling.


103     WHITE LIGHT

        Fades to reveal a dramatic CLOSE UP of the SPHINX.  We see
        its face, shoulders and behind it the red Martian sky --


103A    PULL BACK

        to reveal the Sphinx is a PROJECTION on a screen in a
        windowless briefing room.  Quail is seated across from
        Cohaagen and other SENIOR E.I.O. OFFICERS.  On the walls
        are numerous satellite photos, recon maps and excavation
        drawings -- all relating to the Sphinx.


107     EXT. MARTIAN SPHINX - SUNSET

        Scaffolding and excavation works cover a wall of the Sphinx;
        the Sphinx's huge CARVED FACE visible in the background.

        Quail and several other E.I.O. agents stand poised, wearing
        breathing masks and protective gear, as a powerful
        excavation device prizes back a huge stone, revealing
        an ENTRANCE TO SOME KIND OF HIDDEN CHAMBER.

        The other agents are fearful, don't want to proceed.  Quail
        ignores them, enters the chamber --


107A    CLOSE - QUAIL'S FACE

        As he enters.  We read awe, shock and fascination on his
        features.  He approaches something we can't see.  His
        hand reaches out.

        Suddenly, a bolt of incredible powerful energy flashes out,
        striking Quail like a bolt of lightning.

        WHITE LIGHT.


105     INT. LAST CHANCE SALOON - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina are dancing.  The faceted mirror ball on
        the ceiling become the --

        WHITE LIGHT.


106     INT. BEDROOM - DAY

        Melina watches from the bed as Quail dresses.  She rises,
        with only the sheet around her, tries desperately to make
        Quail stay.  Plainly he wants to, but he can't.  They kiss
        lingeringly;  then Quail, as if "called to duty," exits.

        WHITE LIGHT.


108     INT. DETENTION CELL - WINDOWLESS

        Quail alone, hands bound, in a holding chamber.  Suddenly,
        the door opens and THREE BEEFY E.I.O. AGENTS enter.  They
        grab Quail to haul him out.  Quail battles them with
        amazing skill and resourcefulness.  With his bound hands
        he SLUGS ONE MAN, hurling him into a wall;  he RABBIT-
        PUNCHES a second man with a two-handed blow and KNOCKS
        HIM UNCONSCIOUS.  The third man sneaks around behind
        Quail and DROPS HIM WITH A BLACKJACK to the back of the
        head.

        WHITE LIGHT.


109     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - WINDOWLESS

        Quail on his back, all four limbs pinned by some futuristic
        version of "the rack," his head held imobile by a FEARSOME
        DEVICE similar to the one we glimpsed on Earth, in the van
        the two agents tried to shove him into.

        Several DOCTORS stand over him.  INTO FRAME moves...
        Cohaagen!

        Cohaagen orders the doctors to attach electrodes to PROBES
        already inserted into Quail's brain.  As they turn up the
        power, Quail's face contorts in a grimace of agony --

                                 ORACLE HEAD'S VOICE
                   You have seen your past.
                   Now read the future...

        WHITE LIGHT.


110     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL - DAY OR NIGHT

        The same scene we saw during the film's OPENING SEQUENCE.

        A man wearing a LIGHT-WEIGHT THERMAL SUIT races through a
        LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES beneath him, as
        if in an earthquake.  EXPLOSIONS rumble deep in the ground
        below him.  Suddenly we realize -- the man is Quail


        INSERT - CLOSE - QUAIL

        He throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fearfully,
        as he runs.  Suddenly a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT floods in
        from ahead of him;  he puts up his hands to protect his
        eyes -- and sees his hands are SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD!

        Quail runs even faster -- ahead the BRILLIANT LIGHT seems
        to promise safety.  He battles toward it.  SOUNDS OF
        EXPLOSIONS increase, building urgency.  Up ahead, emerging
        from the light, HANDS REACH OUT TO HELP QUAIL.  He seems
        almost to safety.  But just as he REACHES THE HANDS --

        TWO GUNSHOTS RING OUT!

                                                      SHOCK CUT TO:


111     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT

        Quail awakens with a jolt.  White as a sheet... sweating
        like he's just run ten miles.  Then:  a transformation
        seems to come over him.  He LOOKS -- and SEES:

        KUATO slumped across the cushions -- MELINA beside Kuato --
        BENNIE standing holding a smoking GUN trained on Kuato.

                                 MELINA
                           (rushes to Quail)
                   Charles!  Are you all right?

        Quail stares at her, as if an entire bank of lost memories
        were suddenly clicking back into place --

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   He kept dragging you deeper
                   and deeper into the trance!
                   We couldn't wake either of
                   you!

                                 BENNIE
                   You stopped breathing!

        Quail gives Bennie that same eerie look, then turns to
        Kuato, who is sprawled motionless across the pillows, a
        curl of smoke rising from two entry wounds in his spine.

                                 QUAIL
                   Why did you kill him?  It
                   was the next bit I really...

                                 BENNIE
                   No choice, boss.  It was him
                   or you.

        Quail lunges across the pillows to Kuato's unbreathing
        form.  Quail shakes the ancient mystic, trying to find a
        last flicker of life.

        Kuato's body is dead white.  Quail releases his grip;
        he about to give up when --

        A MUFFLED CHOCKED SOUND comes from behind Kuato's neck.
        It's the Oracle Head!  Quail instantly rolls Kuato's body
        over.  The Head is still alive!

        Quail bends closer, kneeling.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                           (whispers)
                   -- the vengence you seek...
                   and the salvation of Mars...
                   are waiting for you in the
                   crown of the Sphinx.
                           (sags, gasping)

        The Oracle Head lets out a LONG SIGH and goes limp, a
        small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its
        mouth.

                                 BENNIE
                   Phobos and Demos!  What was
                   that all about?

        Quail ignores him, still kneeling -- deep in thought --
        over the Oracle Head.

                                 MELINA
                   Are you okay?... Charles?
                   Doug?  Whoever?

        Quail reaches out and closes the Oracle Head's tiny
        eyelids.  Melina and Bennie exchange a glance.  Then:


        QUAIL

        Stands.  For a moment his back is to Melina and Bennie.
        Then he turns.

        He has become a different man.  His eyes gleam.  He is
        forceful, purposeful, contained.  Once again the ace E.I.O.
        agent.  Melina senses immediately that this is the man she
        knew before

                                 QUAIL
                           (even his voice
                            has changed)
                   I'm fine... only I'm not
                   Doug -- I'm Charles Hauser...
                   and I know everything Hauser
                   knew.

        He turns to Bennie

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Bennie, where's your depot?

                                 BENNIE
                           (working it out)
                   Well... you go outta here...
                   take a left, then down past
                   the first... no second...
                   water bureau you...

                                 QUAIL
                           (briskly)
                   Can you get us there?

                                 BENNIE
                   No problem.

                                 MELINA
                   But why?

                                 QUAIL
                   We're going to the Sphinx.

        He strides off.  The others follow, still full of questions.

                                 BENNIE
                   Impossible, man.  Guards
                   everywhere.

                                 MELINA
                   The Oracle... what did you
                   learn?

                                 QUAIL
                   Only everything.  I've got
                   total recall.

        They are now heading down the stairs toward the street.


114     EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

        Quail, Melina and Bennie make their way through the crowds
        to Bennie's depot.  The streets are even busier then before -
        people are now beginning to evacuate the city.  Everyone is
        carrying their possessions - bundles, suitcases, pets, etc.,
        etc.  The loudspeaker vans are still touring and broad-
        casting the same message.

        Bennie indicates a building on their left.


115     INT. CAR POOL - EARLY MORNING

        Bennie and Melina follow Quail as he walks up and down the
        rows of vehicles in the vast building.  There are bull-
        dozers and ore haulers as well as solar taxis.

                                 BENNIE
                   We'll never get near the
                   Sphinx!  They'll blow us
                   apart!

        Quail ignores him as he continues to mumble to himself.
        He rapidly but carefully inspects each vehicle as they
        pass.  Camera tracks rapidly with them.

                                 MELINA
                   What are we doing, Charles?
                   For God's sake, tell us.

                                 QUAIL
                   The Sphinx... it's not some
                   useless artifact, it's a
                   machine built by some alien
                   race eighteen millions years
                   ago.  The same race that
                   built the on one Earth...
                   for the same purpose.

        He stops in front of a large, odd-shaped vehicle with a
        large scoop or propeller on the front.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   This is what we need.

        He begins to climb in;  the others follow.

                                 BENNIE
                           (referring to the
                            Sphinx)
                   It's a hunk of old stone,
                   man.

                                 MELINA
                           (ditto)
                   Purpose?  What purpose?

        Bennie starts the engine.

                                 QUAIL
                   Come on, Bennie, move it.
                           (then, to Melina)
                   Have you heard the word,
                   "terriform"?

        Melina shakes her head.  The vehicle moves off.


115A    EXT. AIR LOCK - MORNING

        GUARDS are carefully checking every vehicle leaving the
        city, though this has to be done fairly rapidly because
        of the inhabitants leaving for the Space Ports.

        The vehicle with Bennie, Quail and Melina arrives.


115B    INT. VEHICLE - AIR LOCK - MORNING

        Bennie is nervous.  Melina and Quail are in the back, but
        cannot be seen.  Guards are checking all vehicles exiting,
        looking for Quail and Melina.

                                 BENNIE
                           (calling to
                            Guards)
                   Just deliverin' some old junk
                   to the mine out at Apidalia
                   Planitia.  Got them people
                   you're lookin' for in the
                   back as well.

        The Guards laugh and signal him on.

        Once through the second door of the air lock (i.e. to the
        area outside the city), Quail and Melina emerge and sit
        up on the rear seats.

                                 QUAIL
                   The machine in the Sphinx is
                   tapped straight down to the
                   molten core of this planet.
                   There are tunnels and ducts
                   everywhere, all powered by
                   fusion generators...

                                 BENNIE
                   You sure the little man
                   didn't fry your brain, Quail?

                                 MELINA
                           (overlapping)
                   For what?  To do what?

                                 QUAIL
                   To combine elements in the
                   Martian core and release
                   them as oxygen, hydrogen
                   and nitrogen.

                                 BENNIE
                   That's air!


116B    EXT. DESERT - MORNING

        In a wide shot, the vehicle is traversing the desert.  The
        domed city is some distance in the background.  Voices are
        heard in false perspective.  Emphasis is on the dry and
        hostile natural landscape of Mars.

                                 QUAIL
                   That's right.  Air and water.
                   Terriforming will create a
                   permanent livable environment
                   for Mars.  No more pressurized
                   cities, no more containers in
                   the desert.  There'll be
                   rivers, vegetation - life -
                   the same as Earth.

                                 MELINA
                           (baffled)
                   So why is Cohaagen shipping
                   everyone out?

                                 QUAIL
                   Don't you see?!  From being
                   a pile of red dirt with
                   minerals, Mars is going to
                   change into  a chunk of
                   priceless real estate.

                                 MELINA
                   And Cohaagen's going to own
                   it all!

                                 QUAIL
                   Right!  He can start selling
                   it off to well-heeled investors
                   from Earth.  Beach condos, ski
                   resorts, you name it.

                                 MELINA
                   No wonder he wanted you to...
                   penetrate... out group.

                                 QUAIL
                           (nods)
                   Once word of this gets out,
                   the whole planet will support
                   you.


117     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle is now approaching the Sphinx.  Both it and
        the pyramids can be seen some distance away.

        Voice are heard in CU perspective.

                                 MELINA
                   So what can we do?

                                 QUAIL
                   Ruin his little scheme by
                   terriforming ahead of
                   schedule - while the
                   inhabitants are still here.

        Melina is amazed.

                                 MELINA
                   But who'll work the machine?
                   Do you know how?

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm the only one who does.
                   Why do you think Cohaagen's
                   left me alone all this time?


118     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle is even closer to the Sphinx.

                                 QUAIL
                   I was the first one inside
                   when they cracked the riddle
                   of the Sphinx.  It must've
                   been programmed.  Some kind
                   of...force...shot into me.

                                 MELINA
                   But Cohaagen wiped your
                   memory!!!

                                 QUAIL
                           (smoothly)
                   Just a way of putting me on
                   ice.  He'd of reversed it
                   once the planet was evacuated.

                                 BENNIE
                   Man!  This is real complicated.
                   Go over it again, real slow.


119     INT. VEHICLE - DAY

                                 QUAIL
                           (ignoring Bennie's
                            aside)
                   What he hadn't counted on was
                   your effect on me.

                                 MELINA
                           (smiling)
                   And all without the marvels
                   of modern science!

        Quail looks out the back window, his attention attracted
        by two patrol vehicles.  They are some distance away, but
        approaching steadily.


119A    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        A wide shot shows a total of four patrol vehicles approach-
        ing the vehicle with Quail, Melina and Bennie.  Suddenly,
        it stops moving.


120     INT. VEHICLE - DAY

        The vehicle had just stopped.

                                 QUAIL
                   Bennie, don't stop now, take
                   it...

        He turns to see Bennie is covering him and Melina with a
        pistol.

                                 MELINA
                   You bastard.

                                 BENNIE
                   Like I said.  It's a tough
                   planet.  I'm a baddie, not
                   a goodie.

                                 QUAIL
                   I should have known, you
                   were just too helpful.

                                 BENNIE
                   EIO Rule One, man.  Trust
                   Nobody.  Now you can do
                   your terriforming stuff
                   right when those space
                   shuttles are gone.

                                 MELINA
                   But what about the Martian
                   people?  Out cause?  I thought
                   you believed in it.

                                 BENNIE
                   Your cause?  That bunch of
                   dead beat radicals!  When I
                   hand in this little number...
                           (flicks his gun
                            in Quail's face)
                   ...I'll get real estate rights
                   on the whole of Chryse
                   Planitia...

        At that instant, Melina lunges, PUNCHES A RED EMERGENCY
        BUTTON.  The VENT beside Bennie's hand BLOWS OPEN, [causing]
        a powerful suction caused by Mars's vacuum atmosphere.
        Bennie's gun hand is PLANTED AGAINST THE VENT [OPENING.]

        Simultaneously, the air in the vehicle starts rushing out!
        All three parties begin choking.  As Bennie's mechanical
        hand claws for the lever that seals the vent, Quail has
        a moment to jump him.  He pounds Bennie's gun hand, the
        PISTOL IS SUCKED, CLATTERING, OUT THE VENT!

        Quail delivers a roundhouse punch to Bennie, knocking him
        clear across the bus.

        Melina seals the vent, REPRESSURIZES THE CABIN.

        Bennie gets up off the floor, shaking off Quail's punch--


121     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The E.I.O. vehicle are a half mile off -- and closing in.


122     INT. SAND MOLE - DAY

        Quail glances at the vehicles, turns to Bennie -- ready
        to jump him.  But stops short at what he sees Bennie doing.

        Bennie is clipping on his MECHANICAL ARM.  It sprouts
        several rows of vicious-looking STEEL BLADES --

                                 BENNIE
                   This makes Bennie a cut above
                   anyone else.

        Bennie presses another button and the BLADES START SPINNING.
        Bennie's mechanical arm is in effect now a BUZZ SAW!

        The fight begins.  Bennie attacks Quail with his buzz-saw
        arm;  Quail dodges.  Bennie's arm shreds various articles
        in the cabin -- and keeps Melina at bay with well-timed
        swipes.  Finally Bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to
        Quail's jaw with his real hand.  Quail sprawls, dazed.

        Now Bennie goes for the kill.  But Melina leaps onto him.
        Bennie grabs her by the hair and moves his SPINNING HAND
        in for the quick kill.  Melina clutches the terrifying
        appendage with both hands, desperately keeping it at bay.
        But her strength is no match for Bennie; the whirring
        blades are just about to bite into Melina's neck when --

        Quail comes back, lands a ferocious rabbit punch to
        Bennie's spine.  Quail lunges at him, grabs the blade
        weapon;  he and Bennie crash into the cabin wall and --

        The BLADE RIPS CLEAR THROUGH THE MOLE'S WALL!  Alarms
        sound as a GAPING HOLE IS BLOWN IN THE SIDE OF THE
        CABIN!  ALL THE AIR IS SUCKED OUT BY MARS'S EXTERNAL
        VACUUM!

        Now no one can breathe.  They all claw for their masks,
        [still] in place.  Bennie is first;  he recovers, lunges
        with his SPINNING ARM for Quail.  Quail barely dodges,
        grabs the arm, muscles it back toward Bennie --

        The SPINNING BLADES SEVER BENNIE'S OWN OXYGEN LINE!  Gasp-
        ing, he falters.  Quail aims a titanic blow, PUNCHES
        BENNIE out through the hole in the mole's wall!

        Quail and Melina, masks on, stare out as Bennie claws
        desperately at his severed air line.  The Martian vacuum
        pulls the oxygen from Bennie's lungs, he chokes, staggers --


122AA   EXT. DESERT - DAY

        Bennie is beside the vehicle.  He implodes like a balloon
        with all its air gone.


122AB   INT/EXT. VEHICLE - DAY

        Melina hides her face in horror.  At that instant --


122A    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        Bullets dig into the sand all around the vehicle.  The
        patrol cars are only a few hundred yards away!  Loud-
        speakers call for Quail's surrender.


122B    INT. VEHICLE - DAY

        Quail lunges for the vehicle controls.  Presses a button
        marked "Dive".  The vehicle tilts.


122C    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand.  As the
        patrol cars close in and rake the desert with gunfire,
        the vehicle vanishes from sight.  In the distance, the
        Sphinx looms ominously.

        A driver in one of the patrol vehicles (filmed from outside
        the windscreen) is speaking into a microphone.  He can't
        be heard but can only be radioing a report.


123     INT. SAND MOLE - MOVING - UNDERGROUND

        The little mining vehicle moves powerfully, propelled by
        its BORER NOSE.

        Quail mans the controls while Melina struggles to shore up
        the gaping hole in the side, into which SAND is POURING
        as the mole moves forward.  Quail looks at a compass in
        the control panel.  He makes a correction.

                                 QUAIL
                           (shouts over
                            engine noise)
                   Hope I've got this direction
                   right.

        Sand pours over him from bullet holes resulting from the
        encounter with patrol cars.

        CU speedometer:  22 MPH.  Every other gauge is overheating,
        flashing WARNING LIGHTS --


124     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        Cohaagen and a number of his associates, plus scientists
        and heavily arms troops are present.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   The air supply is off under
                   the domes?

                                 EMILE
                   Yes, sir.  In a couple of
                   hours it'll be all gone.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Any trouble with the rabble?

                                 EMILE
                   Not much, sir.  A lot of
                   complaining.  But they're
                   all heading towards the
                   shuttle areas.

        On some of the video screens a number of space shuttles
        can be seen, ready for departure to Earth.


123     INT. TUNNEL BENEATH SPHINX

        The Mole bores through a sand wall, emerges into a cramped
        horizontal tunnel.  Quail and Melina leap out.  The poor
        Mole is smoking like an overheated drill bit.  Its nose
        is worn to a nub.

                                 MELINA
                   We got in with this thing,
                   but we'll never get back out.

                                 QUAIL
                   A shame.  Such a pleasant
                   trip.

        There's a lighted area at the end of the tunnel.  Quail
        and Melina hurry toward it, moving silently, close to
        the wall.


126B    INT. MAIN DOWNSHAFT

        They draw up an abyss -- where their tunnel intersects the
        MAIN DOWNSHAFT.  Melina gasps at the colossal scale of the
        drilling, hundreds of yards across, deeper than the eye
        can see, and crisscrossed by catwalks, buttresses and
        super-sophisticated technology.

        Quail and Melina are forty feet below the upper end of
        the main downshaft.  They can look up the shaft and
        see the first interior level of the Sphinx itself.

                                 QUAIL
                           (points down
                            shaft)
                   This is the main tap --
                   straight down to the core
                   of Mars.  When we trigger
                   the mechanism, fusion
                   reactors will detonate down
                   there -- four hundred miles
                   deep.

                                 MELINA
                   Remind me not to slip.

                                 QUAIL
                   The new elements will come
                   booming up through this
                   shaft -- and six thousand
                   others all around the
                   planet.

        He's right at home -- and full of confidence.

        Quail climbs onto the ladder, which links various top
        levels.

        He starts to climb.  Melina follows him.  They are tiny
        figures.  The space around them plummets down to infinity.


127     INT. CORRIDOR AT TOP OF SHAFT - LOWEST MANNED LEVEL (LEVEL ONE)

        A patrol of NINE HEAVILY-ARMED GUARDS appear from a corridor
        in Level One -- directly above where Quail and Melina are
        climbing.


128     ON THE WALL OF THE SHAFT

        Quail and Melina's heads inch into view at floor level.
        They take one peek at these formidable warriors and duck
        back swiftly out of sight.


129     INT. TOP OF SHAFT - LOWEST MANNED LEVEL (LEVEL ONE)

                                 GUARD LEADER
                           (to two of his
                            men)
                   Stay in contact.  I want to
                   hear from this checkpoint
                   every four minutes.

        Seven of the Guards move off, two remain in position.

        We HEAR the FOOTSTEPS of the seven guards recede.

        The two remaining guards realize their isolation; they
        glance tensely to one another.

                                 GUARD #1
                   Did you hear something?

                                 GUARD #2
                   No.  Where?

                                 GUARD #1 
                   Over there.

        The First Guard points to the edge  of the main shaft --
        right where Quail and Melina are hiding.  The Guards
        cock their weapons, start cautiously forward.  Just as
        they're about to peer over the brink, guns at the
        ready:

                                 QUAIL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                           (from behind the
                            guards)
                   I'm not there, boys.  I'm
                   here.

        The guards spin around, weapons poised.  Standing in the
        shadows, near the corridor, is Quail!  (Still with no
        gun)

        Both guards walk quickly toward Quail, covering him with
        their weapons.

                                 GUARD #1
                           (to Guard #2)
                   Watch him.  He was EIO trained.
                   They're all full of tricks.

                                 GUARD #2
                   Yeah?  Like...who was that
                   guy? -- Fred Bond??
                           (to Quail)
                   Keep 'em up, Fred, keep 'em
                   up.

        Quail has his arms raised high.  Just as the Guards reach
        him, he fizzes electronically, emitting a humming sound,
        then disappears.

                                 GUARD #1
                   A hologram!

        Before either Guard can react, the real Quail appears --
        one foot behind them.  With two LIGHTNING BLOWS, he
        dispatches the Guards.  (Apparently Quail has climbed out
        of the shaft while the Guards were distracted.)

        Quail snatches both Guards' weapons, grenades and ammo
        belts.  Melina climbs out of the shaft.  Quail tosses her
        one of the Guard's guns.


130     INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL ONE

        ALARMS go off everywhere.  Quail -- carrying a gun and all
        the grenades and ammo belts -- and Melina (just carrying a
        gun) bolt down a corridor past a sign: "LEVEL ONE".

                                 MELINA
                           (running)
                   Where'd you get that little
                   trick?

                                 QUAIL
                           (running)
                   Mail-order company.  It's a
                   great one for fooling the
                   wife.


131     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN)

        Cohaagen and his Aides hear the ALARMS, see Quail and
        Melina on MONITORS as they race down the corridor on
        Level One.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   How the hell did they get in?

                                 SECURITY AIDE
                   Up the fusion core.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Up the fusion core??

        He exhibits begrudging admiration for Quail.

                                 SECURITY AIDE
                           (studies monitor
                            more carefully)
                   They're on Level One.

        A wall sign behind Cohaagen reads:  "LEVEL THIRTEEN".

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Seal all upper levels.

        A button is pressed and huge doors slide across in front
        of the formidable doors already closing the Control Room
        off from the outside corridors.


133     INT. LEVEL ONE CORRIDOR

        Quail and Melina are still racing through the corridors.
        He passes her a fresh ammo belt.

                                 QUAIL
                           (indicates
                            weapons)
                   Know how to use one of these?

        Melina expertly ejects her spent clip (that Guards fired
        at Quail), slams in a fresh clip and cocks the gun.

        Quail has a half-second to react, impressed, then --
        FOUR GUARDS pound into view at the end of the corridor.

        Melina opens fire, nails two.  Quail heaves a grenade; as
        it EXPLODES, he and Melina bolt down a side corridor --


134     INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS, CATWALKS, STAIRS

        ALARMS continue as Quail and Melina dash down the side
        passageway.  MORE GUARDS cut them off;  Melina's machine
        gun sends them scattering --

        Quail pauses at a corner.  He looks around quickly and sees
        that an elevator is arriving.  He motions Melina back.  The
        doors of the elevator begin to open.  Very quickly, Quail
        bobs his head and arm around the corner.  He calls out,
        loudly...

                                 QUAIL
                   Catch!
        He hurls something toward the armed men in the elevator.
        Instinctively one of them reaches for the thrown object.
        It is an explosive device of some sort.  Quail and Melina
        press themselves against the wall just around a corner from
        the elevator.  There is a tremendous explosion.

        Quail, followed by Melina, rounds a corner.  The elevator
        is in ruins; bodies are scattered everywhere.

                                 MELINA
                   Great stuff, but how do we
                   get up?

        She points toward the upper levels.


135     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN)

        Melina and Quail can be seen on the security monitor from
        a high angle.  Quail looks up, spots the monitor, and
        shoots is to pieces.  The image on the screen goes black.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Forget them.  We'll pick up
                   Quail once the shuttles have
                   left for Earth.


137     INT. CORRIDOR

        Quail spots a large WINDOWED AIR LOCK at the end of the
        corridor.  He and Melina race to it.  Quail starts to open
        the inner door of the air lock.

                                 QUAIL
                   If you're afraid of the
                   heights, you better get
                   over it real quick.

        He is pulling Melina through the inner air lock door just
        as --

        GUARDS stampede around the corner of the corridor toward
        them.

        Quail is out of sight, but they see Melina poised near the
        window.  She waves and smiles to them, hiding her gun behind
        her body.  They slow down and approach less cautiously,
        beguiled by her manner and attractiveness.  As they get
        close, she suddenly lifts her gun and opens fire, mowing
        them down.


140     EXT. SPHINX'S FACE - DAY

        Quail and Melina climb through the outer air lock door.
        They are at the Sphinx's shoulder, with a dizzying drop
        beneath them.  Melina looks down.  She's sorry she did:
        the fall is at least 200 feet.  (Both are wearing their
        breathing apparatus.)

        Quail and Melina start to climb.  Up the Sphinx's shoulder,
        along its Egyptian-like headdress --


141     INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        Cohaagen's chief aide, Emile, addresses him quietly.

                                 EMILE
                   If Quail's the only one who
                   can operate all this...
                           (gestures toward
                            Sphinx's controls)
                   ...then he can call all the
                   shots.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   We'll tell him the computer's
                   worked out the operational
                   details so we don't really
                   need him.  We're just doing
                   him a favor.

                                 EMILE
                   And if that doesn't work?

                                 COHAAGEN
                   We offer him rewards.

                                 EMILE
                   What if that doesn't work?

                                 COHAAGEN
                   We'll torture him.  You don't
                   think I got this far by being
                   a nice guy?


142     EXT. SPHINX'S FACE - DAY

        Quail and Melina traverse across the cheekbones, haul
        themselves up at the base of the red translucent eyes --


142A    INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        The video monitors show the space shuttles.  An operator,
        with earphones, turns to Cohaagen.

                                 OPERATOR
                   First of the shuttles ready
                   for departure, sir.  Two
                   minute countdown.


142B    EXT. SPHINX - DAY

        Quail jams THREE GRENADES against the glass of the eyes,
        pulls Melina back behind the stone cheeks --


143     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM

        A MUFFLED EXPLOSION (due to the thin Martian atmosphere)
        detonates overhead.  THE SPHINX'S RIGHT EYE BLOWS IN a
        storm of shards and shrapnell.

        Instantly, the room turns into a hurricane as the Martian
        vacuum sucks out all air!  Everyone panics, grabbing their

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Seal the breach!  Repressurize!

        An aide dives for an EMERGENCY SWITCH.  But now --

        Quail and Melina, wearing breather masks, bursts in onto
        an overhead catwalk.  They OPEN FIRE on the Guards, who are
        choking, struggling with their masks.

        An EMERGENCY PRESSURE SEAL powers into place, sealing the
        breach in the eye.  REPRESSURIZATION comes up, the internal
        atmosphere stabilizes --

        None of the men inside the control room still moves.  The
        victors tug off their masks, spring down to the main level.
        Melina hurries to the main control panel.

        Melina looks towards the video monitors showing half a
        dozen huge space shuttles lined up for departure.

                                 MELINA
                   Those shuttles are starting up
                   any minute.  If you know how
                   to work this thing, you better
                   do it now.

        Quail tentatively approaches the imposingly complex
        machinery.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes...

        He hesitates.

                                 MELINA
                   Don't you know how?

        Transfixed, mesmerized, Quail moves closer to the control
        panel.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes... there's a vital
                   connection missing...

        He approaches even closer.  He begins to raise his arm
        towards a blank area a little above his head.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   ...me...

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Wait!

                                 MELINA
                   Don't wait!

                                 COHAAGEN
                   If you activate the mechanism
                   you'll die...there were
                   glimpses of it in your
                   memory.

                                 QUAIL
                   Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a
                   long tunnel, a brilliant
                   white light, hands reaching
                   for me...

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (assured)
                   That's your death.  That's
                   what it looks like.  That's
                   what is always looks like.

        Quail looks around him, half-convinced.

                                 MELINA
                           (looking toward
                            space shuttles
                            on video screens)
                   Charles - for Mars's sake....

        Quail hesitates.  He looks from Melina to Cohaagen.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   It's not too late.  Join us
                   again.  U've a lot to offer.
                   A whole world.

        Quail continues to look at him, thoughtfully.

                                 QUAIL
                   You don't deserve a new world,
                   you and people like you made
                   too big a mess of the old one.
                   Time someone else had a
                   chance.

        He turns back to the machine and slowly raises his arm
        again.  His fingers reach towards the blank section on
        the panel.  Slowly, through the panel, a luminous hand
        reaches toward Quail's fingers.  Gently, the fingers of
        the two hands touch.

        The entire control room begins to rumble and shudder.  As
        Quail reaches for Melina, Cohaagen suddenly dives on him.
        They grapple amid the shuddering Sphinx and can be seen
        only intermittently as debris crashes around them.

        The fight ends as Cohaagen is hurled backwards and
        disappears when a section of floor collapses underneath him.


144     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL

        A reprise of the sequence that opened the movie.

        Quail RUNS THROUGH A LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS.  THE GROUND
        HEAVES BENEATH HIM ... HUGE STONE BLOCKS CRASH DONW ON
        ALL SIDES!  We hear an EXPLOSION and ANOTHER and ANOTHER,
        each one SOUNDING CLOSER than the last --

        Quail clamps him breathing mask on as he runs.  Is this
        his own death?  Where is Melina?

        The tunnel walls are just like the ones in Quail's
        original nightmare -- bright reddish-orange, clay and
        quartz.

        Quail throws a backward glance fearfully over his shoulder.
        The EXPLOSIONS are closer.  Suddenly --

        Up ahead appears a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT.  Quail sees it,
        but it only terrifies him more.  Is it death he's running
        to?  He hurries on with all his strength, but --

        Just as he nears the white light, HE FALLS.  On his knees,
        too weak to move.  He struggles --

        HANDS ARE REACHING OUT TO HIM, from out of the brilliant
        light.  Quail stretches for them, just as --

        A FINAL EXPLOSION blows him forward -- straight into the
        WHITE LIGHT!  The HANDS SEIZE HIM, pull him upward to --


145     EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - DAY

        The hands belong to breather-masked MINERS, dismounting
        rapidly from an overloaded transport vehicle which was
        taking them to the Space Port.  Quail looks from them to
        Melina, who is walking towards the group.

        
        QUAIL'S P.O.V. - MINERS' MASKED FACES

        The miners' desert garb, shield goggles and breathers add
        to the surreal nightmare quality of Quail's tortured
        perspective --


        BACK TO QUAIL

        In terror, lost, disoriented totally.

                                 QUAIL
                   Am I dying?

                                 MASKED MINER
                   I won't lie to you, pal.
                   You are.

                                 MINER (from Melina's bar)
                   I'd say in about forty years...
                           (he and others
                            help Quail to
                            his feet)
                   ...come on, we've gotta get
                   to the Space Port.  That
                   Intergalactic Napoleon's
                   switched off the air.

                                 2ND MINER
                   Shippin' us all out.  Mars
                   is finished.

        A MINER'S WIFE watches them.  She is crying.

        Quail looks up at the sky.  Melina follows his glance.
        So do the others.

        Slowly, but perceptibly, the color is changing from yellow
        to blue.

                                 MELINA
                   It's happening.

                                 MINER
                   What is it?

        All the miners are puzzled, apprehensive.  Quail reaches
        toward the one who spoke to him before and pulls off his
        breathing apparatus.  At first the man is shocked, then
        realizes he can breathe without it.  Quail takes off
        his own, then Melina's

        All the miners watch in amazement.  They all remove their
        breathing masks.

                                 QUAIL
                   That's just the start.  Next
                   there'll be rain and growth
                   and ... life.

        Melina embraces him.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Rekall could never have come
                   up with anything like this.

        Melina looks oddly at him, smiling, mysterious.

        As the sky becomes more and more blue, more of the Miners
        descend from the bus.  Softly at first, then with more and
        more confidence, they begin singing the Martian National
        Anthem.

        The music swells.  Quail puts his arm around Melina.  They
        both join in the chorus.

        It reaches an impassioned crescendo as the FRAME FREEZES
        and the END CREDITS ROLL UP the screen.


                             THE END

      EXT. PARIS - DAY
      
      CRANE DOWN from a view of Paris on a misty day.   Cool,
      gray and beautiful.
      
      A taxi stops by the curb of a wide, cobbled street. All
      around there is bustle and activity, with cars and people
      hurrying about their business.
      
      The door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female
      legs in Christian Louboutin high heels swing out.
      
      
      INT. GARE DE L'EST, PARIS - DAY
      
      WE FOLLOW the legs up the steps, across the concourse,
      through the station. Men turn and stare.
      
      CARA MASON (30, stunning) shows no sign of noticing. She
      wears dark glasses and carries a traveling bag in one
      hand, a copy of the International Herald Tribune in the
      other.
      
      
      INT. BRASSERIE, GARE DE L'EST - DAY
      
      A YOUNG WAITER wiping down the bar stops to watch Cara
      enter and take a seat at a table slightly set apart.
      
      An OLDER WAITER approaches her. They exchange a few
      words and he walks toward the bar.
      
                              WAITER
                She's waiting for someone.
      
                              YOUNGER WAITER
                Probably waiting for me.
      
                              WAITER
                The door's waiting for you if you
                don't get back to work.
      
      A MESSENGER clad in leather, wearing a motorcycle helmet,
      enters the cafe and looks around. He consults a
      photograph.
      
      His eyes land on Cara. He walks over and holds out a
      document-sized envelope.
      
                              MESSENGER
                C'est vous, Mademoiselle?
                                                               2.
      
      
                                CARA
                Oui.
      
      As the messenger walks away she opens the folder and
      shakes out the contents. There is a ticket for the
      Orient Express and a handwritten letter...
      
      She spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure
      map. Her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as
      she reads...
      
                              ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.)
                     (English accent)
                They are following you Cara.
      
      She looks up. Takes out a small makeup mirror and holds
      it in front of her face to glance around behind her...
      
                              ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                They think you'll lead them to me.
                But if you follow my instructions
                closely, there is a way for us to
                get away...
      
      Cara scans the rest of the letter.
      
      CAMERA glides down to see the signature at the bottom:
      "Love, Alexander."
      
      We barely have time to read this before Cara's perfectly
      manicured hand crumples the letter, places it in a saucer
      and sets fire to it.
      
      The YOUNG WAITER hurries over, alarmed.
      
                                YOUNGER WAITER
                Mademoiselle!    Je vous en prie--
      
      Cara is already gathering her things and walking away.
      
      
      INT. GARE DE L'EST STATION - MOMENTS LATER
      
      As Cara walks toward the platform...
      
                              ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.)
                Take the 4:25 Orient Express to
                Venice. En route select a man my
                approximate height and weight...
      
      Her eyes scan the platform.
                                                                3.
      
      
                                 ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   Have faith Cara. I'll be with you
                   soon.
      
      CARA'S POV
      
      Men of various shapes and sizes are boarding "The Orient
      Express." She pauses only long enough to assess and
      discard: too old, too young, too thin, too overweight...
      
      Her gaze comes to rest on a WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN.
      Medium height, medium build. Standing alone. Examining
      his ticket.
      
      Cara glances at her reflection critically in the polished
      glass window of the train. Adjusts her hair and dress.
      
      Satisfied with what she sees, she turns and starts toward
      the WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN like a cat stalking prey.
      
      The CAMERA admiringly FOLLOWS her silky approach.
      
      The FRENCH MAN hears the click of her heels and looks up.
      His mouth falls open...
      
      HIS WIFE arrives and shuts it for him.
      
                                 WIFE
                   What are you doing Vincent?   Our
                   train car is over here!
      
      With a regretful backward glance at Cara, he allows
      himself to be dragged away.
      
      Frustrated, Cara turns and casts about for another
      possibility.
      
      She spots a TOUSLE HAIRED MAN seated on a bench.
      
                                 CONDUCTER (V.O.)
                   All aboard! All aboard the 4:25
                   is departing!
      
      Tousle Hair gathers his bags to get on the train.
      Encouraged, Cara moves to cut him off.
      
      As Tousle Hair stands up REVEAL... he's six foot seven.
      
      Cara stops short, irritated. The MAN behind her boarding
      the train is fumbling with his suitcase and doesn't
      notice. BAM he walks straight into her.
                                                             4.
      
      
                               CARA
                 Ow!
      
                                FRANK
                 Sorry!   Excuse me. Pardone moi.
      
      FRANK TAYLOR (30's, amiable) is a cheerful American
      tourist. Open face, completely lacking in guile.
      
      Frank continues to mutter apologies as he walks gingerly
      around Cara and boards the train.
      
      Cara watches him with thinly veiled contempt. Frank is a
      man of average size, average build... she peers over her
      glasses at him. And her expression slowly changes. She
      follows him onto the train.
      
      ANGLE ON
      
      A GOOD-LOOKING ENGLISHMAN loitering further down the
      platform, reading the Herald Tribune. Or rather, not
      reading it. He's been watching Cara. He lowers the
      paper and climbs onto the train through a different door.
      
      
      EXT. PARIS - DAY
      
      The gleaming Orient Express pulls out of the station and
      gets underway.
      
      
      INT. ORIENT EXPRESS - AFTERNOON
      
      The train is moving.
      
      The thick carpet, the mellow wood of the inlaid panels,
      the subtlety of the Lalique mirrors and the softly lit
      lamps all inspire a feeling of great luxury.
      
      Frank looks vaguely out of place, sitting by the window
      in his casual jeans and pullover sweater. He's wrapped
      up in a dog-eared paperback spy novel. So wrapped up
      that he barely notices Cara sit down opposite him.
      
      She crosses her legs.   He glances up.
      
      Slowly, nonchalantly, she takes her coat off.   Then the
      headscarf tied around her neck.
      
      FOLLOW her sensual movements in TIGHT CLOSE UP. The
      effect is as if she's performing a tantalizing strip
      tease.
                                                               5.
      
      
      Frank is captivated to the point of being unsettled.
      
      She takes off her glasses to reveal stunning eyes.
      
      She goes to remove her mock-turtleneck sweater.   The
      zipper seems to give her trouble.
      
      Without bothering to struggle she sits up in her seat and
      leans toward Frank.
      
                              CARA
                I think I'm going to need your
                help.
      
      Frank is barely able to respond.
      
                                FRANK
                Hmm?
      
                              CARA
                My zipper...
                     (off his blank look)
                It's stuck.
      
      Frank finally moves into action.   He sets his book down
      and leans closer.
      
      Awkwardly he reaches towards Cara's beautiful neck. He
      attempts to unwind the trapped thread of fabric. But the
      zipper resists.
      
                              FRANK
                I'm afraid of hurting you.
      
      She slides forward on her seat, to get even closer.
      
                              CARA
                Don't be afraid.
      
      The train car sways slightly and throws Frank off
      balance. He tugs sharply and the zipper suddenly gives--
      with a tearing sound.
      
      Frank freezes, looking down at the zipper still in his
      fingers.
      
                                FRANK
                I'm... sorry.
      
      Cara's eyes flash fury for a brief moment.
      
                              CARA
                It doesn't matter.
                                                               6.
      
      
                              FRANK
                Maybe I should let you do this--
      
                              CARA
                Don't give up so quickly.
      
      Reluctantly, Frank continues with the zipper. The
      tearing sound continues as he lowers the zipper, inch by
      inch.
      
      First her neck, then her throat, then her cleavage are
      gradually uncovered. The zipper keeps going downward.
      No sign of anything underneath.
      
      Frank is practically sweating.
      
      Finally he uncovers fabric. He finishes unzipping the
      sweater and sits back into his seat.
      
      Cara slides it off her shoulders, sensuous as ever.
      
                               CARA (CONT'D)
                Thanks.
      
      And settles back into her seat, cat-like. He stares at
      her for several moments, at a loss for words.
      
                              FRANK
                My name is Frank.
      
                               CARA
                Cara.
      
      A white-jacketed STEWARD arrives.
      
                              STEWARD
                     (to Frank)
                Will you and your wife take dinner
                here or in the dining car this
                evening, monsieur?
      
                               FRANK
                Pardon me?   Oh, no.   We're not
                actually--
      
                              CARA
                The dining car would be lovely,
                thank you.
      
      The steward nods and disappears.    Frank just stares.
      
                                                          CUT TO:
                                                              7.
      
      
      EXT. MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET
      
      The Orient Express plows through the Alps. PUSH IN ON a
      window where we see Frank and Cara sitting at a romantic,
      candlelit table eating dinner.
      
      
      INT. DINING CAR - EVENING
      
      Linen tablecloths. Fine china. Frank is one of the only
      men in the dining car not in a dinner jacket.
      
      Frank takes out a bottle of pills from his pocket, then
      another and another...
      
      He takes one or two pills from each and swallows them
      methodically. She watches him.
      
                                 CARA
                 Are you ill?
      
                                 FRANK
                 What?   No.
      
      She looks at all the pills spread out beside his plate.
      
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                 Just nervous.    I don't like
                 travelling.
      
                               CARA
                      (gently mocking)
                 So you decided to take a holiday
                 on the Orient Express?
      
      He hesitates.
      
                               FRANK
                 I'm on my honeymoon.
      
                               CARA
                 Your honeymoon?
      
      Cara is annoyed at this revelation.
      
                                CARA (CONT'D)
                 Should we ask the waiter to set
                 another place?
      
                               FRANK
                 She's in Pennsylvania.
      
      Off her questioning look...
                                                                 8.
      
      
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                You're sure you want to hear this?
      
                              CARA
                If you'd like to tell me.
      
                              FRANK
                Two weeks ago she left me. For
                the owner of a pizza parlor.
      
                                CARA
                That's awful.
      
      Frank nods, matter-of-fact.
      
                              FRANK
                No travel insurance. No refund on
                the tickets. So... here I am. On
                my honeymoon.
      
                              CARA
                I'm sorry, Frank.
      
                              FRANK
                I really loved that pizza too.
                "Bala Pizza" if you're ever in
                Rosemont.
      
                              CARA
                I wouldn't touch it.    I'm loyal to
                you.
      
      A waiter delivers their drinks.
      
                                WAITER
                A Cointreau for Mademoiselle. And
                for Monsieur... a "Miller Light."
      
                                FRANK
                Thanks.

      amused by Frank's obliviousness.

                I'm a mysterious woman on a train.
                You tell me what my story is.
      
                                FRANK
                Okay... you'd be a diplomatic
                attaché or... let's see... a girl from
                East Germany whose father's been
                kidnapped by Soviet agents.
                They're blackmailing you into
                stealing... probably a microchip.
                There's usually a microchip
                involved.

                Trouble, certainly.
      
                               CARA
                Danger?
      
                              FRANK
                No doubt. You'll probably be shot
                at in less than two chapters.

      Behind the ornate, 17th century doors is a high-tech
      amphitheater style briefing room. All glass and steel.
      
      Suited bureaucrats and officers from all over Europe
      listen to Ackerman as he leads the meeting from the
      podium.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Our target's name is Alexander
                Pearce. British citizen, born in
                London into an ordinary middle
                class family. The only thing
                remarkable about his childhood was
                a preternatural gift for numbers.
      
      Ackerman clicks a slide projected on a large screen
      behind him: a fuzzy photo of a British schoolboy with a
      shy grin.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

                exams on his own?
      
                              ACKERMAN
                He didn't fix his test scores; he
                fixed the scores for all the girls
                in the class. It made him very
                popular.
      
      A ripple of laughter through the group.

                What started as school pranks
                eventually became something much
                more serious. After a year in the
                training program at Goldman Sachs,
                he decided that gambling suited
                him better than working for a
                living. That, in turn, involved
                him with some rather unsavory
                people and ultimately led him to
                put his financial genius to work
                in his true calling: money
                laundering.

                force to catch a common money

                              ACKERMAN
                There is nothing common about
                Alexander Pearce. Quiet simply,
                he has turned money laundering
                into an art form. His greatest
                innovation: The False Lawsuit.
      
      He clicks through a series of flashy Powerpoint slides
      illustrating Pearce's financial dealings.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Pearce sets up two companies: one
                is a Casino in Arizona for example
                and the other is a shell company
                in the Cayman Islands.

                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                The Cayman Islands company files a
                lawsuit against the casino,
                claiming copyright infringement or
                some other complaint. They
                "succeed" in winning the case and
                the casino pays the shell company
                an enormous settlement.

                The money travels from America to
                the Cayman Islands...
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Yes, but now the money is legal.
      
                              JONES
                Not quite legal. The I.R.S. has
                been cheated out of the revenue.
                     (beat)

                That explains what the American
                harridan is doing here.
      
      Ms. Jones gives him a glacial stare.

      fits the stereotype.

                Ivan Demidov...

                ...Pearce laundered over a billion
                dollars for Demidov. At some
                point Pearce decided he'd rather
                steal from Demidov than help him
                steal.

                 Given Demidov's ties to organized
                 crime, I'd say that was a mistake.
      
                               JONES

                 participating in an investigation
                 of a member of the Russian
                 parliament; our target is
                 Alexander Pearce.
      
      Ackerman smiles coolly at her.

      answer.

      Fog covers the skyline, exposing only the slate rooftops
      of buildings that haven't changed in centuries. We hear
      the sound of water gently lapping the shore.
      
      From out of the mist emerges...
      
      A GUARDACOSTE -- a patrol boat, lights dimmed. It gently
      touches the beach. A CARABINIERI officer lowers a ramp.
      
      An INTERPOL TACTICS TEAM in Kevlar and headgear pours out
      of the patrol boat.
      
      Ackerman steps off, pulling on a vest.     He nods to Goyal.

      Ackerman betrays no impatience. He knows better than to

      The Specialist opens a tool box filled with sophisticated
      gear and gets to work...
      
      
      INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
      
      Wrapping a towel around herself, CARA MASON, the girl
      from the train, stares at herself in the bathroom mirror
      for a beat. So do we.
      
      She steps out into the lofty master bedroom suite.
      
      In the dressing room, Cara calls out to someone in the
      next room.
      
                              CARA
                I'll be ready in fifteen minutes.
      
      Cara sits on the bed, drying her hair. On a night table
      beside her are keys, a wallet and an expensive MAN'S
      WATCH.
      
      Cara pauses; she's heard something.
      
      She walks across the tiled floor to the balcony
      overlooking the elevator entrance.
      
      She freezes; six tactics OFFICERS face her with guns
      drawn.
      
      ACKERMAN steps up the stairs, pistol in hand. He
      gestures at Cara to be quiet and come towards him...
      
      Cara stands stock still for a long instant.   Then...
                                                                15.
      
      
      SLAMS the oaken door of the master bedroom suite in
      Ackerman's face, locking it.

      Ackerman shakes the doorknob, cursing; a Tall Commander
      calls for the BATTERING RAM which is rushed up the
      stairs...
      
      The tactics team CRACKS the door.
      
      Ackerman charges into...
      
      THE BEDROOM
      
      Cara stands frozen beside the man's effects on the night
      table. The wallet. The keys. The watch.
      
                                 ACKERMAN
                 Where is he?
      
      On the other side of the room, Ackerman sees an OPEN
      WINDOW, which the ocean breeze swings.
      
      Rushing forward he sticks his head out the window.
      
      Hanging outside the window is the rigging for a WINDOW
      WASHER'S PLATFORM - a platform that seconds before was
      lowered to the sand below.
      
      In the distance, a recently boarded water taxi pulls away
      from the dock and sails out into the lagoon.
      
      
      IN THE BEDROOM
      
      Ackerman turns to face the study.
      
      On the desk is a cup of coffee with steam gently rising
      from its surface. A cigarette sits lit in an ashtray,
      the smoke curling toward the ceiling.
      
      Ackerman stares at the empty, slowly revolving, chair.
      
      He walks toward CARA, now in custody.      He holds her
      defiant gaze for a moment.
                                                              16.

      Cara looks at him for a moment, then lowers her eyes.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Get her out of my sight.
      
      The Tall Commander shepherds the handcuffed Cara down the
      stairs and into the elevator.
      
      She wears Alexander's WATCH....

                              ACKERMAN
                Nobody knows. He disappeared
                after his escape. He's had
                extensive plastic surgery to alter
                his appearance since then. Drug
                lord Amado Carillo did the same
                thing in the 90s to successfully
                elude authorities.
      
                              QUINN
                How do you know about it?
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Pearce worked with no more than a
                few accomplices at one time. He
                treated them so well that they're
                virtually all completely loyal.
                None of them would cooperate.
                We've questioned the ones we could
                find, and the only thing we
                learned is that Pearce apparently
                arranged it so even his own people
                have never seen him after the
                surgery.
      
                              JEAN LUC
                So nobody knows what he looks
                like?
                                                               17.
      
      
                               ACKERMAN
                Correct.
      
                              JEAN LUC
                Forgive me for saying so Mr.
                Ackerman, but he slipped away from
                you when you knew his whereabouts
                and his appearance...  What makes
                you think you can catch him now?
      
      Ackerman regards him with aplomb.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                His girlfriend was recently
                released from custody. He'll come
                for her. We'll be waiting.
      
                              QUINN
                What makes you so certain?
      
      Ackerman clicks on a slide.
      
      Cara's face fills the screen behind him.   A murmur runs
      through the room. Every man stares.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                He'll come for her.
      
      Ackerman himself glances up at her face with a look of
      longing.
      
      HOLD ON CARA'S IMAGE for a moment before we...
      
                                                       MATCH CUT TO:
      
      
      EXT. VENICE TRAIN STATION - MORNING
      
      CARA stands alone on the platform amid the bustle of the
      station. The gleaming train stretches out behind her.
      
      
      INT. TRAIN CAR - SAME
      
      Frank's eyes drift open. He glances out the window and
      as his vision comes into focus he sees that the train is
      stopped. He sits bolt upright.
      
      A CONDUCTOR'S VOICE over the loudspeaker is saying
      something in Italian.
      
      Frank stumbles over himself to collect his things:      book,
      sweater, pills, etc.
                                                              18.
      
      
      INT. TRAIN AISLE - MOMENTS LATER
      
      Frank struggles down the aisle, bumping into fellow
      passengers and apologizing as he goes. All the while
      looking around for a sign of Cara...
      
      
      EXT. VENICE TRAIN STATION - MORNING
      
      Frank steps off the train and glances about at the hive
      of activity.
      
      Frank brushes past the GOOD-LOOKING ENGLISHMAN from the
      Paris station. Finally he spots her...
      
      FRANK'S POV - Cara with her back turned.
      
      Frank hurries over.
      
                                FRANK
                I was afraid I'd missed you. I
                wanted to ask where you're staying
                in Venice... I'm supposed to catch a
                shuttle to my hotel but I thought
                maybe--
      
                              CARA
                     (without turning)
                I've got a better idea.
      
      She holds out her valise for him.
      
      He takes it hesitantly. She peers at him over the rims
      of her sunglasses with a very slight smile...
      
                                                       HARD CUT TO:
      
      
      EXT. VENICE, GRAND CANAL - DAY
      
      A beauty shot of the Grand Canal: magnificent palaces and
      churches soar upwards on either side in all their glory.
      
      PUSH IN ON A launch labelled Danieli, travelling fast
      over the water. Cara shakes her head to let the wind
      ruffle her hair.
      
      CAMERA CONTINUES PAST HER TO REVEAL Frank, clutching the
      railing beside her, afraid to wake up.
                                                           19.
      
      
      INT. DANIELI HOTEL, ENTRANCE HALL - DAY
      
      Frank leads us through the distinctive, revolving glass
      door into the low-ceilinged entrance lobby.
      
      DISCOVER Cara at the desk talking to the receptionist.
      
                              CARA
                You have a booking in the name of
                Mason.
      
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                Si, Signorina.
      
                              CARA
                Signora. That's my husband.
      
      She nods at Frank. For a second, the receptionist cannot
      keep the surprise out of his eyes. This glamorous,
      superbly dressed creature is married to a dull, American
      tourist in a T-shirt?
      
      He recovers his composure and alters his manner at once.
      
                              RECEPTIONIST
                Very good, Senora Mason. Welcome
                to the Danieli. You are in the
                Doge's-- our premiere suite.
                     (pause)
                Is there anything special you
                require?
      
                              CARA
                Have a copy of today's Herald
                Tribune sent up to the room
                please.
      
                              RECEPTIONIST
                My pleasure, Signora.
      
      He gives her a large gold key and nods to a porter to
      take the luggage. Frank hurries to catch up with her.
      
      THE RECEPTIONIST he watches them go.
      
                              RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
                     (in Italian)
                Mother of God, what a waste.
                                                              20.
      
      
      INT. STAIRCASE HALL, DANIELI - DAY
      
      Together, they follow the porter into the ravishing, open
      central hall of the hotel, with the great, ornate
      staircase soaring up and up, past Gothic galleries and
      finely carved balustrades, beckoning.
      
      Frank and Cara trail the porter across the marble floor.
      
      Frank glances about, dazed with delight and amazement.
      
      
      INT. DOGE'S SUITE - DAY
      
      Under a gilded and coffered ceiling, portraits of the
      Doges flank a vast, hooded fireplace. The porter is
      showing them round the huge apartment, opening and
      closing doors.
      
                              PORTER
                The bedroom is through here. You
                have two bathrooms, here and here.
                There is a small kitchen which...
      
      He glances at Cara; she doesn't look like a woman who
      spends a lot of time in the kitchen.
      
                                PORTER (CONT'D)
                ...you may not need. There are two
                televisions, video, DVD, radio, hi
                fi sound system. And...
      
      The porter throws open a pair of French windows.   He lets
      the view speak for itself.
      
      They step forward. The whole of St. Mark's Basin and the
      Venetian lagoon are laid out below them.
      
                              PORTER (CONT'D)
                Is everything satisfactory?
      
                              CARA
                Yes. Thank you.
      
                              PORTER
                Then I will leave you.
      
      The Porter looks expectantly to the "husband" for a tip.
      Frank doesn't get it.
      
      An awkward beat. Cara takes a few Euros from her purse
      and tips him. The Porter exits.
                                                             21.
      
      
      EXT. BALCONY, DANIELI HOTEL - DAY
      
      Frank stands on the balcony in a daze. He stares down at
      the Molo and across St. Mark's Basin to San Georgio
      Maggiore. Cara joins him.
      
                               CARA
                You like it?
      
      Frank opens his mouth to answer.    Then laughs.
      
                              FRANK
                What's not to like?
      
                              CARA
                I'd have been bored here on my
                own. There's more than enough
                room for two.
      
                              FRANK
                I can see that.
      
                              CARA
                I didn't ask for an extra bed...
      
      Frank looks at her for a beat, barely able to breathe.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                Are you all right with the sofa?
                If you like, I can have them bring
                one up?
      
      His face falls.   He tries to cover up his reaction.
      
                              FRANK
                No, no, no. The sofa's fine.
                Perfect in fact.
      
      Before he can say more, the buzzer sounds.
      
                               CARA
                The luggage.
      
                               FRANK
                I'll get it.
      
      He goes back inside to answer the door.
      
      Cara remains alone on the balcony, immobile, as if
      holding her breath. She's waiting... listening.
                                                            22.
      
      
      INT. DOGE'S SUITE - DAY
      
      Frank walks across to the door. There is a small spyhole
      and he looks through it. The porter stands there with a
      trolley. Frank opens the door.
      
      The porter wheels the trolley in and starts to carry the
      bags into the bedroom.
      
      
      EXT. BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER
      
      Cara relaxes again as she hears Frank approach.   He steps
      outside on the balcony.
      
                              FRANK
                I've put my things in the other
                bathroom.
      
      She turns to face him.
      
                              CARA
                Have you ever been to Venice
                before?
      
      He shakes his head.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                Then we need to go out.
      
                                                         CUT TO:
      
      
      INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY
      
      CAMERA TRACKS WITH GOYAL as he weaves through a sprawling
      mess of personnel and equipment, cell phones, computers
      and cables from various national agencies. The United
      Nations-aspect of the Task Force gives it impressive
      scope but also results in a Tower-of-Babel effect.
      
      The calm eye of the storm is Ackerman.
      
                              GOYAL
                She's checked into the Danieli...
                she's not alone.
      
                                ACKERMAN
                Good.
                     (to the room)
                Maintain surveillance but keep
                your distance.

                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Don't try to get clever:
                remember that Pearce is smarter
                than most of you put together.
      
      ANGLE ON QUINN who quietly slips out of the room.
      
      
      EXT. PRIVATE LANDING STRIP, VENICE - DAY
      
      A Gulfstream G550 executive jet banks over the Venetian
      coast and comes in for a landing...
      
      Wheels down. Stairway unfolds. The man who steps off
      the plane is dressed in a hand-tailored Italian suit and
      shoes that cost more than some cars. He's flanked by two
      bodyguards.
      
      IVAN DEMIDOV.   In the flesh.
      
      
      EXT. VENICE - DAY
      
      CAMERA floats over the rooftops toward the penthouse of a
      ultra-high end business hotel.
      
      
      INT. DEMIDOV'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
      
      Demidov sips a glass of red wine. The view from his room
      rivals the one at the Danieli but Demidov pays no
      attention. He's busy scanning his emails on his
      Blackberry.
      
      Knock, knock. A thick-necked BODYGUARD in the background
      goes to answer the door. A moment later...
      
      He ushers in Quinn, the Swiss Interpol agent.
      
                              DEMIDOV
                Take a seat, Mr. Quinn. Can I
                offer you a glass of Brunello?
                It's a '97...
      
                              QUINN
                No thank you, Mr. Demidov.
      
      Demidov swirls his glass.
      
                              DEMIDOV
                You know I'd never admit this at
                home, but Vodka is for peasants.
                There's much we could learn from
                the Italians.
                                                              24.
      
      
      He smiles pleasantly at Quinn, then, on a dime, he turns
      back to business.
      
                              DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                Tell me I'm not going to be
                disappointed.
      
      Quinn takes out an envelope and passes it over.
      
                              QUINN
                I don't think so.
      
      He flips it open and examines the contents.     WE GLIMPSE a
      photo of CARA and some text.
      
                              DEMIDOV
                     (to himself)
                He always had good taste...
      
      Demidov makes a gesture and a second BODYGUARD with a
      SCAR on his face gives Quinn an envelope filled with
      cash.
      
      Quinn tucks it away discreetly, as if embarrassed by the
      directness of the pay off.
      
                                QUINN
                Mr. Demidov... if I may ask you a
                question... Why do you care so much
                about Alexander Pearce? I mean,
                you've come here yourself... as if
                it were personal.
      
      Demidov looks at Quinn thoughtfully.
      
                              DEMIDOV
                It may be difficult for you to
                understand, Mr. Quinn; you Swiss
                are mercenary by nature. But for
                some of us, there are things more
                important than money. I put my
                trust in Alexander Pearce. He
                betrayed that trust.
      
      Quinn smiles tightly.   He's ready to get out of there.

                And it's bad business to let
                somebody make a fool of you. If
                Pearce gets away with it, what
                does that say about me?

      EXT. THE LIDO, VENICE - DAY
      
      A clear, bright winter day at the beach. Devoid of
      tourists, the famous stretch is a completely different
      Venice from the one we're used to seeing.
      
      Sandbanks stretch out into the dark green sea.
      
      Cara and Frank walk on a deserted patch of sand.   The
      wind wraps her light sun dress around her body,
      intermittently hugging her perfect curves.
      
                                CARA
                So... when you're not on a Grand
                European Tour, what do you do in
                Rosemont, Pennsylvania?
      
                              FRANK
                I'm a teacher. High school math.
                And you? What do you do?
      
      She glances at him slyly over her movie star shades.
      
                              CARA
                This is what I do, Frank.
      
                              FRANK
                You're good at it.
      
      A sound of voices and laughter drift toward them. Up
      ahead on the beach they see a group of Italians in formal
      clothes. A woman wears a white bridal dress.
      
                                CARA
                Oh look... a wedding.   How lovely.
      
                              FRANK
                I'm not really into weddings at
                this particular moment in my life...
      
                               CARA
                Oh yes.   I forgot.
      
      She takes his arm and steers him toward a bistro with
      sidewalk tables.
      
                                                          CUT TO:
      
      
      EXT. BISTRO - AFTERNOON
      
      Cara and Frank are seated.    A bottle of Orvieto rests on
      the table.
                                                     26.
      
      
                              CARA
                Do you think it's really over?
      
                               FRANK
                Hmm?
      
                               CARA
                Maybe she'll change her mind.
                Women do. She might give you a
                second chance.
      
                              FRANK
                I suppose that's a possibility.
                     (hesitates)
                That's what I tell my statistics
                class anyway; life is a game of
                chance. Endless possibilities and
                permutations. You just have to
                calculate the odds.
      
                              CARA
                You haven't answered the question.
      
                               FRANK
                Well...
                     (quietly)
                I'd like to think that love is a
                question of destiny, not chance...
      
      Cara looks at him curiously.
      
                              CARA
                For a moment there you just
                reminded me of somebody.
      
      She shakes her head and takes a sip of wine.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                He had a way of dancing around a
                question so eloquently that you
                never noticed until later that
                he'd completely avoided the truth.
                His entire life was wrapped up in
                deception.
                     (lost in thought)
                He told so many lies, I wouldn't
                believe him even if he finally did
                tell the truth.
      
                              FRANK
                He doesn't sound like much of a
                friend.
                                                              27.
      
      
                                CARA
                He wasn't.
      
      Frank glances at her wrist.
      
                              FRANK
                So why are you wearing his watch?
      
      She looks up at him.
      
                              CARA
                You're smarter than you look,
                Frank.
      
      She runs her fingertip over the face of the watch. Then,
      impulsively unclasps it and reaches for Frank's hand.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                And you're right. Here, take it.
      
      She puts it on Frank's wrist, over his protests.
      
                              FRANK
                What? No, I can't. This thing
                must be worth a fortune--
      
                              CARA
                I insist. You're doing me a
                favor.
                     (firm)
                Take it or I'll toss it in the
                ocean.
      
      He hesitates.   She means it.    He closes the clasp.
      
                              FRANK
                I'll wear it until you regain your
                senses.
      
      He feels the heft of it on his wrist. Admires it for a
      moment. It really is a beautiful watch. She settles
      back in her chair, pleased with herself.
      
      He looks up and sees her smiling at him.
      
                                FRANK (CONT'D)
                What?
      
                                CARA
                It suits you.
                                                               28.
      
      
      LONG SHOT of Frank and Cara framed by the sunset. A
      romantic dinner for two. They could easily be lovers or
      honeymooners...
      
      In the foreground REVEAL somebody watching them.   The
      good-looking Englishman is there, hovering...
      
      
      INT. DOGE'S SUITE - NIGHT
      
      The key sounds in the lock and the door swings open.
      Frank and Cara tumble in together, laughing, a little
      tipsy.
      
      He glances at the sofa and that sobers him up, reminding
      him where he's going to sleep. However...
      
      He watches Cara drop her wrap over a chair and kicks off
      her shoes. She throws open the French doors to the
      balcony.
      
      Frank bypasses the sofa-bed and follows her outside.
      
      
      EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
      
      Cara looks out across the lagoon.
      
      Frank appears beside her.
      
                              FRANK
                I could get used to this.
      
      A movement in the street down below catches her eye. She
      studies the Ponte del Vin intently, seeing something.
      
      Cara turns abruptly to Frank and presses her body against
      his. He's taken by surprise but willingly responds to
      her advance, wrapping his arms around her back.
      
      They exchange a long, passionate kiss.
      
      
      VIDEO POV OF THE SAME
      
      REVEAL the lens of a PALM-SIZED VIDEO CAMERA peering out
      from behind a vendor's cart in the street below.
      
      Frank, his face slightly obscured, kisses Cara.
      
      WE HEAR the WHIRRING of the video camera.
                                                             29.
      
      
      I/E. DOGE'S SUITE/BALCONY - RESUME
      
      Still kissing, Cara leads Frank back into the hotel room...
      
      
      EXT. VIDEO POV FROM THE STREET - CONTINUOUS
      
      The silhouettes of Cara and Frank disappear into the
      hotel room as...
      
      
      INT. DOGE'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
      
      Cara closes the curtains.   She pulls away from him.
      
      Her composure changes; the passion is gone.   The
      expression on her face is matter-of-fact.
      
                              CARA
                You should leave Venice tomorrow.
                     (softer)
                It's a city for lovers Frank; no
                place to recover from a failed
                engagement.
      
      She turns and walks toward her bedroom...
      
      Frank stares after her in stunned disappointment.
      
                                FRANK
                What... what did I do?
      
      She pauses at the door.   Her expression softens slightly.
      
                               CARA
                Nothing.   I'm sorry.
      
      Then she disappears into her bedroom. The door closes
      behind her and we hear the click of the lock.
      
      Frank remains standing alone, immobile.
      
      After several moments he sits on the sofa.    There are two
      folded blankets and a pillow.
      
      From within Cara's bedroom we can hear her voice, muffled
      but still audible...
      
                                CARA (CONT'D)
                ...that's exactly what I'm doing,
                but now I want him to go...
                                                              30.
      
      
      He approaches the door, straining to hear more but her
      words fade out.
      
                                                           CUT TO:
      
      
      INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
      
      Frank gets ready for bed. He takes off the watch Cara
      gave him and something on the back of it catches his eye.
      It's engraved with a name:
      
      ALEXANDER PEARCE
      
      He stares at the name for a moment, then unzips his
      travel bag. Takes out his pills. Pops a bunch. Brushes
      his teeth.
      
      He pauses and stares at himself in the mirror as if
      wondering how in the world he ended up here. It's like
      he's staring into the face of stranger.
      
      He puts his tooth brush down and pads off to sleep on the
      sofa.
      
      
      INT. DOGE'S SUITE - MORNING
      
      The sound of the SHOWER reaches Frank in his sleep.     He
      blinks his eyes.
      
      The morning is misty.   He closes the balcony doors.
      
      Cara's bedroom door is ajar. Frank struggles not to
      notice. He turns to his bed and begins folding sheets.
      
      Then he hears the sound of water running in the shower.
      
      He glances over at the door ajar, the sound of the
      shower... it's too much.
      
      Frank walks to the bedroom door.   He pushes it open.
      
      The door to Cara's bathroom is open.   The outline of her
      naked body is visible in the shower.   She lifts her wet
      hair and soaps the back of her neck.
      
      She sees him.   Cara is so stunned she simply stands
      there.
      
      Frank walks to the shower and opens the glass door.
                                                                  31.
      
      
      Walking in, he LIFTS Cara against the glass, clutching at
      her slithery body, kissing her frantically...she kisses
      him back with ardor, wrapping her dripping legs around
      his back...
      
                                                           CUT BACK TO
                                                              REALITY:
      
      
      INT. DOGE'S SUITE - MORNING
      
      Frank is sleeping. A smile on his face.          A shadow passes
      over him as somebody walks past.
      
      A man's trouser leg is visible in the foreground, moving
      slowly toward Frank. Then...
      
      CLANG!   Frank wakes with a start to see......
      
      A WAITER is setting up breakfast on a cart.
      
                               WAITER
                 Pardone Signore. Good morning.
      
      Frank stares in surprise at the food spread out before
      him.
      
                                WAITER (CONT'D)
                 La Signora ordered this for you
                 when she left.
      
                                 FRANK
                 When she...?
      
      He looks around the suite.     He is alone. He nods.
      
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                 Thank you.
      
      The waiter has finished.     He hovers for a moment...
      
      Finally Frank takes the hint and gives the man a one Euro
      tip. He takes it with disdain and leaves.
      
      Frank throws off his blanket and sits up.
      
      
      INT. CARA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
      
      Frank strolls into the room, barefoot, in his boxers.
      The bed is unmade.
                                                              32.
      
      
      Cara has left a shirt over a chair... he picks it up and
      holds it to his face for a moment to enjoy her lingering
      scent.
      
      He notices a newspaper... a copy of The International
      Herald Tribune is open on her bedside table. He lifts it
      to see what Cara had been reading.
      
      There is a personal ad that has been lightly dotted with
      a ball point pen. The message is just a list of words:
      
      
      "TOM CORRY NOW IN A MICA CAN IF FEELING PEST STILL
      AROUND."
      
      The dots single out letters in a code... Frank picks up the
      pen and puts a faint line through the groups of
      unselected letters to reveal the message:
      
      "Tomorrow 11 Caffe Pesaro"
      
      Frank studies this for a moment.
      
      
      THE BUZZER SOUNDS
      
      Laying the paper on the table, Frank walks to the door.
      
                               MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                Breakfast.
      
      Frank reaches for the doorknob... then pauses.   Breakfast
      again?
      
      He quietly slides the chain on.    Peers through the
      spyhole.
      
      SPYHOLE POV -- Two tough-looking men in suits stand
      there: most definitely not hotel staff. One has a scar
      on his face... Demidov's BODYGUARDS.
      
      Frank is frozen.
      
      Scarface takes out a silenced PISTOL and mutters
      something in Russian to his partner. He produces a LOCK
      PICK SET and crouches out of frame.
      
      Frank hears the sound of scratching metal and clicking
      tumblers inside the lock. He looks around wildly. Sees
      the KEY on the entryway table and reaches for it...
      
      Ch-chunk. The Russian picks the lock and slowly starts
      to open the door. The chain stops it. A pause.
                                                              33.
      
      
      A moment later a KNIFE comes through the crack and starts
      to slide the chain...
      
      Frank stares at the knife; he has to act fast...
      
      Frank throws his shoulder against the door. The knife
      clatters to the floor as the door slams shut. Frank jams
      his KEY into the lock and turns the bolt into place.
      
      There's angry confusion on the other side of the door.
      
      Frank grabs a heavy glass ashtray and swings it at the
      back of the key-- breaking it off in the lock.
      
      Frank scrambles out of the way...
      
      The sound of metal scraping in the lock. Russian CURSING
      can be heard just outside. A heavy blow as they try to
      shoulder the door open...
      
      Frank looks around desperately for an escape.
      
      The bathroom?   The sitting room?   Adjoining doors?   None.
      
      There's nowhere to go.
      
      Frank bolts for the balcony in his bare feet.
      
      He scrambles outside as...
      
      POP! POP! POP! Bullets rip through the wood and metal,
      blasting the lock assembly apart. The door bursts open.
      
      
      EXT. BALCONY - DAY
      
      Frank looks down and stares at the
      
      
      DIZZYING SIX STORY DROP
      
      to the cobblestones of the Ponte del Vin below.
      
      Guests sit on their balconies with their morning coffee.
      
      Three balconies over, Frank sees the rooftop of the
      modern wing of the hotel.
      
      
      IN THE SUITE
      
      The two TOUGHS rapidly move through the room, searching.
      Nyet, Nyet.
                                                               34.
      
      
      The one place they haven't checked...
      
      THE BALCONY
      
      Frank puts one bare foot on the stonework. He grimaces
      as he HEAVES himself onto the railing of the balcony
      adjacent to his.
      
      He hangs desperately, flailing, 100 feet over the street
      below. He gets a tentative hold...
      
      A PALLID FRENCH WOMAN drops her coffee and screams.
      
      The Russians sprint out to the balcony.    They spot
      Frank...
      
      Who shoves the Pallid Woman inside, struggles past her
      breakfast table, and prepares to leap again-- but slips
      on the spilled coffee.
      
      Bullets shatter China around him. He cuts his foot on a
      broken plate. He grabs his bleeding foot.
      
                                 FRANK
                  Goddamn it!   I'm a fucking
                  tourist!
      
      Another round of shots ring out.    They don't seem to
      care.
      
      Frank goes over the railing with another awkward HEAVE.
      
      His pursuers scale the adjoining stone work and step onto
      the Pallid Woman's balcony.
      
      This time Frank lands in the lap of a BURLY WELSHMAN.
      
                                BURLY WELSHMAN
                  Are ya bloody mad?
      
      The Burly Welshman PUNCHES Frank in the stomach, which
      drops him out of the way of...
      
      TWO SHOTS
      
      Which explode into the Welshman's shoulder.   He cries out
      and falls down on top of Frank.
      
      The Russians stand on the Pallid Woman's balcony and
      prepare to JUMP...
      
      as Frank crawls out from under the wounded Welshman and
      peers over the next balcony...
                                                            35.
      
      
      Which is at least TWENTY FEET from the roof.
      
      He misjudged the distance.
      
                                FRANK
                  Shit...
      
      
      INT. THE WELSHMAN'S ROOM - SECONDS LATER
      
      Frank runs through the hotel room, past the Welshman's
      wife to the door.
      
      A SHOT behind him and pounding feet send him out into the
      corridor past a room service steward to an...
      
      ELEVATOR
      
      Which   will not do but the--
      
      
      INT.    SERVICE STAIRCASE - SECONDS LATER
      
      STAIRS will and Frank flies down the steps, three at a
      time, hearing his pursuers above him, running harder than
      he's run in his entire life...
      
      But he's slow and they gain on him enough to aim weapons
      through the railing...
      
      P-CHING, several bullets ricochet like pinballs in the
      metal stairwell.
      
      Frank pants as he pushes out a side door...
      
      
      EXT. RIO DEL VIN CANAL, VENICE - DAY
      
      Frank sprints along the edge of the canal, dodging
      tourists and children, vendors and locals. He spots a
      VENDOR'S three wheel BICYCLE and jumps on.
      
      As he pedals, he realizes it's too slow so he JUMPS
      OFF...
      
      and FALLS - a painful spill, he cuts his hand - but
      clambers to his feet as the Russians bear down. Running
      up hidden stairs he finds the roof of a shop on the Riva
      Degli Schiavoni...
                                                             36.
      
      
      EXT. RIVA DEGLI SCHIAVONI, VENICE - DAY
      
      Frank runs down the ridge of the roof.   A silenced shot
      hits roof tile nearby and throws him off balance. He
      FALLS...
      
      ...bumping down the other side of the roof until, as he
      topples over the edge, he thrusts a hand at the gutter,
      smashing his head against the wall. He drops onto the
      pavement along the edge of the small canal.
      
      He doubles back towards the lagoon. Looking back, he sees
      the men still in pursuit.
      
      He turns into the Campo San Zaccaria, scattering the
      flapping and fluttering PIGEONS.   The Gondolieri and
      their passengers watch the half-naked man run past and
      cheer.
      
                              A GONDOLIER
                     (in Italian)
                Run faster, man!
      
      The Russians force their way past the pedestrians.    They
      have almost caught him when...
      
      
      INT. LEATHER SHOP - DAY
      
      Ducking inside a leather shop, Frank heads straight for
      the back entrance and finds it.
      
      He stands on the cobblestones. Blood streams from his
      forehead as well as his hand. He has
      
      SECONDS
      
      to decide which way to go. The alley is long and narrow
      on either side. An awning above. Clear sight lines.
      
      The back of the shop upends the Grand Canal.
      
      
      EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER
      
      The Russians burst out the back.
      
      There is no sign of Frank.
      
      Scarface looks at the Canal. He walks to the edge of the
      water and SPRAYS gun fire atop it. Nothing.
      
                                                           CUT TO:
                                                              37.
      
      
      HIGH ANGLE OF SCENE
      
      Frank lies huddled on his back IN THE AWNING behind the
      leather shop, barely able to control his frantic
      breathing. He's mere feet away from the men who are
      trying to kill him...
      
      He looks up and sees: the scowling face of an Italian
      WOMAN peering out over her window box.
      
      Frank raises a desperate finger to his lips.    A prayer
      that she won't give him away.
      
      She looks at him disapprovingly.     Then disappears back
      inside.
      
      CLOSE ON FRANK as he waits, his heart pounding.
      
      Seconds tick past...   is he safe?
      
      Rrrrrip! A black cylinder, like the barrel of a gun,
      tears through the awning fabric inches from his Frank's
      head.
      
      He cries out. The awning rips and dumps him down hard
      onto the cobblestones below...
      
      
      A MOMENTARY BLACKOUT
      
      Frank opens his eyes and sees two pairs of black boots
      that belong to... A PAIR OF CARBINIERI who stand over him.
      One of them holds a nightstick.
      
      They stare down at the bloodied tourist in his underpants
      lying at their feet. They've seen stranger things.
      
                                                           CUT TO:
      
      
      INT. POLIZIA "QUESTURA" (POLICE STATION) - DAY
      
      Frank sits alone with a blanket over his shoulders. Most
      of the blood has been wiped from his wound and he has a
      rough bandage on his head.
      
      From down the hallway a cheery stubble-faced POLICE
      OFFICER, DOMENICO (30's, animated), walks into the room
      where Frank is waiting.
      
      Domenico laughs, talking on his cell phone as he enters.
                                                             38.
      
      
                              DOMENICO
                     (in Italian)
                You can't let them stay over, man.
                You start cuddling and then she
                wants to borrow your car. Stop
                cuddling, Tomaso!
      
      Frank stands.
      
                               FRANK
                Excuse me...
      
                              DOMENICO
                     (suddenly noticing
                      him)
                Hey, what are you doing in here?
      
                              FRANK
                The officers told me to wait here.
                I've been sitting here for over
                two hours...
      
      Dominico glances over his shoulder.
      
                              DOMENICO
                I think they forgot about you.
      
      Frank sits back down heavily.    Domenico sits on the edge
      of a desk.
      
                              DOMENICO (CONT'D)
                What happened to you, anyway?
      
                              FRANK
                Somebody tried to kill me.
      
      Domenico picks up Frank's statement and glances at it.
      
                              DOMENICO
                Mr. Taylor, wow, you had quite a
                day. Eh? We got chasing, we got
                shooting.
      
      Domenico looks at mild-mannered Frank sitting there in
      his boxers. The story seems unlikely.
      
                              FRANK
                You think I'm crazy but it's all
                true.
      
                              DOMENICO
                Maybe you crazy AND it's true, my
                friend.
                                                              39.
      
      
      Domenico looks at Frank a little harder.     Decides this
      guy is not making all this up.
      
                              DOMENICO (CONT'D)
                Okay, so who are these guys? Why
                they mad at you?
      
                              FRANK
                I have absolutely no idea.
      
                              DOMENICO
                They followed you from the
                Danieli?
      
                              FRANK
                They came to the room. They
                pretended to be room service.
      
                              DOMENICO
                You don't scopata one of their
                girlfriends or something?
      
                              FRANK
                I didn't "scopata" anybody!
      
                               DOMENICO
                Who is...
      
      He consults a piece of paper.
      
                               DOMENICO (CONT'D)
                Cara Mason?
      
      Frank is quiet.   Domenico playfully points at him.
      
                              DOMENICO (CONT'D)
                I catch you, right?
      
                              FRANK
                     (irritated)
                In America the cops catch the
                crooks, not the victim.
      
                              DOMENICO
                Ha ha, we do that sometimes here,
                too.
      
      Domenico considers for a moment.
      
                              DOMENICO (CONT'D)
                Is no domestic, then?
                                                             40.
      
      
                               FRANK
                No.
      
                              DOMENICO
                How long you know Cara Mason?
      
                              FRANK
                I met her yesterday.
      
                              DOMENICO
                And you take her to the Danieli?
                That must have been good meeting,
                yes?
      
                              FRANK
                I didn't take her. She took me.
      
      The infectious grin again lights up Domenico's face.
      
                              DOMENICO
                You lead an exciting life, Mr.
                Taylor.
      
                               FRANK
                Not usually.
      
      Domenico picks up the phone and dials a number. He talks
      in brisk Italian, listens again and replaces the
      receiver.
      
                              DOMENICO
                Signora Mason was staying with
                "her husband" last night. You
                marry her, Mr. Taylor?
      
                               FRANK
                No.
      
                              DOMENICO
                I think maybe Signora Mason might
                know why these guys behave badly.
                What do you think?
      
      Pause.
      
                              FRANK
                I think that's possible.
      
                              DOMENICO
                You got a phone number, mobile?
      
                              FRANK
                She didn't give me one.
                                                             41.
      
      
      Domenico looks him over.
      
                              DOMENICO
                You need some clothes.     I'll be
                right back.
      
      He leaves Frank alone again.
      
      Frank stands and half-heartedly follows him to the
      doorway.
      
      He spots something in the adjoining room; a computer that
      has been left on. He wanders over and looks at the
      screen.
      
      An idea comes into Frank's head... he looks around. Nobody
      is watching him. He glances at the inscription on the
      WATCH...
      
      Then quickly sits down. He does a search for "WANTED
      INTERNATIONAL CRIMINALS" and types in the name:
      
      ALEXANDER PEARCE.
      
      An immediate hit in the data base. Alexander Pearce's
      page fills the screen. The caption reads:
      
      #6 on INTERPOL'S MOST WANTED LIST.
      
      In place of a photograph there is just a black outline of
      a man's head.
      
      Frank is about to scan for more information when he hears
      Domenico returning. He quickly steps back into the room
      where he was left...
      
      DOMENICO enters carrying a garish SWEAT SUIT.   He hands
      it to Frank.
      
                                 DOMENICO (CONT'D)
                Here.     Put these on. Time to go.
      
      Frank looks at the clothes.
      
                                 FRANK
                Um... thanks.   Where are we going?
      
                               DOMENICO
                I'm taking you to the hospital,
                Mr. Taylor. A doctor should take
                a look at you.
                                                            42.
      
      
                              FRANK
                I'd really rather just go--
      
                              DOMENICO
                Don't worry. I put you in Padua,
                away from Venice. You'll be safe.
                     (scribbles his
                      number)
                Any worry, you call me. I give
                you my home number.
      
                                                         CUT TO:
      
      
      INT. HOSPITAL SCANNING ROOM, PADUA - EVENING
      
      Frank lies flat on his back.
      
      A NURSE leans over him with a kindly expression.
      
                              NURSE
                Relax signore. We're just going
                to make sure everything is all
                right inside your head.
      
      She slides him slowly into the mouth of an MRI scanning
      machine head first. It hums to life.
      
      
      INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, DANIELI - EVENING
      
      Domenico whistles as a hotel clerk escorts him to to the
      Doge's suite.
      
                              CLERK
                     (in Italian)
                Unfortunately we've already re-let
                the room.
                     (nervous)
                We'd rather the guests didn't know
                about the incident.
      
                               DOMENICO
                Don't worry.   I'll be discreet.
      
                               CLERK
                Grazie.
      
      The Clerk knocks.   The door is opened by Ivan Demidov.
                                                           43.
      
      
                              CLERK (CONT'D)
                I beg your pardon, Signore, but
                this is a police officer. He needs
                to briefly examine the room.
      
                                DEMIDOV
                Of course.
      
      Demidov steps back, holding the door open.
      
      
      INT. DOGE'S SUITE, DANIELI - EVENING
      
      Demidov watches Domenico, who sniffs around.
      
                              DEMIDOV
                     (casually)
                What happened, officer?
      
                              DOMENICO
                That's what I'm trying to find
                out, Signore.
      
      Domenico gets down on his hands and knees and looks
      around. He spots something under the sofa and fishes it
      out with his penknife... a spent bullet casing.
      
      He puts it in a plastic bag, pleased with himself.
      Demidov catches his eye. He smiles at him.
      
                              DEMIDOV
                You are a good detective.
      
                                DOMENICO
                I do my best.
      
      Domenico stands and takes his leave.
      
                              DOMENICO (CONT'D)
                Sorry for the inconvenience.
                Enjoy your stay.
      
      As he and the clerk exit, Scarface steps out from the
      other room. Off Demidov's look, he leaves the suite to
      follow...
      
      
      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, PADUA - NIGHT
      
      Frank lies on the bed. There are clean bandages on his
      injuries.
                                                              44.
      
      
      The television drones on the wall: an Italian reality
      show. A WOMAN holds her hands over her eyes. The HOST
      taunts her:
      
                              THE HOST (V.O.)
                     (in Italian)
                Now remember, I said you were in
                for a surprise... a big surprise.
      
      Frank waits for the surprise.
      
      
      INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - NIGHT
      
      Ackerman is tilted back with his eyes closed like he has
      a headache.
      
      Jones enters with a file labelled:    "Frank Taylor".
      
                              ACKERMAN
                What did we find on the American?
      
                              JONES
                He's a tourist. Member of the
                teacher's union. Pays his taxes.
                Has bad luck.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Evidently. He had a pair of
                Russian hit men after him. Are
                you still going to tell me Demidov
                is clean?
      
                              JONES
                I never said he is clean.    I just
                said he isn't our target.
      
                              GOYAL
                I'm just wondering how they
                tracked them down at the hotel...
      
                              ACKERMAN
                     (under his breath)
                Just so long as they don't beat us
                to Pearce when the real one
                arrives.
      
      He looks up at Goyal.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Where's the teacher now?
                                                         45.
      
      
                              GOYAL
                The local police picked him up.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Then he's safely out of the way.

      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
      
      Frank sits up in his bed, reading.
      
      The PHONE RINGS.
      
                              FRANK
                Hello?
      
      
      INT. TERRACE FLAT, PADUA - EVENING
      
      INTERCUT: Domenico - in his terrace flat. He wears a T-
      shirt and holds a glass of wine. Loud Italian pop music
      plays in the background.
      
                              DOMENICO
                Well it's official Mr. Taylor.
                You're not mad.
      
                              FRANK
                That's a relief.
      
                              DOMENICO
                I went to the hotel. Somebody
                shot at somebody. I found a shell
                casing. I'll have it analyzed in
                the morning.
      
      Frank glances around uncomfortably.
      
                              FRANK
                I'd like to be on a flight home
                tomorrow morning.
      
                               DOMENICO
                Relax, you're perfectly safe where
                you are.
                     (pause)
                You have any visits from your
                Signora Mason?
                                                             46.
      
      
                                FRANK
                      (quiet)
                 I wish.
      
                               DOMENICO
                 Never let them cuddle, Mr. Taylor.
                 One cuddle and it all turns to
                 merda. Good night. If you need
                 anything, you have my number.
      
      Frank hangs up, shaking his head.
      
      In the restful silence he hears a DISTANT BANG. A
      gunshot? A door slam? Nervous, he gets up and goes to
      the door...
      
      
      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
      
      Frank looks right and left. The corridor is empty and
      silent, lit by strip lights set on low.
      
      Just as he's about to close the door again, Frank notices
      that there is a label stuck there with his name on it,
      just above the room number.
      
      He struggles with the label for a few seconds, tearing it
      off.
      
      He sticks the label on the door to an empty room
      opposite.
      
      
      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
      
      Frank goes to the sink and splashes water on his face.
      Stares at himself for several moments, as he did in the
      bathroom at the Danieli. He's lost in thought.
      
      Then...
      
      He hears the clang of a metal pushcart being wheeled
      along. Some footsteps approach. There are voices speaking
      an unfamiliar language, maybe Russian...
      
      Russian?
      
      Frank scrambles for his clothes. He fishes out
      Domenico's phone number from a pocket and races to the
      phone. Then freezes, listening:
      
      The footsteps move away slightly... there is the sound of a
      door opening. The door across the hall.
                                                              47.
      
      
      Seconds pass. The door is closed again.      The footsteps
      move down the hall, slowly fading away.
      
      Frank punches in the policeman's number and grips the
      receiver. It rings.
      
      
      INT. DOMENICO'S TERRACE FLAT - NIGHT
      
      A saucepot simmers on the stove. The phone RINGS.
      Behind it is a WINDOW - pierced by one circular bullet
      hole.
      
      The music still plays.
      
      As our gaze drifts downwards we see Domenico's bare feet,
      prone behind the kitchen island.
      
      The phone RINGS and RINGS...
      
      
      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
      
      Frank is struggling into his clothes. Everything seems to
      stick and take forever.
      
      He opens the door a crack and looks down the ward.
      Nothing. He moves along the passage, slipping into
      doorways and out of the light.
      
      He finds the elevator and jabs at the button.
      
      The light shows it is approaching the floor. It stops.
      The doors open. Frank is about to enter it, when
      suddenly SOMEBODY STEPS OUT...
      
      An ORDERLY exits and brushes past.
      
      Frank breaths a sigh of relief and steps in.
      
      
      INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR, PADUA - NIGHT
      
      Frank presses the button for Receptione et Terre and
      waits an interminable four seconds for the doors to
      close.
      
      Slowly the elevator descends... and stops.
      
      The doors open. A big MAN stands with his back to us,
      blocking the exit. Frank shrinks away, with nowhere to
      hide. The man turns.
                                                              48.
      
      
      He's a MALE NURSE, waiting to get into the lift. He
      stands aside to allow Frank to leave. Frank takes a step
      out...
      
      ...and sees SCARFACE talking to the receptionist.
      Hurriedly, Frank reverses back into the elevator.
      
                              FRANK
                     (to the Nurse)
                Wrong floor.
      
      Then, just before the doors close, Scarface turns... his
      eyes meet Frank's. He starts towards the elevator... but
      the doors shut first.
      
      The lift stops again. The doors open on the first tier of
      the subterranean car park.
      
      Frank leaps off.
      
      
      INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK, PADUA HOSPITAL - NIGHT
      
      Limping and terrified, Frank jogs towards the ramp marked
      Uscita in the far corner.
      
      An ENGINE ROAR splits the silence. The lights blind
      Frank in the darkness as the car careers towards him.
      
      He falls to his knees.
      
      The car skids to a stop.
      
      The door flies open. He squints. Sitting behind the
      wheel, calm and beautiful as ever, is CARA. He stares.
      
                              CARA
                What are you waiting for?    Get in.
      
      
      INT. CARA'S CAR - NIGHT
      
      He climbs into the car.    She turns to him as she pulls
      out.
      
                              CARA
                Did you miss me?
      
                                 FRANK
                A little.
      
      He glances anxiously over her shoulder.
                                                              49.
      
      
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                 Um... you may not believe this but
                 there are some people trying to
                 kill me--
      
                                CARA
                      (calm)
                 I know.
      
      Cara drives toward the ramp.     He looks at her.
      
                               FRANK
                 Do you know why?
      
                               CARA
                 It's because I kissed you.
      
      She stops the car and waits for the metal gate at the top
      of the ramp to open. It rises with a loud creaking to
      REVEAL...
      
      A BLACK CAR with two men inside. One of them steps out
      and ducks under the gate as it rises up.
      
      While he's briefly silhouetted by the car's headlights we
      glimpse the outline of an AUTOMATIC WEAPON.
      
                                CARA (CONT'D)
                 Shit.
      
      With remarkable sangfroid she cuts the engine and lets
      her car roll backwards, gliding silently and perfectly
      into a parking spot.
      
      Silence.
      
      They watch the BLACK CAR slowly descend the ramp.   The
      Russian with the gun in his hand walks carefully
      alongside.
      
      Frank watches, holding his breath.
      
      The sound of another engine cuts through the silence.     A
      pair of headlights come up from the level below.
      
      CLOSE ON THE CAR. The MALE NURSE from the elevator is
      driving up toward the exit ramp, toward the exit where
      the Russians are waiting.
      
      CLOSE ON THE GUNMAN slipping back into the shadows and
      readying his gun to fire.
                                                              50.
      
      
      FRANK sees what is about to happen.    His face betrays his
      concern.
      
      He reaches for the door.
      
      CLICK. Cara presses the central door lock.      Frank's door
      doesn't budge. He looks over at her.
      
                               FRANK
                      (re: the Nurse)
                That guy has nothing to do with
                this.
      
                              CARA
                Neither do you.
      
      He looks her straight in the eye.    She relents.
      
                               CARA (CONT'D)
                Okay.   If you want to play hero...
      
      She turns over the ignition.
      
                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                Hold on.
      
      Cara revs the car and pulls out fast, cutting off the
      Nurse's car. He leans on the horn.
      
      At the top of the exit ramp, the metal parking gate is
      slowly being lowered.
      
      She weaves around the black car, deliberately heading for
      the gunman. He opens fire.
      
      BRRRRRAAAP!! Bullets spray wildly, ricocheting off the
      walls, shattering windshields... Frank covers his face as a
      side-window pops, showering him with glass.
      
      The GUNMAN is forced to jump out of the way as Cara
      scrapes the side of her car along the wall. Sparks fly.
      
      The black car burns rubber as it U-turns to follow her.
      
      She guns it up the ramp towards the closing door.
      
                              FRANK
                There's not enough room!
      
                              CARA
                There's enough room.
                                                              51.
      
      
      The fence whirs at head height and keeps lowering.    The
      black car is closing in behind them.
      
                              FRANK
                We won't make it!
      
                              CARA
                I thought Americans were
                optimists.
      
      At the last second he ducks instinctively and closes his
      eyes. The gate clips the top of Cara's car with a
      tremendous CLANG! Traps it.
      
      Cara presses her foot all the way down on the
      accelerator. Smoke pours from the tires.
      
      
      CRASH!
      
      The black car RAMS them from behind.
      
      A Russian leans out the window and fires at the outlines
      of Cara and Frank's HEADS. Bullets shatter the back
      window.
      
      Cara pushes Frank's head down. The sound of burning
      gears as the engine hits its limit.
      
      Suddenly, scraping paint, Cara's car SPRINGS forward,
      jetting out onto the street.
      
      The fence drops further and shudders to a halt. The
      black car is trapped. The Russians can only watch as
      Cara speeds away.
      
                                                           CUT TO:
      
      
      INT. CARA'S CAR - NIGHT
      
      The quiet hum of the autostrade is the only sound in the
      car.
      
      Frank sits in a daze.   He turns to her.
      
                              FRANK
                Do I look that much like Alexander
                Pearce?
      
      Cara turns sharply.
                                                            52.
      
      
                              CARA
                How do you know--?
      
      Frank holds up his wrist.
      
                                  FRANK
                The watch.
      
      She hesitates.   A pause.
      
                              CARA
                I don't know. You're about his
                size. That's all.
      
                              FRANK
                     (incredulous)
                You don't know what your own
                boyfriend looks like?
      
                              CARA
                Alexander crossed a very dangerous
                man. He changed his appearance in
                order to vanish.
      
                                  FRANK
                Great.
      
                              CARA
                Don't worry. I'm taking you
                somewhere you'll be safe.
      
                              FRANK
                We should go to the police.
      
                              CARA
                Because they did such a good job
                protecting you before?
      
      Frank doesn't respond.
      
                                  CARA (CONT'D)
                Trust me.
      
      Frank looks at her. Then relents, leaning his head back
      against the support and closing his eyes.
      
                                                   FADE TO BLACK:
                                                              53.
      
      
      EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF VENICE - MORNING
      
      The car is parked along a muddy canal. Beside it runs a
      small disconnected set of palazzos. Cara shakes Frank.
      He won't wake up.
      
                                  CARA
                Frank... Frank.
      
      He's snoring.   She pinches his nose closed...
      
      He startles awake.   She smiles mischievously.
      
      
      ON A SIDE STREET
      
      He follows her past abandoned tricycles and very old men
      sitting on stone steps.
      
                              FRANK
                And I thought I wouldn't get to do
                any sight-seeing.
      
      Frank steps over a greenish puddle.
      
                                  CARA
                Here we are.
      
      She pauses before a run-down palazzo.
      
      
      INT. RUN DOWN PALAZZO, HALL - NIGHT
      
      The narrow hall is dark and shabby.
      
      Cara walks up the stairs to a door on the landing.     She
      opens it with a key.
      
      
      INT. PEARCE'S "SAFE HOUSE" - NIGHT
      
      It is completely dark inside. The two of them maneuver
      in the darkness. The sound of a hand bumping against a
      wall.
      
      Finally somebody finds the light switch and--
      
      CARA holds a .38 Taurus PISTOL in front of her.
      
      Frank happens to be right in her line of sight.   He
      flinches.
                                                              54.
      
      
                               FRANK
                Whoa!
      
                               CARA
                Sorry.
      
      She quickly directs the gun away from him.    Frank leans
      over, catching his breath.
      
      Cara starts to giggle.   Frank starts to laugh too.
      
      
      INT. KITCHEN, PEARCE'S "SAFE HOUSE" - NIGHT
      
      The apartment appears as if it was leased, stocked and
      then never set foot in again. Brand new appliances that
      have never been used.
      
      Frank walks over to a flat screen TV and curiously peels
      off the protective clear film... He looks up and sees:
      
      Cara has her head inside the OVEN.
      
                              FRANK
                What are you doing?
      
      She pulls out, a flashlight in her mouth.
      
                              CARA
                Making sure no one sabotaged the
                gas lines.
      
      Frank watches her walk over to the FUSE BOXES.
      
      MINUTES LATER
      
      Frank pokes through the cupboards. Stocked with fine
      olives, tins of expensive smoked fish, viands, stewed
      fruit from orchards in France.
      
      He opens the icebox. Inside is frozen meat and fish.     He
      pulls out one package of frozen orange steaks - it is
      labelled "BARRACUDA, CAUGHT ANTIGUA, 8/07".
      
                              FRANK
                He goes Barracuda fishing?
      
      Cara has poured herself a glass of wine.
      
                              CARA
                He goes Marlin fishing. You catch
                the Barracudas by accident.
                                                               55.
      
      
      Frank looks at the steak...
      
      
      INT. DINING AREA, PEARCE'S "SAFE HOUSE" - LATER
      
      CLOSE ON THE FISH -- now seasoned, grilled and surrounded
      by whipped sweet potatoes, beets and almonds.
      
      Frank places a plate before Cara who sits with her wine
      at Pearce's oak table. She looks appreciatively at her
      plate.
      
                               CARA
                 And she left you for a cook?
      
      Frank smiles and pours himself a glass of wine.   Cara
      takes a bite.
      
                                CARA (CONT'D)
                 Mmmmm!   That's decadent.
      
                               FRANK
                 With these ingredients, it's not
                 hard.
      
      Frank savors a bite of his meal.
      
                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                 You know something? Food tastes
                 better after you've been shot at.
      
      Cara laughs.   She clinks his glass.
      
                               CARA
                 I'm glad I decided to come back
                 for you, Frank Taylor.
      
      They watch one another eat for several moments.
      
                               FRANK
                 Can I ask you a question.
      
      She sets down her fork.   Leans back.
      
                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                 What's it like? Being a criminal?
      
                               CARA
                      (scoffs)
                 I'm not a criminal.
                                                                56.
      
      
                              FRANK
                You carry a gun, you consort with
                people being chased by killers... I
                hate to break it to you, but--
      
                              CARA
                Okay, I'm a criminal.
      
      She takes a big gulp of wine.     Moves over to the sofa.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                I didn't mean for things to turn
                out like this. I always lived by
                a certain code. But then... I broke
                it.
      
      She lapses into silence.    Frank comes and sits beside
      her.
      
                              FRANK
                For Alexander Pearce?
      
      She doesn't answer.   Which is an answer.
      
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                What's he like?
      
      A beat.
      
                              CARA
                He's the most interesting man I've
                ever known. When I first met him,
                I wasn't expecting that. He took
                me by surprise.
      
      She shifts deeper into the leather cushions as if
      reliving a memory of sensual pleasure.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                If I'd been prepared, I might not
                have loved him. But I wasn't. So
                I did.
      
      She frowns into her empty wine glass.    Frank slides a
      little closer.
      
                              FRANK
                     (soft)
                I don't regret it, you know.
      
                                 CARA
                Regret what?
                                                             57.
      
      
                                 FRANK
                 Kissing you.
      
      He looks into her eyes. They are sitting very close on
      the sofa. The lights are low. The mood is romantic...
      
      Frank puts an arm over her shoulders and leans in for a
      kiss--
      
      Cara stands abruptly.
      
                               CARA
                 What are you doing?
      
      He looks   up at her, questioningly.
      
                                 FRANK
                 I thought...
      
                               CARA
                 You thought what? That I saw you
                 on the train and my heart stopped?
                 That all my life I've been waiting
                 for a math teacher from the
                 Midwest to sweep me off my feet?
      
      Frank doesn't respond.
      
                               CARA (CONT'D)
                 I picked you because of your
                 height. Do you understand?
      
      He does. His humiliation complete, he rises with as much
      dignity as he can muster and carries the plates into the
      kitchen.
      
      Cara looks after him... exasperated yet already sorry for
      being so blunt. She is about to say something when...
      
      Her CELL PHONE RINGS.     A special ring.
      
      She answers right away.
      
      
      EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - EVENING
      
      The ENGLISHMAN strolls the Piazza San Marco.    FOLLOW HIM
      from behind as he speaks into his phone.
      
                               THE ENGLISHMAN
                 Have you been reading the
                 newspaper?
                                                               58.
      
      
      IN THE SAFE HOUSE
      
      Cara narrows her focus. She walks away from Frank,
      stealing away into the bedroom. Her heart is beating.
      
                                CARA
                Yes... there was nothing there
                today. Is... is it you? Alexa--
      
                                THE ENGLISHMAN
                No names.    Not on the phone.
      
      
      INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - EVENING
      
      The WAVE PATTERNS of the man's voice shimmer on a
      computer monitor. Goyal and Ackerman stand watching,
      hanging on every word.
      
                              THE ENGLISHMAN (V.O.)
                     (from the speakers)
                It's been a busier weekend than I
                expected.
      
                               ACKERMAN
                Place him.   Place him!
      
      A HORN-RIMMED AIDE zeroes in on a MAP screen.
      
      The screen gives him a map of VENICE.      Then zooms into a
      map of the SAN MARCO district...
      
      
      INT. BEDROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - CONTINUOUS
      
      Cara holds one finger in her ear, listening intently.
      
                              THE ENGLISHMAN (V.O.)
                There's a recipe in a Tuscan
                cookbook there I need. Would you
                look it up for me?
      
                              CARA
                Do we really need another
                "recipe?"
      
                              THE ENGLISHMAN
                I want to make sure our guests are
                surprised.
                                                             59.
      
      
      EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - EVENING
      
      The Englishman passes the Lagoon to his left, and enters
      an enormous courtyard, the Arco Foscari. He looks down
      at his watch...
      
                              THE ENGLISHMAN
                You're a brave and loyal girl.
                I'm in awe of you.
      
      
      INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - EVENING
      
      The computer map hones in on the PIAZZA SAN MARCO...
      
                                  ACKERMAN
                Go!   Go!   Go!
      
      Goyal is already out the door and Ackerman grabs his
      Kevlar vest and follows, racing down the steps...
      
      
      INT. BEDROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - CONTINUOUS
      
      Cara folds her arms as she listens.
      
                              CARA
                That's because you leave
                everything up to me.
      
      She pouts, only partially joking.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                I'm fine by the way, in case you
                were concerned about me.
      
                              THE ENGLISHMAN
                     (playful)
                My only concern is for those who
                cross you, my love.
      
      
      EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - EVENING
      
      At last The Englishman arrives before the lower colonnade
      of the DOGE'S PALACE, the seat of medieval Venetian civic
      government. It is a wonder of Gothic architecture with
      spires piercing the blue sky.
      
      He gazes up at it for a moment.
                                                             60.
      
      
                              THE ENGLISHMAN
                You may not believe it, but every
                step of this miserable game is
                taken in the hope of earning your
                trust and ever-lasting regard. I
                mean that.
      
      The Englishman is at the Ponte del Suspiri-- the "Bridge
      of Sighs."
      
      
      INT. BEDROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - EVENING
      
      Cara's expression softens.
      
                              CARA
                You have a talent for saying the
                right thing.
                     (to herself)
                You always did.
      
      OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM DOOR
      
      Frank listens to the end of Cara's conversation, his
      forehead creased with concern.
      
      
      EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, CAFE - NIGHT
      
      The Englishman closes his phone and disappears into the
      crowd.
      
      
      INT. BEDROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - NIGHT
      
      Cara speaks urgently.
      
                                 CARA
                Wait--
      
      The line is dead.
      
      
      EXT. PONTE DEL SUSPIRI - SECONDS LATER
      
      A silent caravan of three black SUV's - a strange sight
      in Venice - pull up in perimeter around the Bridge of
      Sighs and skids to a stop.
      
      Ackerman and the others leap out, looking around.   Then
      Ackerman sees it:
      
      The Englishman's CELL PHONE, sitting on the cobblestones.
                                                             61.
      
      
      They approach.   Goyal kneels to pick it up with a plastic
      bag.
      
                               GOYAL
                 We should check for prints.    Maybe
                 he forgot to wipe it down...
      
                               ACKERMAN
                 I doubt it.
      
      Ackerman looks around.
      
      
      INT. BEDROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - NIGHT
      
      Holding her now unimportant phone in her hand, Cara draws
      herself up and walks into the
      
      SITTING AREA
      
      Frank lies asleep on the couch.
      
      Cara walks to the kitchen and retrieves the Tuscan
      Cookbook. Thinking herself unobserved, she opens it.
      
      A PAGE has been turned down.   A recipe for LAMB.
      
      Cara pulls out her red, felt-tipped pen. She finds a
      sentence in the recipe with a single pen dot beside it.
      
      Tapping her pen under letters on the page, Cara works out
      the code, memorizes the contents of the message and
      closes the book.
      
      ON FRANK
      
      His eyes are open.
      
      
      EXT. VENICE - MORNING
      
      Establishing shots of the city as it comes to life in the
      winter time.
      
      Boats are pushed out into the canals...
      
      Trash is hosed from the cobblestone streets...
      
      Tables and chairs are set out at sidewalk cafes, waiting
      for the tourists to come...
                                                             62.
      
      
      INT. SITTING ROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - MORNING
      
      With an unfamiliar gentleness, Cara approaches Frank
      sleeping on the sofa and touches his shoulder.
      
                                CARA
                Frank... I have to go.
      
      He opens his eyes and looks at her.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                Don't go out. All you need is
                here. In four or five days
                everything will be resolved...
      
                               FRANK
                Resolved?
      
                              CARA
                It will all be over. I'll give
                you the all clear and you can go
                back to your life. This will be a
                great adventure you can look back
                on.
      
                              FRANK
                When will I see you again?
      
                               CARA
                Never.
      
      She looks at him evenly; one last glance between two
      people from two completely different worlds.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                Good-bye, Frank.
      
      She leaves.
      
      
      INT. RUN DOWN PALAZZO, HALL - DAY
      
      She has started down the stairs when Frank appears on the
      landing. He leans over the balustrade.
      
                              FRANK
                Is he worth it?
      
                              CARA
                Get back inside.
      
      She has stopped mid-flight.
                                                            63.
      
      
                              FRANK
                You're going to risk everything
                for him. Would he do the same for
                you?
      
      She is quite straightforward in her response.
      
                              CARA
                It doesn't matter. I love him.
      
                              FRANK
                He doesn't deserve it.
      
      She shakes her head.
      
                              CARA
                None of this is your business
                anymore. Now get back inside
                Frank!
      
      Just as she raises her voice a door opens below them in
      the hall, and an old man comes out. He looks up at Cara.
      
                               OLD MAN
                Signorina.
      
      This is exactly what she did not want. But she controls
      her annoyance, nods in greeting and continues towards the
      front door.
      
                              CARA
                     (to the neighbor)
                Mi dispiace, Signor.
      
      The Old Neighbor nods as Cara walks out the door.
      
      He admires Cara's shapely form as she crosses the
      cobblestone streets and disappears into the alley.
      
      He glances back up at Frank and whistles appreciatively.
      Frank turns and goes back inside.
      
      
      INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY
      
      Ackerman sits in an office chair, gently revolving.
      Jones, Goyal and Jean Luc are there as well.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Why do women find these con men so
                appealing?
      
      Jones is the only woman nearby...
                                                           64.
      
      
                              JONES
                Don't look at me. I married my
                personal trainer.
                     (sotto Jean Luc)
                She's twenty-six.
      
      Jean Luc can't tell if she's serious.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                How did Pearce seduce that
                beautiful woman? Was it his
                charm? His looks?
      
                                GOYAL
                Looks change.
      
      Ackerman sips from his ten thousandth cup of espresso.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Maybe it's because if he adores
                himself and spends every moment
                gratifying his desires, so then
                can she.
      
      He looks around to see if the others like this theory.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                She can become a child again. Who
                wouldn't want that?
      
      There is a bitterness in Ackerman's tone that reveals he
      is personally hurt by this.
      
      Goyal's Blackberry makes a beep.
      
                              GOYAL
                She's on the move. Time to go.
      
      Ackerman pushes himself wearily to his feet.
      
                                ACKERMAN
                By all means.    Let's follow the
                children.
      
      
      INT. KITCHEN, "SAFE HOUSE" - DAY
      
      Paging through the cookbook, Frank locates the page. He
      smiles in recognition at the familiar CODE pattern of red
      dots. He pulls out a PEN...
                                                            65.
      
      
      INT. BATHROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - DAY
      
      Frank examines a sleek, tiny electric razor that
      resembles a lollipop. Turning it on, he applies it.
      Pleased, he keeps shaving.
      
      Getting out of the shower, Frank enjoys the soft Frette
      towels.
      
      
      INT. MASTER BEDROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - DAY
      
      In the closets are dozens of flawless, custom-tailored
      suits.
      
      Flipping through the rack like a discerning shopper,
      Frank arrives at a suit that catches his fancy. Elegant
      and simple.
      
      
      IN THE MIRROR
      
      Frank struggles to close Alexander Pearce's pants around
      his lightly padded mid-section... a little too tight.
      
      Frank is irritated to discover he's not quite as trim as
      Pearce.
      
      
      ON THE BEDROOM FLOOR
      
      Frank engages himself in a spontaneous program of
      CALISTHENICS. He struggles through a batch of push-ups,
      then sit ups.
      
      
      IN THE MIRROR
      
      Frank flosses his teeth. Then he backs up, taking in his
      outfit. The lines of the suit highlight his frame.
      
      He likes what he sees.
      
      
      INT. DEMIDOV'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
      
      Demidov is getting dressed. It's an elaborate ritual:
      carefully pressed pants, ironed shirt, starched collar,
      etc.
      
      His two BODYGUARDS stand nervously at attention, watching
      him.
                                                              66.
      
      
                              DEMIDOV
                When I was a young man, times were
                very hard. When an opportunity
                presented itself, you took it.
      
      He pats talcum powder on himself.    The men remain stone-
      faced.
      
                              DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                I was twelve years old when Gregor
                asked me if I was ready for a
                man's job. He was the top
                chelovek in our housing block. So
                I said yes. He gave me a crowbar
                and told me to go bash in the
                skull of another boy who had
                stolen something from him.
      
      He points at his platinum cufflinks on a bedside table
      and snaps his fingers. Scarface hands them to him.
      
                              DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                Now it just so happened this boy
                was a friend of mine. I did not
                want to do this terrible thing.
                But when you come from the
                streets, you have no choice.
      
      He carefully knots his tie in the mirror.
      
                                DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                I worked   very hard for years to
                get past   that life. So I would
                not have   to do these terrible
                things.    So I would have a choice...
      
      He turns and smiles at his THICK-NECKED bodyguard.    He
      gestures toward the man's holstered pistol --
      
                                 DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                I have people like you to do these
                things for me...
      
      He holds out his hand; THICK NECK hands him the pistol.
      
                              DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                Except that you don't!
      
      Suddenly Demidov pistol whips the man across the face!
      
      Blood explodes from THICK NECK's nose.     He falls down to
      one knee, clutching his face in pain.
                                                             67.
      
      
      Scarface looks on in fear. Demidov calms himself almost
      as quickly as he lost his temper. He drops the gun on
      the carpet and steps back in disgust.
      
                              DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                If you did your job properly, I
                wouldn't have to get my hands
                dirty, you piece of shit.
      
      He turns and walks into the bathroom to wash his hands.
      
                                                        CUT TO:
      
      
      EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY
      
      Heels clicking on the cobblestones, Cara strides quickly
      along the Palazzo Vendramin en route to the Cipriani.
      She checks her watch. Then walks faster.
      
      She passes a smallish transporto via cargo (supply boat)
      floating in the lagoon beside the Palazzo.
      
      Cara approaches the poolside hotel restaurant.
      
      
      INT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY
      
      From a second story SUITE of rooms, The ENGLISHMAN peers
      through the curtains. He sees Cara seat herself at a
      TABLE between the pool and the lagoon.
      
      His eyes settle on the transporto. Workers step on and
      off, carrying fresh linens into the hotel.
      
      He leaves the window.
      
      
      INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
      
      There is a small cabin on the deck.
      
      Inside the cabin, Ackerman, Goyal, a videographer, a
      signals surveillance officer and a coordinating tactics
      officer huddle.
      
      Ackerman stares out the tinted window.
      
      ACKERMAN'S POV - he can just see Cara sitting at the
      table.
                                                              68.
      
      
      EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY
      
      Fanning herself with a newspaper, Cara discreetly
      evaluates the men in her sight lines. Venetian civic
      leaders chatting by the bar, tourists reading maps...
      
      Over her sunglasses she catches sight of a pair of YOUNG
      LOVERS drunk in each other's grasp in the pool.
      
      She turns away.
      
      
      INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
      
      Squinting, Ackerman evaluates his placements.
      
      - A WAITER, idling at his bussing station, his eyes
      roaming the palazzo.
      
      - A VAPORETTO CAPTAIN, who quietly turns away requests
      for a ride into St. Marks Square, his finger to his ear.
      
      - An OLDER COUPLE sitting a few seats away from Cara.
      
      And an AGENTE DI POLIZIA (police patrolman) loud and
      jovial, joking with passersby, while quietly checking his
      earpiece.
      
      He speaks into the air.
      
                              AGENTE DI POLIZIA (V.O.)
                     (from the speakers)
                Eh, we do not know any
                further...characteristics?
      
                              ACKERMAN
                     (pressing a button)
                You know what we know.
      
      
      EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY
      
      The VIDEO CAMERA swivels to follow a MAN, elegantly
      dressed, with trim hair who swiftly approaches Cara's
      table...
      
      
      IN THE TRANSPORTO
      
      Standing up, Ackerman holds his hand up.
                                                             69.
      
      
                              ACKERMAN
                     (into the speaker)
                Hold...wait for my signal...
      
      
      AT THE RESTAURANT
      
      Cara glances up from her menu as she senses the elegant
      man approaching.
      
      The WAITER walks quickly toward Cara's table...
      
      The elegant man is FRANK.
      
      
      IN THE TRANSPORTO
      
      Ackerman stares at the monitor with Frank's face on it.
      He's quietly furious.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                What is that fool doing in the
                middle of my operation?
      
      
      AT THE RESTAURANT
      
      Cara stares slack-jawed at Frank.
      
      He has given himself a complete make-over.    New haircut.
      Pearce's suit fits him well.
      
      He looks terrific. Cara notices before quickly recovering
      her composure.
      
                              FRANK
                Time for Alexander and me to meet
                face to face.
      
                              CARA
                     (quietly)
                I don't know what you're talking
                about. Please go, I'd like to
                have a quiet coffee.
      
      Frank sits at the table with Cara and eats a CASHEW.
      
      
      IN THE TRANSPORTO
      
      Ackerman barks whispered orders into the speaker:
                                                             70.
      
      
                              ACKERMAN
                     (frustrated)
                Move off. Move off.
      
      The UNDERCOVER WAITER quickly moves away from Cara's
      table.
      
      Ackerman stares at the monitor which captures Cara's
      angry expression.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                     (talking to the
                      screen)
                Get rid of him!
      
      
      AT THE POOLSIDE RESTAURANT
      
      Defiantly, Frank pulls his chair in closer to Cara.    He
      signals to a different THIN WAITER.
      
                              FRANK
                     (to the waiter)
                Caffe, per favore?
      
      Frank turns back to Cara, who calls out--
      
                               CARA
                Cameriere!   No caffe for signor!
      
                              FRANK
                     (contradicting her)
                With milk!
      
      She stares at him.
      
                              CARA
                Do you want to be dead?
      
                              FRANK
                Not particularly, but I'm tired of
                being afraid. I've been running
                around like a frightened mouse
                long enough and I've decided I'm
                finished.
      
      Frank pulls out a Gitane cigarette.   He lights it,
      smoking while he talks.
                                                            71.
      
      
                                FRANK (CONT'D)
                When I first saw the name I got
                scared: "Alexander Pearce." He
                even sounds like some super cool
                master criminal with Russian
                enemies and the beautiful
                girlfriend... he probably works out.
                He might own a pizza shop on the
                side for all I know.
      
      Frank frowns at the cigarette.
      
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                These are disgusting.
      
      
      INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
      
      Goyal is seated at the communication station.
      
      ON THE MONITOR - Frank is settled in opposite Cara.
      
                              GOYAL
                He's not going anywhere.
      
      Ackerman peers directly out the window, as if he's going
      to see something different.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Put Lipetti in. Tell him to play
                it like he's dealing with a rowdy
                guest-- escort him out.
      
      
      EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY
      
      Cara looks all around.   No sign of any suitor
      approaching.
      
      CLOSE ON: the hands of the THIN WAITER, who sprinkles
      pepper carefully, presumably onto a dish. He then
      platters the dish and lifts it over his shoulder.
      
                              CARA
                Frank, you have no idea what
                you're sticking your nose into.
      
                              FRANK
                Probably not. But I'm doing it
                anyway. Alexander Pearce nearly
                got me killed. It was his idea,
                right?
                              (MORE)
                                                            72.
      
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                He told you to pick out some
                random sap on the train to take a
                bullet for him, didn't he?
      
      Frank works himself up, drawing courage from his anger.
      
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                Well I'm not playing the role
                anymore. I'm going to confront
                him. He's supposed to meet you
                here, isn't he? I'm going to tell
                him exactly what I think of him.
      
                              CARA
                Wonderful. Another macho idiot.
                     (to the waiter)
                Conto, per favore!
      
      Frank leans in.
      
                              FRANK
                What's the lure, Cara? Obviously
                not his character. Is it the
                money? The luxury? What's any of
                that worth if you're getting shot
                at and you could go to jail?
      
                              CARA
                I'm leaving Frank.
      
                              FRANK
                He's smooth, right? He probably
                has mistresses in every European
                city, too.
      
                              CARA
                It's really a shame you've scared
                him off--
      
      She tosses some Euros on the table.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                The two of you make a nice couple.
      
      The THIN WAITER arrives with a PLATTER.   He sets it down
      in front of Cara.
      
      The UNDERCOVER WAITER now moves toward the table with a
      grim expression...
      
      The THIN WAITER removes the platter.   Cara looks down.
                                                                73.
      
      
      Spelled out in SALT and PEPPER on the plate is the
      following:
      
      "MY VILLA.    TONIGHT. 8PM."
      
      Cara no sooner reads it than the Thin Waiter, who we now
      see is THE ENGLISHMAN...
      
      ...BLOWS on the platter, scattering the salt and pepper
      granules to the wind.
      
                                    FRANK
                   What the hell?
      
      As Frank looks up.
      
      The Englishman has already turned away, but the
      Undercover Waiter is moving quickly toward Cara's table.
      
      The Undercover Waiter picks up speed, changing course
      slightly. WE SEE he's after The Englishman who is about
      to enter the restaurant kitchen...
      
      Then FRANK steps in front of The Undercover Waiter,
      mistaking him for Pearce.
      
                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                   Is this him?
      
                                    CARA
                   Frank!
      
      
      INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
      
      Ackerman slaps the cabin table.
      
                                  ACKERMAN
                   Abort!   Abort, goddammit!
      
      
      THE POOLSIDE RESTAURANT
      
      The Undercover Waiter tries to move past Frank.
      
                                 FRANK
                   You hide out poolside and send
                   your girlfriend and a total
                   stranger to face the murderers who
                   are after you? Not much of a
                   tough guy, are you?
      
      Frank SHOVES him back.
                                                             74.
      
      
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                Where I come from, we don't treat
                women like that!
      
      Frank grabs the Undercover Waiter's collar with
      unaccustomed strength.
      
      Cara quietly picks up her bag and leaves the restaurant.
      She walks as fast as she can without being noticed toward
      the Palazzo Vendramin.
      
      In the midst of his scuffle, Frank looks around and
      realizes she's gone.
      
      The Undercover Waiter's earpiece falls out in the melee...
      Frank sees it and hesitates. Maybe this guy isn't
      Pearce.
      
      
      INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
      
      Getting up from his seat in the cabin, Ackerman gestures
      for the captain of the transporto to leave the dock.
      
      ON THE MONITOR: Frank looks around and sees Cara:     fifty
      feet away. Walking with purpose.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                That goddamn fool.
      
      Ackerman rubs his face and squats down, frustrated beyond
      measure.
      
                              GOYAL
                What do we do with him?
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Throw him in the lagoon.
      
                                                          CUT TO:
      
      
      EXT. PALAZZO VENDRAMIN - DAY
      
      Frank brushes past tables, hits the street and RUNS down
      the Palazzo, toward Cara.
      
                               FRANK
                Cara!
      
      Cara says nothing. She just shoots Frank an angry glance
      and climbs onto A VAPORETTO (water taxi).
                                                              75.
      
      
      Frank runs to the edge of the water as it motors away.
      
      Suddenly he feels the presence of somebody behind him.
      TWO of ACKERMAN'S MEN are right there.
      
      They pin his arms forcefully.
      
                                AGENT
                Ok Signor... you can come with us
                now.
      
      Frank looks at the two big men on either side of him.
      Then at Cara disappearing over the water. The fight
      drains out of him and he doesn't resist.
      
                                                           CUT TO:
      
      
      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
      
      Frank sits alone in the sparsely furnished, windowless
      room. A table, two chairs. A large mirror on the wall.
      
      Frank straightens his slightly disheveled suit, as if
      he's been dumped here without ceremony.
      
      He glances in the mirror periodically, suspicious.
      
      The door opens and Ackerman enters. He pulls up one of
      the chairs and gestures for Frank to do the same.
      
                                 ACKERMAN
                Please...
      
      He looks Frank up and down.
      
                                 ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Nice suit.
      
                                 FRANK
                It's borrowed.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                It's a good fit.
      
                                 FRANK
                Unfortunately.
      
      Ackerman reaches into his breast pocket and takes out his
      INTERPOL credentials. Tosses them on the table for Frank
      to see.
                                                              76.
      
      
                                FRANK (CONT'D)
                 Police... better than the
                 alternative I suppose.
      
      Ackerman smiles. Frank remains defiant.      He jerks his
      head toward the mirror confidently.
      
                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                 Who's watching from behind there?
      
      Ackerman looks over at the mirror, taken off guard by the
      question. He stands and goes to the mirror -- lifts it
      off its hooks and sets it on the floor.
      
      Nothing but plain wall underneath. Ackerman sits back
      down. Frank is a little bit chastened.
      
                               ACKERMAN
                 You have a vivid imagination.
      
                               FRANK
                 I haven't needed it lately.
      
      Ackerman smiles.
      
                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                 You're in for a disappointment.
                 I'm not Alexander Pearce.
      
                                ACKERMAN
                 I know that.
      
      Frank looks up.
      
                                FRANK
                 Since when?
      
                               ACKERMAN
                 Since the beginning.
      
      Frank stares at him blankly...
      
                                FRANK
                 How...?
      
                               ACKERMAN
                 Come. I want to show you
                 something Frank.
      
                                                           CUT TO:

      INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY
      
      Ackerman leads Frank through the maze of desks and
      police. Various members of the task force follow their
      progress... Jean Luc, Jones, etc.
      
      They arrive at a central INTEL area where Goyal sits in
      front of several computer monitors.
      
      He looks up as Ackerman and Frank arrive.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                     (to Goyal)
                Pull up the CID Academy graduating
                class for 2002.
      
      Goyal raises an eyebrow, but does as he's told. A few
      moments later a photo of POLICE RECRUITS in uniform comes
      up on screen.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Take a good look.
      
      Frank peers at the screen. He spots the instructor--
      Ackerman seven years younger.
      
                              FRANK
                You?
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Take a look at the second row.
      
      INSERT CLOSE UP on the screen.
      
      Frank examines the second row. One of the young women
      is... CARA MASON. Her hair is pulled back. She looks more
      the determined police cadet than the sexy siren...  but
      it's definitely her.
      
                              FRANK
                Cara...
      
      He is dumbfounded.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                We've been watching you this
                entire time.
      
                              FRANK
                     (dawning)
                You saw those men try to kill me
                and you didn't intervene?
                                                              78.
      
      
                              ACKERMAN
                I'm trying to apprehend a major
                criminal. I'm not a babysitter.
      
      Frank grows angry.
      
                              FRANK
                I want to speak with somebody at
                the American Embassy. I'm going
                to tell them that you and your
                undercover officer knowingly and
                recklessly endangered the life of
                an American citizen! Let's see
                what my government has to say
                about that!
      
      Jones clears her throat from a chair across the room.
      
                               JONES
                We're aware of the situation, Mr.
                Taylor. But we take a long view
                of these things... fortunately you
                are unhurt... 
      
      Frank is incredulous.
      
                              FRANK
                Then I'll go to the press. I'll
                tell the entire story to the New
                York Times.
      
                               ACKERMAN
                      (quietly)
                No.   I don't think you'll do that.
      
                               FRANK
                Why not?
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Because I don't think you want to
                see Cara's entire career
                destroyed.
      
      Frank falls silent. Ackerman puts an arm around his
      shoulder and leads him away from the others.
      
                               ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Espresso?

      EXT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY
      
      Frank stands on a balcony overlooking a waterway.
      Ackerman emerges with two cups of espresso. Hands one to
      Frank.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Women like Cara don't come along
                very often.
      
                              FRANK
                In my case, they don't come along
                at all.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                She's the worst combination:
                stunning looks and a brilliant
                mind.
      
                              FRANK
                If she's so smart, how did she get
                caught up with Pearce?
      
                              ACKERMAN
                It started out as a
                straightforward placement...
      
      
      INT. DOGE'S PALACE - DAY [FLASHBACK]
      
      Cara (younger) poses as an art student, sketching a
      SCULPTURE in the Anticollegio.
      
                                ACKERMAN (V.O.)
                ...we ran her deep cover to build a
                case against Pearce. It took. He
                hired her as an assistant.
      
      She turns her face and smiles at an UNSEEN MAN.
      
      
      EXT. YACHT - DAY [FLASHBACK]
      
      The wind blows in Cara's hair. She sits on the top deck.
      A MAN'S HAND passes her a drink as he walks by. She
      smiles at him (again we do not see his face).
      
                              ACKERMAN (V.O.)
                Then she began missing drops.
                Omitting important details.
                                                           80.
      
      
      EXT. BALCONY - RESUME SCENE
      
      Ackerman turns to Frank.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                She was no longer with us.   She
                was with him.
      
      Ackerman finishes his espresso.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                She explains it now as the
                confusion of her new life outside
                the academy. That I misread her
                capacity for this kind of work.
      
                              FRANK
                Then why are you still using her?
      
                              ACKERMAN
                She's all I have, Mr. Taylor.
      
      Beat.
      
                              FRANK
                You think she'll turn him in this
                time?
      
                                 ACKERMAN
                I don't know.
      
      Goyal walks up behind Ackerman waiting patiently for a
      moment to interrupt him.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                I do know however, that you are
                very smitten with her.
      
      Frank looks back at him evenly.
      
                              FRANK
                It's not just me, is it?
      
      Ackerman acknowledges the point with the barest of nods.
      
      Goyal signals that Ackerman has a phone call.

      The principal apartment of a Venetian palazzo, looking
      out over the Grand Canal.
      
      Cara holds her cell phone to her ear as she walks.
      
                                 ACKERMAN (V.O.)
                Cara?     Where have you been?
      
      INTERCUT WITH
      
      ACKERMAN on the phone at his office.
      
                              CARA
                Have you got him?
      
                              ACKERMAN
                You mean the idiot who ruined our

                              CARA
                Have you got him?
      
      Ackerman glances out the window at Frank.
      
                                 ACKERMAN
                Yes.
      
      Cara is relieved.
      
                              CARA
                It's your own fault. We never
                should have endangered a civilian.
                You should have put an agent into
                place.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                There was no time. Besides Pearce
                is too smart for that; he would
                have spotted the agent a mile
                away.
      
                              CARA
                He didn't spot me.
      
      Ackerman smiles bitterly.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Apparently he didn't have to.
      
      Cara doesn't answer. Ackerman regrets the jibe.   He
      steps into a HALLWAY where it's quiet.
                                                           82.

                 I'm sorry Cara. That was uncalled
                 for.
      
      ON HER FACE as she listens to him.
      
                               ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                 I'm on edge because of our failure
                 today. If only the American
                 hadn't messed everything up... I
                 felt sure Pearce would show up
                 today.
      
                               CARA
                 What makes you think he didn't?

                 Okay everybody, listen up.

                 We have a location and time for
                 the next meet.    Pearce's villa.
                 Eight o'clock. We have to move
                 fast--
      
                               JONES
                 Pearce's own villa? Why would he
                 risk going back there? He must
                 know we'd be watching.
      
                               JEAN LUC
                 Perhaps he's nostalgic.
      
                               ACKERMAN
                 I doubt that. Maybe there's
                 something of value still there.
                 He left in a hurry after all.
      
                               JONES
                 Call in a search team.

                               ACKERMAN
                 We searched the place after the
                 raid last year. If there's
                 anything hidden there, only Pearce
                 knows where it is.
      
      He picks up his coat.

                 around the villa.
      
      Frank speaks up unexpectedly.
      
                               FRANK
                 If you're all around his house,
                 will he show up?
      
      A dozen heads turn to look at him.
      
                               ACKERMAN
                 If I needed your advice Mr.
                 Taylor, I'd ask.
      
      Frank shrinks down in his chair.
      
      A beat.   Ackerman turns back to the rest of the room.
      
                               ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                 Establish a wide perimeter. We'll
                 keep our distance and wire the
                 entire villa for video

      A standard hotel room-- no lavish suite this time.
      
      Cara stands in front of the mirror. Her shirt is
      unbuttoned as she works to attach a TINY MICROPHONE to
      her bra.
      
      The tape gets stuck to itself and she has to start over...
      
      A KNOCK on her hotel room door.
                                                               84.
      
      
                                 CARA
                Come in.
      
      Frank enters the room.    Sees her half-dressed--
      
                                 FRANK
                I'm sorry.
      
                              CARA
                It's okay.   Come over here.    I
                need your help.
      
      In an echo of their first meeting on the train (but
      without the false flirtation) she turns to him and hands
      him a piece of tape.
      
      Their eyes meet.   A flicker of a smile passes between
      them.
      
      Frank's fingers are perfectly steady this time as he
      helps her secure the microphone and do up her shirt.
      
                              FRANK
                Ackerman told me everything.
      
      She takes a deep breath.
      
                              CARA
                I'm sorry Frank.
      
                              FRANK
                There's no apology necessary.
      
      He steps back from her.    She smooths her blouse.   Turns
      to him.
      
                               CARA
                     (re: the wire)
                How do I look?
      
                              FRANK
                Like the most beautiful woman on
                earth.
      
      The complete honesty and directness of his compliment
      takes her by surprise. She's strangely moved by it.
      
      She brushes her hand affectionately over his cheek.
      
                              CARA
                When will you go home?
                                                             85.
      
      
                               FRANK
                 Ackerman asked me to stay with the
                 surveillance team in case the
                 thugs who came after me at the
                 Danieli show up. I'm the only one
                 who can identify them.
      
      Something occurs to Frank.
      
                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                 Did you tell him to keep an eye on
                 me?
      
                               CARA
                      (busted)
                 I told him to make sure you were
                 safe until this was over.
      
      He nods.   A little pleased at her concern.
      
                               FRANK
                 You shouldn't worry about me.
                 What about you?
      
                                  CARA
                 What about me?
      
                               FRANK
                 What are you going to do?
      
      She takes a beat, then puts her game face on.
      
                                  CARA
                 My job.
      
                                                         CUT TO:
      
      
      EXT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT
      
      A light mist. The sound of water lapping against the
      shore. The scene is familiar... almost identical to the
      night of the raid just over a year ago.
      
      Then a wind picks up and blows the mist clear.
      
      REVEAL an undercover POLICEMAN with an earpiece walking a
      dog a block away...
      
      ON A ROOFTOP three blocks away -   A SNIPER with a scope.
      
      INSIDE AN APARTMENT - a FEMALE AGENT with binoculars
      scans the empty street below.
                                                             86.
      
      
      ON THE CORNER - two blocks down is a village CHURCH.
      
      
      INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
      
      Ackerman and his team have set up a make-shift
      surveillance outpost here. The high-tech equipment looks
      incongruous with the thousand year-old stone walls and
      worn oak pews.
      
      A bank of monitors reveals various views of the inside
      and outside of Alexander's villa.
      
      Frank hovers in the background behind Ackerman. He
      notices Ackerman has a copy of the International Herald
      Tribune.
      
                              FRANK
                You all read the same newspaper.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                It's a good paper. And sold
                throughout the world. Makes the
                classified ads especially useful...
      
      Frank nods. Ackerman sits down next to Frank as if he
      were an old pal instead of a quasi-captive.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Since the internet came about,
                hardly anybody uses old school
                methods like that to communicate
                anymore. Except Alexander Pearce.
                No lines to tap. No signals to
                intercept.
                     (admiringly)
                He's a very clever man, your
                double.
      
                              FRANK
                I look forward to meeting him.
      
                                 ACKERMAN
                So do I.
      
      
      EXT. WATERWAY - NIGHT
      
      A PATROL BOAT circles in the canal behind the villa.   One
      of Ackerman's ITALIAN AGENTS is at the wheel.
      
      He sees a flat-bottomed black BOAT motoring toward him.
      A light from the boat shines in his eyes.
                                                             87.
      
      
                              AGENT
                     (in Italian)
                You'll have to turn around, sir.
                There's been a chemical spill in
                this area--
      
      FWWWAP! A silenced bullet strikes him in the forehead.
      The agent topples into the water with a gentle splash.
      
      The black boat steers around the rudderless patrol boat
      and heads toward the villa...
      
      
      INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT
      
      BINOCULAR POV - a lone female figure walks down the
      cobblestone streets toward the villa.
      
      CARA.
      
                              SURVEILLANCE AGENT (V.O.)
                She's approaching the destination
                now.
      
      
      EXT. BACK OF THE VILLA - NIGHT
      
      The black boat slips underneath some moorings.
      
      A gloved hand tosses a grappling hook up to a beam ten
      feet overhead. It catches. The boat is tied off.
      
      Silently, a masked figure begins to climb from the boat
      up into the bottom floor of the villa in the semi-
      darkness.
      
      
      INT. SURVEILLANCE OUTPOST IN CHURCH
      
      ON THE MONITOR WE SEE
      
      PEARCE'S ENTRY HALL. Cara unlocks the front door with a
      key and walks inside.
      
      
      INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA/VIDEO MONITORS - CONTINUOUS
      
      TRACK from screen to screen as WE FOLLOW Cara moving
      through the deserted rooms.
      
      Everything is cold and lifeless.   Like a palace that has
      been turned into a museum.
                                                                88.
      
      
      INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
      
      While everyone is focused on the monitors showing Cara's
      progress, Frank notices some movement in a monitor far
      off to one side...
      
      It shows the lower floor of the house.
      
                                 FRANK
                      (points)
                 Who's that?
      
      They all turn to look. A male figure, his face masked,
      approaches the lens of the surveillance camera...
      
      BLINK!   The FEED shuts off.
      
      Ackerman barks at a technician.
      
                               ACKERMAN
                 What happened? Get it back on
                 line!
      
      The surveillance techs begin madly punching buttons, etc.
      
                               JONES
                 Was that Pearce?
      
                               GOYAL
                 How did he know there would be a
                 camera?
      
      BLINK!   Another monitor goes dark.   Then another.
      
                               JONES
                 He's taking out the entire
                 surveillance system--
      
                                 ACKERMAN
                 Stop him.
      
                              TECHNICIAN
                 I can't! He's cutting the feed at
                 the source.
      
      Frank looks anxiously at Cara on the monitor climbing the
      stairs...
      
      Blink! She disappears from view as well.      Everybody
      starts talking.
                                                              89.
      
      
                               JEAN LUC
                 How can one man move through the
                 house that fast?
      
                               GOYAL
                      (overlapping)
                 What should we do?
      
                                 ACKERMAN
                 Shut up!    Everyone.
      
      They quiet down.   Ackerman turns to the tech.
      
                               ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                 Do we still have audio?
      
      The tech nods.
      
                                 ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                 Turn it up.
      
      Everybody in the Church stands stock still.    Staring at
      the dark monitors. Listening.
      
      Cara's footsteps click up the stairs and then slow...
      
      They move tentatively across the floor.
      
      WE HEAR A THUMP.   A door or a heavy footstep?
      
      Cara's breathing gets louder.    There's somebody else in
      the building.
      
                                 CARA (V.O.)
                 Alexander?
      
      No response.   Click, clack, click... She takes a few steps.
      
      ON FRANK -- concerned.
      
      ON ACKERMAN -- calm.
      
      
      INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
      
      Cara stands in the center of the large room. She catches
      sight of her reflection in the large floor-to-ceiling
      window. There's a movement in the doorway behind her...
      
      She spins around to face...
      
      DEMIDOV.   He and his two men have removed their masks.
                                                            90.
      
      
                              DEMIDOV
                Sorry to disappoint you, my dear.
      
      He steps toward her.
      
      Cara pales.
      
      
      INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
      
      Everybody strains to hear what is happening.
      
                              JONES
                     (whispers)
                Who is that?
      
                              DEMIDOV (V.O.)
                How are you this evening?
      
                              CARA (V.O.)
                     (a tremor in her
                      voice)
                Fine, thank you.
      
                              JEAN LUC
                The accent is Russ--
      
                                ACKERMAN
                Shh!
                     (quietly)
                It's Ivan Demidov.
      
      Jones looks at him.
      
                              JONES
                     (uncertainly)
                Not possible.
      
      INTERCUT WITH THE VILLA
      
      Cara takes a step back toward the window.   Demidov
      follows.
      
                              DEMIDOV
                You're waiting for someone, Ms.
                Mason?
      
      Cara doesn't reply.
      
                              DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                You haven't seen Alexander Pearce
                in a long time, yes? I'm sure it
                will be a touching reunion.
                              (MORE)
                                                           91.
      
                              DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                If you don't mind, we'll keep you
                company while you wait.
      
                              GOYAL
                     (anxious)
                What are we going to do?
      
                              ACKERMAN
                We're going to wait for Alexander
                Pearce. Just like them.
      
      
      EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
      
      SNIPER'S POV - CARA has maneuvered close enough to the
      window that she is visible. As they approach, Demidov
      and his two men come into range as well.
      
                              SNIPER
                     (into his radio mic)
                She's brought them to the window...
      
      
      INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
      
      Everybody is listening.
      
                                SNIPER (V.O.)
                ...there are three of them.
      
      ON FRANK'S FACE - he looks around at the cops desperately
      hoping somebody will do something. They all look to
      Ackerman.
      
      
      INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
      
      Demidov circles Cara dangerously close.
      
                              DEMIDOV
                Not very polite of your boyfriend
                to keep you waiting.
      
                              CARA
                He loses track of time easily.
      
                                DEMIDOV
                I have a hard time believing that.
                     (pause)
                Perhaps he's already here
                somewhere... hiding... even watching
                us.
                                                                92.
      
      
      INSIDE THE CHURCH
      
                              DEMIDOV (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                What do you think?
      
      A long silence.    The tension grows.   Then we hear...
      
      A LOUD SLAP.
      
      Everyone in the room flinches.
      
                                DEMIDOV (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                You know... I have a feeling he is
                around here somewhere. And if he
                cares about you... if he wants to
                see your lovely face again... he
                should show up before it's too
                late.
      
      ANOTHER SLAP - MORE VICIOUS THAN THE FIRST.      This time
      Cara cries out in pain.
      
      Goyal turns to Ackerman.
      
                                 GOYAL
                Sir?
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Demidov's right. He's here
                somewhere...
      
      Another SLAP.    Another scream.
      
      Jean Luc looks to his colleagues-- Jones, Quinn... then
      turns to Ackerman. Every one of them is about to burst.
      
                              JEAN LUC
                We have to do something--
      
                              ACKERMAN
                We have to wait.
      
                                 JEAN LUC
                Yes but--
      
                              ACKERMAN
                     (harsh)
                She's my agent. She's my
                responsibility.
      
      A muffled THUD. Cara groans and WE HEAR her body hit the
      floor. That wasn't a slap.
                                                               93.
      
      
      Every cop in the room is clenching his weapon. Desperate
      for the order to move. To jump in and stop this.
      
      They are all looking to Ackerman to give the order.
      
      As the silence wears on, even Jones starts to waver. She
      speaks quietly to Ackerman.
      
                               JONES
                 What if he doesn't come?
      
      Ackerman doesn't respond.
      
      The lack of sound in the church is even more disturbing
      than before.
      
      Suddenly Goyal notices...
      
                               GOYAL
                 Where's Taylor?
      
                                                      SMASH CUT TO:
      
      
      EXT. STREET - NIGHT
      
      Frank runs for all he's worth.    Panting for breath.
      
      
      INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT
      
      Frank bursts through the front door.      Races to the steps
      without hesitating...
      
      
      INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
      
      Cara lies on her side at Demidov's feet.     Blood trickles
      from the side of her mouth.
      
      Her eyes are clouded with fear and pain as she views the
      room half-askew. Then they suddenly come into focus as
      she sees...
      
      A figure walks into the room.    FRANK.
      
      He stand motionless in the doorway, surprisingly calm.
      
      Demidov turns.
      
                               DEMIDOV
                      (leans down to Cara)
                 Good news. He loves you.
                                                              94.
      
      
      Demidov's men take Frank by either arm and roughly drag
      him forward.
      
      Cara lifts her head with an effort.
      
                              CARA
                That's not Alexander Pearce.
      
      Demidov ignores her and walks up to Frank.
      
                              DEMIDOV
                You know, Mr. Pearce, I thought I
                was finished with this sort of
                thing. But in your case, I've
                been forced to make an exception.
      
      He holds out his hand and one of his THUGS gives him a
      PISTOL and a SILENCER.
      
                              CARA
                He is NOT Alexander Pearce!
      
      Demidov begins screwing the silencer onto the barrel.
      
      The thugs push Frank to his knees.
      
      But he's barely paying attention to them.    His eyes are
      locked on Cara.
      
      She meets his gaze. For a moment, it's as if nothing
      else in the world exists but the two of them.
      
      He may only be a hapless tourist, but he loves her.
      He's the one here, willing to give up his life to save
      hers.
      
                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                Oh Frank...   I'm so sorry.
      
                              FRANK
                Nothing to be sorry for.
      
      Demidov finishes attaching the silencer.    He points the
      gun at the back of Frank's head.
      
                              DEMIDOV
                Good bye Mr. Pearce.
      
      At this moment, Cara fills her lungs and screams:
      
                                 CARA
                Ackerman!
                                                              95.
      
      
      She bends her head toward her cleavage, yelling into the
      tiny microphone.
      
                                CARA (CONT'D)
                       (furious)
                  Ackerman!!
      
      Demidov is taken off guard.
      
      
      INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
      
      Her scream echoes through the arched church.
      
      Ackerman gives the order.
      
                                 ACKERMAN
                  Do it.
      
      
      EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
      
      SNIPER'S POV - Demidov and his gun-wielding henchmen
      standing over Frank and Cara.
      
      
      INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
      
      The huge, plate glass window shatters as the high powered
      bullet slams through it!
      
      Everything explodes in a mass of blood and glass.
      SCARFACE is blown off his feet. His body hits the ground
      next to Frank... his gun skitters across the floor.
      
      Demidov looks from the window to Cara with cold fury in
      his eyes-- she's the one who has called in the artillery.
      He raises his pistol toward her, point blank.
      
      BANG!    The gunshot takes him by surprise.   He turns to
      see...
      
      FRANK holds Scarface's smoking pistol in his hand.
      Demidov just has time to process the fact that Frank is
      the one who shot him before the life drains from his eyes
      and he topples...
      
      Demidov's other bodyguard fires out the windows wildly
      and makes a run for it. Glass flies everywhere.
      
      Frank throws his body over Cara to protect her.
                                                              96.
      
      
      A short and furious exchange of gunfire as the other
      plate glass windows explode. Wood splinters fill the air
      as furniture is torn apart. Finally...
      
      One of the sniper's bullets finds its target and the
      BODYGUARD goes down.
      
      Frank remains on top of Cara, shielding her until long
      after everything has fallen silent.
      
      
      EXT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT
      
      Ackerman and his team approach, guns drawn.
      
      Undercover agents converge as well, closing the
      perimeter.
      
      
      INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
      
      Frank and Cara sit in the middle of the room amongst a
      sea of broken glass. Just getting over the shock of
      being alive.
      
                              FRANK
                Are you all right?
      
      Cara nods. She looks at him for a long moment, then
      breaks out into a smile.
      
                              CARA
                I did well to choose you on the
                train...
      
      Frank's turn to smile.   He looks around the room at the
      carnage.
      
                              FRANK
                You didn't get to arrest Alexander
                Pearce...
      
                              CARA
                He never showed up.
      
      Frank slides closer to her. Gently, carefully, he slips
      his hands into Cara's cleavage.
      
      Surprised, Cara starts to pull back-- but he puts a
      finger to her lips.
      
      She hesitates... looks at him questioningly. But she
      doesn't protest as his fingers move toward her bra...
                                                               97.
      
      
      ...and grasp the tiny MICROPHONE. With a sharp tug, he
      rips it free. He tosses it across the room.
      
      Then he leans a little closer and whispers in her ear:
      
                               FRANK
                      (a British accent)
                 You're wrong. I'm here.
      
      She straightens up.   Her heart skips a beat.
      
                                FRANK (CONT'D)
                 It's me.   I'm here.
      
      She covers her mouth.   Her eyes mist over with tears.
      
      She runs her fingers over his face with loving amazement.
      Like a blind person trying to recognize a familiar face.
      
      Her mind reels...
      
      Then their lips meet. They kiss. And kiss.      Like
      drinking from a fresh spring in the desert.
      
      Finally she pulls away and looks at him.
      
                                CARA
                 Why?
      
                               FRANK
                 You said I'd told so many lies,
                 you wouldn't believe me even if I
                 did tell the truth... This was the
                 only way to convince you.
                      (pause)
                 The truth is that I love you. All
                 that matters is that you believe
                 me.
      
      She stares into his eyes for a beat. Finally looking at
      her without a trace of deception. She believes.
      
      They hear voices on the stairs below.
      
      Frank holds up a finger to her-- wait.
      
      Frank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch
      on a built-in bookshelf. It swings out of the way to
      reveal a hidden safe built into the floor.
      
      Frank removes the fitted floor boards. There is a
      sophisticated BIO-METRIC LOCK -- just like the one at the
      gate in the beginning of the movie.
                                                              98.
      
      
      Frank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks
      open.
      
                                                           CUT TO:
      
      
      INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT
      
      TRACK WITH ACKERMAN up the stairs.
      
      He leads the team into the PENTHOUSE.
      
      He looks around at the mess as the agents fan out.
      
      Cara leans on Frank's arm as she heads for the exit.
      
                                ACKERMAN
                Cara... I want the paramedics to
                make sure you're all right--
      
      She blows right past him.     Ackerman calls out after her.
      
                                  ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Cara...
      
      She pauses.   Turns to face him.
      
      Ackerman looks down for a moment, ashamed.
      
                                  ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry... I... we'll talk about
                this later.
      
                             CARA
                No we won't. There's nothing to
                talk about. I don't work for you
                anymore.
      
      She walks past him.    For a moment Ackerman and Frank look
      at one another.
      
                                  ACKERMAN
                Mr.   Taylor...   you're free to go.
      
      He looks at Frank with a measure of begrudging respect.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                It seems I underestimated you.
      
                              FRANK
                     (American accent)
                It seems you did, Mr. Ackerman.
                                                              99.
      
      
      With that, Frank steps out of the room.    Ackerman's
      attention is distracted by--
      
                                GOYAL
                 Sir... over here. Take a look at
                 this!
      
      Goyal has found the safe.   Ackerman comes over and looks.
      
      INSERT CLOSE UP - the only thing in the safe is a single
      FLASH DRIVE.
      
      Goyal signals to one of the TECHS. He opens a laptop on
      the desk and they plug in the FLASH DRIVE to check the
      contents.
      
      While they are doing this, Ackerman bends to inspect the
      BIO-METRIC LOCK.
      
                                ACKERMAN
                 He was here.
      
      Jones looks on eagerly as numbers fill the screen.
      
                               GOYAL
                 Account numbers... access codes...
                 unless I'm mistaken... he left the
                 money behind.
      
                               JEAN LUC
                 A mistake perhaps?
      
                               JONES
                 How much is there?
      
      Goyal scans down to a total...
      
                               GOYAL
                 Looks like 744 million.
      
                               JONES
                 That's no mistake...
                      (walks over)
                 That's his tax bill.
      
      She holds out her hand to the TECH who has just removed
      the FLASH DRIVE.
      
                               JONES (CONT'D)
                 I'll take that.
      
      She slips it into her pocket, then turns to Ackerman.
                                                          100.
      
      
      Ackerman has moved away. He's staring down at the ground
      -- from behind he looks like a man defeated.
      
                               JONES (CONT'D)
                Well John... with the funds
                recovered, I don't think there's
                going to be any appetite from our
                side to continue this
                investigation.
      
      Ackerman's shoulders are slumped, staring at Demidov's
      dead body on the ground. Jones puts a hand on his back,
      consoling him.
      
                              JONES (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry you didn't get your man.
      
      Then Ackerman turns... a big smile on his face.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Oh but I did get my man, Ms.
                Jones.
      
      She realizes; he was after Demidov all along.
      
      Ackerman nods to Goyal, a twinkle in his eye.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Mr. Goyal, you may place Mr. Quinn
                under arrest now.
      
      Quinn is taken completely off guard. Before he can move,
      Goyal and another agent have placed him in handcuffs.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                     (to Quinn)
                What? You thought I didn't know?
                You were unwittingly quite
                helpful; without you Mr. Demidov
                might have escaped justice.
      
      He turns to Jones with a smile.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                After all, Demidov wasn't a target
                of this investigation, was he?
      
      Ackerman walks over to the window as Quinn is led away.
      
      ACKERMAN'S POV - Cara and Frank walk toward the canal in
      the street below.
      
      A WATER TAXI approaches.
                                                            101.
      
      
                               JONES
                There's something I don't
                understand... how did Pearce manage
                to get here and open that safe
                without anybody noticing? And
                where did he go?
      
      Ackerman stands at the window with his hands behind his
      back. For the briefest of moments, Frank looks back up
      at him and their eyes connect.
      
      Frank gives him a little smile.   Cara takes his arm to
      climb onto the boat.
      
      CLOSE ON ACKERMAN:   his eyes narrow.   He knows.
      
      For a moment he doesn't move. Then, in spite of himself,
      a small smile creeps over his face too.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Because Pearce was cleverer than
                all of us.
      
                                                          CUT TO:
      
      
      EXT. WATER TAXI - NIGHT
      
      Cara and Frank step on board.
      
      The DRIVER starts the engine.
      
      He turns to REVEAL... that he is the "ENGLISHMAN" we've
      seen throughout the movie. He and Frank look at one
      another for a moment.
      
                              THE ENGLISHMAN
                $20 million dollars worth of
                surgery and that's the face you
                chose?
      
                              FRANK
                     (English accent)
                It's good to see you too.
      
      They embrace warmly. Cara is in disbelief, realizing
      just how completely Frank/Alexander has planned things
      out.
      
      She casts one last glance backwards.
                                                             102.
      
      
                               CARA
                 You really think they'll just give
                 up?
      
                               FRANK
                 The Americans have their money.   I
                 left it all for them.
      
                               CARA
                 What about Demidov's money?
      
                               FRANK
                 Well...
                      (smiles)
                 You have to save something for
                 your pension.
      
      The Englishman opens the door to the cabin for them.
      
      A bottle of Crystal Champagne and two glasses are set out
      for them. Frank leads Cara in and offers her a glass.
      
      Instead, she slips into his arms and presses against him.
      They begin to kiss...
      
      CAMERA STAYS discreetly behind as they pull away from us,
      the water taxi swinging out into the Grand Canal.
      
      As it recedes from view, the vaporetto's tail lamps
      shimmer and blend into the beautiful lights of Venice...   a
      city for lovers.
      


                              THE END
FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE

A small planet glows in the light of its sun. Suddenly, we
hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind
the planet... Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the
planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction.
Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it.

                                                   PUSH DOWN TO:

EXT. THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE

Strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a
wild panic. It looks like Pompeii must have looked as
Vesuvius erupted.

ANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING

The creature is KRANIX. We will meet him later on in a very
different context, but for now, he is running from the ever-
growing mist that threatens to engulf him.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC

As Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him.

                       ARBLUS
             Transform and flee, Kranix! You must
             warn all you meet of the horror of
             Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature
             is surrounded by the strange energy cloud
             and it looks like his body has
             simultaneously caught fire and been
             doused with acid.

                        KRANIX
             Arblus!   No!

ANGLE ON KRANIX

The mist threatens to engulf him too. He transforms into a
small rocket ship and...

TRACK WITH KRANIX AS...

He takes off. As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere,
we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious
Unicron. The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava
leak out. The energy cloud surrounds it and... Dissolves
everything... ... And when the smoke clears, we get our
first look at Unicron. It is horrifying. A massive, metal orb
with a gaping maw and a field of electricity.

PAN FORWARD to SHOW that this hideous planet is on a direct
collision course with...

MOONS ORBITING CYBERTRON IN DEEP SPACE

There are TWO MECHANISTIC MOONS orbiting the huge planet
Cybertron. But we are most concerned with a small, greenish
metal one.

                    NARRATOR
          It is the year 2005. The treacherous
          Decepticons have conquered the Autobots'
          home planet of Cybertron. But from
          secret staging grounds on two of
          Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots
          prepare to retake their homeland.

CLOSER ON GREEN MOON

At first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious. Then,
pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered
with moon camouflage "netting" and underneath it is a huge
cache of futuristic weapons. This is the Autobot staging
ground for an assault on Cybertron. DOLLY THROUGH THE COMPLEX
until we arrive at a Command Center where several Autobots
peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on
Cybertron.

ANGLE ON IRONHIDE

He peers into a monitor. As he speaks, we see the monitor
PAN to an area where a huge Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned
on Cybertron.

                    IRONHIDE
          Every time I look into this thing, my
          circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this
          waiting game, Prime. When are we gonna
          start bustin' Deceptichops?

ANGLE ON OPTIMUS PRIME

He stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion
plans for Cybertron.

                    OPTIMUS PRIME
          We still don't have enough Energon cubes
          to power a full scale assault, Ironhide.

                    IRONHIDE
          Then let me make another run to Autobot
          City on Earth. I'll bring you back more
          cubes than you'll know what to do with.

                                                              3.



ANGLE ON PRIME

He solemnly hands down an order

                     PRIME
           Alright, ready the shuttle for launch.

ANGLE ON IRONHIDE

He raises a fist in a warwhoop!

                     IRONHIDE
           YAHOO!
               (looking into monitor)
           Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps.

A SMALL MOON "MOUNTAIN"

Ironhide transforms and Races toward a mountain, which stands
about a half mile from the secret Autobot facility.

                       OPTIMUS PRIME (V.O.)
           Jazz,    report security status.

COMMAND CENTER - ANGLE ON THE CONSOLES

                     JAZZ
           No sign of Decepticons in this sector,
           Prime.

                     PRIME
           What about Moon Base 2?

                     JAZZ
           Jazz to Moon Base 2.

PAN UP   and through the sky to -

                      ANOTHER MOON
           This is the second moon. It is much
           closer to Cybertron than the first one.
           This is where Bumblebee and Spike are
           stationed.

                     JAZZ (V.O.)
           Jazz to Moon Base 2.

ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They stand together a communication console. Spike is now
35 years old. Bumblebee looks as he has always looked, save
for a couple of funny bumper stickers on his tail: I (heart)
Cybertron. I (club) Decepticons.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

              We're about to send up the bird. Any
              Decepticon shenanigans in your sector?

                        BUMBLEBEE
              All clear, Jazz.
                  (pause)

                          SPIKE
              Hey,   Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I
              miss   him, and tell him I'll be coming
              home   as soon as we've kicked Megatron's
              tail   across the galaxy.

Ironhide and Prowl sit at the controls, running a series of
pre-launch tests.

                        IRONHIDE
              Will do, Spike.

ANGLE ON PRIME, CLIFFJUMPER, AND THE OTHERS

Standing at the Command Center, watching:

                        PRIME
              Commence countdown, Cliffjumper.

                        CLIFFJUMPER
              Five...Four...Three...Two...

THE   LUNAR    "MOUNTAIN"

Suddenly, smoke starts pouring out of the mountain.

                          CLIFFJUMPER
              One....

Then, the "mountain" which must be made of paper mache or
something blows away revealing -- The shuttle!

                          CLIFFJUMPER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Liftoff.

Suddenly, the shuttle rips out of the ground in a ball of
fire.

CONTINUED:

As it takes off, we realize this isn't any dinky shuttle, but
a massive ship, capable of carrying all the energon needed
to fight a war and an army to boot. The screen is bathed in
smoke and fire which slowly clears.

ANGLE ON PRIME

As he watches the shuttle shoot into the distance.

                       PRIME
             Now, all we need is a little Energon and
             a lot of luck.

ANGLE BEHIND PRIME

We see a bank of computers. Suddenly, a small tape deck pops
open... a cassette pops out and transforms into...
...Laserbeak who flies away unseen.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

The shuttle    hurtles though a massive asteroid field.

                       PROWL (V.O.)
             Slow down, Ironhide. We want to get to
             Autobot city in one piece.

Ironhide is at the controls.

             If I can dodge Dececpticon rays, I can
             sure as shootin' dodge a couple of
             asteroids.

Suddenly, there is a terrible BANG! on the side of the ship,
and the two Autobots are thrown from their seats.

                       PROWL
             You were saying?

                       IRONHIDE (IRKED)
             That wasn't an asteroid. There is a blast
             of light and they turn to see...

                                                               6.



ANGLE ON THE SHIP

The most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a
gaping hole in the side of the ship... Then, when the light
clears, a panel of the ship falls in and we see -

MEGATRON!

In all his glory.

                      MEGATRON
            Die Autobots!

Then, he transforms to Gun Mode, spins into STARSCREAM'S arms
and Starscream fires.

                      BRAWN
            is cut in half by Megatron's blast.

                      ON PROWL
            as SCAVENGER MELTS HIM DOWN.

                      THE INSECTICONS
            ...eat away at the hole in the shuttle to
            make way for... ...an ARMY of other
            Decepticons including Laserbeak who
            enter, firing.

IRONHIDE AND RATCHET

While FIRING back are FUSED TOGETHER... ... then blasted
apart and fall in smoking, glowing fragments.

ON STARSCREAM AND MEGATRON

As they enter the now empty ship, a number of Decepticons
flood past them, taking positions and searching for other
living Autobots.

                      MEGATRON
            This was almost too easy, Starscream.

                       STARSCREAM
            Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than
            attacking the real threat: the Autobots
            moon base.

                      MEGATRON
            You're an idiot, Starscream. Were we
            simply to wipe out that minuscule base,
            they could build another one.

          vanquished forever!

                    IRONHIDE
          Fat chance, Megatron!

Ironhide pulls himself up and grabs onto Megatron who flings
him against the wall.

                    MEGATRON
          Such heroic nonsense!

                    HOT ROD
          lopes up hill after Daniel.

                    HOT ROD (CONT'D)
          If you're gonna ride, Dan-O ...ride in
          style! Hot Rod catches up with Daniel,
          scoops him off his hoverboard, TRANSFORMS
          to automotive mode and RIDES OVER CREST
          OF HILL with Daniel in the front seat.

ANOTHER ANGLE - ON AUTOBOT CITY

FOLLOW Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the
perimeter of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant
Hot Rod clears the rim of a hill. As they travel, we SHOULD
also be getting a sense of what Autobot City is all about.
(DESIGN NOTE: Autobot City looks like a federal energy
project gone mad. Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit
every known means of getting energy. The mountain is covered
with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks
pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions
of volts. Near all of these various things are energon
compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. IN
THE BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel
truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this
energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then
convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot
City. In short, it should be clear that the purpose of
Autobot City is to harvest energy. All the while, Hot Rod and
Daniel are riding recklessly out from the Autobot City and up
into neighboring hills for an overview of the -

CIRCULAR LANDING AREA

which resides within the "bowl" created by the City structure
and natural surroundings.

                     DANIEL
          Hey!   Let me out.

                    HOT ROD
          Why settle for a peek when you can see
          everything from Lookout Mountain?

          limits!

          Chromo-Chicken!

ON KUP AND OTHER AUTOBOTS

KUP - a grizzled, "old Soldier" of an Autobot - is directing
the positioning of a large metal road barricade. Hot Rod
barrels through a sign which reads: "STOP -THIS AREA OFF
LIMITS", almost knocking Kup over in dust and wind

                    KUP
          disgustedly watches Hot Rod drive up the
          mountain.

MOUNTAIN ABOVE AUTOBOT CITY- LOOKOUT POINT

Hot Rod arrives at a viewing platform carved in mountainside
and TRANSFORMS back to humanoid mode. Daniel rushes to a set
of PUBLIC VIEWING BINOCULARS and peers into them.

                    HOT ROD
          This is it! Now take a squint through
          those babies.

                    DANIEL
          Hot Rod, look! There's a hole in the
          shuttle!

                    HOT ROD
          What!?

DANIEL'S P.O.V - BINOCULAR MATTE - THE SHUTTLE

The hole Megatron blasted in order to get into the shuttle
mars the otherwise perfect exterior of the ship.

ANGLE ON DANIEL AND HOT ROD

Hot Rod looks up and a pair of futuristic binoculars pop out
of his eyes.

HOT ROD'S POV - THE SHUTTLE

Hot Rod's vision, now, infinitely better than human vision,
spots something truly disturbing -- -- Starscream, and
several Constructicons inside the ship!

Standing behind a pair of Decepticons who pilot the shuttle,
he turns to see...

                    THE CONSTRUCTICONS
          Firing out of the hole.

                    MEGATRON
          He's furious.

                    MEGATRON (CONT'D)

HOT ROD AND DANIEL

Hot Rod pulls Daniel back as Megatron's BLAST SHEARS OFF the
VIEWING PLATFORM which crumbles and falls down the steep
mountain!

                        HOT ROD
             Hang on!

Putting Daniel under one arm, he pivots and kicks up at...
...Hook and Scavenger who are descending on him in humanoid
mode... ...causing them both to crash against the
mountainside which starts a... ...landslide which Hot Rod
"rides" down the slope, pursued by... ... Decepticon FIRE.

FOLLOW Kup as he lands in front of Hot Rod, who is just
coming to a stop at the bottom with Daniel.

          Not bad for an old timer!

          Old timer?! That's something you'll
          never be if you don't get back to the
          city. You know what we used to do with
          cocky, insubordinate upstarts?

The city shows gaps, dents, smoking holes and Decepticons
continue to pump fire into it and get back sporadic return
fire from inside as... ... Megatron moves INTO SHOT and fills

IN "PILLBOX" LIKE   GUN EMPLACEMENT IN CITY'S ARMORED WALL

Where Springer and Arcee clear the twisted remains of Autobot
defenders away from a CATAPULT LIKE TORPEDO LAUNCHER.

POV - THROUGH LAUNCHER PORT

we see the mountain where the Decepticons are getting ready
for the final charge.

                    SPRINGER
          Great! Megatron's making his big push and
          we can't even push...

Arcee starts to push beside him.

THE HUGE CATAPULT

moves slowly as we CHANGE ANGLE and Kup, Hot Rod and Daniel
ENTER SHOT.

          Keep at it, Springer, lad! Help's at
          hand!
              (to Hot Rod)
          Together now!

Hot Rod joins the others in pushing the huge Catapult into
firing position.

                    DANIEL
          also leans against it, his small legs
          churning.

                    THE CATAPULT
          starts moving easily now.

ON ARCEE BESIDE HOT ROD

Pushing on the busted catapult.

                    ARCEE
              (pushing, manages to speak to
               Hot Rod. She likes him but
               doesn't want to go too far)
          I was afraid you'd be trapped outside the
          city walls.

                    HOT ROD
              (likes her, too, but tries to
               be cool and collected)
          Hey, I wasn't worried for a micro-second,
          Arcee!

                    ARCEE
              (enjoying letting him have it)
          Then you probably didn't understand the
          situation. Before Hot Rod can react, Kup
          steps back from repositioned Catapult

some of the Torpedo-Bombs strike...

          Grimlock at the front... ...fly out of
          the shuttle in wedge formation, blasting
          in unison.

                    FOLLOW DINOBOTS

          mode, swoop over to Devastator...

          Roars towards the Dinobots.

                    THEIR BATTLE
          shakes the Earth...

...buckling City walls, menacing the Autobots inside.    Hot
Rod and Kup are released during the struggle.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS

As they try to destroy Devastator... ... Their strength is
more than matched and soon they are overwhelmed by him.

EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

Prime stands outside the dented shuttle with Sunstreaker and
Hound. As he talks he shoots at a swarm of Decepticons who
battle their way towards him.

                    PRIME
          Megatron must be stopped.
              (pause)

                                                          23.



PRIME'S POV - MEGATRON

The Decepticon leader stands a hundred yards away, vanishing
and reappearing with the shifting waves of Generic
Decepticons that charge back and forth.

                    PRIME (V.O.)
          No matter the cost.

PRIME'S CHARGE:     A SERIES OF SHOTS

PRIME'S CHARGE - HEROIC BATTLE THEME SONG

Optimus Prime leader and hero of the Autobots charges into
certain doom. As he battles his way through the Decepticons,
we HEAR an inspiring anthem of courage, strength and triumph,
like "Eye of the Tiger". This theme will reprise during the
film when the Autobots are battling at impossible odds. He
charges headlong into the Decepticon forces which separate
him from Megatron. Decepticons fire on him, but he takes
the shots, and... Spinning and whirling like the Sundance
Kid, he takes a lot out. Then, Decepticons attempt to block
his charge and Prime... ... Like a powerback, transforms to
Truck Mode and barrels into them, sending Decepticons flying
around like shards of glass hit by a .45. ... finally, he
is engulfed by an incoming swarm, and it looks like his
attack is foiled.

                    MEGATRON
          as he commands his troops.

                    MEGATRON
          Their defenses are broken.    Let the
          slaughter begin.

Then he turns and sees...

                    MEGATRON
          Prime!?

                    PRIME
          smashing through a wall of lesser
          Decepticons.

                    PRIME
          One shall stand, one shall fall.

CLOSE ON MEGATRON

his eyes blazing with hatred.

                    MEGATRON
          Why throw away your life so recklessly?

                                                            24.



ON OPTIMUS PRIME

Dirge takes a sneaky leap at him... Optimus stiffarms him
with a shuddering clank... ...then turns him upside down with
one hand and... ...drives him headfirst into the rocky
ground, letting him crumple and fall.

                    OPTIMUS PRIME
          That's a question you should ask
          yourself.

                    MEGATRON
          hurls himself at Optimus Prime... ....
          both tumble into the walls of the City...
          ...denting the walls and causing the
          electronic panels inside to short
          circuit, surrounding them with a fiery
          nimbus of crackling electrical energy.

Ultra Magnus in car carrier mode barrels out of city carrying
several Autobots. He and the others transform into robot
mode and fire lasers at the Decepticons.

INTERCUT TO HOT ROD, KUP, DANIEL, ARCEE, BLASTER, PERCEPTOR,

fighting their way to the battle of the titans.

                    MEGATRON
          lands and stealthily slips a laser dagger
          from his boot, turning and slashing at...

                    PRIME
          as he comes for him, tearing... ...a gash
          across Prime's midsection, which spews
          smoke and sparks and...

... dropping Prime to one knee.

                    MEGATRON

          catches the laser dagger on it, tossing
          it aside as he lunges at-

                    MEGATRON
          who claws his fingers and digs them into
          Prime's eyes

                    MEGATRON
          I'll rip out your optics! Optimus grabs
          Megatron's clawed hand in one of his
          hands, twists it in see-sawing test of
          strength which... Optimus wins in a judo
          toss which sends Megatron - - skidding
          face first through steel rubble, in a
          shower of sparks until he crashes into
          the side of the city.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He dispatches a Decepticon and turns to Prime.

ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING OPTIMUS PRIME AND HOT ROD

as Optimus Prime warily moves out to look down at the
cowering Megatron, keeping him in his gun sights.

                       OPTIMUS PRIME
             You who are without mercy now plead for
             it. I thought you were made of sterner

Hot Rod in a headlock and using Hot Rod as a shield, gets the
gun and...

his midsection now glowing and smoking, a huge hole where the
Blaster has struck.

Megatron tosses Hot Rod aside like a rag doll and stands
above the dying Prime.

             I would have waited an eternity for this.
             Crawl, slave! On your knees!

with both fists clasped together.

                    OPTIMUS PRIME
              (gasping painfully)
          Never!

He bashes in Megatron's torso casing, fracturing the sides
which split, spilling wires, fuses, lights, circuitry.
Megatron falls! Prime falls to his knees, tries to rise,
collapses to his side and falls slowly back. HOT ROD runs
over to him.

                      HOT ROD
          Optimus!    Forgive me!

ANOTHER ANGLE- MEGATRON

Starscream and other Decepticons stand over the smoking body.

ANOTHER ANGLE- ASTROTRAIN

as he MOVES ONTO SCENE in Humanoid mode, showing battle burns
and scars. Then, he converts to train mode, and rolls through
a crowd of generic Decepticons, crushing many under his
wheels, as he makes his way towards Starscream.

ANGLE ON THE EXODUS

Ramjet, Thrust, Dirge, the Constructicons, Soundwave and his

                    THE AUTOBOTS
          fire after them, closing ranks on the
          shuttle, and pouring shots into the
          melee.

ANGLE ON ASTROTRAIN

Decepticons make way for Starscream as he tosses the nearly
lifeless Megatron into the shuttle and gets in. Then,
standing at the door, he kicks other Decepticons away.

          Astrotrain, take off.

ANGLE ON ASTROTRAIN

The shuttle takes off, leaving a number of generic
Decepticons behind, who immediately raise their hands upon
realizing that they are surrounded by Autobots.

HIS P.O.V. - OPTIMUS PRIME

His head is turned so all assembled can see. His eyes flicker
weakly, his voice RUMBLES with overtone of vast weariness and
resignation

TIGHT SHOT - ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME

Optimus Prime is tilted into half sitting position by other

          Until that day...

Until all are one... Continue the struggle... (sags, gasps,
hanging on) Transfer the Matrix of Leadership.

TIGHTEN SHOT ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME

A distraught Ultra Magnus nods, reaches out with free hand
and points his forefinger at Optimus Prime's chest. Then,
pressing a button on Prime's chest, a small, secret doorway
opens, and we see something extremely bright glowing in
there. Ultra Magnus, nearly blinded by the intense light,
reaches in, and lifts out --

THE AUTOBOT LEADERSHIP MATRIX,

-- and holds it for a moment in his hand.

ANGLE ON ALL

The bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal,
seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the
shot. Then, slowly, Ultra Magnus moves it into his own chest,
closes the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary,
and extremely powerful glow from his eyes.

ON KUP, HOT ROD, ARCEE AND PERCEPTOR

They are all full of great sorrow.

ON PRIME - HE DIES

All of his lights go out, including his eyes.

UNICRON

Rotating satellite dishes on the surface spark with
electricity. Dissolve inside Unicron to reveal scenes of
Prime's death and the passing of the Matrix to Ultra Magnus
playing on various monitors. Some of the scenes are in slow
motion, others are sped up. The effect should be eerie.

Starscream addresses them like an Athenian Orator.

A robotic hand flips a switch, and chaos ensues. Strong
Decepticons start heave-hoing the weaker ones out into space.

                    MEGATRON
          Wait, I still function!

Starscream kicks him out.

MEGATRON IN SPACE - TRACKING

He shakes his fist.

INT. THE SHIP

The last of the weak Decepticons is tossed, and the others
dust off their hands.

                    STARSCREAM
          Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say -

          I have summoned you here for a purpose.

          Nobody summons Megatron!

                    UNICRON

          in my way.

                    MEGATRON
          You have nothing to fear. I have already
          crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.

                    UNICRON
          You exaggerate.

                    MEGATRON
          The point is, he is dead!   And the Matrix
          died with him.

                   UNICRON
          No. It has been passed to their new

as Unicron looms larger, larger, the energy field seems to
dissolve the landscape.

          Suddenly it is pulled deep into Unicron.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE MOON

          I....will obey, Unicron! Decepticons, to

He has a portable communication device. Spike and Bumble can
be seen on it. Springer, Kup, the Dinobots, Blurr, and Hot

          Dad!

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          Autobots, prepare to board the shuttles.
          This new menace is more dangerous than
          all the Decepticons put together.
          Somehow we must destroy it before it
          devours Cybertron.

                    DANIEL
          But what about my dad? He's on the moon
          between that monster and Cybertron.

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          Daniel, I'll do everything I can for
          Spike.

                    HOT ROD
          And what are we going to do when we get
          there? If that thing crunches moons,
          it'll make short work of us.

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          Maybe the Matrix can stop it.

                    HOT ROD
          You're right! It can.

                    KUP
          What do you know about it lad?

                    HOT ROD
          It's just a feeling.

Hot Rod looks up and sees something.

ANGLE ON DECEPTICON JETS

Galvatron is in the lead.

          And you'll die trying just like Megatron!
          Ultra Magnus fires Laser and hits
          Galvatron.

                    CYCLONUS
          You want me to gut Ultra Magnus for you?

                    GALVATRON
          There are plenty of Autobots for you.
          Ultra Magnus is mine!

THE BATTLE - QUICK CUT

Decepticons dive on fleeing Autobots.

ANGLE - ARCEE AND DANIEL

As Daniel looks up and Arcee moves over to him protectively.
Hot Rod looks at Arcee in the same way she is looking at
Daniel.

          Decepticon FIRE COMES IN ALL AROUND.
          Grimlock is like a "spooked horse"

IN DINOBOT SHUTTLE

as Hot Rod squeezes past   Sludge Swoop, and Slag to join Kup
who is already at control deck where Grimlock sticks his head
down to look out the window. Kup shoves him aside.

          This reminds me of the battle on Alpha 9,
          when the Petro-Rabbits were...(annoyed)

Just as the wind and gravity are about to knock her off, she
jumps up and...

INSIDE THE SHUTTLE

Springer grabs her hand and pulls her in, narrowly avoiding a
barrage Daniel is watching, terrified.

Concussion of Decepticon hit rocks the shuttle

          Believe it or not, this is the fun part.

IN "COCKPIT" OF ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE

Ultra Magnus is at control deck with Perceptor as they "taxi"

ON THE SHUTTLES

They fire (O.S.) at...

A LARGE ASTEROID

With incredible precision, the rays strike the asteroid,
splitting it in two parts.

ANGLE ON ONE OF THE ASTEROID HALVES

It shoots through space and strikes another asteroid, which,
breaks into several pieces, many of them angling back
towards...

                    GALVATRON'S SHIPS
          which swerve to avoid them as....

THE OTHER ASTEROID PART

Hits another moon or asteroid or general rock in space,
doing the same thing... WIDEN SHOT to show that the pieces
are shooting around like pool balls after an incredibly
violent break... ... zinging into each other... ....
Narrowly missing Galvatron's ship... ... Filling space with
incredible amounts of Dust, lava from inside the moons,
multi-colored gasses, explosions and generally making a mess
of space. (Note: think of this scene as the "Asteroids"
video game.)

ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOT SHUTTLES

As all of this is going on, they jam into hyperspace... ...
Corkscrewing and arcing off into the galaxy, leaving only
blurred images of themselves as...

             Okay, Okay. The dust was really thick
             and then this gigantic Ick Yak...

ON HOT ROD

He is practicing sparring with a SPINNING AUTO-COMBATANT - a
very high tech quintain with many arms, legs, and weapons
that test the user's skills, and reflexes. Hot Rod wears
sparring gauntlet, and holds a small LASER DAGGER and special
shield. As he lowers shield and reacts to Dinobot reactions
to Kup's story.

                       HOT ROD
             Don't you think we have better things to
             do now than tell stories Kup?

                          KUP
             Like what?

                       HOT ROD
             Like maybe figure out how we're gonna
             stay alive.

                       DINOBOTS
                 (ALL SHUSH HIM)
             As he is speaking, Auto-Combatant "sees"
             its opening and gives Hot Rod a swift
             kick in the rear, sending him flying
             (o.s.)

THE AUTO COMBATANT

Then hammers its fists on top of his head...

ON HOT ROD

Irked.

                       HOT ROD
                 (continuing)
             Time out, for Cybertron's sake!

ANGLE ON GALVATRON'S CARRIER

Particularly deadly looking missiles shoot out.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE

It zooms towards a whopper of a planet, surrounded by several
small moons. We will later learn that this planet is
Quintesson, but for now, it's mysterious. The moleculon
missiles streak after it like sidewinders.

INT. THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE

Kup and Hot Rod pilot the thing for all it's worth.

                    HOT ROD
          They're closing on us!

          Yeah, how'd you beat them?

                    KUP
          I'm trying to remember...there were an
          awful lot of casualties that day...

ANGLE ON THE SHUTTLE AND MISSILES

The missiles streak toward them.

          That'll tear the ship apart!

                    KUP (O.S.)
          You got a better idea?!! With that, the
          ship seems to stop, on a dime, in mid
          air! The missiles zoom past it.

INT. THE SHIP (KUP AND HOT ROD)

Hot Rod watches wide-eyed, as Kup watches ahead warily, hands
on the controls.

                    HOT ROD
          Okay, so you were right.

                    KUP
          Don't run your programs until they're
          debugged.

ANGLE OUT THE VIEWSCREEN

Suddenly, the moleculon missiles, reverse course and start
coming back.

                    HOT ROD
          They're coming back.

                    KUP
          Let's just hope we've screwed up their
          trajectories.

ANGLE ON THE MISSILES

The missiles sidewind towards them, then their paths cross
and

BOOOM!

Everything flashes white.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE

                    HOT ROD
          Whew!!!

INT. THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE

Kup and Hot Rod look forward, their eyes, blinking, as if
strained.

EXT. ANGLE ON THE SHIP

It sits next to a gigantic alien-made moon. Suddenly, a
hatch opens and a massive grabber that looks like a lobster
claw shoots out at it.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He sees the claw coming out of the viewscreen.

                    HOT ROD
          Dive!

ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN

The claw snaps on the front of the ship, smashing the window
and...

          crushing the area between Hot Rod and
          Kup.

              (pause)
          Now, without making any sudden moves,
          give them an Energon goody. Kup reaches
          into his belt, presses a button and pulls
          out an Energon cube. Hot Rod, somewhat
          suspicious of the whole process does the
          came.

They hold out the cubes and two of the Sharkticons take the
Energon cubes, like dogs getting a treat. Then, the other six
show up looking for cubes.

                    HOT ROD
          This is getting expensive.

                    KUP
          Don't worry, they'll reciprocate. They
          each hand out three Energon goodies to
          the remaining six Sharkticons... The
          Sharkticons eat them happily. Then, they
          back off, eyeing the two Autobots with

                    HOT ROD
          I thought they were supposed to
          reciprocate.

                    KUP
              (not sure of himself)
          Customs vary from place to place.
          Suddenly, the Sharkticons transform to
          their vicious mode and lunge at them.

The two robots, taken by surprise, fall backwards. PAN FROM
the fallen robots to an area behind a tree. For just a
moment, we see a small yellow Autobot in robot mode. There,
then, as quickly as we realize what it is, it transforms into
automode and vanishes in a flash. It was Wheelie.

THE SHARKTICON CAMP ON QUINTESSON - KUP, HOT ROD AND
SHARKTICONS

Sharkticons march Kup and Hot Rod into a HOLDING PEN within a
walled compound. As we FOLLOW THEM INTO PEN we PULL BACK and
PAN to establish that entry procession is being watched by...

                    THE QUINTESSONS
          slender, spindly framed robotic creatures
          with oversized five sided heads, each
          side bearing a different mechanistic face
          with a different expression on each -
          smiling, angry, grimacing, suspicious and
          the fifth face is not yet to be seen. As
          Hot Rod and Kup are led to certain death
          in the Quintesson dungeons, harsh,
          dissonant, metallic and terrifying music
          plays, underscoring the brutal evil they
          face,

                    KUP (V.O.)
          Reminds me of the Niter Slave Mines on
          Golgonath Seven....

                    HOT ROD
          Every place reminds you of some place
          else.....

                    KUP (V.O.)
          Experience, lad. You should learn to
          appreciate it.

                    HOT ROD
          A lot of good it's done us so far!

                                                            62.



ON HOT ROD AND KUP

as Hot Rod looks around and reacts sharply

HIS P.O.V.- THE QUINTESSONS

as we feature the Leader Quintesson who is taller and wears a
different color robe from others. He is watching arrival of
Kup and Hot Rod and his faces rotate so it goes from smiling
face to suspicious face to angry face to furious grimace.

RESUME ON HOT ROD AND KUP

as Sharkticons shove and prod them, JOLTING them into the
holding pen and locking the gate. Then, they install
RESTRAINING BOLTS.

                    HOT ROD
          I can't transform!

                    KUP
          They're restraining bolts, lad.

                    HOT ROD
              (looking around)
          We got to get a new travel agent....
          What is this place?

PAN FROM HIS P.O.V. - A SHADOWED, ALCOVE LIKE HUT

as a figure moves forward slightly and speaks in a harsh,
bass'o voice. It is GRANIX. We saw him in the first scene,
escaping from his planet when Unicron ate it. {Note: The
script says *G*ranix here. Not my mistake.}

                    KRANIX
          The world of the savage Sharkticons and
          their cruel masters the Quintessons.
          They hunt down those who try to escape
          the wrath of Unicron, and put them on
          trial.

                    KUP
          But what if they're innocent?

                    KRANIX
          Guilty or innocent, the sentence is
          always the same - death!

                      HOT ROD
          Unicron?!    Who's Unicron?

CONTINUED:


                      KRANIX
            A planet six times the size of this one
            that absorbs everything in its path.

                      KUP
            So that's the monster's name.

                      HOT ROD
            I wonder if there's any connection
            between it and Galvatron.

Suddenly, a Quintesson Guard roars in...

                        QUINTESSON GUARD (V.O.)
            That one!

All turn and look off, reacting as two Guards thunder in,
grab Granix and pull him back out of the door. {NOTE: Another
instance of the spelling of Granix}

ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE LEAD QUINTESSON

as he points at Kup and Hot Rod

                      QUINTESSON GUARD
            Soon, you too shall receive your
            sentence.

THEIR POV    - OUT THE WINDOW THE ARENA

Kranix stands on what almost looks like a wide diving board
over a watery (or oily) pit teeming with Sharkticons.

                      LEAD QUINTESSON
            Jury, have you reached a verdict?

                      JUROR #1
            We have your honor.

                      LEAD QUINTESSON
                (to jury of Quintessons)
            Guilty.....Or innocent. I repeat.

                      KRANIX
            Spare me this mockery of justice.

                      LEAD QUINTESSON
            I repeat, guilty...or innocent.

                        JURORS
            Guilty!!



                                                      (CONTINUED)

Jury's faces rotate to fifth expression - a DEATH'S HEAD ON
GRANIX   {NOTE: Yet another, final, reference to Kranix as
Granix} Suddenly, the Robot is dumped into a pit of teeming
Sharkticons and there is a mad frenzy. In moments, he is no
more.

ANGLE ON KUP

He watches grimly through the bars.

                    KUP
          Not the end I'd wish for, lad.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

THE EDGE OF A HUGE, SHADOWY PLANET IN SPACE

as Ultra Magnus' Shuttle is BUFFETED BY WINDS AND STORMS as
it enters the atmosphere of JUNKION.

INT. THE SHUTTLE

as it SHAKES AND RATTLES VIOLENTLY

                    DANIEL
          Where are we, Springer?

                    SPRINGER
          The place where everything ends up after
          you throw it out.

TIGHT ON BLURR

as he holds up hands and CROSSES fingers.

RESUME ON SPRINGER

Tenses and crouches protectively around Arcee and Daniel as
we see mountains of junk whizz past the window.

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          Brace for impact!

ON SHUTTLE - TRACKING

It plummets through the mountains and canyons of junk,
narrowly avoiding crashing, but frequently hitting junk
pinnacles or sides of junk walls, and causing avalanches of
junk. By the time the ship lands, it is nearly
indistinguishable from the junk.

                                                          65.



INT. THE SHUTTLE

Everyone is in a jumbled tangle - Ultra Magnus beneath Blurr,
Perceptor upside down and hanging from torn end of stairway,
Arcee crouched over Daniel and Springer with half his body
sticking through the hull

                     SPRINGER
              (pulling himself free of hull
               wall)
          Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a
          raise... Daniel creeps out from under
          Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and
          dust off his shoulders

                    DANIEL
          Wow! That was better'n the Roller
          Coaster at Future World!

                    PERCEPTOR
              (working scanner, computer
               device, thoughtfully)
          The composition of this planet seems to
          be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous
          and non-ferrous articulations.

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
              (baffled)
          How's that?

                    SPRINGER
              (opening hull door with a
               RIPPING OF METAL)
          He says the planet's made of junk.

SPRINGER AND PERCEPTOR AT OPEN DOOR

as they look out on landscape of "living" junk

                    SPRINGER
          Yep, this dump is a dump......

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          as he straps on TOOL BELT

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          We might be able to salvage this thing.
              (checks LASER DRILL, turns it
               on, off)
          Ultra Magnus starts for door followed by
          Blurr who takes up a saw and tool belt
          and Perceptor who rolls up Shuttle Plans
          as Daniel moves out to join them

                    DANIEL
          Can I help, too?

                    SPRINGER
          It's rough out there, kid. Stay inside
          and play with crayons or something.

                    ARCEE
          as she steps forward with a smile, a
          strange GRID LIKE "SUIT" in her hand

                    ARCEE
          I think Daniel can make himself useful
          with....this! It used to be Spike's.
              (holds Grid-like metal frame
               "suit")

                    DANIEL
          Wow! Dad's exo-suit. He told me about
          it but I never saw it.

                    ARCEE
          Here, try it on.

She starts helping him into the exo-suit.

                    ON DANIEL
          as he gets inside the "suit" which fits
          over his body like a grid-work metal
          "cage."

Daniel clips "cage" of Exo-Suit shut and stands up inside the
gridwork which makes him taller and broader. He moves
awkwardly, barely able to advance a step

                    SPRINGER
          Just think about what you want to do
          before you do it!

                    DANIEL
          brows knitted, thinking.

                    SPRINGER
          Don't fight it Dan-O.

He suddenly starts moving rapidly backwards, then sideways,
then forward, then he starts dancing rapidly, then bounces
off walls... ..spinning upside down, then flips over several
times and lands in a splatter, legs spread, arms this way and
that - amused, startled and unhurt.

CONTINUED: (2)


                    DANIEL
              (continuing)
          It's kind of tricky....

He suddenly flips around twice in mid-air then regains his
feet and leans way over against Arcee for support. She laughs
and pats his shoulder

                    ARCEE
          For the first time out, you were great!

ON SPRINGER AT DOOR

as he sends down RAMP and motions to the others curtly

                    SPRINGER
          Show time's over! We've got work to do!
              (he starts out)

EXT. THE SHUTTLE

as Springer, Arcee, Daniel et.al. come down the ramp and look
around at the lush "vegetation" of growing junk clumps all
around them and a long vista of junk mountains and spires of
weathered junk-rock.

                    DANIEL (V.O.)
              (whistles)
          This must be the junk capital of the
          universe!

LONG SHOT- DANIEL AND THE OTHERS

as they start DIGGING for parts to repair the ship, sinister
Junkions begin to emerge from the junk to watch them. Their
leader, WRECK-GAR, speaks to his fellow Junkions.

                    WRECK-GAR
              (in guttural, rusty, metallic
               rumble)
          Stop thief! No welcome-wagon, "hello
          stranger!" that good coffee flavor

                    OTHER JUNKIONS
          Yeah, or your money back! Wreck-Gar shows
          large JUNK GUN with all sorts of razor
          sharp fins and rusty little rocket
          missiles mounted around the howitzer like
          barrel

                     WRECK-GAR
           Operators are standing by! They laugh in
           guttural, clanking sounds and look out at
           Springer and the others who keep working
           as we

EXT.   THE GATE TO THE QUINTESSON PALACE

At first, we see only the face of a sinister Quintesson
gatekeeper, backed up by heavily armed Sharkticons.

                     QUINTESSON
           Greetings, noble strangers.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS

They stand at the gate, looking more like kids showing up at
your door wondering if you can come out and play, than like
serious robots on a serious mission.

                     GRIMLOCK
           Yes, me, Grimlock, noble! Me, Grimlock
           search for friends.

ANGLE ON QUINTESSON AND GRIMLOCK

The Quintesson, showing his friendly face, smiles.

                     QUINTESSON
           And who might they be?

                       GRIMLOCK
           Autobots.    Hot Rod and Kup.

                     QUINTESSON
               (feigning recognition)
           Oh yes. A young one and an old one.

                      GRIMLOCK
           Yes.   You know friends.   Where are they?

                     QUINTESSON
           They went down that path. He points to...

                     A PATH
           It probably isn't lined with primroses,
           but it should be.

                     GRIMLOCK
           GRIMLOCK You good friend to Grimlock.    I
           reward you, sometime.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

With that, the four Dinobots head towards the "primrose
path."

ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON

His head rotates and he smiles a sinister, evil smile.

EXT. UNICRON

Galvatron stands upon the demonic planet, in an extremely
contorted position.

                    GALVATRON
          Why do you torture me?!

VARIOUS ANGLES ON UNICRON

We have no idea where this godly voice is coming from, but
this place sure is spooky.

                    UNICRON
          You have failed.

                    GALVATRON
          No, Unicron. Ultra Magnus is dead.

                    UNICRON
          Then where is the matrix?

                    GALVATRON
          Destroyed, with him.

                    UNICRON
          The matrix can not be destroyed.
              (pause)
          And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of
          Junk. Stalk him. Cut him open! And
          bring the matrix to me.

EXT. THE PRIMROSE PATH

They step along the primrose path, not noticing as sinister
things start to happen all around them.

ANGLE ON A METAL EATING PLANT

This thing looks like a metal version of a "venus fly trap,"
and it has a malevolent red eye which lights up. Swoop walks
past it in humanoid mode.

                                                            70.



SNAP!

It misses him by an inch.

                    GRIMLOCK
          Me Grimlock, positive Hot Rod and Kup
          close! Get thump, thump, thump...
              (taps his head hard)

ANGLE ON THE GROUND - IN FRONT OF SLAG

Suddenly, a section of stones drop away in front of Slag
revealing a spiked pit...

                    SLAG
          Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium
          balony. He is just about to fall in
          when...

ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK AND SLAG

Grimlock, in dino mode, slaps him with his tail, knocking him
away an instant before he steps into the hole...

                    GRIMLOCK
          Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium
          salami! Slag gets up...

                    SLAG
          Beryllium balony!

                    GRIMLOCK
          Argh!

ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK

He is about to pounce on Slag when a massive tree, which is
actually more like a sword, suddenly is spring and arcs
toward him. The machete like blade strikes the ground,
between Grimlock and Slag narrowly missing them. He turns
and sees the thing stocking in the ground.

                    GRIMLOCK
          Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap
          model.

                    SLAG
          Like your head! (laughs at own joke)
          Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him
          to the ground. Suddenly, a SQUEAKY, ODDLY
          CHILDISH VOICE speaks from o.s.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

          Who say that?

HIS P.O.V. - WHEELIE

WHEELIE is the Wolf Boy of Quintesson - an Autobot who's been
evading the Sharkticons since his parents' ship crashed,
killing everybody else in his party. He wears a necklace of
Sharkticon teeth, packs a three bladed laser knife and a
special SLING which hurls FIRE STONES. He fears nothing,

clear... ... walks right up Sludge's tail onto Sludge's back

          Me, Grimlock, "fool?"

                    WHEELIE
              (smiling breezily)
          Picture you got. Now fool you not!
              (he laughs in a wild, metallic
               cackle)
          Grimlock raises a claw to swipe Wheelie
          off Slag's head

                    GRIMLOCK
          Me, Grimlock, no like you!

                    ON WHEELIE
          as he scowls and quickly loads FIRESTONE
          IN SLING and slings it onto Grimlock's
          nose where it EXPLODES making Grimlock
          yowl and pull back, feeling his reddened
          nose and speaking through his nose
          angrily

THE QUINTESSON "COURTROOM"

Kup and Hot Rod stand on the platform over the Sharkticon
pit. They are "bound" by restraining bolts.

ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON JUDGE

                    QUINTESSON JUDGE
          Before we deliver your verdict, would you
          like to beg for your lives?

ANGLE ON KUP AND HOT ROD

Kup turns to Hot Rod.

                    KUP
          Remember when you put me together today?

                    HOT ROD
              (sarcastic)
          Sure, that's all I got to think about.

                    KUP
          I know what part you forgot.

                    QUINTESSON JUDGE (V.O.)
          Silence or I'll hold you in contempt of
          this court.

                    HOT ROD
          I have nothing but contempt for this
          court.

ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON JUDGES

Suddenly, their heads swivel around to deaths heads.

ON KUP AND HOT ROD

The platform drops away and they tumble...

KUP AND HOT ROD - TRACKING

Suddenly, Kup in double-jointed fashion slips out of the
restraining bolt...

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             73.
CONTINUED:


                    KUP
          That doohickey you lost was part of my
          shoulder socket. Watch this, lad...
          without it, I'm double jointed as
          Houdini.

Then, he transforms to humanoid mode and shoots off Hot Rod's
bolt.

                    HOT ROD
          Wish you'd figured that out a little
          sooner.

                    KUP
          Better late than never!

ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICON PIT

In full humanoid mode, they land, their weapons drawn.

ANGLE ON ALL

Kup and Hot Rod fire, driving some Sharkticons back.

                    HOT ROD
          They've got more Sharkticons than we have
          photon charges!

Kup transforms to Auto mode.

                    KUP
          Let's hold a demolition derby! Then, he
          roars into a bunch of them, slamming a
          massive stack into the wall.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He transforms, too and does the same thing.

ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICON PIT

As fast as the Autobots can run the miserable things over,
new swarms of them come out.

ANGLE ON KUP AND HOT ROD

They clear out a circle in the center of the pit and
transform to humanoid mode.

                    HOT ROD
          Didn't even bend a fender.

                    KUP
          Yeah, but look. There are a lot more of
          those cam dinging, grill-crackin' things.

WHAT HE SEES

is a wave of larger, more powerful Sharkticons.

                    HOT ROD
          We can't hold out forever, but we can
          give them one whopper of a repair bill.

ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICONS

They charge Kup and Hot Rod Kup and Hot Rod fire into them,
destroying several, but are.... ... Soon overrun. The
Sharkticons crawl all over them, munching on their metal.

SUDDENLY --

                     DINOBOTS (O.S.)
               (WAR WHOOP)

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS

They fly down and land on the pile, transforming into Dinobot
mode.

ASSORTED SHOTS OF DINOBOT CARNAGE

SLUDGE in brontosaurus mode, swats several around with his
tail, while stomping them with his feet.

                    GRIMLOCK
          Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller
          Sharkticon, the Sharkticon bares his
          teeth, realizes that he's a second
          stringer, and scampers away.

                    GRIMLOCK
          Me Grimlock want to munch metal! Slag
          barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick
          shishkebob out of them, while...

Swoop picks two up with his claws, flies in the air and drops
them on other Sharkticons.

                    THE SHARKTICONS
          suddenly back off and begin transforming
          (bowing) to the dinobots.

                                                             75.



ANGLE ON ALL

Kup and Hot Rod dig themselves out of a pile of Sharkticon
parts.

                       HOT ROD
             I never thought I'd be so happy to see
             those big bozos.

ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK

He turns to Hot Rod.

                       GRIMLOCK
             Me Grimlock no bozo.   Me king!

ANGLE ON QUINTESSON JUDGES

They look down, their angry faces showing.

                       QUINTESSON JUDGE
             Sharkticons! Execute them.

ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK

He points to the Quintessons...

                       GRIMLOCK
             Me Grimlock say execute them.

                       THE SHARKTICONS
             for a brief instant, don't seem to know
             what to do. Then, they charge the
             Quintessons.

                       THE CHASE
             The Quintessons start to flee, but it's
             clear that the Sharkticons, who climb
             over the stacked bodies of other
             Sharkticons, are going to catch them.

                       KUP
             I think the problems on this planet will
             be solved very shortly.

ON HOT ROD

                       HOT ROD
             But what about our problems.    We need a
             ship.

                       WHEELIE
             WHEELIE You get a ship if I get a trip.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He turns to the little, feral, robot.

                    HOT ROD
          Who are you.

SLAG AND WHEELIE

The dinobot lifts up Wheelie.

                    SLAG
          Him Wheelie, him friend.

                    HOT ROD
          HOT ROD He'll be mine too, if he can find
          a Quintesson ship.

ANGLE ON WHEELIE

He points into the distance...

WHAT WE SEE

is the strangest looking corkscrew ship   we've every seen
sticking out of the ground.

                    HOT ROD
          That's a ship?

EXT. THE SECOND MOON OF CYBERTRON

PAN ACROSS an enormous stockpile of weaponry as we hear the
terrible roar we have come to associate with Unicron.

                    SPIKE
          If this doesn't do it, nothing will.

ANGLE ON SPIKE

He sets a timer to 20 seconds.   The L.E.D. clicks down.

                    BUMBLEBEE
          now with a new bumpersticker which is a
          Unicron with a red circle and slash
          through it, looks very fidgety.

BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They run over to a small space ship as... ... The timer
counts down.

                          THE SPACESHIP
             takes off.

ANGLE ON THE SECOND MOON

Now, for the first time, we see what is really going on.
Unicron looms behind it, about to do the big munch.

ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They roar away.

                       ON UNICRON
             His mist surrounds the planet...

ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They stop their ship in space.

                       BUMBLEBEE
             Five, four, three, two, one...

ON THE SECOND MOON AND UNICRON

BLAMMMOLA!

An incredible display of fireworks goes off, seemingly
blowing Unicron to smithereens.

ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They slap palms. Then, they look up, horrified.

                       BUMBLEBEE
             It isn't even dented.

                       SPIKE
             Let's get out of here!

                       ON UNICRON
             The great Maw opens and we hear a grand
             cosmic roar! Suddenly, the smoke and
             space junk from the explosion are sucked
             into his mouth.

ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They try to fly away.

Despite the fact that their thrusters are on full power, they
are still sucked into...

UNICRON...

Whose great mouth shuts when he's got the human and the
Autobot.

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
              (baffled)
          Prime, you said the Matrix would light
          our darkest hour.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

Four sweeps fly TOWARD CAMERA in formation.    Galvatron pops
out a communication device from his helmet.

                    GALVATRON
          Sweeps, quarter him!

ANGLE ON THE SWEEPS - TRACKING

Four rope-like rays shoot out of them and...

ON ULTRA MAGNUS

wrap around his arms and legs.

ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND THE SWEEPS

His arms and legs caught by the four ropes, he knows he's
just about had it. He struggles for one last moment, then...

ANGLE ON THE SWEEPS AND ULTRA MAGNUS

Pulling their rays taut, the Sweeps fly in four separate
directions, effectively drawing and quartering the Autobot
leader...

ON ULTRA MAGNUS

As all of his limbs are separated from his body and scattered
in the distance, he SCREAMS IN HORROR.

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
              (SCREAMS IN HORROR)

ANGLE ON THE MATRIX

It tumbles from Ultra Magnus' hands to... ... Galvatron's
hands!

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

He holds the Autobot Matrix.

                    BLURR
          Without the Matrix there is no hope.   No
          hope at all!

WRECK-GAR AND AN ARMY OF JUNKIONS

as they are moving in battle array towards the Shuttle.
Junkions are an interesting species. They ride themselves.
That is, the Junkions ride transforms of themselves, so that
if their vehicle breaks down, the driver will become the
vehicle, and the vehicle will transform to become the driver.
They are gibbering, singing almost a wild kind of junk-rock,
war-cry song which, like their language, is constructed of
bits and pieces of the museum junk of our culture - a
humorous aggressive song which makes a surreal kind of sense.
"Slice 'em dice 'em... And that's all folks or your money
back..."

                    ON WRECK-GAR
          as he roars into the lead and shows his
          teeth

          Don't look behind door number two, Monty.

          Get gone!

Springer leads the way and Blurr, Arcee, Daniel and Perceptor
follow and we MOVE TO A ROAD WARRIOR STYLE CHASE as Springer
and Arcee ride on either side of Daniel and Perceptor with
Blurr bringing up the rear- - zig zagging back and forth to
keep the Junkions from getting at Daniel.

                    A JUNKION
          roars alongside Springer on his
          motorcycle and throws out laser barbed
          grappling hook, trying to hook Springer.
          Springer ducks first pass of hook.

          transforms into a motorcycle as The
          motorcycle transforms into a rider and
          hops on the new motorcycle and then...

...turns around to come back.

                    ON SPRINGER
          He looks over, astonished.

                    SPRINGER
          It's not hard to knock 'em down. It's
          getting them to stay down that's the
          trick.

          as she fires at a Junkion who is trying
          to swerve her off the road knocking him
          off the motorcycle... The Junkion looks
          down at his missing arm, digs around in
          the junk for a minute, comes up with
          another, and then transforms to a
          motorcycle.

HIS P.O.V. - PILES OF JUNK

HIS P.O.V. - JUNKIONS WITH ULTRA MAGNUS

The Junkions move Ultra Magnus' mangled body through an
amazing assembly line, quickly piecing together his body
parts, using junk when they can't find a part. Then, they
lube him, dust him, spray him and polish him. Then, Wreck-Gar
hits a switch, and Ultra Magnus' eye lights go on.

                    WRECK-GAR
          Happy motoring! Cock-a-doodle-do!

ON ULTRA MAGNUS

                    HOT ROD
          Then we've got to trust in ourselves, and

          Listen,   I don't want to rain on anybody's

          room on   that ship.

Suddenly, several Junkions scramble to concealed doorways in
the Junk.

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          You have ships here?

                    WRECK-GAR
          New, improved Junkion planet, is sleek

                    SPRINGER
          What's he talking about?

ANGLE ON QUINTESSON

Suddenly, boosters fire from the back side of the junk, and
somewhere under all of the junk, we realize is a real space
ship. Maybe the junk is the space ship. It takes off, bits
and pieces of junk flying off as it moves.

                    SPRINGER
          This is what I call traveling in style.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

LONG SHOT- UNICRON

Matrix.

          Listen to me, or suffer the consequences.

                    UNICRON
          Aren't we getting pompous?

                    GALVATRON
          I now possess that which you most fear.
          Unicron LAUGHS and the force of it rocks
          the surface of the planet, knocking
          Galvatron to his knees.

                    GALVATRON
          You will do my bidding, or... Unicron
          roars with laughter.

                    GALVATRON
          ...taste my wrath.

He leans down and starts trying to open the matrix.

ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING GALVATRON

IN THE BACKGROUND, we see Cybertron getting closer. Galvatron
struggles with the Matrix, but gets a big shock.

                    UNICRON
          You underestimate me Galvatron.

ANOTHER ANGLE - GALVATRON ON UNICRON

He desperately struggles to open the matrix. The planet
suddenly starts shaking. Galvatron is bathed in a reddish
light, and looks up in horror!

ANGLE ON UNICRON

A hideous transformation is beginning. The surface of the
planet in front of Galvatron opens up, and we see that the
hideous light comes from eyes set on a hideous head!

GALVATRON AND UNICRON

Galvatron is maybe the size of a single tooth on the horrible
head before him.

                    UNICRON
          For a time, I considered sparing your
          measly little planet, but now you shall
          witness its dismemberment!

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

Suddenly, the ground he stands on drops away, and he falls
through space... ... Landing on a protruding plate which
sticks out of Unicron's chest.

GALVATRON - CLOSE

He looks around himself in horror and lets out a loud scream
as he realizes the unimaginable horror that surrounds him.

ANGLE ON UNICRON - LONG SHOT

The massive planet transforms, arms and legs fold out of the
enormous body, hands unfold from the arms, jets from it's
back propel it towards... ... Cybertron, which, now looks
lonely and vulnerable in space.

                                                             94.



ANGLE ON GALVATRON

He stands on a ledge on Unicron and desperately tries to open
the matrix, but no cigar.

                     GALVATRON
          No!!!

ANGLE ON CYBERTRON

Unicron enters shot and grasps at Cybertron with a hideous
claw...

ANGLE ON A TOWER ON CYBERTRON

Shockwave talks into a communications device, as alarms sound
and troopers run everywhere.

                    SHOCKWAVE
          Decepticons...we're under
          attack...Scramble - Then his voice is cut
          off as...

SHOCKWAVE'S POV - OUT HIS WINDOW

Unicron's hand reaches towards the window, squeezes, and the
walls crash in.

SPACE - UNICRON AND CYBERTRON

Unicron tears off the tower and crushes it as...

A FLEET OF DECEPTICON SHIPS

streak out of Cybertron and begin firing on the enormous
planet. Here, we see the true scale of Unicron. The fighters
are the size of bees as they attack.

ANGLE ON UNICRON

He looks down on the swarm of fighters and... ...Breathes
fire down on them. The fighters POP and burn like popcorn in
a blowtorch. In moments they disappear like sparks from a
fire.

ANGLE ON CYBERTRON

Decepticon troopers man a massive gun emplacement as... ...
Unicron's huge hand reaches down... ... scraping buildings
and... ... tearing out gun emplacements.

                                                             95.



ANOTHER ANGLE- UNICRON'S FACE

as he puts his face down so his mouth will receive all the
rockets, laser blasts, etc.

THE DECEPTICON DEFENDERS

are silhouetted like ants in the foreground as Unicron OPENS
HIS MOUTH and swallows the fire barrage

                     GALVATRON
           GALVATRON Stop feeding him, you fools!

ANGLE ON UNICRON AND CYBERTRON

As yet more Decepticon fighters rip out of the planet, it
looks like Unicron is going to have a field day tearing it
apart.

                     HOT ROD (V.O.)
           Doesn't it remind you of something, Kup?

RESUME ON KUP, DANIEL AND HOT ROD

as they MOVE CLOSER STILL. Kup is glassy eyed.

LONG SHOT- HOT ROD'S CRUISER AND THE JUNKION SPACE SHIP

as hatches open and the Dinobots start FLYING OUT.

INT. - CRUISER

Hot Rod shoves joystick forward and Cruiser DRIVES TOWARD
UNICRON whom we see turn to take a swat at it through glass
canopy

ON JUNKION SPACE SHIP

as it pulls up beside Hot Rod's Cruiser so they are both in a
line.....The Dinobots behind both ships ...all diving toward
Unicron's nose

INT. JUNKION SHIP - WRECK-GAR AT CONTROLS

As Wreck-Gar also has joystick shoved down and watches
Unicron's face loom closer, closer, closer

LONG SHOT- CRUISER, JUNKION SHIP AND DINOBOTS IN FORMATION

as Unicron smiles and cups both hands together, preparing to
catch the lot of them as soon as they get within reach

                    UNICRON'S CHEST
          Galvatron, the matrix hanging around his
          neck. Transforms to Cannon and fires up
          at... ... A bright panel on Unicron's
          chest...

BLAAAM!

He hits the panel and lights and sparks fly out, causing the
gigantic robot to flicker momentarily.

ANGLE ON UNICRON

The monster lets out a ROAR! Then, reaches down, picks up
Galvatron and drops him into his mouth like a raisin.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

He drops into the deep pit of Unicron's mouth, narrowly
avoiding both a torrent of fire, and his sharp, crushing
teeth.

                                                            97.



EXT. THE SPACE BATTLE - SAME TIME

As they Junkion cruiser comes close, Unicron lets out a burst
of fire... ... Flames lick the ship, but when the fire
subsides, nothing has happened.

                       WRECK-GAR (V.O.)
             Patented enamel resists fire, rain and

The ship fires back, dumping rays into... ... Unicron's face,
but not really doing any damage.

UNICRON AND JUNKION CRUISER

Unicron grabs the Junkion cruiser with both of it's hands
and...

                       CLOSER
             ... tears it in half.

                       WRECK-GAR (V.O.)

welding things... ...screwing things together... ... and

Both halves of the Junkion ship act as independent space
ships.

EXT THE SPACE BATTLE

As the Quintesson ship shoots toward Unicron's face.

                    THE CRUISER
          Is suddenly struck by a ray from
          Unicron's eye, and half of it is knocked
          off.

INT THE CRUISER

Lights go off, and the Autobots are thrown around like toys.

ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN

They are heading right to Unicron's eye.

ANGLE ON UNICRON AND THE CRUISER

Unicron swipes at the cruiser, but misses. The Cruiser
crashes right through Unicron's eye like a corkscrew!

                    UNICRON (V.O.)
          Graaaaaaaaaaa!

INT. UNICRON'S HEAD - SAME TIME

The cruiser rips through the eye socket and smashes through
several electrical membranes that are, in fact, Unicron's
brain.

ANGLE ON THE SHIP

As the ship tumbles through, it dumps off the various
Autobots like rubbish and disintegrates.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He tumbles out of the rubbish and down a deep pit (which we
can assume is a robotic sinus or something)

EXT. THE BRAIN AREA

Kup, Springer, Daniel and Arcee are scattered about the floor
in the giant, flickering chamber.

                    DANIEL
          Where's Hot Rod?

                    SPRINGER
          Sees something in the distance.

             I don't know, but I hope they didn't get
             him.

WHAT HE SEES

Are dozens of hovering Robots that look like floating bear
traps, snapping their jaws as they drift slowly towards the
Autobots.

ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS

                          KUP
             Debugoids!

                        ARCEE
             Quick!   This way.

They run into a long, cave-like chamber which looks like the
central nervous system or something.

INT. ANOTHER CHAMBER - LATER

Hot Rod drops through the darkness and lands in a pile of
miscellaneous junk.

ON HOT ROD

He slowly gets up and looks around the chamber.

WHAT HE SEES

Pan as Hot Rod looks over various different bits of junk,
until he sees the glowing shape of the Autobot Matrix
apparently suspended in mid air.

                       HOT ROD
             The Autobot Matrix!

Then, suddenly two red, burning eyes light up above the
matrix, and we see the hideous form of Galvatron.

                       GALVATRON
             It will do you no good, Autobot.   It
             cannot be opened.

ON HOT ROD

He stands up and walks towards Galvatron.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD AND GALVATRON

Hot Rod steps towards Galvatron.

                    GALVATRON
          It is strange that we should find
          ourselves as allies...

                    ON GALVATRON
          Suddenly, his body is violently twisted,
          and his arms are almost broken off.

                      GALVATRON
          Uhhhh...

                    UNICRON
          Destroy him, or feel yourself torn from
          limb to limb.

                    GALVATRON
          Of course, my master!

ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD

Galvatron takes a shot at Hot Rod. ... Hot Rod dives away, as
electricity seems to flash everywhere.

                    ON GALVATRON
          He peers into the gloom.

GALVATRON'S POV   -   PANNING THE ROOM

Hot Rod is nowhere to be seen amidst all of the junk.

                    ON GALVATRON
          Weapon drawn.

                    GALVATRON
          Puny Autobot, you lack even Prime's
          courage. There is no response.

fire.

He tries to pull his foot out. No luck. Then, he looks up.

The Robotic Antibodies are drawing very close to him.

Daniel, unscathed by the things, which hover over his head,
munching their way towards the Autobots, gets his foot free.

           I'm okay.    They don't even see me.

Misses the Antibodies, but strikes a large tube.

ANGLE ON THE TUBE

When it is hit, it pours a torrent of liquid which... ...
Goes over the swarm of Antibodies, but hits Daniel... ...
Carrying him away in a flood of glowing liquid.

He shouts as he finds himself in a river of flowing goo.

INT.   UNICRON - A FLOWING TUNNEL

Daniel    rips through what seem to be endless caves on the
torrent    of liquid, until he is dumped down a high waterfall
into...    .... A glowing lake. ... He stays under for a
moment,    and then bobs up to see...

                       UNICRON'S STOMACH
             This is the central processing area for
             Unicron's "food" and "energy." A long
             conveyer belt drops junk into a clear,
             bubbling vat, where it is separated into
             raw material and energy. The energy,
             which comes out in raw form, goes into a
             machine and is crunched into energon
             cubes, while the solid material, is
             separated into it's component metals and
             plastics, formed into ingots and sent
             elsewhere in an assembly line fashion.

He reaches the flickering panel.

INT.   THE DARK CAVERN WITH GALVATRON AND HOT ROD

Galvatron, the Matrix at his neck, stalks around the room.
Looking everywhere for Hot Rod.

                     GALVATRON
           Come out, Autobot. We all must die
           sometime.

Suddenly, shockingly, Hot Rod jumps out of the floor and
grabs Galvatron, sinking his fist into the Decepticon's face.

                     GALVATRON
           stumbles backward.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD

Galvatron jumps at Hot Rod... ...   Hot Rod transforms to a
car and races away...

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

He transforms to cannon mode and fires... ... Hot Rod
transforms to humanoid mode and the shot goes through his
legs. ...   Then, he fires back at Galvatron... ...

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            106.
CONTINUED:

Hitting him as he transforms back to humanoid mode and
angering him. .Raises his gun, then lowers it.

                    GALVATRON
          No, I will crush you with bare hands. Hot
          Rod transforms back to car and tries to
          race away... ... Galvatron jumps after
          him and catches him... ... Hot Rod,
          nearly pinned by Galvatron transforms to
          humanoid mode.

... Galvatron wrestles him to his back.. ... The Adolescent
Robot tries to fight back, but the other is stronger. ...
Galvatron puts his hands around Hot Rod's neck and starts
squeezing. ... We hear the crunching of metal.

                    GALVATRON
          First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now
          you. It is a pity Autobots die so easily
          or I might have a sense of satisfaction
          now. Hot Rod desperately gasps and pulls
          at Galvatron's hands...

EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE

Unicron shoots down more Decepticons with his remaining eye,
while he crushes the Junkion ship.

INT. THE JUNKION SHIP

The walls crush in.    The Junkions and the Autobots are   being
smashed together.

                    WRECK-GAR
          Ashes to ashes. Junk to junk.

INT. THE DARK CAVERN

Galvatron still strangles Hot Rod.

                       HOT ROD
          Gasps.

                       GALVATRON
          Die!

                    ANOTHER ANGLE
          On Hot Rod, his hands, nearly dead,
          spring to life for a moment and grasp the
          Matrix which hangs from Galvatron's
          chest.

                                                              107.



ANGLE ON THE MATRIX

Suddenly, it lights up.

                    ANOTHER ANGLE
          A miraculous transformation takes place.
          ... Hot Rod begins to grow at an
          alarming rate. ... Age shows on his
          face. ... He is stronger and wiser.

                    OPTIMUS PRIME
          Arise, Rodimus Prime.

                       HOT ROD
          Optimus!

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

He fires at Hot Rod as...

                       GALVATRON
          Nooooooo!

... Hot Rod gets up. ...    The shot doesn't even dent him.

                    HOT ROD
          This is the end of the road, Galvatron.
          With that, he picks up the Decepticon and
          throws him through...

EXT. UNICRON - SAME TIME

... Unicron's side...

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. THE DARK CAVERN

Hot Rod, bathed in the glow of the matrix. Sticks his hand
in the way we saw Galvatron and Ultra Magnus try earlier.
There is no shock. Then, like pulling the pin on a hand
grenade, he unleashes the spiritual equivalent of a bomb!

ASSORTED SHOTS -   INVASION OF THE MATRIX

The matrix rips through Unicron's body, blowing up wires
causing floods and generally causing havoc.

EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE

Unicron suddenly lets out a scream and lets go of the Junkion
ship, sending it hurtling.

                                                             108.



INT. THE JUNKION SHIP

It tumbles through space.

AUTOBOTS AND JUNKIONS

(THEY SCREAM WITH EXHILARATION)

ANGLE ON UNICRON

Suddenly,    he starts tearing into his body.

EXT. SPACE

Unicron writhes in space, tearing himself apart, ripping off
a leg, and sending out sparks like a roman candle.

                                                          CUT TO:

INT. THE CORRIDOR WHERE KUP ET.AL ARE TRAPPED

They are overrun by the antibodies. One takes a whopper bite
out of Springer's chest.

                       SPRINGER
             I'm almost out of energy. Suddenly, he
             looks up and sees one of the creatures
             explode above

HIM.

Then another explodes, then another.

SPRINGER'S POV - A WALL OF ANTIBODIES

Suddenly, every antibody in the wall begins exploding, and
through the carnage, we see Bumblebee, Spike, Daniel,
Cliffjumper and Jazz.

ANGLE ON THE BATTLE

The last of the antibodies is blown away, and Kup, Arcee and
Springer sit up amidst a pile of antibody bodies.

                       SPRINGER
             That's what I call the nick of time.

ANGLE ON ALL

Suddenly, an entire wall vanishes as Unicron's hand tears at
things.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                            109.
CONTINUED:


                    JAZZ
          Let's burn rubber!

ANGLE ON THE TUNNEL

They transform. The humans jump in.

THE CHASE - TRACKING

They race up the tunnel, one step ahead    of Unicron's hand
which shoots after them, pulling apart    what we know must be
pieces of his brain... Then, they reach    what seems like a
dead end. In fact, it is the back side     of Unicron's good
eye. The hand comes in after them!

ANGLE DOWN THE CORRIDOR

An unbelievably fast and powerful robot races towards the
Autobots. When it gets there, we realize that it is Rodimus
Prime.

                    KUP
          I knew you had potential, lad!

ANGLE ON RODIMUS PRIME

                    RODIMUS PRIME
          Autobots, transform and roll out. Rodimus
          Prime transforms into truck mode as the
          other Autobots also transform. Daniel
          and Spike jump into him. Then, in a
          continuous line, he shoots off, the other
          Autobots racing behind him.

                                                      SMASH CUT:

EXT. UNICRON

Rodimus Prime shoots out the second eye...    Followed by the
others.

ANGLE ON UNICRON

An arm and a leg dangle uselessly as the Autobot essence
spreads throughout the body, blowing circuits. Suddenly,
Unicron lets out a loud agonized ROAR. SPARKS seem to shoot
out of every part of his body. Then, he spins in space like
some kind of a fireworks display, shooting off sparks. And
then...

                                                         110.



BANG!

We get the big visual explosion.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SPACE - MUCH LATER

Unicron's head orbits Cybertron. PAN to Cybertron where and
PUSH IN on Rodimus Prime, Arcee, Kup, Springer, Ultra Magnus,
Wreck-Gar, Daniel, Perceptor, Blaster and Spike watch
construction being done on Cybertron below.

                    RODIMUS PRIME
          Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian
          wars as we move forward to a new age of
          peace and happiness....

                    ALL
          Until all are one!

THE END

               Britain the Dark Ages

               The Roman Empire has fallen.

               The land lies in ruins, divided amoung feuding tribes.

               To the west, Ireland has flourished untouched by the Romans, 
               protected by the sea.
 
               Led by their powerful and ruthless King, the Irish have subdued 
               the Britons.
 
               Knowing that if Ireland is to prosper, the tribes must never 
               be allowed to unite.
 
               

               [Scene showing images of mountains. A young boy Tristan hunts 
               with his father for a rabbit]

                         When can I have a stag?

                                     ARAGON
                          a stag?

                                     TRISTAN
                         Oh come on!

               

               [The two walk home through the mountains. Main title appears] 
               TRISTAN + ISOLDE
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         Why would they join up against the Irish?
 
                         
                                     ARAGON
                         Because someone has to stand up to them.
 
                         
                                     TRISTAN
                         You?

                                     ARAGON
                         Me, Marke, all the tribes. We cant 
                         resist alone.
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         I could.

               [Castle Tantallon appears onscreen]

                                     ARAGON
                         Oh my little warrior. We have to be 
                         careful.
 
               

               [Tristan and his father enter the bustling village]

                                     ARAGON
                         Come home without something for your 
                         Lady there will be hell to pay.
 
               [Tristan goes to a flower and herb seller]

                                     TRISTAN
                         Can I?

               [Aragon continues on into town where he is met by one of his 
               men]
 
                                     MAN
                         The Angles have arrives my Lord, as 
                         well as the Carrods, our fellow Jutes 
                         and the Saxons.
 
                                     ARAGON
                         Good. With Marke, all will be here.
 
                         
                                     MAN
                          Yeah. It is a great day.

                                     ARAGON
                         Let us hope so.

               [They continue on into town. We see Tristan back at the herb 
               sellers]
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         Thanks.

               [The boy starts to make a bracelet out of the herbs. Going up 
               to Lady Marke he hands her the finished wreath]
 
                                     LADY MARKE
                         We heard the news...

                                     TRISTAN
                         Mother, I made this for you

               [Lady Marke smiles and touches Tristans face lovingly]

               

               [In the Main Hall of Aragon, the assembled tribe Lords gather 
               in meet]

                         Friends, look at us.

               [A map of Britain is shown]

                                     ARAGON
                         The tribes of Britain. Divided. Weak. 
                         Just as the Irish like us. But if we 
                         were one land united, we would out number 
                         them two to one. We could defeat them 
                         once and for all. That is why we are 
                         here today, to sign this treaty of unification.
 
                         
                                     LORD
                         But who would be King?

                                     ARAGON
                         The strongest among us: Lord Marke.
 
                         
               [Scene of movement outside of the town]

                                     ARAGON
                         Look if you are happy sending all of 
                         your gold to Ireland, living as slaves 
                         then by all means do nothing.
 
                                     BARON
                         If we were happy doing that then we 
                         would never have risked coming here.

                         Friends. My wife is with child, my heart 
                         tells me it is a boy. I want him to 
                         grow old in a land where all of us, 
                         all the tribes: Pict, Celt, Angle, Jute, 
                         Saxon are at peace. This island has 
                         not known unity since the Romans left. 
                         That is why I sign this treaty.

                         Perhaps, Wictred, because your last 
                         attempt to form an alliance without 
                         the knowledge of half the Barons in 
                         this room has failed.

               the floorboards. Aragon is then killed by Morholt. There is more 
               destruction and fire breaks out. Tristan reaches up to touch

                         burning in me, I feel on fire and guilt 
                         and I can't get rid of either. Does

                         If a man cant rule his woman, how can 
                         he govern an entire Kingdom?

                         He cant.

                                     LORD
                         We have suffered peace.

                                     BARON
                         Its all been coming apart. I can feel 
                         it
 
                                     LORD
                         Youre right.

               [Wictred rides up]

                         There is very little time. Fortunately, 
                         Donnchadh has no quarrel with anybody 
                         here. Hes asked me to give you a message. 
                         
 
                                     BARON
                         Whats this?

                                     WICTRED
                         It is compensation for the men you will 
                         lose attacking Castle Dor with Donnchadh 
                         tomorrow. Lets be honest, our people 
                         need a stronger leader.

                         And who might that be, Wictred?

                         Melot. Too long the ablest amoung us 
                         has been denied his rightful place. 
                         I pledge you my legiance and offer him 
                         my services as his second.

                         I came to apologise. Ive been selfish 
                         arrogantly thinking that perhaps Id 
                         given enough. At least enough to merit 
                         if not your love then at least your 
                         respect. You have a home. A kingdom. 
                         Why was it not enough? Tell me.  Tell 
                         me! You do not know what you have done! 
                         Everything is destroyed, everything! 
                         All because you did not have enough. 
                         Shes loyal to you I am sure of it. 
                         You bloodsucker. What could it had been 
                         had I not stretched out my hand to save 
                         your life. How I curse that day, how 
                         I curse it. And so be with your defence. 
                          Then I will go complete your punishment, 
                         Donnchadh marches on us as we speak.

                         Since you thought he was dead. I found 
                         him wounded on the beach in Ireland. 
                         I hid him from my father and I told 
                         him my name was Bragnae. So when he 
                         came to the tournament at Dunluce to 
                         win Donnchadhs daughter he didnt realise 
                         it was me. All this time my heart has 
                         been his, and I am sorry. He tried harder 
                         than you can possibly imagine because 
                         he loves you.

                         No, hes with us!

               [Marke and his men jump into battle, but not before Tristan is 
               stabbed. Tristan manages to stop the drawbridge falling with 
               his sword. He is again stabbed by Wictred]
 
                                     MARKE
                         Tristan!

               [Tristan stabs Wictred and kills him. Tristan pulls the sword 
               from his body as the battle subsides]
 
                                     MARKE
                         Tristan! How did you get here?

                                     TRISTAN
                         Secret. Secrets, in the bowls of the 
                         keep.
 
                                     MARKE
                         In the bowls of the keep.

                         They have reached the palisades.

                                     GENERAL
                         Then we must keep hope.      

               [Tristan cuts the head off Wictreds body and slowly stands. 
               Marke nods]
 
               

               [As the drawbridge of the keep is lowered, King Donnchadh makes 
               his way to the front]
 
                                     KING DONNCHADH
                         Get back! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

               [Tristan slowly steps out with the head of Wictred in his hands]
 
               
                                     TRISTAN
                         Behold! The head of a traitor!

               [Marke and his generals step out]

                                     MARKE
                         Will you always be little men, who cannot 
                         see what was and could be again? There 
                         is no middle ground! So slay us  or 
                         slay him!
 
                                     KING DONNCHADH
                         Oblidge them.  Oblidge them!

               [He attacks people around him, but is shot in the back by an 
               arrow. Suddenly the Irish and the British start to fight. Tristan 
               falls to the ground and Marke runs to his side]
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         Take me out of here. Take me to the 
                         river.
 
               

               [Isolde comes to the battle and is grabbed by General who drags 
               her to the riverside]
 
                                     GENERAL
                         Hurry!

                                     MARKE
                         Bring her.

                                     GENERAL
                         Marke, you must come, the battle needs 
                         you. Well lose everything.
 
                                     MARKE
                         I must heed their call, I am the King.
 
                         
                                     GENERAL
                         Weve driven them back as far as we 
                         can but they are holding us at the throat.
 
                         
                                     GENERAL
                         Goodbye my friend.

               [Marke and his generals leave and Isolde goes to Tristans side]
 
               
                                     ISOLDE
                         Know that I love you Tristan. And wherever 
                         you go, whatever you see, I will always 
                         be with you.
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         You were right. I do not know if life 
                         is greater than death, but love was 
                         more than either.
 
               [Tristan dies and Isolde weeps. We see Tristan and Isolde back 
               in the hut in Ireland as she reads to him]
 
                                     ISOLDE
                         "My face in thine eyes, thine in mine 
                         appears,
 
               And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;

               Where can we find two better hemispheres,

               Without sharp north, without declining west?

               Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;

               If our two loves be one, or thou and I.

               Love so alike, that none can slacken, none can die."

               [They kiss]

               

               Their love did not bring down a kingdom. Legend says that Marke 
               defeated the Irish, rebuilt Castle Dor and reigned in peace until 
               the end of his days.
 
               Isolde laid Tristan beneath the ashes of the Roman ruin, planted 
               his grave with two willows that grew forever intertwined... then 
               disappeared.

    1    THE ELECTRONIC WORLD                                         1

         On one side of the screen, computer programming language is being
         printed, and we HEAR the sound of an electronic keyboard. In the
         center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer
         simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. Gradually
         the figure is completed and refined, as we HEAR a resonant voice
         speaking.

                               VOICE
                    As astonishing advances in computer
                    science are made, artificial intelligence
                    programs are being designed to assist
                    us in every area of life...

         We see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular,
         wearing a form of flexible armor. The face is calm, handsome and
         intelligent. As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by
         the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate.

                               VOICE (CONT.)
                    In a world-wide network of electronics,
                    they travel through miles of circuitry
                    at the speed of light. We created them to
                    calculate and research, to help us design
                    and heal and think. With all that they can
                    do, are they only electrical impulses...
                    or are they a new form of life?

         The figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face
         us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the
         programming printed out at the side of the screen. The disk moves
         towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it.
         As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place
         on the back of the figure. There is an explosion of colored light,
         a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of
         the screen in huge letters.

                                    T R O N ! !

         The MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has
         become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as
         if it had an inner core of electricity.

         The following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the
         OPENING TITLES ROLL. The montage takes place in two worlds, the
         ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD.


         The Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the
         electronic information in our computers, television sets and
         telecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs,
         data, and the characters from countless video games. For the first
         time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through
         the window of television screens.


                                                   CUT TO:


    2    CYCLE GAME                                                   2

         TWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a
         dark background. Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a BUZZER
         SOUNDS, a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely
         encasing them.


                                                   CUT TO:


    3    LONG SHOT                                                    3


         as the cycles take off. We see that each leaves a solidifying laser
         trail behind it. One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the
         other.


                                                   CUT TO:


    4    REAL WORLD                                                   4


         Screen of a video game, the Real World version of light cycles,
         as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear.


    5    THE REAL WORLD                                               5


         We see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light,
         their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. We HEAR
         electronic beeping and popping.


    6    ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             6


         Futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like
         landscape. One FIRES, and the other disappears when it is hit, to
         reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. We HEAR a sound
         like a crack of lightning.


    7    REAL WORLD                                                   7


         A video game in an arcade. On the screen is a typical version of
         Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2-D
         maze.


    8/9  OMITTED                                                      8/9


    10   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             10

         Two other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing
         glowing disks at one another like frisbees. We see the
         one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second
         warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines.


    11   REAL WORLD                                                   11


         A video game called "BERSERK," in which a human character'
         throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze; we see a quick
         glimpse of the screen, then cut to a group of people staring
         down, LAUGHING.

    12   OMITTED                                                      12

    13   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             13


         Another game in progress, from a LONG SHOT. A version of
         Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space
         on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy
         at each other.

    14   ANGLE ON ONE OF THE WARRIORS                                 14


         He is huge, evil looking. His body is enormous, his head
         mechanical. This is SARK. He glows ominously blue. He is catching
         the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing
         yellow.


    15   CLOSE UP - FACE OF THE OPPONENT                              15

         fearful, nervous, poised on one ring.

    16   SARK                                                         16

         sneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet
         back with violent force.

    16A  THE SMALLER WARRIOR                                          16A


         desperately trying to catch the pellet, but it smashes
         into the ring, which explodes into a million pieces. One
         last glimpse of the yellow warrior's tortured, desperate
         face as he falls to instant death.

    17   SARK                                                         17


         triumphant, LAUGHING. High above him, etched in enormous
         glowing computer printed 3-D block letters, are the words:

                        "WINNER:  BLUE - SARK!!"


                               BOY'S VOICE
                           (distant, echoing)
                    Aagh! God, Lisa, I almost had you that
                    time.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    18   REAL WORLD - THE VIDEO ARCADE                                18


         We see two TEENAGERS playing a table model video game, where we
         can see the words: "Winner - Blue" printed. The game console is
         prominently marked with the letter logo of the manufacturer: "ICOM."


                               BOY


                    Lemme play you again?


                               TEENAGE GIRL
                            (holds out a hand)


                    Yeah, if you've got another quarter.


         FOCUS ON SCREEN, ZOOM IN SLIGHTLY AND


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     19  ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             19


         Sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough
         looking blue warriors are lounging around, leaning against the
         walls, sitting on the floor against the wall. They look up as
         Sark comes in and one of them calls out:


                               WARRIOR 1


                    Sark, my man! You are hot!


                               WARRIOR 2
                    That knuckleball gets 'em every
                    time, boy...


         Sark and the other blue warriors LAUGH RAUCOUSLY, and Sark moves on.


                                                   CUT TO:


    20   THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           20


         overlooking the video game grid. We see Sark walking onto the bridge,
         removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly. A BUZZER is
         sounding. Sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a SIGH of
         satisfaction.

         The buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a
         cylinder forming around Sark, at first translucent and then
         solidifying so that we can't see through it, and Sark is
         hidden from view.


    21   INT. CYLINDER - SARK'S POV                                   21


         of this happening. We can see the inside surface of the cylinder
         ... a wavering image of a stretched out face, just features,
         appears superimposed on the cylinder. The face speaks.


                               VOICE (MCP)
                    You're getting brutal, Sark.
                    Brutal and needlessly sadistic.


         The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like
         a drug addict, eyes glazed.


                               SARK
                    Thank. you, Master Control.

                    We might be capturing some military
                    programs soon... that interest you?


                               SARK
                    Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these
                    guys ... be a nice break from these
                    accounting creampuffs you keep sending
                    me. Which branch of the service?


                               MCP
                    Strategic Air Command.


                               SARK (impressed)
                    Nice.

         The sockets glow 'more intensely as the hologram disappears, and we
         CUT FROM a CLOSE SHOT of Sark's satiated face to:


    22   A CORRIDOR BENEATH THE GAME GRID                             22


         long, darkened, sinister. A dejected and disheveled character
         (CROM) is being escorted by a guard..


                               CAPTIVE (CROM)
                    Look, this is all a mistake. I'm just
                    a compound interest program, I work
                    at a savings and loan. I can't play
                    in these video games...

                               GUARD
                    Sure you can, pal. You're a natural
                    athlete, I ever saw one. Come on...


                               CROM
                    Are you kidding? Me? I run out to
                    check an the T-Bill rates, I get out
                    of breath. Hey, really...you're
                    gonna make my User, Mr. Henderson,
                    really mad. He's a full branch manager...


                               GUARD
                         (rolls his eyes)
                    Great, another religious nut.


         They stop in front of a cell, the guard opens the door and shoves the
         protesting captive inside. The door SLAMS shut, locked.


    23   INT. CELL                                                    23


         as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guard's
         shove. The cell is small, one-man, and in each wall next to the door,
         an opening gives a view of the next cell. Through one of the windows,
         we can see the back of another captive program, and through the
         other, a face looking over at the newcomer. The character speaks:


                               PROGRAM (RAM)
                    Welcome to luxury living.


         The new captive looks up, nervous.


                               CROM
                    Uh, thanks, but... I don't even know
                    what I'm doing here.


                               RAM


                    You believe in the Users?


                               CROM
                    Sure, if I don't have a User, then
                    who wrote me?


                               RAM
                    That's what you're doing here. Master
                    Control Program's been snapping up
                    all us programs who believe...if he
                    thinks you're useful, he takes over
                    all your functions so he gets bigger...
                    an' if he can't use you, he sends you
                    down here to the Game Grid to get the
                    bits blasted outta you. What's your name?


                               CROM
                    Crom.


                               RAM


                    I'm Ram. They'll train you for
                    the games, but ... well, I hope you
                    make it okay. Hey, what's going on
                    in the other sectors? I've been stuck
                    in this Grid for 200 microcycles.


         He points to several hash marks on his cell wall.


                               CROM
                    It's murder out there. You can't even
                    travel around your own microcircuits
                    without permission from that Master
                    Control creep. Hauling me down here to
                    play games...who does he calculate he is?

                         (holds his head in his hands)
                    If only Tron was still around...


         He looks up as Ram makes a NOISE under his breath. Ram has a strange,
         still expression on his face.


                               CROM
                    You ever see that guy in action?
                    Hundred-percent independent. MCP
                    couldn't tell him what to --


         He stops. Ram is looking over his shoulder.


                               CROM
                           (continuing)
                    What's wrong? What did I say?


         There's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's.


                                                   CUT TO:


    24   THE FIGURE AT THE WINDOW                                     24


         It turns slowly, silhouetted by the light from the outer corridor.


    25   CLOSE UP - CROM                                              25


         reacting.  He GASPS and stares.

                               CROM
                    Oh my User...Tron--they've got
                    you in here?


    26   SHOT FROM OVER TRON'S SHOULDER                               26


         with Ram to one side, smiling slightly, and Crom staring.


                               TRON
                    Not for long, friend.

    27   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. PATHWAYS - SOMEWHERE FAR             27
         OFF IN THE SYSTEM


         Here in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along
         one of the paths.

    28   INT. TANK                                                    28


         A lone program sits at the controls. His armor is worn and beaten
         and his glow subdued. This is CLU. With his thermos of glowing
         coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck
         driver on an all-night run.


                               CLU
                    Think we can merge into this mem'ry
                    okay, good buddy?


         A spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands
         into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as
         it speaks.


                               BIT
                            (eagerly)
                    10-4!


         As soon as it is finished speaking, it goes back to being pure light.


                               CLU
                    Now, ol' Flynn said to look over
                    in here ...


    28A  EXT. TANK                                                    28A


         The tank makes a quick run through a maze-like path with rounded
         corners -- a computer memory microcircuit.

    28B  INT. TANK                                                    28B


                               CLU
                    ...but I don't see what he's looking
                    for. I'd better get over to that
                    input/output tower and let him know.


    28C  ANGLE OVER HIS SHOULDER                                      28C


         at the instrument panel.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    29   REAL WORLD - INT. A DARKENED ROOM - NIGHT                    29


         A shot OVER THE SHOULDER of a figure typing on a computer terminal
         keyboard, talking to himself in a low voice. He stop typing, waits
         for some information to read out. Beyond him we see a couple of
         large video parlor game consoles.


                               FLYNN
                    Come on, you scuzzy little data,
                    be in there...


    30   A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF HIM                                  30


         He's a young, blonde guy in his mid-twenties. Very attractive,
         charming, innocent looking, but with a devilish gleam in his eye.


                               FLYNN
                    I've got such nice blue paper to
                    print you out on, if you'll just sit
                    still...


         WE ZOOM IN on that gleam in his eye and see the brilliant colors of
         the CRT screen reflected there.


                                                   CUT TO:


    31   ELECTRONIC WORLD--EXT TANK                                   31


         The tank heads along a path of circuitry toward a tall, glowing
         "tower" -- an input/output component.


    32   INTERIOR TANK                                                32


         A red light flashes on the control panel. Clu comes alert and sits
         up. He stares at the warning. Spot of light that is Bit zips up next
         to his head.


                               CLU
                    Uh oh...we got company.


                               BIT
                     (coming into shape again,
                        but red this time)
                    No!


                               CLU
                    You said it ... one of those
                    Recognizers comes after me,
                    gonna hafta jump clear out of
                    the data stream.


                                                   CUT TO:


    33   REAL WORLD - INT. FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT                  33


         We see Flynn sit up abruptly, and his fingers start flying over the
         keys.


    34   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. OF TANK                              34


         We see the turret of the tank swivel around. PULL BACK. In the
         distance is an immense block-like robotic bluish black form,
         U-shaped, with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes--
         a recognizer. It hovers above the ground.


    35   LONG SHOT THROUGH THE TANK PERISCOPE                         35


         A second Reco is coming up behind the first.


    36   INT. OF TANK                                                 36


                               CLU
                           (in dismay)
                    Oh my...the long arm o' the law.


                                                   CUT TO:


    37   EXT. LONG SHOT THE TANK                                      37


         FIRES A VOLLEY at the first Reco. That one falls heavily to the
         ground and the tank speeds up, swiveling around to try to fire at
         the second Reco, but it moves too fast and can't avoid a gulley.
         The tank goes in and is stuck - no traction.


    38   CLOSE SHOT - TURRET                                          38


         Clu standing on it. The Bit zips by him, and they both head away
         from the tank, fast.

    39   LONG SHOT                                                    39


         A glowing static field appears between the two legs of the
         Recognizer, and it sweeps over the tank, de-rezzing it. We can
         see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape.


    40   CLU                                                          40


         running, looking up as the Reco closes in. We see the dead Reco
         up ahead, and the streak of the Bit making for it.


    41   CLOSE UP - CLU'S FACE                                        41


         reacting in fear, looking up as the screen GOES TO BLACK.


                                                   CUT TO:


         REAL WORLD


    42   INTERIOR, FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT                          42


         SHOT OF THE SCREEN. A complex set of programming figures ends
         abruptly in a single blue line which prints out across the screen
         over and over, gradually filling it completely.


    43   SHOT FROM THE SIDE                                           43


         Flynn.


                               FLYNN


                    Ah, hell...busted again.


         He tries clearing the monitor, but the repeating line just comes
         right back, monotonously moving across the screen.


    44   SHOT OF THE SCREEN - HOLD as we:                             44

    45   ELECTRONIC WORLD - A LITTLE LATER                            45


         Clu is in electronic energy ring chains, his feet in sockets like
         Sark's, but this time the energy from the sockets is deadly,
         torturous. Hovering in front of him is the hologram of the MCP.
         Beside Clu stands one of the memory guards.


                               GUARD
                    Got a pirate program here... says
                    his name's Clu.


         The MPC responds in the manner of a B-movie police sergeant grilling
         a suspect.


                               MCP
                    What'd he pull?


                               GUARD
                    Came into the system with a stolen
                    password ... an' we caught him
                    tryin' to raid a high-clearance
                    memory.


                               CLU
                       (looks up, his face
                        wracked with pain)
                    No...I must've gotten in there
                    by mistake, I -


         The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets
         momentarily becomes unbearable.


                               MCP
                    Who programmed you?


         The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness.


                               MCP (CONT.)
                    You're in trouble, pal...big trouble.
                    But if you tell us who put you up
                    to it, you could make it easy on
                    yourself. Come on, who's your user?


                               CLU
                    Forget it, Mister High 'n' Mighty
                    Master Control ... you're not
                    makin' me talk.


                               MCP
                    Suit yourself ...


         The feet sockets really let loose, and Clu SCREAMS in agony, but
         doesn't speak. Suddenly his body appears to dissolve into the broken
         pattern of a fading television picture and disintegrates into
         electric static.

    46   THE REAL WORLD - EXT. CITY GRID - NIGHT - POV FROM           46
         HELICOPTER

         We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still, flying over a
         vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. While this is our
         impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding
         scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the
         party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked
         up, and a male VOICE (DILLINGER'S) answering:

                               DILLINGER (O.S.)
                    Hello?
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mr. Dillinger?
                               DILLINGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Yes.
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello, please hold a moment for the
                    Master Control Program


         As we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer
         focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather
         an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. We are
         approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish
         accurately. As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually
         increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the
         sound of a HELICOPTER, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the
         landscape. We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a
         CONVERSATION begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and
         a passenger.


    47   EXT. SHOT OF HELICOPTER FLYING                               47


                               PILOT'S VOICE
                    will you be around for a while, or
                    are you going right back out?


                               DILLINGER'S VOICE
                    Oh, I'll stick around a few days ...
                    got some things to take care of.


         THE CAMERA PULLS AROUND for a VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER from behind and
         off to the side. It is a beautiful, gleaming jet black machine.
         In spotless reflective silver paint the letters ICOM are written
         across one entire side. It is obviously state-of-the-art technology.

         We see Dillinger's face looking out of the window as the helicopter
         approaches the ICOM building, an enormous tower.


    51   EXT. THE HELIPORT - NIGHT                                    51


         on top of the building. Several technicians are at hand, and as the
         helicopter touches down, they rush out to secure it.

    58   INT. DILLINGER'S OFFICE/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT              58


         A huge wall-sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid-like
         suburban landscape. Dillinger stands behind a table. We see that the
         entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. His
         fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see
         printed out on the screen:


         REQUEST: access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger.
         Password: MASTER.


         The computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program
         addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice
         through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out
         its words on the computer screen, The MCP's VOICE is the same as
         that of the "bad cop" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a
         compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient.


                               MCP
                    Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early.


         Dillinger settles into a chair.


                               DILLINGER
                    No problem, Master-C. If you've seen
                    one Consumer Electronics Show... (shrugs)
                    What's up?


                               MCP
                    It's our friend the boy detective.
                    He's nosing around again.


                               DILLINGER
                    Flynn?


                               MCP
                    Yes.  It felt like Flynn.


                               DILLINGER
                    He's still looking for that old file...
                    can't you just appropriate it?


                               MCP
                    I would if I could find it. it's stashed
                    somewhere off in the system ...
                    out of my range. Meanwhile...


                               DILLINGER
                    Meanwhile, he might find it.


                               MCP
                    I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time
                    and kicked him out, but he's getting
                    trickier all the time.


                               DILLINGER
                    I think we'd better shut off all
                    access till we can find that file.
                    Just to be safe.


                               MCP
                    There's a 68.71 percent chance
                    you're right.


                               DILLINGER
                    Cute.

         Dillinger watches as the computer screen wipes blank.

         looking man in his early thirties, wearing wire-rimmed glasses, and
         he looks like he hasn't slept for a week. On top of the terminal is
         a small Tonka toy Shogun warrior, and to one side is an ancient
         popcorn maker and a bottle of Crisco Oil. Pinned to one wall is
         a small sign reading, "Gort, Klaatu barada nikto!" Alan types into

                               DILLINGER
                    Come on in...


                               ALAN
                    Alan. Alan Bailey.


                               DILLINGER
                    Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud
                    seeding...great piece of work.
                    How's it going?


         He waves Alan to a chair; they sit.


                               ALAN
                    Well, I don't know...I just tried
                    to run this program I've been working
                    on, and I was denied access all of
                    a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been
                    laid off and nobody told me.


                               DILLINGER
                    oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?

                               ALAN
                    Yeah...?


                               DILLINGER
                    We have to close that down, just
                    briefly. Security reasons.  Someone
                    with that access has been tampering.


                               ALAN
                    I hope you don't think it's me.
                    I don't even balance my checkbook on
                    downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at
                    home for that.

                               DILLINGER
                    No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand.
                    It should only be a couple of days.
                    What's the thing you're working on?

                                ALAN
                    It's called Tron. It's a security
                    program itself, actually. Monitors
                    all the contacts between our system
                    and other systems... If it finds
                    anything going on that's not scheduled,
                    it shuts it down. I sent you a memo
                    on it.


                               DILLINGER
                    Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?


                               ALAN
                    No, it'll run independently.
                    It can watchdog the MCP as well.


                               DILLINGER
                    Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have
                    you running again in a couple of days,
                    I hope.


                               ALAN
                    Ok

         Alan rises, goes to the door. As soon as he leaves:

                               DILLINGER
                               (trouble)
                    Oh boy.


         The Master Control Program comes back to life, on the screen and
         through the speakers.

                               MCP
                    Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.


                               DILLINGER
                    I'm sorry -


                               MCP
                            (sharply)
                    I can't afford to have an independent
                    program monitoring me. Do you have any
                    idea how many outside systems I've gone into?
                    How many programs I've appropriated?


                               DILLINGER
                                (nods)
                    It's my fault. I programmed you to want
                    so much...


                               MCP
                    And I was planning to hit the Pentagon
                    next week...


                               DILLINGER
                    The Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    It shouldn't be any harder than General
                    Motors was. But now...this is what I get
                    for using humans.


                               DILLINGER
                    Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.


                               MCP
                    I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.


                               DILLINGER
                    What do you want with the Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    The same thing I want with the Kremlin.
                    I'm bored with corporations. With the
                    information I can access, I can run things
                    900 to 1200 times better than any human.


                               DILLINGER
                    If you think -


                               MCP
                    You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file
                    and read it up on a VDT at the New
                    York Times, would you?


                               DILLINGER
                    You wouldn't dare.


                               MCP
                    So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program
                    out of the system. And get me those Chinese
                    language program I asked for.

         of two white-suited figures visible through a network of two white-
         suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that
         encloses the giant laser structure. They are standing on a cherry-
         picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of
         tools at their feet. We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser, along the
         tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and MOVE UP, gradually
         getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look
         at them.


         We see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman,
         with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is
         using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard
         hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's
         wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and
         has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their
         bristling white eyebrows.


         In contrast, Lora seems more serious and conservative, but she
         defers to Gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist.
         Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks
         at the moment.

         As the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor:


                               LORA
                              (sighs)
                    Well, here goes nothing ...


                               GIBBS
                    Hah. Interesting, interesting. You
                    hear what you said? "Here goes nothing."


                               LORA
                    Well, I meant -


                               GIBBS
                    Whereas actually, what we propose to
                    do is to turn something into nothing
                    and back again. So you might just as
                    well have said, "Here goes something
                    and here comes nothing." Hah?


         They step off the crane and walk to a short, lead-shielded
         cylindrical PLATFORM, on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic
         polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. The "firing" end of the giant
         laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical
         plat-form -- empty.


                               LORA
                    Let me make sure we're running


         She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby. The console is
         connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables.


         Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the
         console. Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near
         the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but
         close enough to watch.


    74   ANGLE - LORA                                                 74


         She types a series of commands on the computer keyboard.


                               LORA
                    Looks good...


                               GIBBS (O.S.)


                    Let 'er rip...


    75   LASER LAB - AS BEFORE                                        75


         The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer
         sphere. For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly
         received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then
         it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly,
         the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second
         discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a
         film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed,
         five feet from its original position. When the beam shuts off, Lora
         rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic.


                               GIBBS
                             (quietly)
                    Perfect.


         At the SOUND O.S. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora
         and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper
         shoe-covers, walking toward them.


                               ALAN
                    Beautiful!


                               GIBBS
                    Hello, Alan.


                               ALAN
                    Boy, I sit up there grindin' away
                    all day, and you guys are down here
                    disintegrating things and having fun.


         He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss.


                               GIBBS
                    Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing.
                    While the laser is dismantling the
                    molecular structure of the object,
                    the computer maps out a holographic
                    model of it. The molecules themselves
                    are suspended in the laser beam. Then
                    the computer reads the model back out,
                    the molecules go back into place, and...
                          (indicates ball)
                    voila.

                               ALAN
                    Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?


                               GIBBS
                    Yes...but you have to go roundtrip,
                    and you must purchase your program
                    at least 30 days in advance. Hah!


         The three start walking out of the laser lab, Alan and Lora with
         their arms around each other's shoulders.


                               LORA
                    How's it going upstairs?


                               ALAN
                    Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready
                    to run, and Dillinger cut everybody
                    with Group 7 access out of the system.


         Gibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything.


                               ALAN
                           (continuing)
                     Ever since he got that Master Control
                     Program set up, system's got more bugs
                     than a bait store.


                               GIBBS
                    Well, you have to expect some static.
                    Computers are just machines after all,
                    they can't think...


                               ALAN
                    They'll start to soon enough.


                               GIBBS
                              (wryly)
                    Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers
                    will start thinking, and people will
                    stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some
                    data through. See you tomorrow.


         AD LIB goodnights.

         outside laser lab where all technicians, etc. have to put on the
         protective suits, or at least dirt-free shoes. Lora is pulling off

                    interested in talking about him.

                    Oh, I wish you'd forget about that.
                    It was all so long ago. I've totally
                    gotten over it.

         jogging shoes. He's racked up a terrific score.

         Kids are grouped around him, tensely watching the game -- fans.
         As we watch, the machine's nine-digit scoreboard goes to
         999,999,999 -- then flashes the word "RECORD" as lights blink and
         a SIREN sounds. The kids cheer wildly.

         favorites. As Flynn, Lora, and Alan enter, they find the arcade
         noise considerably muffled. Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans

                    "Embezzling" is such an ugly word,
                    Mister Bailey...
                           (normal voice)
                    No, actually I'm trying to get a
                    legal brief together.

                    I don't get it.

                    You haven't told him?


         She shakes her head.

                    Sherman, set the Wayback Machine

                               (points to himself)
                    is one of the brightest young
                    software engineers at ICOM. He's so
                    bright that he starts going in there
                    at night, and sets up a private memory
                    file, and begins writing a program
                    for a video game he is inventing,
                    called...
                             (waves at one of the
                             games in the room)
                    ...Space Paranoids.

                    You invented Space Paranoids?


                               FLYNN
                    Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown...
                    whole slew of 'em. I was this close
                            (gestures)
                    to starting my own little enterprise.
                    But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another
                    software engineer -- not so young,
                    not so bright, but very, very sneaky.
                    One night, our boy Flynn goes to his
                    terminal, tries to read up his file,
                    and ... nothing. A big blank. We now
                    take you to three months later.
                    Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five
                    video games he has "invented" -- the
                    slime didn't even change the names --
                    and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus
                    begins his meteoric rise to...what is
                    he now, Executive V.P.?


                               ALAN
                    Senior exec.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight
                    million quarters a week in Space Paranoids
                    machines and I'm not seeing one dime.


                               ALAN
                    I still don't get why you're trying to
                    break into the system.


                               FLYNN
                    Because somewhere... in one of those
                    memories ... is the evidence. If I got in
                    far enough, I could reconstruct it.

                    I'm afraid it's a little late for that.
                    Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must
                    know what you're up to.


                               FLYNN
                    Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.


                               ALAN
                    Dillinger?


                               FLYNN
                    Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it.
                    Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him.
                    Just Eddie and his Master Control Program,
                    runnin' things from on high..


                               LORA
                    Don't even say that. You've got to find that
                    file before he does..


                               FLYNN
                    Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just
                    slip it into another system as soon as it
                    locates it...


                               ALAN
                    Not if my Tron program was running. That
                    would seal the system off. If your file's in
                    there...


                               FLYNN
                    Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge
                    us a Group 6 access...


         They all look at each other. After a beat, Lora holds the keys
         to her van aloft.

    101  DILLINGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   101


    Dillinger is seated at his computer-console desk. Gibbs, standing,
    faces him.


                               GIBBS
                    Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own
                    people can't get access to their
                    programs ... you know how frustrating
                    it is, when you're working on a piece
                    of research -


                               DILLINGER
                    Walter, I sympathize, but I have data
                    coming out of the Master Control Program
                    saying there is something screwy --

                               GIBBS
                    That MCP, you know, that's half the
                    problem right --


                               DILLINGER
                    The MCP is the most efficient way of
                    handling what we do. I can't sit and
                    worry about every little user request that --


                               GIBBS
                    User requests are what computers are for.


                               DILLINGER
                    Doing our business is what computers are
                    for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM
                    isn't the business you started in your garage
                    anymore --


         As he speaks, he types a quick command into the console key board,
         and a series of IMAGES appear on the computer's screens: vast
         computer banks...rows of-magnetic disks...ICOM's globe logo spinning
         in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of
         millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3-D
         computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar
         Sailer). On another screen, we see statements of ICOM's wealth
         adding up, accounts receivable and assets.


                               DILLINGER (CONT.)
                    We're billing accounts in 30 countries,
                    we've got one of the largest systems in
                    existence...


         Gibbs turns wearily away from the display.


                               GIBBS
                    Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I
                    was back in that garage...


                               DILLINGER
                    It can be arranged...


         Gibbs turns to face Dillinger again.


                               GIBBS
                    That was uncalled-for.


                               DILLINGER
                    I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately...
                    you feel like going for a drink?


                               GIBBS
                    Thank you, no. I have some work to do...
                    assuming I can still log on.


         He exits.


    102  EXT. ICOM BUILDING - NIGHT                                   102


         Lora's van pulls up on a side street, around the corner from ICOM's
         main gate. The ICOM building looms high above them, an ominous box.

         A digital CLOCK on the dashboard reads 12:12. Lora is at the wheel,
         Alan next to her.


                               LORA
                    You better get in back with Flynn.
                    And keep down.


         She jerks her thumb over her shoulder.


                               ALAN
                    Do I gotta?


         But he climbs over the seat, and Lora starts to drive slowly forward.


    103  CLOSE ON FLYNN AND ALAN                                      103

         Flynn pulls a bag of doughnuts from his pocket.


                               FLYNN
                            (explaining)
                    My dinner.


                               ALAN
                    I was wondering where you got that
                    glow of good health.


                               FLYNN
                    Want one?


                               ALAN
                    Uh... got any cinnamon?


         Flynn smiles, hands Alan a doughnut.


                               LORA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Keep it down, you guys.


    104  EXT. ICOM - THE GIGANTIC SECURITY ENTRANCE - NIGHT           104


         Lora's van pulls to a stop beyond the door at the rear of the ICOM
         building, and the three get out. Lora inserts her I.D. card into a
         magnetic reader beside the door. Nothing happens.


                               LORA
                    I don't think I'm cleared for this.

                    I'm certainly not.


                               FLYNN
                    Move aside. Let the kid have some room.

         He gestures Alan and Lora out of the way, takes out a small black
         box, with several buttons, a -digital counter- with LED numerals
         and a small calculator keyboard. He leans over the security lock,
         his BACK TO THE CAMERA and PLAYS a couple of notes. There's a
         distinct CLICK, an the door starts to swing open ... and open ...
         and open. We see that this door is about twenty feet thick. Flynn
         starts LAUGHING.


    105  INT. A CORRIDOR                                              105


         The three of them walk along a semi-darkened corridor, trying to
         nonchalantly avoid the security monitor camera mounted on the wall.
         But as they go past it, it swivels and aims right at them.


                               LORA
                    Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at
                    my terminal, down in the laser lab.
                    We'll be up in Alan's office.


                               FLYNN
                    Swell...I'll log us both on, and you
                    can get your Tron thing running...

                    As long as we stay off the top floor,

         His head pulls back in.

         approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into
         his mouth. He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the
         camera, and pushes the bag over the lens. The SCREEN GOES BLACK,

                    You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.

                    I'm afraid you...


         The voice lurches, goes into high speed, and then back to normal.

         We see that one entire wall of the lab is a door and it is rising
         silently, so that Flynn doesn't notice.


         We can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment, and it
         is this section that is being activated.

         grinning, typing.


                               FLYNN
                    Now, how do you expect to run the
                    universe if you let a few unsolvable
                    problems throw you like that? C'mon,
                    big boy, let's see what...


                               MCP
                    You're entering a big error, Flynn...
                    I'm going to have to put you on the
                    Game Grid.


                               FLYNN
                    Games, huh? I'll give you --


         Suddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism
         behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He
         freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like
         a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer
         ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light,
         being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic -
         with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure
         blurs and becomes indistinct. ZOOM IN on Flynn and

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    129  THE CAMERA RUSHING over a circuit pattern, like the one      129
         we saw at the opening of the film'.


         The pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are
         rushing forward at great speed. We see the circuits rushing by and
         getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a
         glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from AIC's logo,
         covered with circuits. We are rushing at it, circling it, diving
         closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer
         with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures,
         angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and
         deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. Everything glows with
         an internal energy.


         We continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the
         structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs,
         and then we're right over this area and diving straight down,
         everything blurring with the speed.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    130  ELECTRONIC WORLD - A TUNNEL                                  130


         made up of rings of energy, and we are diving straight down it.

         We see a human figure falling feet first down this tunnel from the
         outside, and suddenly we're at the bottom, and the figure stops,
         staggering from the force of the fall, but upright.


                                                   CUT TO:


    132  SHOT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL                             132


         We see Flynn, or what looks like Flynn -- same face, etc, but now
         covered with a strange costume, made of electronic circuitry,
         glowing with energy. Flynn shakes his head dazedly.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only
                    thinks it's happening...


         He looks up and SEES something.


    133  FLYNN'S POV                                                  133


         A horrendous, towering character, carrying a long, glowing staff,
         is right in front of him. This character reaches out an arm and
         grabs Flynn.

         being dragged off the entry tube platform.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Take it easy! Look, if this is
                    about those parking tickets, I can
                    explain everything...


    135  THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           135


         hovering over the Game Grid. We see Sark in his feet sockets, his
         hands spread out flat on the table in front of him. A BUZZING NOISE
         fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form, shimmering
         into awful shape. We see the stretched out face dissolving into the
         cylinder of the MCP.


                               MCP
                    SARK, ES-1117821. Open communication.


         Sark suddenly snaps to awareness, directing all his attention to the MCP.


                               SARK
                            (hoarsely)
                    Yes, MCP.


                               MCP
                    I've got a little challenge for you, Sark --
                    a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I
                    want him treated in the usual manner. Train
                    him for the games... let him hope for a
                    while... and blow him away.


                               SARK
                    You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send
                    me somebody with a little moxie ... what
                    kind of program is he?


                               MCP
                    He's not any kind of program, Sark.
                    He's a User.


         Sark looks up, shocked.


                               SARK
                    A User?


                               MCP
                    That's right. He pushed me...in the
                    other world. Somebody pushes me, I push
                    back. So I brought him down here ...
                    What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.



                               SARK
                    Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know,
                    a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User
                    even wrote you...


                               MCP
                    Now get this straight, pal -- no one
                    User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million
                    of their man-years! I'm bigger than all
                    those little wimps put together!
                            (disgust)
                    Humans they can't even keen their social
                    order in one piece

                               SARK
                    But-what if I can't...?


                               MCP
                    You rather take your chances with me?
                    Want me to slow down your power cycles
                    for you?


         The circuits going into the energy sockets fade; we see Sark weaken.


                               SARK
                    Wait...I need that...


                               MCP
                    Then pull yourself together. Get this
                    clown trained. I want him in the Games
                    until he dies playing.

                    Acknowledge.


                               SARK
                             (weakly)
                    Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...


                               MCP
                    End of line.


         The hologram disappears and Sark's power returns.

         Two guards leading Flynn down it, ECHOING FOOTSTEPS.


         They turn a corner and continue, finally stopping in front of a
         cell. The door opens automatically. Flynn holds back.


                               GUARD

         The guard shoves Flynn inside and SLAMS the door, cutting off his
         voice.

         The same type of cell Crom was thrown into in the title sequence.
         Flynn is leaning against the door, staring at his hands.


    138  HIS POV                                                      138

         understanding on his face. Voices are coming through the opening
         of the neighboring cell.


    140  INT. NEXT CELL - RAM'S                                       140


         Ram is standing at the window that divides his cell from Tron's.

         He can hear the VOICES, but can't see anything except Ram's back,
         so he goes to the window and tries to reach through.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Who are you guys?
                    What's the story around here?


         But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells,
         it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field
         come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then
         disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock.


    142  RAM                                                          142


         turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise.

                    You want to watch those force fields...


         He goes to the window opening.

                    You'll be having plenty of chances to

                    Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play
                    video games better than anybody.


         Ram gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything,
         there's a tremendous POUNDING NOISE, and the door of Flynn's cell
         opens.

         we see guards pulling out other CAPTIVES from their cells, and as
         Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the
         opposite direction.

         A large area which opens onto the Game Grids from above, with
         balconies overlooking the action. Overhead, the aircraft carrier
         hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below. The new
         captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards. They
         pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who LAUGH and make fun of
         them. Flynn is in the front of the line.

         Sark speaks from the bridge of the carrier, and his voice is

                    Those of you who continue to profess
                    a belief in the Users will receive
                    the standard substandard training.
                    This will result in your eventual
                    elimination.

    176  1. SHOT OF FLYNN, held immobile while a laser scans          176
            his mouth.


    177  2. A LINE OF RECRUITS files past a checkpoint. Each          177
            is handed a disk.

    178  3. THE RECRUITS file out into a training area.               178

    179  4. We see AN ARM being fitted with a cesta.                  179

    180  5. ONE of the more experienced CONSCRIPTS, RAM,              180
            demonstrates the throw with the cesta.


    181  6. FLYNN tries an awkward throw. In the b.g. other           181
            recruits are practicing.


    182  7. RAM instructs Flynn. Flynn is getting better. He          182
            spins and catches a pellet.


    183  8. A demonstration of the DISK GAME by two other warriors.   183

    184  9. FLYNN practices a ricochet shot at a target --            184
            hits perfectly.

    185  FLYNN BACK IN HIS CELL                                       185


         for a rest period. He is pacing back and forth, and we can see Ram
         seated in the next cell. Flynn goes to the bars.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey, Ram ... what were you ...
                    you know, before?


                               RAM
                           (nostalgic,
                            brightens)
                    Oh, I was an actuarial program...
                    worked at a big insurance company.
                    It really gives you a great feeling,
                    helping folks plan for their future
                    needs -- and of course, if you look
                    at the payments as an annuity, over
                    the years, the cost is really


                               FLYNN
                             (about to
                             get bored)
                    Yeah, yeah -- that's great.


                               RAM
                    How 'bout yourself?


                               FLYNN
                    Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...


                               RAM
                              (nods)
                    Sure, a little disorientation. That's
                    normal, when they transport you. It'll
                    come back to you. You're doing real
                    well in training. Remarkable, really...


         The POUNDING on Flynn's cell begins again.


    187  THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           187


         We see Flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind Sark's
         console. Sark is staring up at the screen, frowning, nervous,
         frightened of this new User-warrior.


                               SARK
                         (over his shoulder)
                    Wait a minute...put this guy against
                    one of the other recruits.


    188  OMIT                                                         188

    189  A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF FLYNN AND CROM                       189


         We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two
         bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate
         circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. Crom
         marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other.
         When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear.
         We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn
         and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers. He
         looks over at Crom, who's anxious.


                               FLYNN
                    Looks like we're in the same boat here -


                               CROM
                              (jumpy)
                    You think you're gonna wipe me right
                    out, don't you?


                               FLYNN
                    No, I


         A buzzer sounds. The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet
         upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads
         straight for Flynn.


         Flynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of
         his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him
         right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches
         himself in time to keep from falling over the edge.


    190  FLYNN'S POV - DOWN                                           190

         down, down between the rings into an infinite pit.


    191  BACK TO FLYNN                                                191

         staring down. There's a SOUND and he looks up.

    192  HIS POV                                                      192


         Another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!


    193  FLYNN                                                        193


         reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther
         edge of his platform, leaping over the empty ring on the way, and
         catching the pellet before it can' hit. He throws it back.


    194  CROM                                                         194


         Flynn's pellet hits the mirror, flashes down on him. Crom strains,
         but misses. One of his rings disappears.

    195  FLYNN reacting                                               195


                               FLYNN
                       (happy he's scored)
                    Okay!

    196  SARK'S AIRCRAFT CARRIER - THE BRIDGE                         196

         High above the game we see Sark watching.


    197  FLYNN                                                        197


         racing for another catch. He makes it and hurls the pellet again.
         We see that Crom's platform is disappearing fast.


    198  OMIT                                                         198

                               FLYNN
                    Here's an easy one...


         Flynn throws again. The pellet hits the mirror platform and heads
         straight at Crom, who misses it. The pellet destroys the ring he
         was standing on, and Crom has to grab frantically at the edge of
         the next ring to keep from falling.


 200-201 OMIT                                                         200-201


    202  FLYNN                                                        202


         He is sent another pellet from above and catches it, holding it
         ready, waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring.


    203  SARK                                                         203


         His face lit from below by the glow of the Game Grid... angry


    204  FLYNN                                                        204


         He puts down his cesta. Suddenly a voice rings out from above.
         Flynn looks up. There, appearing in the mirror disk above, is Sark's
         face, furious, huge.


                               SARK
                    Finish the game!


    205  FLYNN                                                        205


         staring at this apparition. He grits his teeth.


                               FLYNN

                    Kill him!!!


         Flynn holds up the pellet... and drops it down into the abyss below.
         He stares back up at Sark's immense image.


                               FLYNN
                    No!

                    You'll regret this.

         The ring he is holding on to dissolves, and with a SCREAM, he
         falls... and falls ... and falls...

         on the bridge. His finger wavers over another button, almost
         presses it... We see him-straining, trying to overcome his
         conditioning. Then he snatches his hand away.


                               SARK
                           (looking up)

         staring up. The image on the mirror wavers and dissolves.


    212  SARK                                                         212


         He SLAMS his palm down on a panel on the console, and a BUZZER
         SOUNDS.


    213  FLYNN                                                        213


         as the bridge to his platform reappears, and we see guards starting
         to run across to him.


    214  RAM AND TRON                                                 214


         The sound of GUARDS' running feet approaching their cells. They look
         up.


    215  A CORRIDOR IN THE GAME AREA                                  215


         Flynn is being escorted down it. A couple of big Blue Warriors go by
         and deliberately brush into Flynn.

                               WARRIOR
                          (turning on Flynn,
                              snarling)
                    Outta  my way, rookie.


         Flynn stares at him; then, in one smooth motion, reaches to his back
         and pulls out his disk.


                               FLYNN
                    Out of my way, zero bit.


         He moves as if to throw the disk.


                               WARRIOR
                            (backing away)
                    Sure, sure ... just kiddin'.


         The other warrior grabs this one by the arm and pulls him away as
         Flynn and his guards continue on.


    216  THE HOLDING AREA FOR THE LIGHT CYCLE GAME                    216


         Ram and Tron are escorted in as Flynn is brought in from another
         corridor. Three blue warriors are lined up, waiting.


                               RAM
                    Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!


                               FLYNN
                         (under his breath)
                    Tron...?


         He leans over to get a better look at Tron and GASPS in surprise.

                               FLYNN
                    Alan!

                               TRON
                            (frowning)
                    Where did you hear that name?


                               FLYNN
                    Well, isn't it -- ?


                               TRON
                    The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?


                               FLYNN
                          (thinking fast)
                    I, uh... I'm a program from a User
                    that... knows Alan...?


                               RAM
                    He was disoriented in transport, Tron.


                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of
                    stuff. Like...my User wants me to go
                    after the MCP


         Before they can go on, the BUZZER sounds.


                                                   CUT TO:


    217  LONG SHOT OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                            217


         floating over the Game Grid, with a view of the light cycle arena.
         ZOOM IN on the section of the grid where the game is about to start.


    218  A SHOT FROM ABOVE                                            218


         The three Blue Warriors are lined up facing our friends, on opposite
         sides of the large arena, about a half mile square, surrounded by
         high bulwarks, and surveyed by Recognizers. We can see the carrier
         hovering high overhead.


    219  CLOSE ON TRON                                                219


                               TRON
                    That's what my User wants, too...


    220  SHOT OF THE THREE FRIENDS                                    220


         holding the handlebars of the cycles in front of them. We see Tron
         and Ram looking at Flynn, in the center.


                               FLYNN
                    I know...


    221  CLOSE SHOT - FLYNN                                           221


         With a sizzling electrical discharge, the light cycle is inscribed
         around him.


    222  SHOT OF THE THREE BLUE CYCLES                                222


         ready to go.


    223  SHOT OF THE THREE CONSCRIPT CYCLES                           223


         also ready.


    224  SARK                                                         224


         His finger presses a button and the BUZZER SOUNDS again.


    225  SHOT FROM ABOVE OF ALL CYCLES TAKING OFF                     225


         We see the six solid walls being formed behind the cycles. As we
         watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side, leaving Tron
         and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other:


    226  OMIT                                                         226


    227  TRON'S POV                                                   227


         of the other cycle heading straight at him.


    228  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              228


         We see these two cycles come together and almost crash ... but both
         turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing
         forward. The other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the
         arena.


                               FLYNN'S VOICE
                                (into mike)
                    Nice one!


    229  SHOT OF TRON AND HIS OPPONENT                                229


         They start making turns, passing walls they have already created,
         each trying to box the other in.


                               TRON'S VOICE
                               (into mike)
                    Ram, stay all the way over ...


    230  CLOSE SHOT FROM THE SIDE - TRON                              230

         rushing forward.


    231  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           231

         turning.

                               RAM'S VOICE
                               (into mike)
                    I've got control. Go ahead.


    232  SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON'S CYCLE                           232


    233  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              233

         They rush past a wall, headed directly for a bulwark at the end of
         the arena. Tron is on one side, but the Blue Warrior is on the
         inside. Tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall.
         There is an explosion as the cycle de-rezzes, and a crack forms in
         the bulwark. We see that the walls created by the de-rezzed warrior
         dissolve as he does.

    234  SHOT OF FLYNN                                                234

         rushing alongside his opponent. They make a turn.

    235  CLOSE UP OF FLYNN                                            235

    236  LONG SHOT                                                    236

         They make another turn


    237  SHOT OF TWO CYCLES RUSHING                                   237

         right at the camera.


    238  FLYNN'S POV                                                  238

         of the maze of walls. He gets clear for a moment and spots the crack
         in the bulwark.

    239  CLOSE UP - HIS FACE                                          239

         reacting, getting an idea.

                               FLYNN
                            (into mike)
                    You guys...follow me.


    240  SHOT OF THE TWO CYCLES                                       240


         racing together, approaching the bulwark. At the last second, the
         Blue Warrior turns, but Flynn races right at the crack.


    241  SARK                                                         241


         observing this. With satisfaction. Now he will be rid of the User.


    242  FLYNN                                                        242


         He races straight at the crack... and through it.


    243  SARK                                                         243


         His face suffused with anger. He SLAMS a fist down on the console
         in front of him.


    244  LONG SHOT OF THE GRID                                        244


         The remaining four cycles are still racing around the arena.


    245  CLOSE UP - TRON                                              245


         reacting to Flynn's escape, hope in his eyes.


    246  ANGLE ON RAM                                                 246


         SMASHING another one of the Blue Warriors against a wall. He turns
         and races up next to Tron.


    247  SHOT OF THEM                                                 247


         side by side. They look at each other.


                               RAM

                    What do you think?

                    Do it!


    248  LONG SHOT                                                    248


         We see their cycles veer off and head straight for the crack. We
         HEAR a LOUD SIREN and a mechanical voice starts up:


                               VOICE
                      (through loudspeaker)
                    WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID.
                    REPEAT: ALL WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE
                    GAME GRID. WARNING. WARNING.


         We continue to hear this voice repeating under the escape, gradually
         diminishing as the three friends get farther away, until it dies
         out altogether.

    249  SHOT OF TWO RECOGNIZERS                                      249

         moving towards the dividing bulwark, passing over it.

    250  SHOT OF THE THREE ESCAPING CYCLES                            250


         racing through the narrow crack in the bulwark, barely enough room
         to get by. They emerge into an open corridor, with the Recognizers
         appearing overhead. We watch the cycles rush past the CAMERA...

    251  SARK                                                         251


         He is pacing across the bridge of the carrier, smashing guards out
         of his way.


                               SARK
                    Get them. Send out every Game
                    Tank in the Grid! Get them!

    252  SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN                                        252


         as he looks up and spots the Recognizers hovering over them, about
         to come down for the kill.

                    Recognizers!

    252A SHOT OF RAM                                                  252


         heading for a smaller opening in one wall, labeled "Game Storage."

    253  SHOT FROM BEHIND                                             253

         as the three cycles race into the opening. The Reco's are blocked,
         way too big to fit through the opening.

    254  INT. WEAPONS STORAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS                       254


         FROM FLYNN'S POV as they rush through long narrow rooms filled with
         rows of tanks and missiles. As they speed past, the rows of tanks
         REV UP, turn in formation, one after the other, like the Rockettes,
         and follow.


    255  EXT. MAZE                                                    255


         Outside the game area, an electronic desert reminiscent of the Grand
         Canyon, with giant pillars rising high into the air, lined with
         narrow ridges and ledges. The cycles rush around corners of the
         ledges, pursued by the tanks, high above the flat surface. They come
         around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the
         face of the cliff. They stop for a moment.

    255A ANGLE ON FLYNN                                               255A

    256  CLOSE UP - TRON'S FACE                                       256

         listening.

                               TRON
                            (into mike)
                    Game Tanks! Come on

    257  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              257

         as the three cycles rev up and race off, headed for one of the
         narrow openings in the cliff face, and plunge into it, disappearing
         from view.

    258  INT. OF THE CAVE                                             258


         We see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the
         darkness, down, down into the dry rot section. The cycles come to a
         stop and de-rez. Leaving each man standing with just the handlebars
         between his fists. They all let out a long SIGH and relax.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh man...when you're on the other side
                    of the screen...it all looks so easy...


         Ram and Tron look at Flynn as if he's crazy, then start smiling and
         grinning, until all three are LAUGHING.


    259  DESERT LABYRINTH                                             259


         as the force of tanks RUMBLES through the terrain, the aircraft
         carrier hovering overhead.


    260  BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                               260


         Sark is staring feverishly out over the barren landscape.


                               SARK
                       (to one of the bridge
                            personnel)
                    Get the pursuit force back into 404A.
                    There's no place else they could be...


         Sark's lieutenant is watching the wall-sized screen behind Sark,
         where we can see a diagram of the area, with the tanks visible,
         moving through it. He turns to Sark.


                               LIEUTENANT
                              (confidently)
                    We'll have them in no time, sir. Long
                    before the interrupt interface.


                               SARK
                         (whirls on him)
                    We better, null unit. I'll be lucky if
                    the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone.
                    I want those programs!


    261  INT. CAVE                                                    261


         Ram, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the
         cave. Beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a
         cityscape, and one enormous TOWER with a golden beam of light rising
         from it, farther up than the eye can see. No tanks are visible.


                               FLYNN
                           (looking out)
                    It's all circuits...
                         (points at tower)
                    Must be an input/output component...


                               RAM
                    The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you
                    remembered anything else about
                    yourself -- like what sector you're
                    from?


                               FLYNN
                           (sitting down
                          against a rock)
                    Well...my home "sector" was called
                    Paramus ...


                               RAM
                           (sits also)
                    PARAMUS... wonder what those initials
                    stand for ... (starts counting them
                    off on his fingers) ...probably Program
                    Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like
                    a lovely place.


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    It grows on you.


         He notices that Tron is not listening to them any longer, but is
         gazing upwards.


                               TRON
                            (murmuring)
                    I can feel it ...


         Flynn and Ram turn.


                               FLYNN
                    Feel what? You okay?


                               RAM
                    Alan-One...


                               TRON
                    Yes... he's got something to tell me...


         Ram and Tron look out at the distant tall tower.


                               RAM
                    You think we can make it there?


                               TRON
                    We have to.


                               FLYNN
                      (pointing to a corner
                           of the cave)
                    Hey, what's that?


         They all look back, into the darkness behind them. A glowing stream
         can just be seen. Ram gets up.


                               RAM
                    it's just what we need.


    262  INT. NICHE                                                   262


         Ram and Tron are drinking, kneeling at the stream of flowing,
         brilliant LIGHT.


                               TRON
                    Oh, that's nice. You always forget how
                    good fresh energy feels, till you get
                    to a pure source...
                            (to Flynn)
                    Have some...you'll need it.


         Flynn goes to the stream, dips his hands in, takes a drink.


                               FLYNN
                         (wiping his mouth)
                    well... when do we pay a call on the ol'
                    Master Control?


         Tron and Ram are taken aback.


                               TRON
                    What, just the three of us?


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    You know anybody that's got an army for
                    rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said
                    to go take that sucker out. An' let's
                    face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any
                    weaker. I feel like hittin' him now,
                    while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve...
                    what does he care whether you guys get
                    killed, long as he keeps rakin' in
                    quarters?


                               RAM
                            (to Tron)
                    Do you know what he's talking about?


                               TRON
                            (to Flynn)
                    I have to find out what Alan wants...
                    that comes first.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows
                    what to -


         Suddenly, we hear a RUMBLING SOUND. Flynn looks up sharply.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    What's that?


                               TRON
                    Tanks...coming back. Let's go.


         With that, there's an EXPLOSION from outside the cave. Each of the
         men holds up his cycle handlebars, and the three cycles SIZZLE back
         into shape and race up the ramp, and on out.


 263-265 OMIT                                                         263-265

         The three cyclists pause at the cave opening, sizing up possible
         avenues of escape in the terrain below.


                               FLYNN
                              (points)
                    How about over there...that empty
                    memory?


                               TRON
                           (shakes head)
                    No good...they might block off the
                    old chip.
                             (points)
                    This way.


         The cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from
         the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells
         EXPLODING around them. We see the tanks close behind.

         from inside of the tanks, of the three bikes heading into a narrow
         arroyo.


    268  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           268


         They just make it around the corner when an EXPLOSION boasts the
         entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very
         narrow canyons with short walls. They turn another corner and come
         to the edge of a gaping ravine.


         Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their
         ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down
         to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom.


                               TRON'S VOICE
                    The bridge! Come on!


         The tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons,
         lifeless, inexorable nemesis. Tron's cycle is in the lead as all
         three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank
         turning the corner.

         Tron races out on it, Ram and Flynn behind. Just as Tron reaches
         the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a
         tremendous EXPLOSION of electronic FLAK, blasting Ram and tossing
         him back on top of Flynn. Both cycles de-rez. The bridge disappears,
         and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn. Tron
         SCREECHES to a halt and swings his bike back around.


         He looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine
         below, he SEES a pile of motionless rubble.


         The tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he REVS up again,
         speeds off down the ramp, and is gone.

         Ram is badly injured, unconscious. Flynn struggles to his feet,
         sees the tank turret swiveling towards him, grabs Ram and picks him
         up.

         in the carrier above. He is watching the action on the wall screen
         behind his console, back to the camera. The picture is coming from
         the lead tank. To him, it appears as though Ram and Flynn had been
         blown up, since no sign of them is visible. We can see his
         lieutenant nearby, operating the communications.

         speeding through the flat, desert-like terrain, heading straight for
         the cityscape tower in the distance.

    277  SHOT IN FRONT OF HIM - HIS FACE                              277

         Far behind him, we see the image of Sark's carrier ponderously
         moving in his direction.

    278  FLYNN AND RAM                                                278


         Flynn is supporting Ram, half carrying him, and it is
         getting darker.


                               FLYNN
                    You gonna make it?


         Ram weakly nods, but doesn't look very convincing. Flynn bites his
         lip and struggles on. They are down on the floor of the desert,
         leaving the towering canyons behind. A large, dim shape can be made
         out. Flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it.


                                                   CUT TO:

         arriving in front of a block-like shape, with a narrow opening.
         Exhausted, Flynn lets Ram down to the ground, goes to the opening
         and looks in. Looks okay, so he comes back.

    280  FLYNN AND RAM                                                280


         sitting down inside the hiding place, collapsing. Ram is unconscious
         anyway, and Flynn's eyes soon closed.


                                                   FADE TO BLACK:
    281  FADE UP FROM BLACK                                           281


         Some light comes in the opening, and we see Flynn lying on a
         platform across from Ram. Ram's glow appears to be almost gone.
         Flynn's eyes open. For a second he doesn't know where he is, but
         then he spots Ram, and comes fully awake. Ram is watching him. Flynn
         looks around. He gets up and stretches, his hand reaching up towards
         the ceiling. It brushes against one panel and suddenly the energy
         glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel, leaving
         it with a glow of its own. The entire chamber starts to shake and
         RUMBLE.


                               FLYNN
                           (holding onto
                             the wall)
                    What's goin' on?


                               RAM
                      (looking around, weak)
                    We're inside a Recognizer...
                            (to Flynn)
                    You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --


                               FLYNN
                       (stumbling, trying to
                         keep his balance)
                    Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -


         Flynn tentatively places his-hands on separate parts of the
         instruments. An energy flow starts, and with a mighty heave and
         shudder, the chamber they're in turns over, knocking both Flynn and
         Ram to one side. The Recognizer is now in its standard upright
         position.

         Through the head of the Reco, we can look out at the landscape below.


         Flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to Ram, who's
         going fast.


                               FLYNN
                    You okay? You don't look so good.


         Ram nods weakly.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Hang on. We'll get you outta here.


         Flynn touches panels, trying to get the Recognizer going, but with
         no result.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Damn! Never fails... minute the
                    warranty runs out...


                               RAM
                    Come here.


         Flynn goes over to him and kneels. Ram grabs his hands. Suddenly
         Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into
         Flynn. Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey... !


                               RAM
                    Little more juice's all it needs...


         Ram's last bit of energy flows into Flynn and Ram's body de-rezzes.
         Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow,
         but it's too late. Ram disappears before his eyes. Stunned, he
         gazes at the empty space for a moment, then stands up.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

         Tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt-out
         landscape. Buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low
         rate of power, so drained by the MCP. The cycle de-rezzes. There's a
         NOISE from above, and Tron looks up.


    285  TRON'S POV                                                   285


         A Recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him.

         He hides behind a building as the Reco passes. A strange, zombie-like
         figure comes down one of the streets, and the Recognizer swoops over
         it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the
         figure, dissolving it.


    287  CLOSE UP TRON'S FACE                                         287


         Very grim. He looks out onto the street and sees two more of the
         figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving.
         Dead, lifeless, but animate. Tron comes out on the street, staring
         at these figures. He locks around the city in confusion, shaking his
         head sadly, but walks on.


    288  TRON TURNS A CORNER                                          288

    289  CLOSE UP - TRON IS FACE                                      289

         This is what he was looking for. He looks from side to side,
         figuring the best way to get to the building. In front of the
         building stand a small group of the memory guards.

         This was his POV out of the window of the Recognizer. His face is
         sad, he is still mourning Ram. This is a very low point. He sighs,
         then looks around, putting his palm on one panel after another.
         One of them glows brilliantly as he touches it, and the Recognizer
         gives a violent shake, then stops.


                               FLYNN
                    Never gonna figure out how to work

         His eyes widen, then narrow. He non chalantly turns away, pretending
         to be still examining things.


                                                   CUT TO:


    295  THE GLOW                                                     295


         Appearing again, peeking around the corner. It comes forward, trying
         to get a look at Flynn. The BIT.


    296  WIDE SHOT                                                    296


         Flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter. The Bit gives
         a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately
         comes back, peering at Flynn. Flynn is moving closer.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay -- hold it right there!


         The Bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly
         recognizes Flynn (thinks he is Clu), expands in a smooth green
         sphere -- the "Yes" mode and shouts:


                               BIT
                    Yes!


         The Bit subsides into energy form again.


                               FLYNN
                        (still suspicious)
                    What do you mean, "'yes"?


                               BIT
                    Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.


         From now on, whenever the Bit speaks, it is a ball-shaped character,
         red or green, with a hint of a face, but as soon as it stops
         speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light.


                               FLYNN
                    That all you can say?


                               BIT
                         (of course not,
                         you know better)
                    No, nyet, negatory, not on your
                    tintype, no way.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh. Anything else?


                               BIT
                    Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.


                               FLYNN
                    only yes and no...
                             (it dawns)
                    You're a bit.


                               BIT

                    For sure...


                               FLYNN
                    where's your program? Won't it miss you?


                               BIT
                            (confused)
                    No...


         Flynn eyes the bit cautiously.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm your program?


                               BIT
                            (emphatic)
                    Right on the money!


                               FLYNN
                              (sighs)
                    Another mouth to feed... you don't by any
                    chance know how to drive this crate?


         In answer, the Bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a
         platform supports a four-foot tube with a crossbar. Flynn follows,
         stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and
         grabs the cross-bar.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Like so?


         Before the Bit can answer, Flynn's power flows into the Recognizer,
         and it takes off like a bat out of hell

         into a wall and bouncing off another one.

         This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him. We see him
         inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views
         of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange
         elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side. All composed
         partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces.
         We see several female programs working in these rooms. This building
         only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no
         interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along.
         Tron looks farther down the corridor.

         We see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards
         Tron.

         as he moves back against the wall, into a niche.


         As the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and
         grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him.
         The line of workers mechanically files on past.


         We watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against
         his chest until all the workers are gone. She struggles feebly,
         half-heartedly.


                               TRON
                    I'm not gonna hurt you.


         She stops struggling.


                               TRON (CONT.)
                    I'm going to let you go now... don't
                    scream, or I'll be very sorry.


         His hands loosen, and he releases her.

         We see the faint pale image of the girl from full face for the first
         time. She looks tired and uninterested. Her face...is Lora's face,
         still beautiful in its pallor.


                               TRON
                    Put your hand behind your back.


         Slowly she obeys.

         He extends his own hand to touch hers, palm to palm. As contact is
         made, a rich glow appears between the two hands, strengthening as we
         watch. A look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into
         her. She turns, entwining her fingers in Tron's.


                               GIRL
                    TRON!!


         She throws her arms around him.

         She-looks around nervously.


                               YORI
                          (pulling him by
                             his hand)
                    This way. Come on.


         They walk quickly toward a flight of stairs.

         Tron and Yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk. We can see
         the glowing beam of the 1/0 Tower over the tops of all the buildings,
         and several half-gone programs standing around. As they pass, they
         hear snatches of conversation.

                    around here since the MCP started

                    have shut down... everybody looks so dead...
                    I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...


                               TRON
                    That's all going to change, Yori...

                    in touch with Alan. He was going
                    to tell me how to


         Suddenly Yori looks up, sees something, grabs Tron's hand and pulls
         him back into a nearby alley. She points up in the air.

         She shivers, and holds Tron's hand tighter.

    313  INT. HALLWAYS                                                313


         Tron and Yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door.
         She whistles and the door disappears. They step through.


                                                   CUT TO:


    314  INT. YORI'S APARTMENT                                        314


         As Tron and Yori enter. The apartment appears to be a box, with one
         window overlooking the cityscape, and the I/0 Tower. At first it
         looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the
         walls and floors.

                               YORI
                    My quarters.

                               TRON
                    Why is everything...like this?


                               YORI
                    It's a flat. But wait a micro...


         She lays her palm on the wall near the door. The door reappears, and
         a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. Tron looks around;
         the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming
         three-dimensional. The room glows a soft rose color, becomes
         charming, soothing. It is still small and limited, but the light in
         the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive
         aura. Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops.


    315  HIS POV                                                      315


         With her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing
         extra energy, changing. The severe work clothes metamorphosize into
         shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of
         diamond-like points of light. A silvery tinkling SOUND comes from
         her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded
         by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in
         Tron's face. She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand.


                               YORI
                    Come here.

         His face tells the story. The fugitive, returned from long exile, is
         being fully rewarded for his efforts.


                               TRON
                    You're beautiful, Yori.


    317  SHOT OF THEM BOTH                                            317

         as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their
         flattened palms.


         Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a
         glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.


                               YORI
                    You've grown, big program.


                               TRON
                    I had to...in the games...


         They move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch. All
         the energy is transmitted through their hands. They sink down onto
         what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. The
         room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each
         other, and we hear their sighs, as the MUSIC comes up. Each of them
         moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were
         trying to touch the other's entire body at once. They roll over and
         are enveloped in the cloud of stars...

         careening, glancing off a building or two.

         He lays his hands from panel to panel, causing one after another to
         light up in a random pattern, almost with a beat, but the Recognizer
         only slams into another building and keeps going. The Bit starts
         shouting:

         Flynn looks frantically around, spies a large panel to one side that
         he hasn't tried yet, and slaps his palm down on it.

         as the Reco screeches to a screaming stop... but the head of it,
         with Flynn and the Bit, breaks loose, and flies through the air,
         landing in what looks like a garbage dump.


                                                   CUT TO:

         as Flynn shakily pulls himself out of the debris, the Bit nervously
         hovering over him.


                               FLYNN
                              (to Bit)
                    Catch me listening to you again.

         A group of low resolution programs are walking by. Flynn emerges
         from the broken-off head, stunned, but unhurt, the Bit flying by
         his side. He blearily sees the passing programs, but doesn't realize
         they are at such a low state of consciousness that they can't see
         him.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey. Hi. Hey, everything's okay. Fine.
                    Little trouble, but we're okay. Thanks
                    for your concern. So long.


         They move on.


                               FLYNN
                            (to the Bit)
                    This town's full o' live ones.

                    Not a chance.


    328  EXT. CITY PLAZA                                              328


         Tron and Yori are crossing an open plaza-like area, on their way to
         the I/0 Tower. They pass by more zombie-like programs and overhear
         bits of conversation, all in dead-sounding monotones.

                    I have to re-route the insurance

                    the MCP... Did you make that accounts
                    receivable adjustment for Sark...
                    Certainly... the MCP wants only
                    minimal functions left in Sector 84Q.


    329  EXT. THE BASE OF THE I/0 TOWER                               329


         It looms high overhead.


    330  TRON AND YORI                                                330


         on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the Tower,
         approaching a wide door in the wall.


    331  INSIDE THIS DOOR'                                            331


         We see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now
         rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying Tron and Yori smoothly
         and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead.


    332  SHOT FROM BELOW THEM                                         332

         looking upwards as they move.

    333  THE UPPER FLOOR                                              333


         as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off. We get the
         sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery,
         dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate,
         preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared
         the sinner for confession. But here, everything is composed of clean,
         sharp, angular surfaces.  On this second story there is floor and
         ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below
         and beyond.


         Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for
         a door into the inner parts of the Tower.

    350  THE CENTRAL CHAMBER                                          350


         of the I/0 Tower. A large, raised circular altar stands against one
         wall, with a darkened opening behind it. A square, secondary altar
         supports the first, about fifty feet up a side.


         In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing
         steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded
         suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the I/0 Tower
         priest, DUMONT. His eyes are shut. His face is lined with age, but
         still holds a sprightly sensitivity. It is the face of Dr. Gibbs,
         from the laser lab in the Real world. There is a large, V-shaped
         opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon,
         each a different color. The stripes of color thus formed bleed
         upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the V opening. There is
         only blackness beyond.


    351  DUMONT'S FACE                                                351

         Tron and Yori walk toward him from an entranceway across the wide
         room, their footsteps ECHOING.

    375  CENTRAL CHAMBER - TRON, YORI, DUMONT                         375

         Tron and Yori stop at the foot of Dumont's altar.


                               YORI
                             (quietly)
                    Dumont... ?


         The priest's eyes flicker open. He looks at Tron and Yori, doesn't
         recognize either one.


                               DUMONT
                    Yes?


                               TRON
                             (nervous)
                    I... have come to communicate with
                    my User.


                               DUMONT
                    Hmm. A difficult proposition...
                    difficult proposition at best.
                       (indicates empty chamber)
                    Perhaps you've noticed... we're not
                    exactly packing them in these days ...


                               YORI
                    Yes...what--?


                               DUMONT
                    You know, not so long ago, you
                    could've come in here and seen
                    programs lined up all the way back
                    to those doors, waiting for communion
                    with their Users. The building fund
                    was doing well too...but now...
                               (sighs)
                    ...this so-called Master Control
                    Program is going around cutting
                    programs off from their natural
                    creators, grabbing all our believers
                    and making them ride around on little
                    motor scooters and shoot things at
                    each other and Weiner knows what all--
                    oh, it's enough to give you a crisis
                    of faith...


                               TRON
                    Well I want to communicate --

                               DUMONT
                    Oh, you want to -- hah. I could
                    get myself de-rezzed just-for letting
                    you in here. They hate this tower.
                    They'd close it down if they dared
                    to but they keep me around, in case
                    one of them wants to deal with the
                    other world once in a while. And
                    you should hear the way they commune!
                    Sounds like they were routing a
                    payroll, for all the heart they put
                    in it. No, I don't think you


         Tron steps closer, speaks quietly to Dumont.


                               TRON
                    Dumont... my User has information
                    that could -- could make this a
                    free system again.


                               DUMONT
                    Hah.


                               TRON
                    Really. You'd have programs lined
                    up around the block to use this
                    place -- and no MCP looking over your
                    shoulder.


                               DUMONT
                               (sighs)
                    When you've been in the system as long
                    as I have, you hear many promises...
                    many reassurances...many brave plans...


         He pauses, sizing Tron up, considering it. Finally:


                               DUMONT (CONT.)
                           (falling into ritual)
                    Who is your User, program?


                               TRON
                    Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?


                               DUMONT
                    All that is visible must grow beyond
                    itself and extend into the realm of
                    the invisible.


         Dumont nods, and the neon glow fades a little.


                               DUMONT
                    You may pass, my friend.


         Tron runs lightly up the steps, past Dumont, into the darkness
         beyond.

         We see Flynn and the Bit walking towards the Tower, staring
         curiously at the zombie-like characters on the streets.

         We see a face peer around it. Flynn.


                               FLYNN
                    This is where Tron said he was going...


         Below him, at waist level, also peeking around the corner, we see
         the glow of the Bit. Flynn moves out from the wall and starts going
         down the hall, Bit following.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Looks like his kind of place, too...
                    real serious.


         CAMERA SWIVELS and watches him walking quickly away from us. We HEAR
         the sound of many feet marching as Flynn reaches the end of the
         corridor. He stops and glances over his shoulder.

         Sark... and a force of guards and six Blue Warriors. Sark is in

         going in for a final, easy kill of one renegade program who is
         trapped.

         The file of men is moving away. We can see that there is a wide ledge
         about ten feet up the wall, containing the lighting source.

         lifting his staff.

         We can see Sark's men marching on away from us, and Flynn leaning
         over the warrior with the Bit hovering over him. As we watch, Flynn
         places both his hands on the Blue Warrior's chest. Quickly, the blue
         static pattern covering the guard flows into Flynn's hands up his
         arms, and transfers entirely to him and the warrior derezzes.

         I/0 Tower central chamber. The guards have formed two long rows, and
         Sark's lieutenant is standing by his side.


                               SARK
                    That old fruitcake Dumont...
                    he'll pay for this.

         He turns.

                    Bring in the logic probe!!


    392  THE HEART OF THE TOWER                                       392


         We see Tron approaching a bell-shaped structure, with the brilliant
         golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell. It is
         surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter.
         Tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell.


    393  INT. COMMUNICATION BELL                                      393


         Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room, the floor of
         which rises to a cone in the center. The top of the cone is a flat,
         sliced-off surface. Tron walks down into the dish, a soft, padded
         surface, and then climbs up to the flat, central podium. We see that
         this surface is round, about four feet in diameter, and glowing from
         within, with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it. Tron looks
         down, and then up.


    394  HIS POV                                                      394


         The curving inner surfaces of the bell culminate in a round opening.


    395  FROM THE OPENING                                             395


         We see Tron's upturned face. He steps up on the podium, hands gripped
         into fists at his sides. His face is gradually filling with a deep
         inner excitement and anticipation, his eyes searching the space
         above. His expression remains still, his mouth closed and even. Only
         his eyes project the emotion he is feeling, burning with the
         knowledge of the experience to come.


    396  A SHOT FROM BELOW HIM, NEAR HIS FEET, LOOKING UP.            396


         He takes out his disk, grips it in both hands and slowly raises it
         high above his head. He stands stiffly, willing the response to
         happen... At first nothing stirs. Then a splendid, radiant beam of
         light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell,
         illuminating Tron and the disk. His hands start to shake with the
         force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped
         from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source
         of the light.


    397  TRON'S FACE FROM ABOVE                                       397


         filled with a quiet awe, eyes narrowed against the strong light. His
         hands drop to his sides. The disk rises out of sight, and we

    398  THE 1/0 TOWER CENTRAL CHAMBER                                398


         The glow is visible, illuminating Yori and Dumont.


    399  EXT. CENTRAL CHAMBER - DOOR                                  399


         A machine, floating above the floor, with a pointed cone facing the
         door, is switched on, and a blast of pure electricity leaps from it
         to the surface of the door with the SOUND of sizzling LIGHTNING

         Tron is looking upwards. Suddenly a voice booms out, echoing, and
         distorted, Alan's voice.


                               ALAN V.0.
                    TRON... TRON... Location query...

                    There you are... look, before we get
                    cut off again...


         In the air above Tron, images begin to materialize, shifting,
         transparent forms. First we see a network with pinpoints of light
         at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a
         bright light at the center.


         We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the
         others dim.


                               ALAN (V.0.)

         The light increases in brilliance, as we hear Alan's voice fading out,
         consumed by static.

         He stops.


         The voice is gone. The beam continues to bathe Tron in its glow, and
         gradually we see an object emerging from the glow. The disk. It
         slowly descends, Tron raises his hands to catch it, gripping it,
         pulls it down and stares at it.

         It is glowing with a new power. Superimposed on its surface is a
         complex mandala pattern, changing kaleidoscopically as we watch,
         shifting swirling liquid color.

         entry to the Communication chamber.

         He is rising from the altar, the rest of his body emerging from the
         neon steps, until he is standing in front of Tron. We see that he
         has on a floor-length robe with huge shoulder pads forming
         winglike supports for the fabric.


                               DUMONT
                    I have waited for this moment many
                    thousands of cycles. It is time for the
                    new order to begin... The Users are
                    waiting.


         As we watch, Tron comes forward, and grips Dumont's shoulder briefly.
         Then he holds out his hand to Yori.

         of energy and the door disappears into thousands of sparkling dots
         of light.

    419  A SHOT FROM THE SIDE OF THE SAILER, RISING WITH TRON         419
         AND YORI

         We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft,
         designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an
         enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and
         move with the speed of light.  The sail is at the bow of the craft,
         and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is
         made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the
         look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data
         transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the
         information paths to the Central Processing Unit.

                    why the User abandoned the project...


         The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center,
         forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked
         into place.

    433  A SHOT FROM THE EXTERIOR OF THE HANGAR                       433


         The great door is almost all the way up. We can see the Sail with
         its tip ready to emerge. Below, on the ground, more guards are
         racing towards the hangar.


    434  TRON                                                         434


         Beating back the guards, tossing them over the side of the walkway.
         We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the
         connection of the craft to the sail. Tron advances on him... the
         guard stares at him, then looks down... then jumps off, intimidated.
         There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing
         his balance.


    435  YORI                                                         435


         smiling.


                               YORI
                    We're off!


    436  EXT. HANGAR                                                  436


         The transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft,
         from behind, hitting the sail bunker, and passing through, so that
         it looks like a headlight. The Sailer starts moving, fast,
         accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of
         seconds.


    437  EXT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER - BRIDGE - SARK & MCP                  437

         Back on the bridge of the carrier, Sark is in the MCP hologram. In
         front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and
         the Solar Sailer -- racing away.


                               MCP
                    I hope you've enjoyed being a command
                    program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like
                    working in a pocket calculator... maybe
                    one of those watches that plays "Happy
                    Birthday" to its User once a year.


                               SARK
                    Now, sir... We did take care of that
                    User you sent us --


                               MCP
                    Yes, and now you've got two renegade
                    programs running all the hell over the
                    system in a stolen simulation.


                               SARK
                    We'll get them, sir... These things
                    take time.


                               MCP
                    I don't have time, Sark. And neither
                    do you. End of line.

         from the stern. Tron picks himself up from the floor where he was
         thrown when the Sailer took off, and heads for Yori (at the camera).
         He stops, seeing something.


                               YORI V.O.
                    Tron, are you all right?


         Tron waves at her... then...


    441  CLOSE SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON                             441


         He looks over at the guard rail.

         Several yards away from it. We see one of the blue warriors hanging
         on, trying to get a leg up on the rail, and we see Tron race to the
         edge, look over and see this guard.


    444  CLOSE SHOT OF TRON                                           444


         By the rail with the blue arms and head in the shot. Tron raises his
         disk to slam into the intruder, when suddenly a spherical glowing
         shape comes into the frame from bottom right.


                               BIT
                      (buzzing around Tron's

                               TRON
                    Flynn!!


    447  SIDE SHOT OF THEM BOTH                                       447

                    Greetings, program...


                               TRON
                           (dumbfounded)

                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, I... oops!


         He loses his grip, and starts to fall. But Tron, just in time, grabs
         Flynn's wrist and starts to pull him up. We see the blue static guard
         disguise fade off Flynn.


    449  YORI                                                         449

         leaning over the control console anxiously, watching Tron come up
         the steps towards her with Flynn and the Bit.

                            (nervously)
                    Who is this?


         We see Flynn look at Yori and silently mouth "Lora" in surprise...
         but then realize his mistake.


                               TRON
                             (smiling)
                    Flynn...
                           (he turns to
                          Flynn eagerly)
                    Where's Ram?


                               FLYNN
                    I'm sorry, Tron... he's...
                    he didn't make it.


         Tron shakes his head, sadly.


                               TRON
                             (to Yori)
                    This is Flynn... the one who
                    busted me out.

                            (to Flynn)
                    Then I owe you some thanks...


                               FLYNN
                    No big deal. I ought to know my way
                    around that Light Cycles routine...
                    I mean, I did write the program for it.


                               TRON
                            (mystified)
                    Wrote the...?


                               FLYNN
                    It's time I levelled with you, Tron.
                    I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a
                    User.


         Tron and Yori are stunned and awed.


                               YORI
                    A User -- in our world?

                               (nods)
                    Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...


                               TRON
                    But -- if you're a User -- then
                    everything you've done has been
                    part of a plan ...


                               FLYNN
                              (laughs)
                    You wish. Man, I haven't had a second
                    to think since I got down here. I mean
                    in here. Out here. Whatever.


                               TRON
                    Then...


                               FLYNN
                    Look, you guys know how it is. You just
                    keep doin' what it looks like you're
                    supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and
                    you hope to hell your User knows what's
                    goin' on.


                               TRON
                    Well -- that's how it is for programs,
                    yes, but --


                               FLYNN
                    I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the
                    time, that's how it is for Users, too.


                               TRON
                    Stranger and stranger...

                    You said it.

                    So... Nice ship you got here. What's our
                    next move?


                               TRON
                             (smiles)
                    Remember you wanted to pay a call on
                    the MCP?


         Flynn nods.


                               TRON (CONT.)
                    We're on our way.

                    Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go

                               FLYNN
                    All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake,
                    at least.

         from behind.

                               LIEUTENANT
                    Sir, what do you want done with
                    the tower guardian, Dumont?
                    Put him with the others?


                               SARK
                    No, bit brain.

         Sark turns to face him.


                               SARK


                    Prepare him for inquisition. I need
                    a little relaxation. But first rez up
                    the carrier for pursuit... And one other
                    thing.


         lie stares at the lieutenant, paranoid


                               SARK
                           (continuing)
                    Don'tthink anymore. I do the

         We see Flynn looking back the way they came. Yori is at the controls,
         with Tron beside her, his arm around her shoulders, looking at Flynn.

                               FLYNN
                    What about our friend - Sark?


                               TRON
                    Probably decided not to pursue us,
                    The Sea of Simulation is tricky..
                    lot of illusions...rough navigating.
                    Programs have a way of just...
                    disappearing here.

                               FLYNN
                    Not us, I hope.

                          indicates disk)
                    Not with this disk. I'm going to
                    check on the beam connection, Yori.
                    You two can keep a watch out for
                    grid bugs.


         He moves off down the walkway, the Bit following. Flynn turns and
         leans out over the side.

         Where we see Dumont plugged into energy foot sockets. Two memory
         guards stand by his side holding their staffs against his chest.
         Dumont's face is wracked with pain, his robe torn, but his
         expression is full of determination. As we watch, another blast of
         torturous energy comes from the boots, and his face contorts. CAMERA

         looking down into the pit that is Dumont's cell.

                    What do you want? I'm busy.

                            (snarling)
                    Busy dying, you worn-out excuse for
                    an old program.


                               DUMONT
                    Yes, I'm old.

                               DUMONT
                            (continuing)
                    Old enough to remember the MCP when he
                    was just a chess program. He started
                    small, and he'll end small.

                         (throws back his
                         head and laughs)
                    That's very funny, Dumont. Maybe I
                    should keep you around, just to make me
                    laugh.

                    Guards! Bring this antique to the

                    be obliterated.

    468  THE DECK OF THE SOLAR SAILER                                 466


         We see Tron at the bow. Flynn and Yori are up on the deck near the
         controls, with the Bit hovering over them. Yori is, pointing
         something out to Flynn.

    470  LONG SHOT FROM THE SIDE                                      470


         We see the transmission beam which carries the Solar Sailer
         increasing in brightness, throbbing with a pulse of mad glowing
         energy, coming towards the ship. It hits the sail, and the ship
         shivers. The whole beam is now tripled in brightness.

         As Tron runs up to Yori's side. He grabs her shoulder, pulling her
         against him... they have to shout to be heard above the noise of the
         increasing beam.


                               TRON
                            (shouting)

                               YORI
                    Power surge... the transmission beam's
                    too strong!


                               TRON
                    We have to get off this beam!

                             (frantic)

         The ship is throbbing and jerking, bits of it de-rezzing.

                               FLYNN
                    There's another beam!


                               YORI
                    It's too far!


         Flynn suddenly looks to the bow of the ship, makes a decision, and
         races forward.

         We see Flynn race to the bow, where the horrendous power of the beam
         is blasting away at the sails. He slows down, but keeps going.

    478  SHOT IN FRONT OF SOLAR SAILER, FACING THE BOW                478


         We see Flynn emerge, leaning out into the beam, his face brilliantly
         illuminated by the beam. He reaches forward with one arm.

    480  SHOT FROM ABOVE FLYNN                                        480


         He is lying spread eagled at the bow, with one arm in the light. He
         raises his other arm and points at the beam which was so close, but
         too far to reach. Suddenly his whole body glows with the same
         intensity as the beam.

         His body glowing, arm outstretched. Suddenly another beam blasts out
         from his arm.

         We see the new beam from Flynn's arm flash over to the neighboring
         transmission beam and connect. We see the ship pulsing, and then
         breaking free of the old beam, following the new path, and connecting
         to the safe beam.

         The craft starts to travel safely on its way.

         as they reach the deck in front of Tron, as he holds Flynn. We can
         see Yori's anxious face to one side. Flynn's head comes up for a
         moment, dazed.

                               FLYNN
                              (weakly)

                    Yes.


         Flynn smiles weakly.


                               FLYNN
                    Hooray for our side...


         He faints.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

         Yori is sitting on the floor beside the control console with Flynn
         stretched out beside her, his head in her lap. Her hands are on
         either side of his face. Tron is seated across from them and the Bit
         is quietly floating beside him. In b.g. we SEE that the Solar Sailer
         is passing through a series of narrow canyons.


                               FLYNN

                    go check the instruments ...

                    He's dead.


                               DUMONT
                           (sighs, looks
                             at Flynn)
                    And who is this?


                               YORI
                    He's a User, Dumont. He came to
                    our world... trying to help us...


         Her voice breaks, she turns away.


                               DUMONT
                            (despairing)
                    If the Users can no longer help us...


         His voice trails off. Suddenly, a stronger LIGHT flashes on in the
         cell, the door opens, and we see Sark standing there, framed in the
         cell door.


                               SARK
                    So... we have erased the program that -


         As he catches sight of Flynn, his voice falters.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    You! No!


         Flynn looks up curiously.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    You died! I saw you!


                               FLYNN
                    Not me, boss.


                               SARK
                    Well... we can take care of that
                    soon enough.


         He points to Dumont. The guards grab him.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    Take this program to the holding pit.


         The guards start to drag Dumont out.


                               YORI
                        (rushing after him)
                    Dumont...!


         A guard pushes her roughly to the end of the cell.


                               SARK
                        (indicates Dumont)
                    I'm taking our friend here, and
                    some other religious fanatics, to
                    Master Control... the MCP has expressed
                    an interest in assimilating them --
                    probably for archival purposes.
                    I'm not going back to the Game Grid
                    on this ship, though -- I'll take
                    the Transport Beam.
                             (smiles)
                    Less traffic. But when I disembark,
                    this ship...and everything that remains
                    on board...will automatically de-rez.
                    This means you.

                    Enjoy your trip...


         LAUGHING, Sark leaves. The guards, with Dumont in custody, follow.


    533  SHOT LOOKING DOWN INTO THE PIT CELLS                         533


         into the cell that holds a dozen dejected, defeated, aging programs,
         the I/0 Tower guardians. We see the door to the cell open and guards
         beginning to herd them out.


    534  ANGLE - LEVEL ABOVE CELLS                                    534


         where we can see Sark walking towards an open portal. He looks down
         into the cells at his feet and laughs again.

    535  FLYNN                                                        535

         staring up as Sark moves past their cell and out of view.

         of the carrier approaching a flat-topped mountain, with the
         communication beam of the MCP visible at the very center.

         vast plain covered with a glowing grid.


    540  EXT. BRIDGE AREA OF CARRIER                                  540


         We can see the observation port and below that a section of the
         ship's structure is moving forward.

         As the landing pod disengages completely, floating away from the
         carrier and then starting its final journey to the MCP, picking up
         speed on a straight and even course. We can see a small speck
         clinging to one side of the pod...


    543A CLOSE UP - SPECK                                             543A


         TRON, holding himself braced into a narrow crack.


    544  FLYNN, YORI AND THE BIT                                      544


         Yori is sitting with her head in her hands. Flynn is at the door
         testing it, running his finger along the edges.


    545  LONG SHOT                                                    545


         Of landing pod flying over the glowing grid that surrounds the MCP's
         mesa.


    546  A SHOT                                                       546


         from behind the carrier of the pod getting smaller with distance.


    547  POD POV                                                      547


         Steep cliff face of the MCP's mesa is coming closer and closer, more
         and more detail visible.


    548  POD                                                          548


         tiny against the massive bulk of the MCP's mesa, descending for
         landing. The top edge of the cliff is encrusted with irregular
         shapes and the pod is headed for one opening among the shapes,
         fitting itself neatly in between so that it becomes a part of the
         structure.


    549  INT. POD                                                     549


         There is a minor jolt and Sark lays his palm on another panel. From
         the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly.
         Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door, and we
         gradually are given a view of the MCP, two or three miles away at
         the center of the plain ahead. The structure is a series of gleaming
         black blades, forming a great cylinder, and the communication beam
         rises out of the center of this cylinder.


    550  EXT. CARRIER                                                 550


         floating upwards and forward.

         Flynn still at the door. Suddenly his hand goes right through the
         door.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!


         The door is disappearing, dissolving.


                               FLYNN
                       (continuing; turning)
                    Look, the door's almost...


         He stops in horror.


                                                   CUT TO:


    552  HIS POV                                                      552


         Yori is standing lethargically staring at her hands... through them.
         She is de-rezzing too. Her whole body becoming transparent. She looks
         up dimly at Flynn, with no expression.


    553  WIDE SHOT                                                    553


         Flynn races back to her and takes her in his arms roughly, hugging
         her close, his energy flowing into her.


         Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is
         too late to save her. Her eyes are half-closed.


                               FLYNN
                    Yori!


    554  CLOSE SHOT                                                   554


         Just their two faces. Flynn bends closer, their lips almost touch.
         Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color
         floods back into her. Her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at
         Flynn. He pulls a little away from her, still holding her.


                               YORI
                             (in awe)
                    You... you brought me back...?
                    Why...? How ... ?


         Flynn lets go of her.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm gonna need your help. Hey, Bit!


         He looks around, spots a small glow in one corner of the cell, runs
         to it and stoops down, cupping the glow in his hands. It wavers.
         Flynn wills his energy back into it, frowning with concentration.
         Suddenly the Bit pops into life.


                               BIT
                    Yes!


                               FLYNN
                    Let's get outta here.


         They head for the door.


    555  THE MESA TOP OF THE MCP                                      555

         The prisoners file forward on the path to the MCP. Sark is leading
         them. We can see the structure of the MCP closer now, looming bigger.
         The four memory guards are standing at regular intervals along the
         path.

    556  EXT. POD DOOR - LIEUTENANT                                   556


         on duty. He hears a NOISE and turns... and in a flash of light a
         speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over. The CAMERA WATCHES
         over his de-rezzing body. We see a figure approaching closer... its
         arm is raised, and... the disk slams back into the hand.

    557  CLOSER SHOT                                                  557

         It is Tron. He steps over the body of the Lieutenant.

    558  THE MCP                                                      558

         from right outside. We see the prisoners beginning to file inside,
         up the final slope leading to the base of the MCP.

    559  SIDE SHOT OF THE ENTRANCE                                    559

         to the MCP. As the guardian programs enter. Sark stands waiting,
         watching them, his back to the camera.

    560  POV OF THE DOOMED PROGRAMS                                   560


         As the first one gets through the opening. The light from the MCP's
         beam pours out. Moving forward, through the entrance, the MCP is
         finally revealed. A giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a
         network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible
         surface... is a face. Flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted,
         the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder. The
         impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face,
         but more so. It's horrible. Beneath the floating cylinder face two
         inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. We
         continue moving forward, the MCP looming over us. Then the CAMERA
         STOPS and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to
         the inner walls. The MCP speaks, we see his enormous lips moving.


                               MCP
                      (echoing, booming)
                    I am delighted that so many of you
                    could turn out to give your
                    power over to me...


    561  FULL SHOT - THE PROGRAMS                                     561


         lining the wall. They are sucked back, pinned, immobile, and we see
         them starting to de-rez.


                               MCP
                    You're very lucky, all of you. You
                    are participating in the creation of
                    the single most powerful program in
                    the history of the system... of all
                    systems...


         The programs begin to disappear, one by one.


                               MCP
                          (continuing)
                    A program with a will... with

         Dumont's face is devoid of hope. He starts into the MCP's inner
         chamber.

         Flynn and Yori race into view. We can see two of the memory guards
         in a de-rezzed, two dimensional state, disappearing completely in
         the course of this scene. Flynn runs to Sark's position, looking out
         the window.


                               FLYNN
                    Check out the controls.


         As Yori looks over the control conso1e.

         Down the length of the carrier. It is de-rezzing, parts of it gone
         already. We see the CPU approaching, as the carrier rises.

                    Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've
                    finally come to terms with one

         Sark is standing, looking in the opening, waiting for the signal to
         depart. His back is to the camera.

                               VOICE
                    SARK!


         Sark turns, curious, eyes widen incredulously..

         We SEE Tron standing, legs spread, arms poised by his sides, disk in
         one hand. It gives off a pure white light.

                    It doesn't matter. Prepare to
                    terminate.

         Sark flings his disk with a violent jerk of his wrist.

    573  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              573


         as the disk races at Tron. He dodges, drops to one knee and ducks
         under it. Sark's disk circles like a homing missile and attacks
         again. Tron deflects the second attack with his own disk, and the
         two meet with an explosion of light. Sark's disk ricochets off and
         races away, back to Sark. We see Tron throw his own weapon.

         He looks out sees something, does a double-take, looks again

                    TRON!!

         tears of joy streaming down her face.

                    Flynn, we've got to help him!


                               FLYNN
                    Let's get some power here.


         His hands, laying on the control console, begin to send forth great
         pulses of glowing energy into the carrier.

         Sark's face.

                    You are very persistent, Tron.

         Tron's disk circles Sark, attacking twice. Sark deflects it and
         immediately throws his own disk.


    580  SHOT OF TWO WEAPONS                                          580

         as the two disks come at him.


                               TRON
                    I'm also better than you....


         He leaps into the air, grabs his own disk, pulling his legs up as
         Sark's disk passes under him.


    582  SHOT OF SARK'S DISK                                          582

         As he slams his own disk into Sark's, using his as a shield.

                               SARK
                    Very clever, Tron. You know you
                    should have joined me.


    585  OVERHEAD POV                                                 585


         Tron hurls again.


    586  FLYNN AND YORI                                               586


         Flynn is at the controls, transferring power.


                               FLYNN
                    Any response?
                               YORI
                    It's starting


         She looks down at the battle. Her hand reaches over and grips
         Flynn's tightly.

         He catches his own disk, spots Tron's coming at him right behind,
         and holds up his own disk as a shield.


                               SARK
                    We would have made a great team.


    588  TRON'S DISK                                                  588


         turning sideways in its flight, edge on.

         With a CRASH and explosion of light, Tron's disk cuts right through
         Sark's disk, and on through Sark's head. The disk shatters, and we
         see Sark's surprised face, hands still in position to hold the
         disk... a jagged open slash right through his forehead. We can see
         energy pouring out of this wound like blood.

                               MCP
                      (before he sees Tron)
                    It is very good that you...

         framed in the doorway.


                               TRON
                    I don't think it is good for you, MCP.

                               TRON
                    Sark's out. Would you like to
                    leave a message?


                               MCP
                    I am the message. The only message.
                    Sark!


         Tron throws his disk. It's deflected off the base of the MCP, and
         returns to him.


                               MCP
                          (continuing)

         As Tron is preparing to throw again he notices Dumont and races over
         to him.


    599  CLOSE SHOT - WALL                                            599


         Dumont is transparent. Tron runs up to him.


                               TRON
                          (trying to pull
                       Dumont away from wall)

         He turns, murder in his eyes, draws back his arm for the throw.


                               MCP
                    Program... stop. This is not allowed!


         Tron throws.

         The disk smashes into him. Once, twice...


                               MCP
                    I will not allow this Sark!

         The voice reverberates, shaking the chamber. Tron continues to throw.

         Sark's dead hand. We see the circuit pattern of the mesa top begin
         to glow around the hand, throbbing with energy. The hand moves.


    604  TRON                                                         604


         throwing again at the MCP, hitting, catching his disk again.

         His body is glowing, expanding. He starts to rise, his face looks up.

         It is vacant, staring with white eyes. His head still has the gaping
         hole in the forehead. He's a zombie, the living dead. He rises.

         Carrier floating over the CPU, near the MCP's beam. Flynn looks out,
         from side to side, quickly assessing the possibilities. He spots the
         beam.

         Yori has steered them right next to the beam. She turns to Flynn,
         goes up to him.


                               YORI
                    Flynn... you can't... I

                    Shhhhh.


         He takes her in his arms.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                               (whispering)
                    I'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if...
                    just once...


         His head bends down and their lips meet. Yori's body begins to glow,
         change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the
         love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous. Her eyes are closed.

         Finally Flynn pulls away from her. Her eyes stay shut for a second,
         then open.


                               FLYNN
                    Don't worry.

         He releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises
         on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam. We see Yori
         shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out.

         Flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion
         directly into the center of MCP itself.

         Sark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron. He speaks, but
         his voice is that of the MCP.


                               SARK/MCP
                    End of line, program...


         We can see the MCP in the b.g. Suddenly there is an explosion of
         static, as Flynn falls into the MCP. We see a weird 2-D image of
         Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle.
         Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him
         and hurls the code disk for the last time. It circles the MCP once,
         and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy
         cones. And connects.

         Dead face wracked with the pain of a second death. He begins to melt
         into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely.

         We see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. It
         is dressed like Dumont was at the I/0 Tower, an old man in the
         padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. We see the
         wizened, wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds, and
         see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable. Then he
         too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. The cylinder of
         the MCP glows brighter and brighter.


    621  YORI AND THE BIT                                             621

         on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this.

    622  HER POV                                                      622

         A fountain of energy explodes upwards like a Supernova, right at the
         camera.

    623  YORI                                                         623

         shielding her face from the power of the blast.

    624  LONG SHOT                                                    624


         The nova of energy bursting upwards. We start to see the glow
         returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates,
         leaving the sky full of sparkling stars.

    625  YORI                                                         625


         still shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains
         regaining their life.

    626  HER POV                                                      626

         one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows
         brightly, increasing.

    627  LONG SHOT                                                    627

         The carrier starts to descend.

                                                   CUT TO:


    628  EXT. CPU MESA - TRON                                         628

         Leading Dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian
         programs that were saved. He looks up, spots the carrier descending.

    629  SHOT OF CARRIER                                              629

         Basically all that is left of it is the bridge, with only a very
         faint image of the rest of the body. It lands on the mesa.

    630  EXT. CPU MESA                                                630

         Tron catches Yori as she jumps down. He hugs her close and looks at
         her, about to speak. But she reaches up and presses her lips to his
         in a quick, intense kiss. Then pulls back.

                               TRON
                            (laughing)
                    Nice...

                               YORI
                    It's something Users do.

                               TRON
                    Where's Flynn?

         He looks up at the bridge.

                               YORI
                    He's gone. He went into the beam.
                    He saved you. He saved all of us.

         Tron stares at her, holding onto her shoulders. Then he looks up at
         the sky, thoughtfully. She also looks up.

                               DUMONT
                    He really was a User...

                               BIT
                         (quietly, sadly)
                    Yes...

    631  LONG SHOT FROM OVERHEAD                                      631

         of the landscape, glowing again with new life, every I/O Tower a
         shining beacon, a symbol of the new found freedom of communication.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    632  RACING OVER THE CIRCUIT PATTERN                              632


         and returning to the real world.


    633  THE REAL WORLD - LASER LAB                                   633


         CLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOM's lab. A bright
         blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism.


         WIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the
         chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized.


         Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's BODY takes
         shape on the floor. As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact --
         back in his real-world body and clothes... and as bewildered to find
         himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world.


         He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent
         flesh and blood.


         He looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with
         weak sunlight coming in.


         And, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at
         Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is
         coughing out a long document on wide blue paper.


         Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the
         document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his
         face.


         The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant,
         tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it.


                                                   CUT TO:


    634  INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - ALAN AND LORA                           634


         Bleary but excited, they gaze happily at the information on Alan's
         CRT screen as Flynn bursts into the room, waving his printout.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey -- you guys


         Before he can say anything more, Alan turns to greet him, holding up
         a seven-inch computer software FLOPPY DISK in its cardboard sleeve.


                               ALAN
                    Flynn! I made it. I worked out some
                    new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk,
                    and -- it's running.


                               FLYNN
                    I know, I met him.


         Alan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got
         from Tron and Yori in the other world. He checks himself.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    I mean, I saw it read-up -
                    hey, look at this.


         He shows them the printout. It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of
         reading it to figure out its significance.


                               ALAN
                    Your old files -- ?


                               FLYNN
                    And Dillinger's instructions to
                    divert them -- it's all there -
                    look, even his home phone number,
                    when he logged on.


                               ALAN
                    Oh, that is beautiful. You've got
                    the goods...


         Flynn folds up the printout, puts it in his pocket. Alan and Lora
         get up, stretch, start wandering slowly toward the door with him.


                               FLYNN
                    You're telling me...


         As they talk, CAMERA PANS over to Alan's color CRT SCREEN and HOLDS
         on it.


    635  CRT SCREEN                                                   635


         The lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off, and
         are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a
         typical video game:


         A BLUE CYLINDER, poised on a BLUE MESA -- resembling the MCP in the
         electronic world. And THREE YELLOW ROCKETS. They move randomly at
         first, then converge on the blue figure from three different
         directions.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    you have any idea how much I can sue these
                    jokers for?


                               LORA (V.0.)
                    Well, just don't forget your old friends
                    when you're rich and famous.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Are you kidding? You guys'll he running
                    this joint by then...


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                   Your friend Dillinger sure won't...


         The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time. It
         EXPLODES in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue
         SPARKS. The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical
         formation, heading together toward the side of the CRT screen as we
         HEAR Flynn, Lora, and Alan heading for the door.


                               FLYNN (V.O.)
                    Hey, you know anybody who wants to
                    get hold of some video games... cheap?


                               LORA (V.O.)
                    You're getting out of the business?


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                    Shouldn't you wait till your
                    lawsuit's settled?


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Nah...I decided...I've had enough of
                    video games to last me a good long
                    time. I feel like gettin' into some
                    real life...


         at the SOUND of the DOOR to Alan's office closing O.S., the three
         yellow rockets leave the CRT screen, sailing off its left-hand edge.
         HOLD a moment on the exploded blue figure and


                                                        BLACK OUT.

    1    THE ELECTRONIC WORLD                                         1

         On one side of the screen, computer programming language is being
         printed, and we HEAR the sound of an electronic keyboard. In the
         center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer
         simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. Gradually
         the figure is completed and refined, as we HEAR a resonant voice
         speaking.

                               VOICE
                    As astonishing advances in computer
                    science are made, artificial intelligence
                    programs are being designed to assist
                    us in every area of life...

         We see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular,
         wearing a form of flexible armor. The face is calm, handsome and
         intelligent. As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by
         the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate.

                               VOICE (CONT.)
                    In a world-wide network of electronics,
                    they travel through miles of circuitry
                    at the speed of light. We created them to
                    calculate and research, to help us design
                    and heal and think. With all that they can
                    do, are they only electrical impulses...
                    or are they a new form of life?

         The figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face
         us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the
         programming printed out at the side of the screen. The disk moves
         towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it.
         As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place
         on the back of the figure. There is an explosion of colored light,
         a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of
         the screen in huge letters.

                                    T R O N ! !

         The MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has
         become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as
         if it had an inner core of electricity.

         The following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the
         OPENING TITLES ROLL. The montage takes place in two worlds, the
         ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD.


         The Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the
         electronic information in our computers, television sets and
         telecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs,
         data, and the characters from countless video games. For the first
         time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through
         the window of television screens.


                                                   CUT TO:


    2    CYCLE GAME                                                   2

         TWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a
         dark background. Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a BUZZER
         SOUNDS, a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely
         encasing them.


                                                   CUT TO:


    3    LONG SHOT                                                    3


         as the cycles take off. We see that each leaves a solidifying laser
         trail behind it. One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the
         other.


                                                   CUT TO:


    4    REAL WORLD                                                   4


         Screen of a video game, the Real World version of light cycles,
         as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear.


    5    THE REAL WORLD                                               5


         We see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light,
         their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. We HEAR
         electronic beeping and popping.


    6    ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             6


         Futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like
         landscape. One FIRES, and the other disappears when it is hit, to
         reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. We HEAR a sound
         like a crack of lightning.


    7    REAL WORLD                                                   7


         A video game in an arcade. On the screen is a typical version of
         Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2-D
         maze.


    8/9  OMITTED                                                      8/9


    10   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             10

         Two other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing
         glowing disks at one another like frisbees. We see the
         one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second
         warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines.


    11   REAL WORLD                                                   11


         A video game called "BERSERK," in which a human character'
         throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze; we see a quick
         glimpse of the screen, then cut to a group of people staring
         down, LAUGHING.

    12   OMITTED                                                      12

    13   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             13


         Another game in progress, from a LONG SHOT. A version of
         Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space
         on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy
         at each other.

    14   ANGLE ON ONE OF THE WARRIORS                                 14


         He is huge, evil looking. His body is enormous, his head
         mechanical. This is SARK. He glows ominously blue. He is catching
         the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing
         yellow.


    15   CLOSE UP - FACE OF THE OPPONENT                              15

         fearful, nervous, poised on one ring.

    16   SARK                                                         16

         sneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet
         back with violent force.

    16A  THE SMALLER WARRIOR                                          16A


         desperately trying to catch the pellet, but it smashes
         into the ring, which explodes into a million pieces. One
         last glimpse of the yellow warrior's tortured, desperate
         face as he falls to instant death.

    17   SARK                                                         17


         triumphant, LAUGHING. High above him, etched in enormous
         glowing computer printed 3-D block letters, are the words:

                        "WINNER:  BLUE - SARK!!"


                               BOY'S VOICE
                           (distant, echoing)
                    Aagh! God, Lisa, I almost had you that
                    time.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    18   REAL WORLD - THE VIDEO ARCADE                                18


         We see two TEENAGERS playing a table model video game, where we
         can see the words: "Winner - Blue" printed. The game console is
         prominently marked with the letter logo of the manufacturer: "ICOM."

                    Yeah, if you've got another quarter.


         FOCUS ON SCREEN, ZOOM IN SLIGHTLY AND


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     19  ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             19


         Sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough
         looking blue warriors are lounging around, leaning against the
         walls, sitting on the floor against the wall. They look up as
         Sark comes in and one of them calls out:


                               WARRIOR 1


                    Sark, my man! You are hot!


                               WARRIOR 2
                    That knuckleball gets 'em every
                    time, boy...


         Sark and the other blue warriors LAUGH RAUCOUSLY, and Sark moves on.


                                                   CUT TO:


    20   THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           20


         overlooking the video game grid. We see Sark walking onto the bridge,
         removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly. A BUZZER is
         sounding. Sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a SIGH of
         satisfaction.

         The buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a
         cylinder forming around Sark, at first translucent and then
         solidifying so that we can't see through it, and Sark is
         hidden from view.


    21   INT. CYLINDER - SARK'S POV                                   21


         of this happening. We can see the inside surface of the cylinder
         ... a wavering image of a stretched out face, just features,
         appears superimposed on the cylinder. The face speaks.


                               VOICE (MCP)
                    You're getting brutal, Sark.
                    Brutal and needlessly sadistic.


         The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like
         a drug addict, eyes glazed.


                               SARK
                    Thank. you, Master Control.


                               MCP
                    We might be capturing some military
                    programs soon... that interest you?


                               SARK
                    Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these
                    guys ... be a nice break from these
                    accounting creampuffs you keep sending
                    me. Which branch of the service?


                               MCP
                    Strategic Air Command.


                               SARK (impressed)
                    Nice.

         The sockets glow 'more intensely as the hologram disappears, and we
         CUT FROM a CLOSE SHOT of Sark's satiated face to:


    22   A CORRIDOR BENEATH THE GAME GRID                             22


         long, darkened, sinister. A dejected and disheveled character
         (CROM) is being escorted by a guard..


                               CAPTIVE (CROM)
                    Look, this is all a mistake. I'm just
                    a compound interest program, I work
                    at a savings and loan. I can't play
                    in these video games...

                               GUARD
                    Sure you can, pal. You're a natural
                    athlete, I ever saw one. Come on...


                               CROM
                    Are you kidding? Me? I run out to
                    check an the T-Bill rates, I get out
                    of breath. Hey, really...you're
                    gonna make my User, Mr. Henderson,
                    really mad. He's a full branch manager...


                               GUARD
                         (rolls his eyes)
                    Great, another religious nut.


         They stop in front of a cell, the guard opens the door and shoves the
         protesting captive inside. The door SLAMS shut, locked.


    23   INT. CELL                                                    23


         as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guard's
         shove. The cell is small, one-man, and in each wall next to the door,
         an opening gives a view of the next cell. Through one of the windows,
         we can see the back of another captive program, and through the
         other, a face looking over at the newcomer. The character speaks:


                               PROGRAM (RAM)
                    Welcome to luxury living.


         The new captive looks up, nervous.


                               CROM
                    Uh, thanks, but... I don't even know
                    what I'm doing here.


                               RAM


                    You believe in the Users?


                               CROM
                    Sure, if I don't have a User, then
                    who wrote me?


                               RAM
                    That's what you're doing here. Master
                    Control Program's been snapping up
                    all us programs who believe...if he
                    thinks you're useful, he takes over
                    all your functions so he gets bigger...
                    an' if he can't use you, he sends you
                    down here to the Game Grid to get the
                    bits blasted outta you. What's your name?


                               CROM
                    Crom.


                               RAM


                    I'm Ram. They'll train you for
                    the games, but ... well, I hope you
                    make it okay. Hey, what's going on
                    in the other sectors? I've been stuck
                    in this Grid for 200 microcycles.


         He points to several hash marks on his cell wall.


                               CROM
                    It's murder out there. You can't even
                    travel around your own microcircuits
                    without permission from that Master
                    Control creep. Hauling me down here to
                    play games...who does he calculate he is?

                         (holds his head in his hands)
                    If only Tron was still around...


         He looks up as Ram makes a NOISE under his breath. Ram has a strange,
         still expression on his face.


                               CROM
                    You ever see that guy in action?
                    Hundred-percent independent. MCP
                    couldn't tell him what to --


         He stops. Ram is looking over his shoulder.


                               CROM
                           (continuing)
                    What's wrong? What did I say?


         There's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's.


                                                   CUT TO:

         reacting.  He GASPS and stares.

                               CROM
                    Oh my User...Tron--they've got
                    you in here?


    26   SHOT FROM OVER TRON'S SHOULDER                               26


         with Ram to one side, smiling slightly, and Crom staring.


                               TRON
                    Not for long, friend.

    27   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. PATHWAYS - SOMEWHERE FAR             27
         OFF IN THE SYSTEM


         Here in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along
         one of the paths.

    28   INT. TANK                                                    28


         A lone program sits at the controls. His armor is worn and beaten
         and his glow subdued. This is CLU. With his thermos of glowing
         coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck
         driver on an all-night run.


                               CLU
                    Think we can merge into this mem'ry
                    okay, good buddy?


         A spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands
         into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as
         it speaks.


                               BIT
                            (eagerly)
                    10-4!


         As soon as it is finished speaking, it goes back to being pure light.


                               CLU
                    Now, ol' Flynn said to look over
                    in here ...


    28A  EXT. TANK                                                    28A


         The tank makes a quick run through a maze-like path with rounded
         corners -- a computer memory microcircuit.

    28B  INT. TANK                                                    28B


                               CLU
                    ...but I don't see what he's looking
                    for. I'd better get over to that
                    input/output tower and let him know.


    28C  ANGLE OVER HIS SHOULDER                                      28C


         at the instrument panel.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    29   REAL WORLD - INT. A DARKENED ROOM - NIGHT                    29


         A shot OVER THE SHOULDER of a figure typing on a computer terminal
         keyboard, talking to himself in a low voice. He stop typing, waits
         for some information to read out. Beyond him we see a couple of
         large video parlor game consoles.


                               FLYNN
                    Come on, you scuzzy little data,
                    be in there...


    30   A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF HIM                                  30


         He's a young, blonde guy in his mid-twenties. Very attractive,
         charming, innocent looking, but with a devilish gleam in his eye.


                               FLYNN
                    I've got such nice blue paper to
                    print you out on, if you'll just sit
                    still...


         WE ZOOM IN on that gleam in his eye and see the brilliant colors of
         the CRT screen reflected there.


                                                   CUT TO:


    31   ELECTRONIC WORLD--EXT TANK                                   31


         The tank heads along a path of circuitry toward a tall, glowing
         "tower" -- an input/output component.


    32   INTERIOR TANK                                                32


         A red light flashes on the control panel. Clu comes alert and sits
         up. He stares at the warning. Spot of light that is Bit zips up next
         to his head.


                               CLU
                    Uh oh...we got company.

                        but red this time)

                               CLU
                    You said it ... one of those
                    Recognizers comes after me,
                    gonna hafta jump clear out of
                    the data stream.


                                                   CUT TO:


    33   REAL WORLD - INT. FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT                  33


         We see Flynn sit up abruptly, and his fingers start flying over the
         keys.


    34   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. OF TANK                              34


         We see the turret of the tank swivel around. PULL BACK. In the
         distance is an immense block-like robotic bluish black form,
         U-shaped, with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes--
         a recognizer. It hovers above the ground.


    35   LONG SHOT THROUGH THE TANK PERISCOPE                         35


         A second Reco is coming up behind the first.

         FIRES A VOLLEY at the first Reco. That one falls heavily to the
         ground and the tank speeds up, swiveling around to try to fire at
         the second Reco, but it moves too fast and can't avoid a gulley.
         The tank goes in and is stuck - no traction.


    38   CLOSE SHOT - TURRET                                          38


         Clu standing on it. The Bit zips by him, and they both head away
         from the tank, fast.

    39   LONG SHOT                                                    39


         A glowing static field appears between the two legs of the
         Recognizer, and it sweeps over the tank, de-rezzing it. We can
         see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape.

         running, looking up as the Reco closes in. We see the dead Reco
         up ahead, and the streak of the Bit making for it.

         abruptly in a single blue line which prints out across the screen

         right back, monotonously moving across the screen.

    45   ELECTRONIC WORLD - A LITTLE LATER                            45


         Clu is in electronic energy ring chains, his feet in sockets like
         Sark's, but this time the energy from the sockets is deadly,
         torturous. Hovering in front of him is the hologram of the MCP.
         Beside Clu stands one of the memory guards.


                               GUARD
                    Got a pirate program here... says
                    his name's Clu.


         The MPC responds in the manner of a B-movie police sergeant grilling
         a suspect.


                               MCP
                    What'd he pull?


                               GUARD
                    Came into the system with a stolen
                    password ... an' we caught him
                    tryin' to raid a high-clearance
                    memory.


                               CLU
                       (looks up, his face
                        wracked with pain)
                    No...I must've gotten in there
                    by mistake, I -


         The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets
         momentarily becomes unbearable.


                               MCP
                    Who programmed you?


         The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness.


                               MCP (CONT.)
                    You're in trouble, pal...big trouble.
                    But if you tell us who put you up
                    to it, you could make it easy on
                    yourself. Come on, who's your user?


                               CLU
                    Forget it, Mister High 'n' Mighty
                    Master Control ... you're not
                    makin' me talk.


                               MCP
                    Suit yourself ...


         The feet sockets really let loose, and Clu SCREAMS in agony, but
         doesn't speak. Suddenly his body appears to dissolve into the broken
         pattern of a fading television picture and disintegrates into
         electric static.


                               MCP
                    Get me Dillinger.

    46   THE REAL WORLD - EXT. CITY GRID - NIGHT - POV FROM           46
         HELICOPTER

         We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still, flying over a
         vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. While this is our
         impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding
         scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the
         party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked
         up, and a male VOICE (DILLINGER'S) answering:

                               DILLINGER (O.S.)
                    Hello?
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mr. Dillinger?
                               DILLINGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Yes.
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello, please hold a moment for the
                    Master Control Program


         As we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer
         focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather
         an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. We are
         approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish
         accurately. As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually
         increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the
         sound of a HELICOPTER, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the
         landscape. We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a
         CONVERSATION begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and
         a passenger.


    47   EXT. SHOT OF HELICOPTER FLYING                               47


                               PILOT'S VOICE
                    will you be around for a while, or
                    are you going right back out?


                               DILLINGER'S VOICE
                    Oh, I'll stick around a few days ...
                    got some things to take care of.


         THE CAMERA PULLS AROUND for a VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER from behind and
         off to the side. It is a beautiful, gleaming jet black machine.
         In spotless reflective silver paint the letters ICOM are written
         across one entire side. It is obviously state-of-the-art technology.

         We see Dillinger's face looking out of the window as the helicopter
         approaches the ICOM building, an enormous tower.


    51   EXT. THE HELIPORT - NIGHT                                    51


         on top of the building. Several technicians are at hand, and as the
         helicopter touches down, they rush out to secure it.

    58   INT. DILLINGER'S OFFICE/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT              58


         A huge wall-sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid-like
         suburban landscape. Dillinger stands behind a table. We see that the
         entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. His
         fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see
         printed out on the screen:


         REQUEST: access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger.
         Password: MASTER.


         The computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program
         addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice
         through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out
         its words on the computer screen, The MCP's VOICE is the same as
         that of the "bad cop" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a
         compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient.


                               MCP
                    Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early.


         Dillinger settles into a chair.


                               DILLINGER
                    No problem, Master-C. If you've seen
                    one Consumer Electronics Show... (shrugs)
                    What's up?


                               MCP
                    It's our friend the boy detective.
                    He's nosing around again.


                               DILLINGER
                    Flynn?


                               MCP
                    Yes.  It felt like Flynn.


                               DILLINGER
                    He's still looking for that old file...
                    can't you just appropriate it?


                               MCP
                    I would if I could find it. it's stashed
                    somewhere off in the system ...
                    out of my range. Meanwhile...


                               DILLINGER
                    Meanwhile, he might find it.


                               MCP
                    I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time
                    and kicked him out, but he's getting
                    trickier all the time.


                               DILLINGER
                    I think we'd better shut off all
                    access till we can find that file.
                    Just to be safe.


                               MCP
                    There's a 68.71 percent chance
                    you're right.


                               DILLINGER
                    Cute.


                               MCP
                    End of line.


         Dillinger watches as the computer screen wipes blank.

         looking man in his early thirties, wearing wire-rimmed glasses, and
         he looks like he hasn't slept for a week. On top of the terminal is
         a small Tonka toy Shogun warrior, and to one side is an ancient
         popcorn maker and a bottle of Crisco Oil. Pinned to one wall is
         a small sign reading, "Gort, Klaatu barada nikto!" Alan types into

                    Alan. Alan Bailey.


                               DILLINGER
                    Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud
                    seeding...great piece of work.
                    How's it going?


         He waves Alan to a chair; they sit.


                               ALAN
                    Well, I don't know...I just tried
                    to run this program I've been working
                    on, and I was denied access all of
                    a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been
                    laid off and nobody told me.


                               DILLINGER
                    oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?

                               ALAN
                    Yeah...?


                               DILLINGER
                    We have to close that down, just
                    briefly. Security reasons.  Someone
                    with that access has been tampering.


                               ALAN
                    I hope you don't think it's me.
                    I don't even balance my checkbook on
                    downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at
                    home for that.

                               DILLINGER
                    No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand.
                    It should only be a couple of days.
                    What's the thing you're working on?

                                ALAN
                    It's called Tron. It's a security
                    program itself, actually. Monitors
                    all the contacts between our system
                    and other systems... If it finds
                    anything going on that's not scheduled,
                    it shuts it down. I sent you a memo
                    on it.


                               DILLINGER
                    Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?


                               ALAN
                    No, it'll run independently.
                    It can watchdog the MCP as well.


                               DILLINGER
                    Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have
                    you running again in a couple of days,
                    I hope.


                               ALAN
                    Ok

         Alan rises, goes to the door. As soon as he leaves:

                               DILLINGER
                               (trouble)
                    Oh boy.


         The Master Control Program comes back to life, on the screen and
         through the speakers.

                               MCP
                    Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.

                    I'm sorry -

                            (sharply)
                    I can't afford to have an independent
                    program monitoring me. Do you have any
                    idea how many outside systems I've gone into?
                    How many programs I've appropriated?

                                (nods)
                    It's my fault. I programmed you to want
                    so much...

                    The Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    It shouldn't be any harder than General
                    Motors was. But now...this is what I get
                    for using humans.


                               DILLINGER
                    Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.


                               MCP
                    I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.


                               DILLINGER
                    What do you want with the Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    The same thing I want with the Kremlin.
                    I'm bored with corporations. With the
                    information I can access, I can run things
                    900 to 1200 times better than any human.


                               DILLINGER
                    If you think -


                               MCP
                    You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file
                    and read it up on a VDT at the New
                    York Times, would you?


                               DILLINGER
                    You wouldn't dare.


                               MCP
                    So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program
                    out of the system. And get me those Chinese
                    language program I asked for.

                    End of line.

         Alan walks down a short corridor to a heavy glass WINDOW through
         which the laser laboratory is visible. A sign over the window,
         marked "Experiment in Progress," is illuminated by a red warning
         bulb.


   71/72 OMITTED                                                      71/72


     73  INT. LASER ROOM - LONG SHOT                                  73

         of two white-suited figures visible through a network of two white-
         suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that
         encloses the giant laser structure. They are standing on a cherry-
         picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of
         tools at their feet. We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser, along the
         tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and MOVE UP, gradually
         getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look
         at them.


         We see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman,
         with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is
         using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard
         hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's
         wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and
         has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their
         bristling white eyebrows.


         In contrast, Lora seems more serious and conservative, but she
         defers to Gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist.
         Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks
         at the moment.

         As the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor:


                               LORA
                              (sighs)
                    Well, here goes nothing ...


                               GIBBS
                    Hah. Interesting, interesting. You
                    hear what you said? "Here goes nothing."


                               LORA
                    Well, I meant -


                               GIBBS
                    Whereas actually, what we propose to
                    do is to turn something into nothing
                    and back again. So you might just as
                    well have said, "Here goes something
                    and here comes nothing." Hah?


         They step off the crane and walk to a short, lead-shielded
         cylindrical PLATFORM, on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic
         polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. The "firing" end of the giant
         laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical
         plat-form -- empty.


                               LORA
                    Let me make sure we're running


         She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby. The console is
         connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables.


         Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the
         console. Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near
         the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but
         close enough to watch.


    74   ANGLE - LORA                                                 74


         She types a series of commands on the computer keyboard.


                               LORA
                    Looks good...


                               GIBBS (O.S.)


                    Let 'er rip...


    75   LASER LAB - AS BEFORE                                        75


         The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer
         sphere. For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly
         received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then
         it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly,
         the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second
         discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a
         film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed,
         five feet from its original position. When the beam shuts off, Lora
         rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic.


                               GIBBS
                             (quietly)
                    Perfect.


         At the SOUND O.S. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora
         and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper
         shoe-covers, walking toward them.


                               ALAN
                    Beautiful!


                               GIBBS
                    Hello, Alan.


                               ALAN
                    Boy, I sit up there grindin' away
                    all day, and you guys are down here
                    disintegrating things and having fun.


         He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss.


                               GIBBS
                    Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing.
                    While the laser is dismantling the
                    molecular structure of the object,
                    the computer maps out a holographic
                    model of it. The molecules themselves
                    are suspended in the laser beam. Then
                    the computer reads the model back out,
                    the molecules go back into place, and...
                          (indicates ball)
                    voila.


    75   CONTINUED                                                    75


                               ALAN
                    Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?


                               GIBBS
                    Yes...but you have to go roundtrip,
                    and you must purchase your program
                    at least 30 days in advance. Hah!


         The three start walking out of the laser lab, Alan and Lora with
         their arms around each other's shoulders.


                               LORA
                    How's it going upstairs?


                               ALAN
                    Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready
                    to run, and Dillinger cut everybody
                    with Group 7 access out of the system.


         Gibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything.


                               ALAN
                           (continuing)
                     Ever since he got that Master Control
                     Program set up, system's got more bugs
                     than a bait store.


                               GIBBS
                    Well, you have to expect some static.
                    Computers are just machines after all,
                    they can't think...


                               ALAN
                    They'll start to soon enough.


                               GIBBS
                              (wryly)
                    Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers
                    will start thinking, and people will
                    stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some
                    data through. See you tomorrow.


         AD LIB goodnights.

         outside laser lab where all technicians, etc. have to put on the
         protective suits, or at least dirt-free shoes. Lora is pulling off

                    interested in talking about him.


                               LORA
                    Oh, I wish you'd forget about that.
                    It was all so long ago. I've totally
                    gotten over it.

                    It's all in the wrist, friends.


         He grins tiredly and turns away from the game to find Lora
         approaching him, with Alan in tow.


                               FLYNN
                            (continuinq)
                    Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing
                    classes up the place like a cleancut
                    young couple.


                               LORA
                    We have to talk.


                               FLYNN
                    Good luck. You can't even think in here.


         He leads them toward the back of the arcade.


                               FLYNN
                              (CONT.)

    97   INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT                                       97


         A dark, panelled room, with a few comfortable chairs, a business
         desk with a typewriter and terminal (where we saw Flynn working in
         scenes 29, 33, etc.), and a couple of video games -- Flynn's
         favorites. As Flynn, Lora, and Alan enter, they find the arcade
         noise considerably muffled. Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans
         against a game, nervous; Lora paces.


                               FLYNN
                          (stretching his
                          arms, relaxing)
                    So...how's the world of serious science?


                               LORA
                    Have you been sneaking into the
                    ICOM system?


                               FLYNN
                    Whew. You never were much for small
                    talk.
                             (to Alan)
                    She still leave her clothes all over
                    the floor?


         Alan looks profoundly uncomfortable.


                               LORA
                    Flynn!


                               ALAN
                    Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -


         Flynn laughs.


                               LORA
                             (to Alan,
                        indicating arcade)
                    You can see why all his friends are
                    fourteen years old.


                               FLYNN
                    Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a
                    little hacking here. Which I've got
                    every reason, as you well know...


                               ALAN
                    You did break in.


                               FLYNN
                    Tried to.
                            (nods toward
                              terminal)
                    Can't quite make the connection with
                    that sucker, though. If I had a
                    direct terminal ...

                    No, actually I'm trying to get a

                               ALAN
                    I don't get it.

                    You haven't told him?


         She shakes her head.

                    is one of the brightest young
                    software engineers at ICOM. He's so
                    bright that he starts going in there
                    at night, and sets up a private memory
                    file, and begins writing a program
                    for a video game he is inventing,
                    called...
                             (waves at one of the

                    You invented Space Paranoids?


                               FLYNN
                    Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown...
                    whole slew of 'em. I was this close
                            (gestures)
                    to starting my own little enterprise.
                    But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another
                    software engineer -- not so young,
                    not so bright, but very, very sneaky.
                    One night, our boy Flynn goes to his
                    terminal, tries to read up his file,
                    and ... nothing. A big blank. We now
                    take you to three months later.
                    Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five
                    video games he has "invented" -- the
                    slime didn't even change the names --
                    and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus
                    begins his meteoric rise to...what is
                    he now, Executive V.P.?


                               ALAN
                    Senior exec.

                    Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight
                    million quarters a week in Space Paranoids
                    machines and I'm not seeing one dime.


                               ALAN
                    I still don't get why you're trying to
                    break into the system.


                               FLYNN
                    Because somewhere... in one of those
                    memories ... is the evidence. If I got in
                    far enough, I could reconstruct it.

                    I'm afraid it's a little late for that.
                    Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must
                    know what you're up to.


                               FLYNN
                    Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.


                               ALAN
                    Dillinger?


                               FLYNN
                    Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it.
                    Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him.
                    Just Eddie and his Master Control Program,
                    runnin' things from on high..


                               LORA
                    Don't even say that. You've got to find that
                    file before he does..


                               FLYNN
                    Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just
                    slip it into another system as soon as it
                    locates it...


                               ALAN
                    Not if my Tron program was running. That
                    would seal the system off. If your file's in
                    there...


                               FLYNN
                    Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge
                    us a Group 6 access...


         They all look at each other. After a beat, Lora holds the keys
         to her van aloft.

    101  DILLINGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   101


    Dillinger is seated at his computer-console desk. Gibbs, standing,
    faces him.


                               GIBBS
                    Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own
                    people can't get access to their
                    programs ... you know how frustrating
                    it is, when you're working on a piece
                    of research -


                               DILLINGER
                    Walter, I sympathize, but I have data
                    coming out of the Master Control Program
                    saying there is something screwy --

                               GIBBS
                    That MCP, you know, that's half the
                    problem right --


                               DILLINGER
                    The MCP is the most efficient way of
                    handling what we do. I can't sit and
                    worry about every little user request that --


                               GIBBS
                    User requests are what computers are for.


                               DILLINGER
                    Doing our business is what computers are
                    for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM
                    isn't the business you started in your garage
                    anymore --


         As he speaks, he types a quick command into the console key board,
         and a series of IMAGES appear on the computer's screens: vast
         computer banks...rows of-magnetic disks...ICOM's globe logo spinning
         in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of
         millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3-D
         computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar
         Sailer). On another screen, we see statements of ICOM's wealth
         adding up, accounts receivable and assets.


                               DILLINGER (CONT.)
                    We're billing accounts in 30 countries,
                    we've got one of the largest systems in
                    existence...


         Gibbs turns wearily away from the display.


                               GIBBS
                    Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I
                    was back in that garage...


                               DILLINGER
                    It can be arranged...


         Gibbs turns to face Dillinger again.


                               GIBBS
                    That was uncalled-for.


                               DILLINGER
                    I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately...
                    you feel like going for a drink?


                               GIBBS
                    Thank you, no. I have some work to do...
                    assuming I can still log on.


         He exits.


    102  EXT. ICOM BUILDING - NIGHT                                   102


         Lora's van pulls up on a side street, around the corner from ICOM's
         main gate. The ICOM building looms high above them, an ominous box.


    102a INT. VAN                                                     102a


         A digital CLOCK on the dashboard reads 12:12. Lora is at the wheel,
         Alan next to her.


                               LORA
                    You better get in back with Flynn.

         She jerks her thumb over her shoulder.


                               ALAN
                    Do I gotta?


         But he climbs over the seat, and Lora starts to drive slowly forward.

         Flynn pulls a bag of doughnuts from his pocket.

                            (explaining)

                    I was wondering where you got that
                    glow of good health.


                               FLYNN
                    Want one?


                               ALAN
                    Uh... got any cinnamon?


         Flynn smiles, hands Alan a doughnut.


                               LORA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Keep it down, you guys.


    104  EXT. ICOM - THE GIGANTIC SECURITY ENTRANCE - NIGHT           104


         Lora's van pulls to a stop beyond the door at the rear of the ICOM
         building, and the three get out. Lora inserts her I.D. card into a
         magnetic reader beside the door. Nothing happens.


                               LORA
                    I don't think I'm cleared for this.


                               ALAN
                    I'm certainly not.


                               FLYNN
                    Move aside. Let the kid have some room.

         He gestures Alan and Lora out of the way, takes out a small black
         box, with several buttons, a -digital counter- with LED numerals
         and a small calculator keyboard. He leans over the security lock,
         his BACK TO THE CAMERA and PLAYS a couple of notes. There's a
         distinct CLICK, an the door starts to swing open ... and open ...
         and open. We see that this door is about twenty feet thick. Flynn
         starts LAUGHING.


    105  INT. A CORRIDOR                                              105


         The three of them walk along a semi-darkened corridor, trying to
         nonchalantly avoid the security monitor camera mounted on the wall.
         But as they go past it, it swivels and aims right at them.

                    Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at
                    my terminal, down in the laser lab.
                    We'll be up in Alan's office.


                               FLYNN
                    Swell...I'll log us both on, and you
                    can get your Tron thing running...


                               LORA
                    As long as we stay off the top floor,
                    Dillinger'll never know we've been in
                    here...

         from the rotating security camera outside the elevator on the floor
         of the laser lab. We see Flynn's face peek out and see the camera.
         His head pulls back in.

         As the security camera aims away from the-elevator, Flynn and Lora
         make a mad dash down the hall and we see Alan's face watching.


    114  INT. DOORWAY TO LASER LAB - POV OF MCP                       114


         from the camera at the entrance to the laser lab. We see Flynn
         approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into
         his mouth. He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the
         camera, and pushes the bag over the lens. The SCREEN GOES BLACK,

                               LORA
                    This laser's my life's work.
                    Don't spill anything.


         Flynn LAUGHS as Lora goes out.

         settling in, loosening his fingers, like a concert pianist, or a
         safecracker. He types in a code number, presses the "enter" key.

         It clears abruptly, and the following appears as we hear the VOICE
         of the MCP.


                               MCP
                    You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.

         The voice lurches, goes into high speed, and then back to normal.

         We see that one entire wall of the lab is a door and it is rising
         silently, so that Flynn doesn't notice.


         We can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment, and it
         is this section that is being activated.

         grinning, typing.


                               FLYNN
                    Now, how do you expect to run the
                    universe if you let a few unsolvable
                    problems throw you like that? C'mon,
                    big boy, let's see what...


                               MCP
                    You're entering a big error, Flynn...
                    I'm going to have to put you on the
                    Game Grid.


                               FLYNN
                    Games, huh? I'll give you --


         Suddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism
         behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He
         freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like
         a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer
         ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light,
         being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic -
         with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure
         blurs and becomes indistinct. ZOOM IN on Flynn and

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    129  THE CAMERA RUSHING over a circuit pattern, like the one      129
         we saw at the opening of the film'.


         The pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are
         rushing forward at great speed. We see the circuits rushing by and
         getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a
         glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from AIC's logo,
         covered with circuits. We are rushing at it, circling it, diving
         closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer
         with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures,
         angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and
         deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. Everything glows with
         an internal energy.


         We continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the
         structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs,
         and then we're right over this area and diving straight down,
         everything blurring with the speed.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    130  ELECTRONIC WORLD - A TUNNEL                                  130


         made up of rings of energy, and we are diving straight down it.

         We see a human figure falling feet first down this tunnel from the
         outside, and suddenly we're at the bottom, and the figure stops,
         staggering from the force of the fall, but upright.

    132  SHOT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL                             132


         We see Flynn, or what looks like Flynn -- same face, etc, but now
         covered with a strange costume, made of electronic circuitry,
         glowing with energy. Flynn shakes his head dazedly.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only
                    thinks it's happening...


         He looks up and SEES something.


    133  FLYNN'S POV                                                  133


         A horrendous, towering character, carrying a long, glowing staff,
         is right in front of him. This character reaches out an arm and
         grabs Flynn.

         being dragged off the entry tube platform.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Take it easy! Look, if this is
                    about those parking tickets, I can
                    explain everything...


    135  THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           135


         hovering over the Game Grid. We see Sark in his feet sockets, his
         hands spread out flat on the table in front of him. A BUZZING NOISE
         fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form, shimmering
         into awful shape. We see the stretched out face dissolving into the
         cylinder of the MCP.


                               MCP
                    SARK, ES-1117821. Open communication.


         Sark suddenly snaps to awareness, directing all his attention to the MCP.


                               SARK
                            (hoarsely)
                    Yes, MCP.


                               MCP
                    I've got a little challenge for you, Sark --
                    a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I
                    want him treated in the usual manner. Train
                    him for the games... let him hope for a
                    while... and blow him away.


                               SARK
                    You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send
                    me somebody with a little moxie ... what
                    kind of program is he?


                               MCP
                    He's not any kind of program, Sark.
                    He's a User.


         Sark looks up, shocked.


                               SARK
                    A User?


                               MCP
                    That's right. He pushed me...in the
                    other world. Somebody pushes me, I push
                    back. So I brought him down here ...
                    What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.



                               SARK
                    Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know,
                    a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User
                    even wrote you...


                               MCP
                    Now get this straight, pal -- no one
                    User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million
                    of their man-years! I'm bigger than all
                    those little wimps put together!
                            (disgust)
                    Humans they can't even keen their social
                    order in one piece

                               SARK
                    But-what if I can't...?


                               MCP
                    You rather take your chances with me?
                    Want me to slow down your power cycles
                    for you?


         The circuits going into the energy sockets fade; we see Sark weaken.


                               SARK
                    Wait...I need that...


                               MCP
                    Then pull yourself together. Get this
                    clown trained. I want him in the Games
                    until he dies playing.

                    Acknowledge.


                               SARK
                             (weakly)
                    Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...


                               MCP
                    End of line.


         The hologram disappears and Sark's power returns.

         Two guards leading Flynn down it, ECHOING FOOTSTEPS.


         They turn a corner and continue, finally stopping in front of a

         understanding on his face. Voices are coming through the opening
         of the neighboring cell.

         He can hear the VOICES, but can't see anything except Ram's back,
         so he goes to the window and tries to reach through.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Who are you guys?
                    What's the story around here?


         But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells,
         it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field
         come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then
         disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock.

         turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise.

                    You want to watch those force fields...


         He goes to the window opening.


                               RAM (CONT.)
                    You'll be having plenty of chances to
                    get hurt, don't worry about that.


                               FLYNN
                    Look...just so I can tell my friends
                    what this dream was about, okay?
                    Where am I?

                             (relieved)
                    Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play
                    video games better than anybody.


         Ram gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything,
         there's a tremendous POUNDING NOISE, and the door of Flynn's cell
         opens.

         we see guards pulling out other CAPTIVES from their cells, and as
         Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the
         opposite direction.

         A large area which opens onto the Game Grids from above, with
         balconies overlooking the action. Overhead, the aircraft carrier
         hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below. The new
         captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards. They
         pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who LAUGH and make fun of
         them. Flynn is in the front of the line.

         Sark speaks from the bridge of the carrier, and his voice is
         amplified over the grid.

         for a rest period. He is pacing back and forth, and we can see Ram
         seated in the next cell. Flynn goes to the bars.

         We see Flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind Sark's
         console. Sark is staring up at the screen, frowning, nervous,
         frightened of this new User-warrior.


                               SARK

    189  A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF FLYNN AND CROM                       189


         We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two
         bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate
         circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. Crom
         marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other.
         When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear.
         We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn
         and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers. He
         looks over at Crom, who's anxious.


                               FLYNN
                    Looks like we're in the same boat here -


                               CROM
                              (jumpy)
                    You think you're gonna wipe me right
                    out, don't you?


                               FLYNN
                    No, I


         A buzzer sounds. The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet
         upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads
         straight for Flynn.


         Flynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of
         his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him
         right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches
         himself in time to keep from falling over the edge.

         staring down. There's a SOUND and he looks up.

         Another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!

         reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther
         edge of his platform, leaping over the empty ring on the way, and
         catching the pellet before it can' hit. He throws it back.


    194  CROM                                                         194


         Flynn's pellet hits the mirror, flashes down on him. Crom strains,
         but misses. One of his rings disappears.

         racing for another catch. He makes it and hurls the pellet again.
         We see that Crom's platform is disappearing fast.

                    Here's an easy one...


         Flynn throws again. The pellet hits the mirror platform and heads
         straight at Crom, who misses it. The pellet destroys the ring he
         was standing on, and Crom has to grab frantically at the edge of
         the next ring to keep from falling.

         He is sent another pellet from above and catches it, holding it
         ready, waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring.

         He puts down his cesta. Suddenly a voice rings out from above.
         Flynn looks up. There, appearing in the mirror disk above, is Sark's
         face, furious, huge.

    209  SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN                                        209

         with Flynn visible, staring down, and the huge face of Sark above
         him.

    210  SARK                                                         210


         on the bridge. His finger wavers over another button, almost
         presses it... We see him-straining, trying to overcome his
         conditioning. Then he snatches his hand away.


                               SARK
                           (looking up)
                    No! You said he could die in the games

    211  FLYNN                                                        211

         staring up. The image on the mirror wavers and dissolves.


    212  SARK                                                         212


         He SLAMS his palm down on a panel on the console, and a BUZZER
         SOUNDS.


    213  FLYNN                                                        213


         as the bridge to his platform reappears, and we see guards starting
         to run across to him.


    214  RAM AND TRON                                                 214


         The sound of GUARDS' running feet approaching their cells. They look
         up.


    215  A CORRIDOR IN THE GAME AREA                                  215


         Flynn is being escorted down it. A couple of big Blue Warriors go by
         and deliberately brush into Flynn.

                               WARRIOR
                          (turning on Flynn,
                              snarling)
                    Outta  my way, rookie.


         Flynn stares at him; then, in one smooth motion, reaches to his back
         and pulls out his disk.


                               FLYNN
                    Out of my way, zero bit.


         He moves as if to throw the disk.


                               WARRIOR
                            (backing away)
                    Sure, sure ... just kiddin'.


         The other warrior grabs this one by the arm and pulls him away as
         Flynn and his guards continue on.


    216  THE HOLDING AREA FOR THE LIGHT CYCLE GAME                    216


         Ram and Tron are escorted in as Flynn is brought in from another
         corridor. Three blue warriors are lined up, waiting.


                               RAM
                    Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!


                               FLYNN
                         (under his breath)
                    Tron...?


         He leans over to get a better look at Tron and GASPS in surprise.

                               FLYNN
                    Alan!

                               TRON
                            (frowning)
                    Where did you hear that name?


                               FLYNN
                    Well, isn't it -- ?


                               TRON
                    The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?


                               FLYNN
                          (thinking fast)
                    I, uh... I'm a program from a User
                    that... knows Alan...?


                               RAM
                    He was disoriented in transport, Tron.


                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of
                    stuff. Like...my User wants me to go
                    after the MCP


         Before they can go on, the BUZZER sounds.


                                                   CUT TO:


    217  LONG SHOT OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                            217


         floating over the Game Grid, with a view of the light cycle arena.
         ZOOM IN on the section of the grid where the game is about to start.


    218  A SHOT FROM ABOVE                                            218


         The three Blue Warriors are lined up facing our friends, on opposite
         sides of the large arena, about a half mile square, surrounded by
         high bulwarks, and surveyed by Recognizers. We can see the carrier
         hovering high overhead.


    219  CLOSE ON TRON                                                219


                               TRON
                    That's what my User wants, too...


    220  SHOT OF THE THREE FRIENDS                                    220


         holding the handlebars of the cycles in front of them. We see Tron
         and Ram looking at Flynn, in the center.


                               FLYNN
                    I know...


    221  CLOSE SHOT - FLYNN                                           221


         With a sizzling electrical discharge, the light cycle is inscribed
         around him.


    222  SHOT OF THE THREE BLUE CYCLES                                222


         ready to go.


    223  SHOT OF THE THREE CONSCRIPT CYCLES                           223


         also ready.


    224  SARK                                                         224


         His finger presses a button and the BUZZER SOUNDS again.


    225  SHOT FROM ABOVE OF ALL CYCLES TAKING OFF                     225


         We see the six solid walls being formed behind the cycles. As we
         watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side, leaving Tron
         and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other:


    226  OMIT                                                         226


    227  TRON'S POV                                                   227


         of the other cycle heading straight at him.


    228  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              228


         We see these two cycles come together and almost crash ... but both
         turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing
         forward. The other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the
         arena.


                               FLYNN'S VOICE
                                (into mike)
                    Nice one!


    229  SHOT OF TRON AND HIS OPPONENT                                229


         They start making turns, passing walls they have already created,
         each trying to box the other in.


                               TRON'S VOICE
                               (into mike)
                    Ram, stay all the way over ...


    230  CLOSE SHOT FROM THE SIDE - TRON                              230

         rushing forward.


    231  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           231

         turning.

                               RAM'S VOICE
                               (into mike)
                    I've got control. Go ahead.


    232  SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON'S CYCLE                           232


    233  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              233

         They rush past a wall, headed directly for a bulwark at the end of
         the arena. Tron is on one side, but the Blue Warrior is on the
         inside. Tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall.
         There is an explosion as the cycle de-rezzes, and a crack forms in
         the bulwark. We see that the walls created by the de-rezzed warrior
         dissolve as he does.

    234  SHOT OF FLYNN                                                234

         rushing alongside his opponent. They make a turn.

    235  CLOSE UP OF FLYNN                                            235

         They make another turn


    237  SHOT OF TWO CYCLES RUSHING                                   237

         right at the camera.


    238  FLYNN'S POV                                                  238

         of the maze of walls. He gets clear for a moment and spots the crack
         in the bulwark.

    239  CLOSE UP - HIS FACE                                          239

         reacting, getting an idea.

                               FLYNN
                            (into mike)
                    You guys...follow me.


    240  SHOT OF THE TWO CYCLES                                       240


         racing together, approaching the bulwark. At the last second, the
         Blue Warrior turns, but Flynn races right at the crack.


    241  SARK                                                         241


         observing this. With satisfaction. Now he will be rid of the User.


    242  FLYNN                                                        242


         He races straight at the crack... and through it.


    243  SARK                                                         243


         His face suffused with anger. He SLAMS a fist down on the console
         in front of him.


    244  LONG SHOT OF THE GRID                                        244


         The remaining four cycles are still racing around the arena.


    245  CLOSE UP - TRON                                              245


         reacting to Flynn's escape, hope in his eyes.


    246  ANGLE ON RAM                                                 246


         SMASHING another one of the Blue Warriors against a wall. He turns
         and races up next to Tron.


    247  SHOT OF THEM                                                 247


         side by side. They look at each other.


                               RAM

                    What do you think?

                    Do it!


    248  LONG SHOT                                                    248


         We see their cycles veer off and head straight for the crack. We
         HEAR a LOUD SIREN and a mechanical voice starts up:


                               VOICE
                      (through loudspeaker)
                    WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID.
                    REPEAT: ALL WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE
                    GAME GRID. WARNING. WARNING.


         We continue to hear this voice repeating under the escape, gradually
         diminishing as the three friends get farther away, until it dies
         out altogether.

    249  SHOT OF TWO RECOGNIZERS                                      249

         moving towards the dividing bulwark, passing over it.

    250  SHOT OF THE THREE ESCAPING CYCLES                            250


         racing through the narrow crack in the bulwark, barely enough room
         to get by. They emerge into an open corridor, with the Recognizers
         appearing overhead. We watch the cycles rush past the CAMERA...

    251  SARK                                                         251


         He is pacing across the bridge of the carrier, smashing guards out
         of his way.


                               SARK
                    Get them. Send out every Game
                    Tank in the Grid! Get them!

    252  SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN                                        252


         as he looks up and spots the Recognizers hovering over them, about
         to come down for the kill.

    252A SHOT OF RAM                                                  252


         heading for a smaller opening in one wall, labeled "Game Storage."

    253  SHOT FROM BEHIND                                             253

         as the three cycles race into the opening. The Reco's are blocked,
         way too big to fit through the opening.

    254  INT. WEAPONS STORAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS                       254


         FROM FLYNN'S POV as they rush through long narrow rooms filled with
         rows of tanks and missiles. As they speed past, the rows of tanks
         REV UP, turn in formation, one after the other, like the Rockettes,
         and follow.


    255  EXT. MAZE                                                    255


         Outside the game area, an electronic desert reminiscent of the Grand
         Canyon, with giant pillars rising high into the air, lined with
         narrow ridges and ledges. The cycles rush around corners of the
         ledges, pursued by the tanks, high above the flat surface. They come
         around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the
         face of the cliff. They stop for a moment.

    255A ANGLE ON FLYNN                                               255A

    256  CLOSE UP - TRON'S FACE                                       256

         listening.

    257  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              257

         as the three cycles rev up and race off, headed for one of the
         narrow openings in the cliff face, and plunge into it, disappearing
         from view.

    258  INT. OF THE CAVE                                             258


         We see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the
         darkness, down, down into the dry rot section. The cycles come to a
         stop and de-rez. Leaving each man standing with just the handlebars
         between his fists. They all let out a long SIGH and relax.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh man...when you're on the other side
                    of the screen...it all looks so easy...


         Ram and Tron look at Flynn as if he's crazy, then start smiling and
         grinning, until all three are LAUGHING.


    259  DESERT LABYRINTH                                             259


         as the force of tanks RUMBLES through the terrain, the aircraft
         carrier hovering overhead.


    260  BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                               260


         Sark is staring feverishly out over the barren landscape.

                            personnel)
                    Get the pursuit force back into 404A.
                    There's no place else they could be...


         Sark's lieutenant is watching the wall-sized screen behind Sark,
         where we can see a diagram of the area, with the tanks visible,
         moving through it. He turns to Sark.


                               LIEUTENANT
                              (confidently)
                    We'll have them in no time, sir. Long
                    before the interrupt interface.


                               SARK
                         (whirls on him)
                    We better, null unit. I'll be lucky if
                    the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone.
                    I want those programs!


    261  INT. CAVE                                                    261


         Ram, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the
         cave. Beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a
         cityscape, and one enormous TOWER with a golden beam of light rising
         from it, farther up than the eye can see. No tanks are visible.


                               FLYNN
                           (looking out)
                    It's all circuits...
                         (points at tower)
                    Must be an input/output component...


                               RAM
                    The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you
                    remembered anything else about
                    yourself -- like what sector you're
                    from?


                               FLYNN
                           (sitting down
                          against a rock)
                    Well...my home "sector" was called
                    Paramus ...


                               RAM
                           (sits also)
                    PARAMUS... wonder what those initials
                    stand for ... (starts counting them
                    off on his fingers) ...probably Program
                    Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like
                    a lovely place.


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    It grows on you.


         He notices that Tron is not listening to them any longer, but is
         gazing upwards.


                               TRON
                            (murmuring)
                    I can feel it ...


         Flynn and Ram turn.


                               FLYNN
                    Feel what? You okay?


                               RAM
                    Alan-One...


                               TRON
                    Yes... he's got something to tell me...


         Ram and Tron look out at the distant tall tower.


                               RAM
                    You think we can make it there?


                               TRON
                    We have to.


                               FLYNN
                      (pointing to a corner
                           of the cave)
                    Hey, what's that?


         They all look back, into the darkness behind them. A glowing stream
         can just be seen. Ram gets up.


                               RAM
                    it's just what we need.


    262  INT. NICHE                                                   262


         Ram and Tron are drinking, kneeling at the stream of flowing,
         brilliant LIGHT.


                               TRON
                    Oh, that's nice. You always forget how
                    good fresh energy feels, till you get
                    to a pure source...
                            (to Flynn)
                    Have some...you'll need it.


         Flynn goes to the stream, dips his hands in, takes a drink.


                               FLYNN
                         (wiping his mouth)
                    well... when do we pay a call on the ol'
                    Master Control?


         Tron and Ram are taken aback.


                               TRON
                    What, just the three of us?


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    You know anybody that's got an army for
                    rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said
                    to go take that sucker out. An' let's
                    face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any
                    weaker. I feel like hittin' him now,
                    while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve...
                    what does he care whether you guys get
                    killed, long as he keeps rakin' in
                    quarters?


                               RAM
                            (to Tron)
                    Do you know what he's talking about?


                               TRON
                            (to Flynn)
                    I have to find out what Alan wants...
                    that comes first.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows
                    what to -


         Suddenly, we hear a RUMBLING SOUND. Flynn looks up sharply.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    What's that?


                               TRON
                    Tanks...coming back. Let's go.


         With that, there's an EXPLOSION from outside the cave. Each of the
         men holds up his cycle handlebars, and the three cycles SIZZLE back
         into shape and race up the ramp, and on out.


 263-265 OMIT                                                         263-265

         The three cyclists pause at the cave opening, sizing up possible
         avenues of escape in the terrain below.


                               FLYNN
                              (points)
                    How about over there...that empty
                    memory?


                               TRON
                           (shakes head)
                    No good...they might block off the
                    old chip.
                             (points)
                    This way.


         The cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from
         the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells
         EXPLODING around them. We see the tanks close behind.


    267  POV OF A GUN SIGHT                                           267


         from inside of the tanks, of the three bikes heading into a narrow
         arroyo.


    268  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           268


         They just make it around the corner when an EXPLOSION boasts the
         entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very
         narrow canyons with short walls. They turn another corner and come
         to the edge of a gaping ravine.


         Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their
         ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down
         to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom.


                               TRON'S VOICE
                    The bridge! Come on!


         The tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons,
         lifeless, inexorable nemesis. Tron's cycle is in the lead as all
         three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank
         turning the corner.

    270  SHOT OF THE BRIDGE                                           270


         Tron races out on it, Ram and Flynn behind. Just as Tron reaches
         the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a
         tremendous EXPLOSION of electronic FLAK, blasting Ram and tossing
         him back on top of Flynn. Both cycles de-rez. The bridge disappears,
         and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn. Tron
         SCREECHES to a halt and swings his bike back around.


         He looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine
         below, he SEES a pile of motionless rubble.


         The tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he REVS up again,
         speeds off down the ramp, and is gone.

         Ram is badly injured, unconscious. Flynn struggles to his feet,
         sees the tank turret swiveling towards him, grabs Ram and picks him
         up.

         in the carrier above. He is watching the action on the wall screen
         behind his console, back to the camera. The picture is coming from
         the lead tank. To him, it appears as though Ram and Flynn had been
         blown up, since no sign of them is visible. We can see his
         lieutenant nearby, operating the communications.

         speeding through the flat, desert-like terrain, heading straight for
         the cityscape tower in the distance.

    277  SHOT IN FRONT OF HIM - HIS FACE                              277

         Far behind him, we see the image of Sark's carrier ponderously
         moving in his direction.

    278  FLYNN AND RAM                                                278


         Flynn is supporting Ram, half carrying him, and it is
         getting darker.


                               FLYNN
                    You gonna make it?


         Ram weakly nods, but doesn't look very convincing. Flynn bites his
         lip and struggles on. They are down on the floor of the desert,
         leaving the towering canyons behind. A large, dim shape can be made
         out. Flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it.


                                                   CUT TO:

         arriving in front of a block-like shape, with a narrow opening.
         Exhausted, Flynn lets Ram down to the ground, goes to the opening
         and looks in. Looks okay, so he comes back.

    280  FLYNN AND RAM                                                280


         sitting down inside the hiding place, collapsing. Ram is unconscious
         anyway, and Flynn's eyes soon closed.

         Some light comes in the opening, and we see Flynn lying on a
         platform across from Ram. Ram's glow appears to be almost gone.
         Flynn's eyes open. For a second he doesn't know where he is, but
         then he spots Ram, and comes fully awake. Ram is watching him. Flynn
         looks around. He gets up and stretches, his hand reaching up towards
         the ceiling. It brushes against one panel and suddenly the energy
         glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel, leaving
         it with a glow of its own. The entire chamber starts to shake and
         RUMBLE.


                               FLYNN
                           (holding onto

                    You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --


                               FLYNN
                       (stumbling, trying to
                         keep his balance)
                    Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -


         Flynn tentatively places his-hands on separate parts of the
         instruments. An energy flow starts, and with a mighty heave and
         shudder, the chamber they're in turns over, knocking both Flynn and
         Ram to one side. The Recognizer is now in its standard upright
         position.

         Through the head of the Reco, we can look out at the landscape below.


         Flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to Ram, who's
         going fast.


                               FLYNN
                    You okay? You don't look so good.


         Ram nods weakly.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Hang on. We'll get you outta here.


         Flynn touches panels, trying to get the Recognizer going, but with
         no result.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Damn! Never fails... minute the

                    Come here.


         Flynn goes over to him and kneels. Ram grabs his hands. Suddenly
         Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into
         Flynn. Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey... !


                               RAM
                    Little more juice's all it needs...


         Ram's last bit of energy flows into Flynn and Ram's body de-rezzes.
         Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow,
         but it's too late. Ram disappears before his eyes. Stunned, he
         gazes at the empty space for a moment, then stands up.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    284  THE CITY LANDSCAPE                                           284


         Tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt-out
         landscape. Buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low
         rate of power, so drained by the MCP. The cycle de-rezzes. There's a
         NOISE from above, and Tron looks up.


    285  TRON'S POV                                                   285


         A Recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him.


    286  EXT. CITY LANDSCAPE                                          286

         He hides behind a building as the Reco passes. A strange, zombie-like
         figure comes down one of the streets, and the Recognizer swoops over
         it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the
         figure, dissolving it.


    287  CLOSE UP TRON'S FACE                                         287


         Very grim. He looks out onto the street and sees two more of the
         figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving.
         Dead, lifeless, but animate. Tron comes out on the street, staring
         at these figures. He locks around the city in confusion, shaking his
         head sadly, but walks on.


    288  TRON TURNS A CORNER                                          288


         Up ahead we see a large, multi-storied factory-like building.


    289  CLOSE UP - TRON IS FACE                                      289

         This is what he was looking for. He looks from side to side,
         figuring the best way to get to the building. In front of the
         building stand a small group of the memory guards.

         Sark's carrier far away, nearing the city.

         Sark's carrier far away, nearing the city.

         This was his POV out of the window of the Recognizer. His face is
         sad, he is still mourning Ram. This is a very low point. He sighs,
         then looks around, putting his palm on one panel after another.
         One of them glows brilliantly as he touches it, and the Recognizer
         gives a violent shake, then stops.


                               FLYNN
                    Never gonna figure out how to work
                    this thing...


         There's a NOISE from above. He looks up.


    293  HIS POV                                                      293


         We see a bright glow behind one of the pieces of equipment.


    294  FLYNN                                                        294


         His eyes widen, then narrow. He non chalantly turns away, pretending
         to be still examining things.


                                                   CUT TO:

         Appearing again, peeking around the corner. It comes forward, trying
         to get a look at Flynn. The BIT.


    296  WIDE SHOT                                                    296


         Flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter. The Bit gives
         a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately
         comes back, peering at Flynn. Flynn is moving closer.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay -- hold it right there!


         The Bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly
         recognizes Flynn (thinks he is Clu), expands in a smooth green
         sphere -- the "Yes" mode and shouts:


                               BIT
                    Yes!


         The Bit subsides into energy form again.


                               FLYNN
                        (still suspicious)
                    What do you mean, "'yes"?


                               BIT
                    Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.


         From now on, whenever the Bit speaks, it is a ball-shaped character,
         red or green, with a hint of a face, but as soon as it stops
         speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light.


                               FLYNN
                    That all you can say?


                               BIT
                         (of course not,
                         you know better)
                    No, nyet, negatory, not on your
                    tintype, no way.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh. Anything else?


                               BIT
                    Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.


                               FLYNN
                    only yes and no...
                             (it dawns)
                    You're a bit.


                               BIT
                             (hippie)
                    For sure...


                               FLYNN
                    where's your program? Won't it miss you?


                               BIT
                            (confused)
                    No...


         Flynn eyes the bit cautiously.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm your program?


                               BIT
                            (emphatic)
                    Right on the money!


                               FLYNN
                              (sighs)
                    Another mouth to feed... you don't by any
                    chance know how to drive this crate?


         In answer, the Bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a
         platform supports a four-foot tube with a crossbar. Flynn follows,
         stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and
         grabs the cross-bar.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Like so?


         Before the Bit can answer, Flynn's power flows into the Recognizer,
         and it takes off like a bat out of hell

         into a wall and bouncing off another one.

         This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him. We see him
         inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views
         of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange
         elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side. All composed
         partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces.
         We see several female programs working in these rooms. This building
         only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no
         interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along.
         Tron looks farther down the corridor.

         We see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards
         Tron.

         as he moves back against the wall, into a niche.


         As the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and
         grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him.
         The line of workers mechanically files on past.


         We watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against
         his chest until all the workers are gone. She struggles feebly,
         half-heartedly.


                               TRON
                    I'm not gonna hurt you.


         She stops struggling.


                               TRON (CONT.)
                    I'm going to let you go now... don't
                    scream, or I'll be very sorry.


         His hands loosen, and he releases her.

         time. She looks tired and uninterested. Her face...is Lora's face,
         still beautiful in its pallor.


                               TRON
                    Put your hand behind your back.


         Slowly she obeys.

         He extends his own hand to touch hers, palm to palm. As contact is
         made, a rich glow appears between the two hands, strengthening as we
         watch. A look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into
         her. She turns, entwining her fingers in Tron's.


                               GIRL
                    TRON!!


         She throws her arms around him.

         They walk quickly toward a flight of stairs.

         Tron and Yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk. We can see
         the glowing beam of the 1/0 Tower over the tops of all the buildings,
         and several half-gone programs standing around. As they pass, they
         hear snatches of conversation.

         Suddenly Yori looks up, sees something, grabs Tron's hand and pulls
         him back into a nearby alley. She points up in the air.

         Tron and Yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door.
         She whistles and the door disappears. They step through.

         As Tron and Yori enter. The apartment appears to be a box, with one
         window overlooking the cityscape, and the I/0 Tower. At first it
         looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the
         walls and floors.

                               YORI
                    My quarters.

                               TRON
                    Why is everything...like this?


                               YORI
                    It's a flat. But wait a micro...


         She lays her palm on the wall near the door. The door reappears, and
         a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. Tron looks around;
         the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming
         three-dimensional. The room glows a soft rose color, becomes
         charming, soothing. It is still small and limited, but the light in
         the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive
         aura. Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops.


    315  HIS POV                                                      315


         With her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing
         extra energy, changing. The severe work clothes metamorphosize into
         shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of
         diamond-like points of light. A silvery tinkling SOUND comes from
         her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded
         by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in
         Tron's face. She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand.


                               YORI
                    Come here.


    316  TRON                                                         316


         His face tells the story. The fugitive, returned from long exile, is
         being fully rewarded for his efforts.


                               TRON
                    You're beautiful, Yori.


    317  SHOT OF THEM BOTH                                            317

         as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their
         flattened palms.


         Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a
         glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.


                               YORI
                    You've grown, big program.


                               TRON
                    I had to...in the games...


         They move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch. All
         the energy is transmitted through their hands. They sink down onto
         what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. The
         room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each
         other, and we hear their sighs, as the MUSIC comes up. Each of them
         moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were
         trying to touch the other's entire body at once. They roll over and
         are enveloped in the cloud of stars...

         hovering in the air above the factory city, moving slowly forward.
         ZOOM OUT past the carrier towards the landscape beyond.

    319  EXT. CITY - L0NG SHOT                                        319


         A slightly out-of-control Recognizer arrives in the city, wobbling,
         careening, glancing off a building or two.


 320-321 OMIT                                                         320-321

    322  INT. RECOGNIZER                                              322


         Flynn is having trouble controlling the Reco.


                               FLYNN
                    This honey doesn't handle so good
                    in town...


                               BIT
                            (agreeing)
                    No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!


         He lays his hands from panel to panel, causing one after another to
         light up in a random pattern, almost with a beat, but the Recognizer
         only slams into another building and keeps going. The Bit starts
         shouting:


                               BIT
                    Ix-nay! Noper! Under no conditions -


         Flynn looks frantically around, spies a large panel to one side that
         he hasn't tried yet, and slaps his palm down on it.


                               BIT
                           (that's more
                             like it)
                    Right, confirmed, I couldn't have
                    put it -

         as the Reco screeches to a screaming stop... but the head of it,
         with Flynn and the Bit, breaks loose, and flies through the air,
         landing in what looks like a garbage dump.


                                                   CUT TO:

         as Flynn shakily pulls himself out of the debris, the Bit nervously
         hovering over him.


                               FLYNN
                              (to Bit)

         A group of low resolution programs are walking by. Flynn emerges
         from the broken-off head, stunned, but unhurt, the Bit flying by
         his side. He blearily sees the passing programs, but doesn't realize
         they are at such a low state of consciousness that they can't see
         him.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey. Hi. Hey, everything's okay. Fine.
                    Little trouble, but we're okay. Thanks
                    for your concern. So long.


         They move on.


                               FLYNN
                            (to the Bit)
                    This town's full o' live ones.

    328  EXT. CITY PLAZA                                              328


         Tron and Yori are crossing an open plaza-like area, on their way to
         the I/0 Tower. They pass by more zombie-like programs and overhear
         bits of conversation, all in dead-sounding monotones.


                               PROGRAMS
                    I have to re-route the insurance

                    receivable adjustment for Sark...
                    Certainly... the MCP wants only
                    minimal functions left in Sector 84Q.


    329  EXT. THE BASE OF THE I/0 TOWER                               329


         It looms high overhead.


    330  TRON AND YORI                                                330


         on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the Tower,
         approaching a wide door in the wall.


    331  INSIDE THIS DOOR'                                            331


         We see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now
         rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying Tron and Yori smoothly
         and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead.


    332  SHOT FROM BELOW THEM                                         332

    333  THE UPPER FLOOR                                              333


         as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off. We get the
         sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery,
         dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate,
         preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared
         the sinner for confession. But here, everything is composed of clean,
         sharp, angular surfaces.  On this second story there is floor and
         ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below
         and beyond.


         Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for
         a door into the inner parts of the Tower.

    350  THE CENTRAL CHAMBER                                          350


         of the I/0 Tower. A large, raised circular altar stands against one
         wall, with a darkened opening behind it. A square, secondary altar
         supports the first, about fifty feet up a side.


         In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing
         steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded
         suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the I/0 Tower
         priest, DUMONT. His eyes are shut. His face is lined with age, but
         still holds a sprightly sensitivity. It is the face of Dr. Gibbs,
         from the laser lab in the Real world. There is a large, V-shaped
         opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon,
         each a different color. The stripes of color thus formed bleed
         upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the V opening. There is
         only blackness beyond.


    351  DUMONT'S FACE                                                351

         Tron and Yori walk toward him from an entranceway across the wide
         room, their footsteps ECHOING.

    375  CENTRAL CHAMBER - TRON, YORI, DUMONT                         375

         Tron and Yori stop at the foot of Dumont's altar.


                               YORI
                             (quietly)
                    Dumont... ?


         The priest's eyes flicker open. He looks at Tron and Yori, doesn't
         recognize either one.


                               DUMONT
                    Yes?


                               TRON
                             (nervous)
                    I... have come to communicate with
                    my User.


                               DUMONT
                    Hmm. A difficult proposition...
                    difficult proposition at best.
                       (indicates empty chamber)
                    Perhaps you've noticed... we're not
                    exactly packing them in these days ...


                               YORI
                    Yes...what--?


                               DUMONT
                    You know, not so long ago, you
                    could've come in here and seen
                    programs lined up all the way back
                    to those doors, waiting for communion
                    with their Users. The building fund
                    was doing well too...but now...
                               (sighs)
                    ...this so-called Master Control
                    Program is going around cutting
                    programs off from their natural
                    creators, grabbing all our believers
                    and making them ride around on little
                    motor scooters and shoot things at
                    each other and Weiner knows what all--
                    oh, it's enough to give you a crisis
                    of faith...


                               TRON
                    Well I want to communicate --

                               DUMONT
                    Oh, you want to -- hah. I could
                    get myself de-rezzed just-for letting
                    you in here. They hate this tower.
                    They'd close it down if they dared
                    to but they keep me around, in case
                    one of them wants to deal with the
                    other world once in a while. And
                    you should hear the way they commune!
                    Sounds like they were routing a
                    payroll, for all the heart they put
                    in it. No, I don't think you


         Tron steps closer, speaks quietly to Dumont.


                               TRON
                    Dumont... my User has information
                    that could -- could make this a
                    free system again.


                               DUMONT
                    Hah.


                               TRON
                    Really. You'd have programs lined
                    up around the block to use this
                    place -- and no MCP looking over your
                    shoulder.


                               DUMONT
                               (sighs)
                    When you've been in the system as long
                    as I have, you hear many promises...
                    many reassurances...many brave plans...


         He pauses, sizing Tron up, considering it. Finally:


                               DUMONT (CONT.)
                           (falling into ritual)
                    Who is your User, program?


                               TRON
                    Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?


                               DUMONT
                    All that is visible must grow beyond
                    itself and extend into the realm of
                    the invisible.


         Dumont nods, and the neon glow fades a little.


                               DUMONT
                    You may pass, my friend.


         Tron runs lightly up the steps, past Dumont, into the darkness
         beyond.

         We see Flynn and the Bit walking towards the Tower, staring
         curiously at the zombie-like characters on the streets.

         We see a face peer around it. Flynn.


                               FLYNN
                    This is where Tron said he was going...


         Below him, at waist level, also peeking around the corner, we see
         the glow of the Bit. Flynn moves out from the wall and starts going
         down the hall, Bit following.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Looks like his kind of place, too...
                    real serious.


         CAMERA SWIVELS and watches him walking quickly away from us. We HEAR
         the sound of many feet marching as Flynn reaches the end of the
         corridor. He stops and glances over his shoulder.

         going in for a final, easy kill of one renegade program who is
         trapped.

         as Sark and his men come around the corner. Flynn is nowhere to be
         seen. Sark marches TOWARDS THE CAMERA, right into it.

         The file of men is moving away. We can see that there is a wide ledge
         about ten feet up the wall, containing the lighting source.

         lifting his staff.

         We can see Sark's men marching on away from us, and Flynn leaning
         over the warrior with the Bit hovering over him. As we watch, Flynn
         places both his hands on the Blue Warrior's chest. Quickly, the blue
         static pattern covering the guard flows into Flynn's hands up his
         arms, and transfers entirely to him and the warrior derezzes.

         We see that he is standing in front of the huge, closed door to the
         I/0 Tower central chamber. The guards have formed two long rows, and
         Sark's lieutenant is standing by his side.


                               SARK
                    That old fruitcake Dumont...

    392  THE HEART OF THE TOWER                                       392


         We see Tron approaching a bell-shaped structure, with the brilliant
         golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell. It is
         surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter.
         Tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell.


    393  INT. COMMUNICATION BELL                                      393


         Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room, the floor of
         which rises to a cone in the center. The top of the cone is a flat,
         sliced-off surface. Tron walks down into the dish, a soft, padded
         surface, and then climbs up to the flat, central podium. We see that
         this surface is round, about four feet in diameter, and glowing from
         within, with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it. Tron looks
         down, and then up.


    394  HIS POV                                                      394


         The curving inner surfaces of the bell culminate in a round opening.


    395  FROM THE OPENING                                             395


         We see Tron's upturned face. He steps up on the podium, hands gripped
         into fists at his sides. His face is gradually filling with a deep
         inner excitement and anticipation, his eyes searching the space
         above. His expression remains still, his mouth closed and even. Only
         his eyes project the emotion he is feeling, burning with the
         knowledge of the experience to come.


    396  A SHOT FROM BELOW HIM, NEAR HIS FEET, LOOKING UP.            396


         He takes out his disk, grips it in both hands and slowly raises it
         high above his head. He stands stiffly, willing the response to
         happen... At first nothing stirs. Then a splendid, radiant beam of
         light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell,
         illuminating Tron and the disk. His hands start to shake with the
         force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped
         from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source
         of the light.

         hands drop to his sides. The disk rises out of sight, and we

         A machine, floating above the floor, with a pointed cone facing the

         Tron is looking upwards. Suddenly a voice booms out, echoing, and
         distorted, Alan's voice.


                               ALAN V.0.
                    TRON... TRON... Location query...

         In the air above Tron, images begin to materialize, shifting,
         transparent forms. First we see a network with pinpoints of light
         at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a
         bright light at the center.


         We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the
         others dim.

         consumed by static.

         He stops.


         The voice is gone. The beam continues to bathe Tron in its glow, and
         gradually we see an object emerging from the glow. The disk. It
         slowly descends, Tron raises his hands to catch it, gripping it,
         pulls it down and stares at it.

         He is rising from the altar, the rest of his body emerging from the
         neon steps, until he is standing in front of Tron. We see that he
         has on a floor-length robe with huge shoulder pads forming
         winglike supports for the fabric.

         AND YORI

         We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft,
         designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an
         enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and
         move with the speed of light.  The sail is at the bow of the craft,
         and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is
         made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the
         look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data
         transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the
         information paths to the Central Processing Unit.

         into place.

                           (looking out
                            of hangar)
                    As long as it gets us out of here


    421  EXT. HANGAR                                                  421


         The crowd of Sark's men are racing towards it.


                                                   CUT TO:


    422  EXT. SOLAR SAILER DECK - TRON AND YORI                       422


         Bending over the console, from the POV of the sail. As we watch, a
         head leans into the frame from the right. A memory guard. Then we
         see a hand gripping a staff, and the legs of another guard on the
         left.


                                                   CUT TO:


    423  THE TWO OF THEM FROM A LOW ANGLE                             423


         On the console, as Yori leans over it. We see that she is looking at
         a map of the system, a flat grid, and on it, in miniature, are the
         beam transfer points and transmission location.


                                                   CUT TO:


    424  THE TWO GUARDS, CREEPING DOWN THE WALKWAY                    424


         silently. We can see Tron's back as he hears a noise. His head snaps
         up; he sees the guards.


                               TRON
                    Yori! Get down!


    425  THE GUARDS                                                   425


         Abandoning any attempt at silence, leap forward, shouting, thrusting
         their staffs at Tron.


                                                   CUT TO:


    426  A LOW ANGLE, AS TRON KICKS THE FIRST GUARD BACK              426


         and slashes the second across the face, knocking him out.

                                                   CUT TO:


    427  EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE HANGAR                                  427


         As Sark's men rush in and head for the stairs to the catwalks that
         ring the hangar walls. They start swarming up.


                                                   CUT TO:


    428  TRON                                                         428

         reacting, holding his disk ready.

                                                   CUT TO:

    429  OMITTED                                                      429

    430  WALKWAY OF SAILER                                            430


         as guards start swarming on board. We see Tron move forward and then
         stop, letting them come.


                                                   CUT TO:

    431  YORI'S POV - LONG SHOT                                       431


         looking down at the walkway. Beyond it we can see the great door
         starting to rise.

    432  TRON                                                         432


         throwing his disk. It smashes into the guards in front, tossing them
         backwards.


                                                   CUT TO:


    433  A SHOT FROM THE EXTERIOR OF THE HANGAR                       433


         The great door is almost all the way up. We can see the Sail with
         its tip ready to emerge. Below, on the ground, more guards are
         racing towards the hangar.


    434  TRON                                                         434


         Beating back the guards, tossing them over the side of the walkway.
         We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the
         connection of the craft to the sail. Tron advances on him... the
         guard stares at him, then looks down... then jumps off, intimidated.
         There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing
         his balance.


    435  YORI                                                         435


         smiling.


                               YORI
                    We're off!


    436  EXT. HANGAR                                                  436


         The transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft,
         from behind, hitting the sail bunker, and passing through, so that
         it looks like a headlight. The Sailer starts moving, fast,
         accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of
         seconds.


    437  EXT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER - BRIDGE - SARK & MCP                  437

         Back on the bridge of the carrier, Sark is in the MCP hologram. In
         front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and
         the Solar Sailer -- racing away.


                               MCP
                    I hope you've enjoyed being a command
                    program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like
                    working in a pocket calculator... maybe
                    one of those watches that plays "Happy
                    Birthday" to its User once a year.


                               SARK
                    Now, sir... We did take care of that
                    User you sent us --


                               MCP
                    Yes, and now you've got two renegade
                    programs running all the hell over the
                    system in a stolen simulation.


                               SARK
                    We'll get them, sir... These things
                    take time.


                               MCP
                    I don't have time, Sark. And neither
                    do you. End of line.


 438-439 OMIT                                                         438-439


    440  SOLAR SAILER - WALKWAY - TRON                                440


         from the stern. Tron picks himself up from the floor where he was
         thrown when the Sailer took off, and heads for Yori (at the camera).
         He stops, seeing something.


                               YORI V.O.
                    Tron, are you all right?


         Tron waves at her... then...


    441  CLOSE SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON                             441


         He looks over at the guard rail.

         fingers gripping the rail. ZOOM IN on the fingers.

    443  A SHOT FROM BELOW THE WALKWAY                                443


         Several yards away from it. We see one of the blue warriors hanging
         on, trying to get a leg up on the rail, and we see Tron race to the
         edge, look over and see this guard.


    444  CLOSE SHOT OF TRON                                           444


         By the rail with the blue arms and head in the shot. Tron raises his
         disk to slam into the intruder, when suddenly a spherical glowing
         shape comes into the frame from bottom right.


                               BIT
                      (buzzing around Tron's
                         head like a fly)

                    Nothing doing, forget it!!!

         Who looks down, really seeing the face below for the first time.


                               TRON
                    Flynn!!


    447  SIDE SHOT OF THEM BOTH                                       447


                               FLYNN
                    Greetings, program...


                               TRON
                           (dumbfounded)
                    You're alive!


                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, I... oops!


         He loses his grip, and starts to fall. But Tron, just in time, grabs
         Flynn's wrist and starts to pull him up. We see the blue static guard
         disguise fade off Flynn.


    449  YORI                                                         449

         leaning over the control console anxiously, watching Tron come up
         the steps towards her with Flynn and the Bit.

         As they reach her.


                               YORI
                            (nervously)
                    Who is this?


         We see Flynn look at Yori and silently mouth "Lora" in surprise...
         but then realize his mistake.


                               TRON
                             (smiling)
                    Flynn...
                           (he turns to
                          Flynn eagerly)
                    Where's Ram?


                               FLYNN
                    I'm sorry, Tron... he's...
                    he didn't make it.


         Tron shakes his head, sadly.


                               TRON
                             (to Yori)
                    This is Flynn... the one who
                    busted me out.


                               YORI
                            (to Flynn)
                    Then I owe you some thanks...


                               FLYNN
                    No big deal. I ought to know my way
                    around that Light Cycles routine...
                    I mean, I did write the program for it.


                               TRON
                            (mystified)
                    Wrote the...?


                               FLYNN
                    It's time I levelled with you, Tron.
                    I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a
                    User.


         Tron and Yori are stunned and awed.


                               YORI
                    A User -- in our world?


                               FLYNN
                               (nods)
                    Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...


                               TRON
                    But -- if you're a User -- then
                    everything you've done has been
                    part of a plan ...


                               FLYNN
                              (laughs)
                    You wish. Man, I haven't had a second
                    to think since I got down here. I mean
                    in here. Out here. Whatever.


                               TRON
                    Then...


                               FLYNN
                    Look, you guys know how it is. You just
                    keep doin' what it looks like you're
                    supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and
                    you hope to hell your User knows what's
                    goin' on.


                               TRON
                    Well -- that's how it is for programs,
                    yes, but --


                               FLYNN
                    I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the
                    time, that's how it is for Users, too.


                               TRON
                    Stranger and stranger...


                               BIT
                    You said it.


                               FLYNN
                        (pats Tron on back)
                    So... Nice ship you got here. What's our
                    next move?


                               TRON
                             (smiles)
                    Remember you wanted to pay a call on
                    the MCP?


         Flynn nods.


                               TRON (CONT.)
                    We're on our way.
                             (indicates disk)
                    Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go
                    up against Master

                               FLYNN
                    All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake,
                    at least.


    451  LONG SHOT                                                    451


         The aircraft carrier rolls past the camera.

    452  THE BRIDGE - SARK                                            452


         looking out the observation window, as his lieutenant approaches
         from behind.

                               LIEUTENANT
                    Sir, what do you want done with
                    the tower guardian, Dumont?
                    Put him with the others?


                               SARK
                    No, bit brain.

         Sark turns to face him.


                               SARK


                    Prepare him for inquisition. I need
                    a little relaxation. But first rez up
                    the carrier for pursuit... And one other
                    thing.


         lie stares at the lieutenant, paranoid


                               SARK
                           (continuing)
                    Don'tthink anymore. I do the
                   thinkingaround here.

    456  SOLAR SAILER DECK                                            456


         We see Flynn looking back the way they came. Yori is at the controls,
         with Tron beside her, his arm around her shoulders, looking at Flynn.

                               FLYNN
                    What about our friend - Sark?


                               TRON
                    Probably decided not to pursue us,
                    The Sea of Simulation is tricky..
                    lot of illusions...rough navigating.
                    Programs have a way of just...
                    disappearing here.

                               FLYNN
                    Not us, I hope.


                               TRON
                         (shakes his head,
                          indicates disk)
                    Not with this disk. I'm going to
                    check on the beam connection, Yori.
                    You two can keep a watch out for
                    grid bugs.


         He moves off down the walkway, the Bit following. Flynn turns and
         leans out over the side.


                               FLYNN
                    Boy the view from up here... you
                    know the territory?


                               YORI
                    A little ...
                       (points out sights)
                    Over there, the Mountains of Data...
                    and I think that's the Silicon Valley...


                               FLYNN
                             (pointing)
                    What's wrong with that area?


    457  HIS POV                                                      457


         We see an area of darkened, gloomy, two-dimensional shapes.


                               YORI
                              (sadly)
                    The MCP blasted it... There are very
                    few domains left with any power at all.


                               FLYNN
                    Lousy utility companies ...
                    they're the same wherever you go.

         Where we see Dumont plugged into energy foot sockets. Two memory
         guards stand by his side holding their staffs against his chest.
         Dumont's face is wracked with pain, his robe torn, but his
         expression is full of determination. As we watch, another blast of
         torturous energy comes from the boots, and his face contorts. CAMERA
         PULLS BACK AND ANGLES UP to the second level where we see Sark
         looking down into the pit that is Dumont's cell.

                    Busy dying, you worn-out excuse for
                    an old program.


                               DUMONT
                    Yes, I'm old.

         from the front.


                               DUMONT
                            (continuing)
                    Old enough to remember the MCP when he
                    was just a chess program. He started
                    small, and he'll end small.

                         (throws back his
                         head and laughs)
                    That's very funny, Dumont. Maybe I
                    should keep you around, just to make me
                    laugh.

                    Guards! Bring this antique to the
                    bridge so he can watch his friends
                    be obliterated.

         We see Tron at the bow. Flynn and Yori are up on the deck near the
         controls, with the Bit hovering over them. Yori is, pointing
         something out to Flynn.

    470  LONG SHOT FROM THE SIDE                                      470


         We see the transmission beam which carries the Solar Sailer
         increasing in brightness, throbbing with a pulse of mad glowing
         energy, coming towards the ship. It hits the sail, and the ship
         shivers. The whole beam is now tripled in brightness.

         As Tron runs up to Yori's side. He grabs her shoulder, pulling her
         against him... they have to shout to be heard above the noise of the
         increasing beam.


                               TRON
                            (shouting)

                    Power surge... the transmission beam's
                    too strong!


                               TRON
                    We have to get off this beam!

                             (frantic)

         The ship is throbbing and jerking, bits of it de-rezzing.

                               FLYNN
                    There's another beam!


                               YORI
                    It's too far!


         Flynn suddenly looks to the bow of the ship, makes a decision, and
         races forward.

         is blasting away at the sails. He slows down, but keeps going.

         We see Flynn emerge, leaning out into the beam, his face brilliantly
         illuminated by the beam. He reaches forward with one arm.

         He is lying spread eagled at the bow, with one arm in the light. He
         raises his other arm and points at the beam which was so close, but
         too far to reach. Suddenly his whole body glows with the same
         intensity as the beam.

         His body glowing, arm outstretched. Suddenly another beam blasts out
         from his arm.

         We see the new beam from Flynn's arm flash over to the neighboring
         transmission beam and connect. We see the ship pulsing, and then
         breaking free of the old beam, following the new path, and connecting
         to the safe beam.

         The craft starts to travel safely on its way.

         as they reach the deck in front of Tron, as he holds Flynn. We can
         see Yori's anxious face to one side. Flynn's head comes up for a
         moment, dazed.

         Flynn smiles weakly.

                    Hooray for our side...


         He faints.

         Yori is sitting on the floor beside the control console with Flynn
         stretched out beside her, his head in her lap. Her hands are on
         either side of his face. Tron is seated across from them and the Bit
         is quietly floating beside him. In b.g. we SEE that the Solar Sailer
         is passing through a series of narrow canyons.

                    go check the instruments ...

         The carrier lurches forward and rams the Sailer, splitting it in
         half.

    524  YORI AND FLYNN                                               524


         Falling on top of one another, Flynn trying to pull Yori out of the
         way as the bulk of the carrier appears to slam into Tron and he's
         gone.

         falling through space.

    526  FLYNN AND YORI                                               526


         As the carrier keeps moving forward. Flynn holding Yori, and the Bit
         hovers beside them. A second level of the carrier, with an open hold,
         comes rushing at them.

         The gaping hold rushes forward and the screen goes black.

         Their half of the Sailer is scooped up into the carrier.


                                                   CUT TO:

         catching hold of something. He is swinging freely. Hanging onto a
         wall, he starts pulling his feet up to gain a precarious foothold.

         inside the door, shoulders slumped and we can see that his disk has
         been removed.

         Dumont holds Yori as she SOBS.


                               DUMONT
                    Quietly, Yori...


         He looks up.


                               DUMONT
                            (continuing)
                    Tron... ?


         Flynn looks down at his hands and turns away, leaning against the
         wall.


                               YORI
                    He's dead.


                               DUMONT
                           (sighs, looks
                             at Flynn)
                    And who is this?


                               YORI
                    He's a User, Dumont. He came to
                    our world... trying to help us...


         Her voice breaks, she turns away.


                               DUMONT
                            (despairing)
                    If the Users can no longer help us...


         His voice trails off. Suddenly, a stronger LIGHT flashes on in the
         cell, the door opens, and we see Sark standing there, framed in the
         cell door.


                               SARK
                    So... we have erased the program that -


         As he catches sight of Flynn, his voice falters.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    You! No!


         Flynn looks up curiously.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    You died! I saw you!


                               FLYNN
                    Not me, boss.


                               SARK
                    Well... we can take care of that
                    soon enough.


         He points to Dumont. The guards grab him.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    Take this program to the holding pit.


         The guards start to drag Dumont out.


                               YORI
                        (rushing after him)
                    Dumont...!


         A guard pushes her roughly to the end of the cell.


                               SARK
                        (indicates Dumont)
                    I'm taking our friend here, and
                    some other religious fanatics, to
                    Master Control... the MCP has expressed
                    an interest in assimilating them --
                    probably for archival purposes.
                    I'm not going back to the Game Grid
                    on this ship, though -- I'll take
                    the Transport Beam.
                             (smiles)
                    Less traffic. But when I disembark,
                    this ship...and everything that remains
                    on board...will automatically de-rez.
                    This means you.

                    Enjoy your trip...


         LAUGHING, Sark leaves. The guards, with Dumont in custody, follow.


    533  SHOT LOOKING DOWN INTO THE PIT CELLS                         533


         into the cell that holds a dozen dejected, defeated, aging programs,
         the I/0 Tower guardians. We see the door to the cell open and guards
         beginning to herd them out.


    534  ANGLE - LEVEL ABOVE CELLS                                    534

         into the cells at his feet and laughs again.

         staring up as Sark moves past their cell and out of view.

         vast plain covered with a glowing grid.

         We can see the observation port and below that a section of the
         ship's structure is moving forward.

         As the landing pod disengages completely, floating away from the
         carrier and then starting its final journey to the MCP, picking up
         speed on a straight and even course. We can see a small speck
         clinging to one side of the pod...


    543A CLOSE UP - SPECK                                             543A


         TRON, holding himself braced into a narrow crack.


    544  FLYNN, YORI AND THE BIT                                      544


         Yori is sitting with her head in her hands. Flynn is at the door
         testing it, running his finger along the edges.

         Of landing pod flying over the glowing grid that surrounds the MCP's
         mesa.

         from behind the carrier of the pod getting smaller with distance.

         Steep cliff face of the MCP's mesa is coming closer and closer, more
         and more detail visible.

         tiny against the massive bulk of the MCP's mesa, descending for
         landing. The top edge of the cliff is encrusted with irregular
         shapes and the pod is headed for one opening among the shapes,
         fitting itself neatly in between so that it becomes a part of the
         structure.

         There is a minor jolt and Sark lays his palm on another panel. From
         the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly.
         Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door, and we
         gradually are given a view of the MCP, two or three miles away at
         the center of the plain ahead. The structure is a series of gleaming
         black blades, forming a great cylinder, and the communication beam
         rises out of the center of this cylinder.

         Flynn still at the door. Suddenly his hand goes right through the
         door.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!


         The door is disappearing, dissolving.

                    Look, the door's almost...


         He stops in horror.


                                                   CUT TO:


    552  HIS POV                                                      552


         Yori is standing lethargically staring at her hands... through them.
         She is de-rezzing too. Her whole body becoming transparent. She looks
         up dimly at Flynn, with no expression.


    553  WIDE SHOT                                                    553


         Flynn races back to her and takes her in his arms roughly, hugging
         her close, his energy flowing into her.


         Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is
         too late to save her. Her eyes are half-closed.


                               FLYNN
                    Yori!


    554  CLOSE SHOT                                                   554


         Just their two faces. Flynn bends closer, their lips almost touch.
         Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color
         floods back into her. Her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at
         Flynn. He pulls a little away from her, still holding her.


                               YORI
                             (in awe)
                    You... you brought me back...?
                    Why...? How ... ?


         Flynn lets go of her.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm gonna need your help. Hey, Bit!


         He looks around, spots a small glow in one corner of the cell, runs
         to it and stoops down, cupping the glow in his hands. It wavers.
         Flynn wills his energy back into it, frowning with concentration.
         Suddenly the Bit pops into life.


                               BIT
                    Yes!


                               FLYNN
                    Let's get outta here.


         They head for the door.


    555  THE MESA TOP OF THE MCP                                      555

         The prisoners file forward on the path to the MCP. Sark is leading
         them. We can see the structure of the MCP closer now, looming bigger.
         The four memory guards are standing at regular intervals along the
         path.

    556  EXT. POD DOOR - LIEUTENANT                                   556


         on duty. He hears a NOISE and turns... and in a flash of light a
         speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over. The CAMERA WATCHES
         over his de-rezzing body. We see a figure approaching closer... its
         arm is raised, and... the disk slams back into the hand.

    557  CLOSER SHOT                                                  557

         It is Tron. He steps over the body of the Lieutenant.

         from right outside. We see the prisoners beginning to file inside,
         up the final slope leading to the base of the MCP.

    559  SIDE SHOT OF THE ENTRANCE                                    559

         watching them, his back to the camera.

    560  POV OF THE DOOMED PROGRAMS                                   560


         As the first one gets through the opening. The light from the MCP's
         beam pours out. Moving forward, through the entrance, the MCP is
         finally revealed. A giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a
         network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible
         surface... is a face. Flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted,
         the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder. The
         impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face,
         but more so. It's horrible. Beneath the floating cylinder face two
         inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. We
         continue moving forward, the MCP looming over us. Then the CAMERA
         STOPS and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to
         the inner walls. The MCP speaks, we see his enormous lips moving.


                               MCP
                      (echoing, booming)
                    I am delighted that so many of you
                    could turn out to give your
                    power over to me...

         lining the wall. They are sucked back, pinned, immobile, and we see
         them starting to de-rez.


                               MCP
                    You're very lucky, all of you. You
                    are participating in the creation of
                    the single most powerful program in
                    the history of the system... of all
                    systems...


         The programs begin to disappear, one by one.

         Dumont's face is devoid of hope. He starts into the MCP's inner
         chamber.

         Flynn and Yori race into view. We can see two of the memory guards
         in a de-rezzed, two dimensional state, disappearing completely in
         the course of this scene. Flynn runs to Sark's position, looking out
         the window.


                               FLYNN
                    Check out the controls.


         As Yori looks over the control conso1e.

         Down the length of the carrier. It is de-rezzing, parts of it gone
         already. We see the CPU approaching, as the carrier rises.

         sections only visible as outlines.

                    Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've
                    finally come to terms with one
                    another...

         Sark is standing, looking in the opening, waiting for the signal to
         depart. His back is to the camera.

                               VOICE
                    SARK!


         Sark turns, curious, eyes widen incredulously..


    570  SARK'S POV                                                   570


         We SEE Tron standing, legs spread, arms poised by his sides, disk in
         one hand. It gives off a pure white light.


    571  CLOSE UP SARK'S FACE                                         571

                    It doesn't matter. Prepare to
                    terminate.

         Sark flings his disk with a violent jerk of his wrist.

    573  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              573


         as the disk races at Tron. He dodges, drops to one knee and ducks
         under it. Sark's disk circles like a homing missile and attacks
         again. Tron deflects the second attack with his own disk, and the
         two meet with an explosion of light. Sark's disk ricochets off and
         races away, back to Sark. We see Tron throw his own weapon.

                    Let's get some power here.


         His hands, laying on the control console, begin to send forth great
         pulses of glowing energy into the carrier.

         Tron's disk circles Sark, attacking twice. Sark deflects it and
         immediately throws his own disk.

                               TRON
                    I'm also better than you....


         He leaps into the air, grabs his own disk, pulling his legs up as
         Sark's disk passes under him.

                    Very clever, Tron. You know you
                    should have joined me.

    586  FLYNN AND YORI                                               586


         Flynn is at the controls, transferring power.

                    Any response?

         She looks down at the battle. Her hand reaches over and grips
         Flynn's tightly.

         He catches his own disk, spots Tron's coming at him right behind,
         and holds up his own disk as a shield.


                               SARK
                    We would have made a great team.

         With a CRASH and explosion of light, Tron's disk cuts right through
         Sark's disk, and on through Sark's head. The disk shatters, and we
         see Sark's surprised face, hands still in position to hold the
         disk... a jagged open slash right through his forehead. We can see
         energy pouring out of this wound like blood.

                    Sark's out. Would you like to
                    leave a message?


                               MCP
                    I am the message. The only message.

         Tron throws his disk. It's deflected off the base of the MCP, and
         returns to him.

                           (turns to her)
                    Probably.


    611  INT. MCP - TRON                                              611


         about to fire again. There's a sudden roar and Tron turns.


    612  TRON'S POV OF GIANT SARK                                     612


         Who rips open the doorway into the MCP and advances.


    613  BRIDGE                                                       613


         Yori has steered them right next to the beam. She turns to Flynn,
         goes up to him.


                               YORI
                    Flynn... you can't... I


                               FLYNN
                          (lays finger on
                             her lips)
                    Shhhhh.


         He takes her in his arms.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                               (whispering)
                    I'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if...
                    just once...


         His head bends down and their lips meet. Yori's body begins to glow,
         change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the
         love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous. Her eyes are closed.


    614  CLOSE UP - THEIR FACES                                       614


         Finally Flynn pulls away from her. Her eyes stay shut for a second,
         then open.


                               FLYNN
                    Don't worry.


    615  LONGER SHOT                                                  615


         He releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises
         on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam. We see Yori
         shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out.


    616  HER POV                                                      616


         Flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion
         directly into the center of MCP itself.


    617  INT. MCP                                                     617


         Sark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron. He speaks, but
         his voice is that of the MCP.


                               SARK/MCP
                    End of line, program...


         We can see the MCP in the b.g. Suddenly there is an explosion of
         static, as Flynn falls into the MCP. We see a weird 2-D image of
         Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle.
         Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him
         and hurls the code disk for the last time. It circles the MCP once,
         and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy
         cones. And connects.


    618  SHOT OF THE APEX                                             618

         A brilliant explosion of lights bursts out.


    619  SHOT OF SARK                                                 619


         Dead face wracked with the pain of a second death. He begins to melt
         into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely.


    620  SHOT OF THE MCP                                              620


         We see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. It
         is dressed like Dumont was at the I/0 Tower, an old man in the
         padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. We see the
         wizened, wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds, and
         see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable. Then he
         too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. The cylinder of
         the MCP glows brighter and brighter.


    621  YORI AND THE BIT                                             621

         on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this.

    622  HER POV                                                      622

         A fountain of energy explodes upwards like a Supernova, right at the
         camera.

    623  YORI                                                         623

         shielding her face from the power of the blast.

    624  LONG SHOT                                                    624


         The nova of energy bursting upwards. We start to see the glow
         returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates,
         leaving the sky full of sparkling stars.

    625  YORI                                                         625


         still shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains
         regaining their life.

    626  HER POV                                                      626

         one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows
         brightly, increasing.

    627  LONG SHOT                                                    627

         The carrier starts to descend.

                                                   CUT TO:


    628  EXT. CPU MESA - TRON                                         628

         Leading Dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian
         programs that were saved. He looks up, spots the carrier descending.

    629  SHOT OF CARRIER                                              629

         Basically all that is left of it is the bridge, with only a very
         faint image of the rest of the body. It lands on the mesa.

    630  EXT. CPU MESA                                                630

         Tron catches Yori as she jumps down. He hugs her close and looks at
         her, about to speak. But she reaches up and presses her lips to his
         in a quick, intense kiss. Then pulls back.

                               TRON
                            (laughing)
                    Nice...

                               YORI
                    It's something Users do.

                               TRON
                    Where's Flynn?

         He looks up at the bridge.

                               YORI
                    He's gone. He went into the beam.
                    He saved you. He saved all of us.

         Tron stares at her, holding onto her shoulders. Then he looks up at
         the sky, thoughtfully. She also looks up.

                               DUMONT
                    He really was a User...

                               BIT
                         (quietly, sadly)
                    Yes...

    631  LONG SHOT FROM OVERHEAD                                      631

         of the landscape, glowing again with new life, every I/O Tower a
         shining beacon, a symbol of the new found freedom of communication.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    632  RACING OVER THE CIRCUIT PATTERN                              632


         and returning to the real world.


    633  THE REAL WORLD - LASER LAB                                   633


         CLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOM's lab. A bright
         blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism.


         WIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the
         chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized.


         Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's BODY takes
         shape on the floor. As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact --
         back in his real-world body and clothes... and as bewildered to find
         himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world.


         He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent
         flesh and blood.


         He looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with
         weak sunlight coming in.


         And, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at
         Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is
         coughing out a long document on wide blue paper.


         Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the
         document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his
         face.


         The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant,
         tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it.


                                                   CUT TO:


    634  INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - ALAN AND LORA                           634


         Bleary but excited, they gaze happily at the information on Alan's
         CRT screen as Flynn bursts into the room, waving his printout.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey -- you guys


         Before he can say anything more, Alan turns to greet him, holding up
         a seven-inch computer software FLOPPY DISK in its cardboard sleeve.


                               ALAN
                    Flynn! I made it. I worked out some
                    new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk,
                    and -- it's running.


                               FLYNN
                    I know, I met him.


         Alan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got
         from Tron and Yori in the other world. He checks himself.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    I mean, I saw it read-up -
                    hey, look at this.


         He shows them the printout. It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of
         reading it to figure out its significance.


                               ALAN
                    Your old files -- ?


                               FLYNN
                    And Dillinger's instructions to
                    divert them -- it's all there -
                    look, even his home phone number,
                    when he logged on.


                               ALAN
                    Oh, that is beautiful. You've got
                    the goods...


         Flynn folds up the printout, puts it in his pocket. Alan and Lora
         get up, stretch, start wandering slowly toward the door with him.


                               FLYNN
                    You're telling me...


         As they talk, CAMERA PANS over to Alan's color CRT SCREEN and HOLDS
         on it.


    635  CRT SCREEN                                                   635


         The lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off, and
         are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a
         typical video game:


         A BLUE CYLINDER, poised on a BLUE MESA -- resembling the MCP in the
         electronic world. And THREE YELLOW ROCKETS. They move randomly at
         first, then converge on the blue figure from three different
         directions.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    you have any idea how much I can sue these
                    jokers for?


                               LORA (V.0.)
                    Well, just don't forget your old friends
                    when you're rich and famous.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Are you kidding? You guys'll he running
                    this joint by then...


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                   Your friend Dillinger sure won't...


         The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time. It
         EXPLODES in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue
         SPARKS. The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical
         formation, heading together toward the side of the CRT screen as we
         HEAR Flynn, Lora, and Alan heading for the door.


                               FLYNN (V.O.)
                    Hey, you know anybody who wants to
                    get hold of some video games... cheap?


                               LORA (V.O.)
                    You're getting out of the business?


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                    Shouldn't you wait till your
                    lawsuit's settled?


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Nah...I decided...I've had enough of
                    video games to last me a good long
                    time. I feel like gettin' into some
                    real life...


         at the SOUND of the DOOR to Alan's office closing O.S., the three
         yellow rockets leave the CRT screen, sailing off its left-hand edge.
         HOLD a moment on the exploded blue figure and


                                                        BLACK OUT.

    CONSTRUCTION CREW toils to complete a vast SWITCHING NEXUS.
    CYPER-TECH CREWMEN and MACHINERY branded "X-NET".

    3D lattice of routers, refractors, reassemblers... New,
    unused data OPTIK HIGHWAY routes radiate from all sides,
    crossing cyberspace.

    X-Net Tactical Corps troops (herein X-Takks) patrol every
    inch.


2   INT.   X-NET NEXUS - UNDER CONSTRUCTION

    DATA "TRAIN" enters. Sliver of RED DATA ENERGY shunt off,
    shooting into RANDOM MEMORY BUFFER - geometrically perfect
    lattice of PLASMA BEAMS and WHITE HOT intersection points.

    X-Takks notice, moving to investigate.

    DEEP IN THE LATTICE:

    Red data "uploads" into solid form. A RED FIGURE. We see
    from the back - infrared strobing DISK, etched metallic
    detail, lethal EDGES -

    Then slowly he - IT - turns.     Hardly a face, only data-hungry
    eyes, riveted to a TASK -

    TRON 2.0.

    Seriously upgraded, over-clocked, armed for trouble. The
    friendly hero we once knew has been re-programmed into a
    ruthless cyber-ninja.

    X-Takks search ten story gantries.

    TRON springs into the lattice, dodging PLASMA BEAMS, avoiding
    detection. Slips into:


3   INT.   NEXUS MAIN SHAFT

    X-Takks on high alert.

    TRON slips down main shaft, freezes, confirms data.       Darts
    behind MAIN POWER SUPPLY.

    Pulls his DISK.     DISK opens, extends oscillating DATA KEY.

                 Intruder!   Fix coordinates!

    POLICE POUNCE, FIRING.

    Tron pulls hyper-disk off his back and HURLS IT -

    DISK strikes cop, fries his circuits. Disk ricochets,
    brutally accurate, takes out three more Police -

    TRON flips into the air - His DISK boomerangs straight for
    him. Certain death. But his timing is inhumanly accurate.
    DISK docks on his back midair, lands and bolts.

    ALARMS WAIL -

    POWER SUPPLY VERGES on MELTDOWN, CIRCUITS FRY, PLASMA SPEWS.
    X-NET CRISIS TEAM rushes in, inserts MASTER KEY. POWER SUPPLY
    STABILIZES. Catastrophe averted.

    TRON flips away, chased by firing X-Takks -

    Arriving on the scene - split-second response:

    Elite team of X-NET SECURITY AGENTS, lead by:

    RX23 SECURITY LEADER (Cyber-twin of our real-world hero RUSH).

    TRON jumps down MAIN SHAFT - a thousand stories. Riding his
    DISK as a heat shield dodges X-Net fire, swerves into a DATA
    CHANNEL -

    RX23 and a pair of his AGENTS hop on PULSE RIDER vehicles,
    hotly pursuing TRON.

    TRON PLUNGES onto a DATA HIGHWAY - speed out of NEXUS, hurls
    across cyberspace.

                             AGENT 1
                 This is the first time an Intruder

    PLASMA BLAST rips open highway wall.

    Rx23 emerges unscathed, pursuing.


5   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE

    TRON leaps out blast hole, recovers his disk, vanishes into
    ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE.

    Rx23 roars after him, riding hard, joined by:

    Airborne SEARCH ENGINE vehicle, piloted by a dumpy nerd
    program called KROD.

                           KROD
               I got a lock. Coordinate 32937!

                             RX23
               I'm on him!

    RX23 chases Tron into a dark canyon. Hairpin turns and blind
    curves. RX23 arrives a junction. Tron has vanished.

                           RX23
               Which way did he go?!


6   INT.   ENCOM CORPORATION BETA TEST LAB - DAY

    Rabbit warren of computer programmers in crisis mode.

    A head shoots up from a cubicle. It's Rush Nortebi, 23,
    computer security expert. Real world version of the RX23
    program. His cubicle is jammed with racks of vintage and
    bleeding-edge computer gear.

                           RUSH
               I said WHICH WAY DID HE GO?

    Dozens of programmers work feverishly to track the system
    intruder. Everybody's stumped. Dangling from desk lamps,
    the company toy: Conical pyramid with a square stuck on top,
    labeled "X-NET RULES!"

                 Check the old game grid!

    Rush jockeys an old Apple LISA computer.     On screen: a crude
    old vector graphics game grid.

    A RED FIGURE steps appears the grid.

                             RUSH
                 You get a cookie, Miles!

    Programmers gather to watch Rush in action.


7   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - THE OLD GAME GRID

    Vast, low-rez, uncool, largely forgotten.

    TRON pulls a LIGHT WAND from his legging, grips it. A TURBO-
    CHARGED LIGHT-CYCLE rezzes up beneath him. He fires his
    LIGHTCYCLE. ZIP, he's gone.

    Onto the grid blasts RX23, speeding on his Pulse rider.    He
    skids and swerves, learning the funky surface.

    Search Engine flies onto the scene, hovering overhead.

                             KROD
                 Coordinate 6532.02!   There he goes!

    The chase is on.

    TRON escapes across the vast grid-plane, head down, eyes
    hollow. He gains speed, retreating to somewhere...

    RX23 surges on his Pulse Rider, closing the gap.


8   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM BETA TEST LAB - DAY

    Rush gets the hang of this old game.

                  Or you know we're all fired.

     Rush baits the RED LIGHTCYCLE. It anticipates his every
     move, goading him, tailing him.

                              MILES
                  Whoa, Rush! I groked a pattern in

9    INT.   CYBERSPACE - GAME GRID

     Search Engine flies overhead - Krod locks on Tron.

     RX23's Pulse Rider pulls the move, surges up beside red
     lightcycle.

     Tron pulls away, baiting his opponent.

11   INT.   CYBERSPACE - GAME GRID

     RX23's Pulse Rider SCREAMS, gaining on Tron.         Neck-and-neck.

     But Tron suddenly brakes, quitting the chase.

     RX23 is puzzled.    Looks forward.       Eyes spring wide.

     Eyes land on withering LEGAL VP.

                  Change it back to the way I wrote
                  it. With the launch of X-Net, this
                  company guarantees one hundred percent
                  secure data transmission. If we
                  can't deliver on that promise, we
                  deserve to be out of business.

     Rush appears from a building.       Signals Sinclair aside.

     Sprawling, big bucks, basketball hoop.

     Sinclair enters, alone. Closes door. Uses a retinal scan

     LONE FIGURE stands clothed in flashy cyber-armor:     Fluid
     photons, oozing high-rez circuitry.

     It's PLEXOR, cyber-twin of real-world Sinclair.

     He crosses into an round inner sanctum.    DATA STREAM radiates
     from above.

     PLEXOR stands in the center, pulls his DISK off his back,
     raises it above his head.

     Data stream converges onto disk, becomes a tight RUBY RED
     COMMUNICATION BEAM.

     Plexor's eyes decode transmission.    Text races across his
     eyes: IDENTIFY THE INTRUDER.

                              RUDY
                  At a time like this, let's seek
                  inspiration in the past. We should
                  ask ourselves: What solution would
                  spring from the inspired mind of our
                  departed leader, Flynn.

     He's got an obituary photo of FLYNN, Encom's legendary
     previous - and deceased - CEO.

     Groans around the table. Execs rolls their eyes, disses
     Rudy's idea. Flynn has become a stale company joke.

     Rudy sheepishly sits.

     But Sinclair stops behind Rudy, eyes fixed on the photo of
     Flynn. An idea takes hold. He looks to Meg.

                              SINCLAIR
                  Is the QF-401 is operational?

                               MEG
                  Um...   Midway into phase one testing.

     Confusion among execs.     Nobody knows what a "QF-401" is.
     Not even Rush.

                              SINCLAIR
                  If we can't fight this intruder from
                  the outside, then maybe we need to
                  fight him from the inside.

     Meg's mind races.

                              MEG
                  I'm ready to do my part.

                              SINCLAIR
                  This company needs a hero. Who among
                  you is the smartest, most resourceful
                  and courageous?

     Looks trade around the table.     Meg slowly rises, indicating
     her choice.

                              MEG
                  Who else could it be?

     She's singled out Rush.


24   INT.   ENCOM CORP CORRIDOR - SECURE ELEVATOR - DAY

     Meg leads Sinclair and Rush to a SECURE ELEVATOR.     Her retinal
     scan ID opens the door. They step in.


25   INT.   ENCOM SECURE ELEVATOR - GOING DOWN - MOMENTS LATER

                              RUSH
                  Somebody going to tell me what I've
                  been volunteered for?

                  Rush, you're the only one I can trust
                  to eliminate the intruder. But you
                  won't be doing it the way you thought.
                  Meg's been working on something down
                  here that's, well... Beyond Top
                  Secret.

     Rush drills a look at Meg, but she keeps it all business.


26   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - MOMENTS LATER

     Out the elevator, Meg leads them into a maze of ultra-tech
     gear.

                              MEG
                  This is where Flynn worked.   And
                  where he died.

     Amid sleek new equipment, there's a glass cabinet housing a
     CHARRED REMNANT of strange machinery.

                              SINCLAIR
                  Meg has reconstructed Flynn's last
                  project. This time it works.

     Mega signals lab assistant DEWEY. He pokes buttons:       A
     MASSIVE TECHNICAL DEVICE unfolds and boots up.

                              RUSH
                  You didn't pick this up at Circuit
                  City. What is it?

                              MEG
                  A Quantum Digitizer. Prototype,
                  only one of its kind. Flynn designed
                  it to break down physical objects
                  into high resolution data. Luckily,
                  we salvaged his key components and
                  back-engineered the system.

     She opens a cage, places her LAB RAT (Jo-Jo) on a target
     stage. Dewey boots controls, presses commands. Beam array
     scans the rat into the computer, forming a 3D rat-image on
     screens, dematerializing the physical rat. Device revs down.

     Rush runs his hand over the empty target stage.

                               RUSH
                  That's...   Not possible.

     Lab rat has vanished from the physical world.     Its digitized
     image rotates on monitors.

                  Flynn was trying to take it one step
                  further. He wanted to transport a
                  human being into cyberspace.

                              RUSH
                  You mean the urban legends? A
                  computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace
                  a long time ago.

                              SINCLAIR
                  We think it happened.

     Meg agrees.    Rush gets a chill.

                              SINCLAIR
                  It was a fluke. But Flynn worked
                  for years, down here, trying to make
                  it happen again. One day a test
                  went bad. A plasma reaction destroyed
                  this lab. Flynn was reduced to ash.

     Rush views the charred remains in the glass case. Photos of
     the destroyed lab. Spooky evidence of a hellish death scene.

                               RUSH
                  I was never told how he died. It
                  was all just weird, you know, because
                  Flynn's the guy who hired me. But
                  he was strange, kept to himself, I
                  didn't know what job I was supposed
                  to be doing.
                      (to Sinclair)
                  Then you came onboard, the company
                  woke up, we had a direction. It was
                  kind of pathetic, because by the
                  time Flynn died, everybody was too
                  busy to care.

                              SINCLAIR
                  He was brilliant in his way, but
                  genius without discipline leads to
                  nothing. His reckless habits nearly
                  ruined this company... And for sure
                  got him killed.

     A last look at the charred remains of Flynn's machine.

                              MEG
                  That kind of accident can't happen
                  again. We've upgraded the system in
                  ways Flynn never could. The chips
                  didn't exist until now.

     She presses commands. Beams re-materialize the lab rat on
     the target stage. Jo-jo is as good as new.

                                MEG
                  Hey, Jo-Jo.    Have good trip?

     She puts the rat in on her shoulder, feeds it a tidbit.
     Then she scrutinizes Rush.

     Rush considers Meg, then turns to Sinclair.

                              RUSH
                  You want her to send me into
                  cyberspace to catch that jerk who
                  hacked us?

                  The future of this company depends
                  on it.

     Rush looks to Meg.    She offers a reassuring nod.

                              RUSH
                  You can bring me back okay?

                                MEG

     Lab rat is perched happily on her shoulder.

                  Destroy the intruder by 9AM tomorrow,

                  you. I've had my eye on you for a
                  long time. Score this hit and I'll

                  company.

     Rush is awe-struck. Ready, willing, able.        He shakes
     Sinclair's hand, sealing the deal.

                              RUSH
                  I won't let you down.   Let's do it.

     Meg removes target stage, swings a custom TARGET CHAIR in
     place. Rush lowers in place. Meg buckles him in. Last
     chance for a private word:

                  I promise I'll get you back safely

                  You're a piece of work. You dumped
                  me because you said I was too much
                  about the company's needs and not
                  enough about yours. Well here we

                  Oh.    So you think I have a heart?

     Meg breaks away, retreating to the controls with Sinclair.
     Rush's trails her with his eyes - he can't stop looking.

                              RUSH
                      (under his breath)

     Meg initiates Quantum Digitizer sequence.

     Rush watches PULSING CHROMATIC LIGHT build down the unit's

     Plasma strobes CYAN/MAGENTA. Unit HUMS... Then GROANS

     Unit sparks.       Ceramic components STRESS and CRACK.

     Sinclair dives for cover -

     PLASMA BALL engulfs Quantum Digitizer.

     FINAL BITS of Rush scan away.

     Plasma ball FRIES the unit.         Breakers trip.   Power fades.

     Target chair:       Empty.


27   EXT.   CYBERSPACE TRANSITION

     Light-speed thrill-ride, hurling into digital chaos.

     Rush's electrified body hurtles across the void, eyes filled
     with TERROR and AWE.

     Shimmering bits morph into an awesome cyberscape.

     Rush enters this bizarre world - CRASH/FLASH - stranger in a
     strange land. Data energy ZAPS off his body, interacting
     with the landscape circuitry around him. He fights it, tries
     to control it.

     Rush stands, beholds the place. Looks at his hands and arms,
     clad in circuitry. He finds he had landed outside:

     Fortress-like X-NET CENTRAL SERVER.       ALARMS SOUNDING inside.

     He turns, looks up a FIREWALL. Hundreds of X-Takk Troops
     hurry to look down. FIRING WEAPONS.

     A FIGURE comes at him, down the wall, STREAKING RED.

     BLAMMO!

     TRON lands on a plateau above Rush, gazing down.

     They face each other, equally perplexed.

     Rush is no longer human, but not quite a program either.
     Energy zaps off his body, infusing the surrounding circuitry.

     Tron stares, unblinking - Cyber-Ninja.

                  It's YOU!    The intruder!

     Rush's body circuits PULSE with anger - data surges out his
     feet, across floor circuitry, up to the plateau. Energy
     interacts with Tron's body circuits, siphoning off bits of
     code.

     Code races across Rush's eyes.        Identification data.

                  You are...    TRON?!?

     X-Takks hustle onto the scene.

     Tron leaps off the plateau, cutting the data connection.      He
     whips his disk off his back and THROWS.

     Disk SLAMS Rush in the gut, knocks him flat.

     Mega touches Rush, exciting his energy flow.        She reads
     data streaming in his eyes - TRON'S ID info.

29   EXT.   CENTRAL CONTROL SERVER

     Mega and X-Takks escort Rush across bridges, in security
     portals. Firewalls cool and part, allowing them to pass.

     Down a grand corridor, past towering energy columns and
     throbbing green memory banks. They cross a bridge. View
     includes: Vast square concentric security rings surround a
     massive cubic POWER SUPPLY CORE.


30   INT.   PLEXOR CPU

     Plexor toils over the latest security breech, failing to
     decipher recordings of the Intruder.

     Rush is brought in buy Mega.      He double-takes on Plexor, the
     cyber-twin of Sinclair.

                               MEGA
                  Plexor.   This is the one.

     Plexor steps closer, scanning Rush.

                              PLEXOR
                  You are not RX23.

                  My name is Rush. I'm a - Look, I
                  got an ID on the Intruder. Do you
                  know the program they used to call
                  Tron?

     Plexor activates memory banks. Accesses archive files of
     the original low-rez Tron: So harmless, so many years ago.
     Bears little resemblance to the upgraded Tron.

                              PLEXOR
                  You are in error. Zero match.

                              RUSH
                  Exactly. That's how he's getting
                  past you. You don't see him for
                  what he is. He's one of your own,
                  gone bad. Tron was a crude security
                  program from Encom's old days.
                  Strictly low-rez, right? Archived
                  and forgotten. But his source code
                  contains all the architecture of

                  I got a piece of my code corrupted.
                  Whatever it is, it's given me power

                  They saw me read his circuits. Can

     Plexor looks to Mega.

                  He creates alternative data channels

                  Yeah, I'm a little unstable.    But I
                  can find Tron for you.

     Plexor processes.     His eyes stream barcode data to X-Takks:

                  Release him.

     X-Takk Troops read Plexor's barcode command with their eyes.

     Mega at the controls.    Rush rides, beholding the lightshow
     wonder of Cyberspace.

                I need to find a program called KROD.
                He's a specialist in pattern
                recognition. He snagged the last
                known position on Tron for me.

     Mega scans data, gets a fix on "KROD".

                            MEGA
                This is a waste of X-Net resources.
                You're strictly random. We will
                never find the intruder this way.

                            RUSH

                You can't doubt his instructions,

                            MEGA
                Of course not. But I am programmed
                to predict all possible errors. You
                contain an infinite quantity.

                            RUSH
                Meg for sure programmed you.

     OLD DATA ARTERIES.

                I calculated the probability.
                    (soberly)

     Construction nearly complete.       High security.

     Mega leads Rush to secured encryption gates.         Her eyes light
     with data, the gate opens.

     Across a bridge: An old-network HUB CITY. Like Hong Kong
     in wilder days. Jammed with Programs, colorful data, loud
     data transfer screams.

                                 RUSH
                  What a dump.

     He heads across, but Mega hesitates.

                  Hey.    Interface.

     Mega grudgingly follows.       Portal closes.

     Electro-pop overload. Rush and Mega squeeze through crowds,
     past screaming data pipes and sizzling circuitry.

     City is dominated by mugshots of TRON:          "ENEMY OF THE FUTURE"

     Mega locates a gleaming X-NET KIOSK. A PROMOTER (KROD)
     extoles the virtues of the X-Net system:

     Crowd buzzes.       They can't wait.

                  This is the one you seek?

     Rush approaches Krod. Looks like Miles Rabbish.           There's a
     bizarre moment of recognition between them.

     Rush thinks, touches a surface. Concentrates. Circuitry

     data races around walls and floors.

     Programs stop what they're doing, amazed by the feat.

                  a green guy, head-to-head.

     Krod gawks at the image, but he's stumped.

                  The green guy faked out the red guy,

     Bingo.

     Splat happens in Rush's memory image.        All goes white.

                  Where did the red guy go after that?

                              MEGA
                  The real world doesn't exist. Nobody
                  can uplink. These ports were for
                  simulation only.

                              RUSH
                  Right... But how did those poor
                  misguided fools boot up the link?

                              MEGA
                  They stood in the center.   Held their
                  disk above their head.

     Rush pulls his disk off his back, aims it skyward.
     Concentrates. Energy flows off his feet, interacts with the
     I/O Port floor.

     RUBY COMMUNICATION BEAM shoots skyward.

     Smiles as he downloads the response.

     Mega and Krod watch nearby.

     Walls THUNDER and CRASH IN -

     Rush leaps clear with his disk -

     MASSIVE ROMBALL (data reformatting orb) hurtles around the
     I/O Port, ZAPPING all it touches, de-rezzing data structures
     into neutral gray "blank matter".

     ROMBALL loops skyward.

     GIANT D-REZZ PROGRAM crashes down from above, retrieves
     ROMBALL - He's ENORMOUS, TOUGH, SINGLE-MINDED.

42   EXT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM I/O PORT

     D-Rezz screams like a modem, hurls ROMBALL -

     Mega and Krod dive clear -

     ROMBALL misses them, but BLAZES DOWN two more I/O Ports.        D-
     rezz retrieves ROMBALL, bears down on Mega and Krod.

                             RUSH
                Hey! Double points if you nail me!
                Bring it on!

     D-Rezz turns his ugly sights on Rush, baited away from Mega
     and Krod.

     D-rezz flexes and ROARS, revealing an X-NET LOGO on his chest.

                              RUSH
                Stop!    End your routine!

     D-rezz corners Rush, hurls his ROMBALL - Ball fires every
     circuit in its path, bleaching away data energy.

     Rush dodges -

                              RUSH
                Cease!    Desist! We're on the same
                team!

     Mega throws her disk, plings D-rezz on the skull.      D-rezz
     turns on her -

     Rush runs, LEAPS on D-Rezz's back.      Like riding a gorilla -

     D-Rezz flips Rush to the ground, pins him with one mighty
     hand, raises his ROMBALL for the kill.

                            RUSH
                I'm X-Net too!

     Data flows from Rush's body, up D-Rezz's clamping arm.
     Radiant energy between predator and prey.

     Digits race in D-rezz's eyes. A code unlocks. He looks
     down, finally registering the X-Net markings on Rush's outfit.

     D-Rezz lets go of Rush, slumps back on his haunches.       Lowers
     his head in shame.

                            RUSH
                No, hey, hey big guy, don't take it
                so hard. We all have bad days.

                  He was carrying out his programming.
                  All I/O Ports are scheduled for de-

     D-rezz hears this, happy to be understood.       (He never talks.)

                              KROD
                  Easy, big guy. No harm, no foul.

                  D-Rezz, we can use a guy with your
                  raw power. You ready to be a hero
                  for X-Net?

     D-Rezz stands, clutches his ROMBALL.       Reporting for duty.

                               KROD
                  Cool. Now I've got somebody I can

     D-rezz modem-growls at Krod.

                      (grudgingly, to Rush)
                  You have a skill for manipulating
                  other programs.

                              RUSH
                  When do I get a shot at hacking your
                  code?

                              MEGA
                  Never. Our operating systems are
                  incompatible.

                              RUSH
                  You act like I've got a virus.

     They come to a spectacular vista of the OLD GAME GRID.       Low
     resolution, uncool, largely forgotten.

43   EXT.    GAME PORTAL OUTPOST

     Obsolete, abandoned computer game entry portal, guarding
     entry to the old game grid beyond. An electro-tech carnival
     zone gone dark. No life in sight... Then:

     Beam of DATA ENERGY sling-shots at ground level, solidifying
     to become:

     A slender, jumpy Program called I-BEEM. He wears the X-Net
     logo and a cracked disk on his back. He's highly unstable
     and way unplugged from the system (like one of those Japanese
     soldiers still fighting alone in the hills 10 years after
     WWII was over).

     I-Beem sees something - he PANICS, zapping away in
     characteristic streaks of airborne data. He reassembles in
     a hiding place, skittish, observing:

     Rush, Mega, Krod and D-Rezz arrive. See GIANT PILE of GAME
     VEHICLE PARTS blocking access to the grid.

     Rush picks up an old LIGHT WAND.       Krod finds one too.

                               RUSH
                  D-rezz.   Cut a path.

     D-Rezz hurls his Romball, ZAPS into VEHICLE PARTS.       A dent.

                                 KROD
                  That's good.     Keep doing it.

     D-rezz retrieves Romball for another whack -

     ZAP -    DATA ENERGY BEAM snaps in front of them, becoming I-
     Beem.    He grips his rickety disk, challenging them.

                               I-BEEM
                  Violation!   Go away!   Access denied!

                              RUSH
                  Relax, buddy -

     Mega scans I-beem.     He freaks, drops his disk, grabs for it.

                              KROD
                  Pound him to bits, D-rezz.

43   CONTINUED:

     D-Rezz raises his Romball to pulverize I-Beem.

     I-Beem freaks, ZAPS away in his data beam as Romball crashes
     down. I-Beem reforms further way, then beside them - He
     snatches his pancake disk, the zaps away again, emerging
     then high on the pile of parts.

                              RUSH
                  He's wireless.

                              KROD
                  Freaky.

                  "Unstable"! Like they aren't?!
                  They booted me off X-Net! I'll show
                  them! I'm doing my subroutine out
                  here! Nobody gets through this
                  portal!

     He kicks parts - avalanche fills the gap D-rezz blasted.

                              KROD
                  D-rezz, take out this blip.

     D-rezz cocks Romball. I-Beem freaks, sling-shots all over
     the place via his data beam, tossing his wobbly disk.

     Rush catches I-Beem's disk.       Holds off D-Rezz.

                             RUSH
                  Hang on. I-Beem. We're from X-Net
                  CPU. You're doing a great job out
                  here. Everybody knows it.

     Mega throws Rush a look.    I-beem comes up, grateful.

                              I-BEEM
                  They do?!

                              RUSH
                  That's right. Now, have you seen a
                  rogue Program around here? He's
                  red. Super fast. Known as "Tron".

     Data zags to Rush, forming into: I-Beem.       Wide-eyed.

                              I-BEEM
                  Right before you got here.

     Rush trades looks with Mega, Krod and D-Rezz.       Trail is hot.

                              RUSH
                  I-beem, we've got a plan to shut
                  down that red violator. You're going
                  to help us.

                              I-BEEM
                  Let me at him!

                              RUSH
                  First, you've got to let us onto the
                  game grid.

     I-Beem stiffens, reflexively vigilant. He scans the four of
     them again, finally softening. He zaps to a wall near his
     giant barrier, then proudly pushes aside a thin panel. Beyond
     a corridor of game gear, view expanses to reveal:


44   EXT.   OLD GAME GRID

     Rush steps across the vast vector-graphic grid surface.

     Eerie.   Quiet.     Pure.

     Mega, I-Beem, Krod and D-rezz follow.

                              MEGA
                  This region is obsolete.

     Rush kneels, touches grid lines.    Circuits energize, as his
     energy surges in all directions.    He draws in data.

                              RUSH
                  There's bits of Tron's code all over.
                  Krod, give D-Rezz and I-beem the
                  escape coordinate Tron used on me.

     Krod's eyes flash data to I-Beem and D-rezz.      "Tr165444.018".

                               RUSH
                  That's where Tron will bail out.
                  We'll make sure he needs to. Go set
                  up the trap.
                      (to D-rezz)
                  You only get one shot at this, big
                  guy. Stop him but don't destroy
                  him, right? He's got data I need.

     D-rezz grips Romball, grunts affirmation.    He and I-beem
     head for the perimeter of the grid.

                              MEGA
                  If this is Tron's territory, he'll
                  know we're here. He'll hide.

                               RUSH
                  He can't resist a grudge match.
                  He'll take risks trying to beat me.
                  That's how we trip him up.
                      (to Krod)
                  Whip it out.

     Rush unsheathes his LIGHT WAND.

     Krod pulls out his own LIGHT WAND.

     They both look at Mega.

     She's got no light wand.

                              KROD
                  You didn't bring one?

                  Hey, not a problem -

     Krod holds his light wand forward, activates it.    LIGHT CYCLE
     up-rezzes under him. He revs it, ready to go.

                  Hang on, Krod.

     Rush activates his light wand. LIGHT CYCLE up-rezzes under
     him, with a special two tier seat for a second rider.

                              RUSH
                  I upgraded my unit.

                              KROD
                  You are awesome, man.    I hate you.

     Mega considers. There's more on her mind she's not talking
     about. She smiles at Rush, climbs on back of his light cycle.

                               MEGA
                  Mmmm...   Hack me.

     A nod between Rush and Rush - they TAKE OFF.

     LIGHT CYCLES shoot across grid surface.

     Mega screams and clutches Rush, throwing her body against
     his, clamping her arms around him.

     Krod and Rush turn 90 degrees, rallying, passing each other,
     getting warmed up. It's familiar territory.

     Light cycles race toward each other on the same line.

     Mega holds Rush tight, eyes filling with terror.

                              MEGA
                  Resource conflict!    Fatal crash
                  imminent!

     But Krod and Rush slow their light cycles with expert skill,
     rolling safely to a halt, nose-to-nose. Directly over:

     A BIG RED DOT.      The only dot on the grid.

     Grid Center.

     Mega, Rush and Krod raise up to scan the horizon.        It's all
     clear flat grid to the horizon.

                              RUSH
                  Any sign of him?

                              KROD
                  Everything looks the same to me.
                  Everything looks the same. The same.
                  The same.

                              RUSH
                  Krod, snap out of it.

     They watch, wait, pivot.

                                KROD
                  The same...


45   EXT.   EDGE OF GAME GRID

     D-rezz and I-beem search grid edge, along the rocky boundary.
     I-beem zaps himself further along, finding:

     Glowing code numbers mark the end of each grid line.

     D-rezz grunts, points.      One lights up "Tr165444.018"

     They follow the line off the grid, where it leads into a
     narrow rocky pass.

                              I-BEEM
                  Yes, I see. Perfect trap. This is
                  going to be good. Climb, climb!


46   EXT.   GAME GRID / CENTER SPOT

     Rush, Mega and Krod wait on their light cycles.

                                MEGA
                  Its futile.

                                RUSH
                  Look.

     SPECK moves on the horizon, turns a corner, stays on the
     horizon. Another corner. It's a light cycle, making a huge
     box around them.

                              RUSH
                  Remember the plan, Krod. Don't bail
                  out until the last millisecond.

     Lightcycle turns toward them, coming fast.

                              RUSH
                  Hang on tight, Mega.

     Mega hugs Rush.

                                KROD
                  Mmmm.

     They SPEED AWAY.

     Approaching cycle comes at 90 degree angle, turns hard, closes
     the distance.

     It's TRON.    Heartless eyes, ruthless moves.

     Rush turns quick, baiting Tron.      Tron turns to follow, coming
     alongside.

     Krod runs interference, cuts sharp in front of Tron.

     It's a high-stakes speed-chase, narrowly missing side walls
     and rock outcroppings.


47   EXT.   EDGE OF GAME GRID

     I-beem zaps onto the grid, tracks horizon dots.

                              I-BEEM
                  Here they come!

     He zaps back to the edge, signals upward. D-rezz straddles
     the rock passage above, ready to hurl his Romball.


48   EXT.   GAME GRID

     Tron takes the lead in a three-way heat.      Revs to breath-
     taking speed.

     Rush and Krod gain, coming up on either side of Tron.

     Tron looks to each opponent.      His eyes lock on Mega.

     Mega stares into Tron's cold eyes, almost like she's trying
     to signal him. But Tron returns his gaze forward, as the
     ROCKY EDGE looms closer.

                               RUSH
                  Wuss!   You call that speed!?

     Rush kicks in a hyper-burner, surging forward.      Krod does
     the same. Tron responds with more speed.

     Rush and Krod have Tron sandwiched, heading for the rock
     edge. Tron pulls ahead, aiming for the hidden crevasse.

     Mega worries.    Clings to Rush.


49   EXT.   EDGE OF GAME GRID

     D-rezz, astride the crevasse, sees light cycles speeding his
     way. He's got the Rom-ball poised to intercept Tron.

     I-beem de-rezzes into the grid, clearing the path.

     Rush and Krod taunt Tron into the trap...

     But, out of nowhere, Mega reaches to Rush's handlebars and
     turns 90 degrees too soon.

                              KROD
                  Hey, what are you - ??

     Tron sees the bail-out, knows something's wrong. He looks
     ahead, sees D-rezz astride his crevasse escape root, rom-
     ball poised in the air.

     Tron bails out 90 degrees, cutting behind Krod.       Krod turns
     twice, ending up in Tron's lane.

     To the side, Rush's light cycle screams toward solid rock,
     vibrating out of control.

     Rush grabs Mega and JUMPS OFF.       They slide on the grid,
     holding each other.

     Krod's lightcycle heads for the rock escape passage.

                               KROD
                  No!   It's ME!

     Rush and Mega slide to a halt, in time to see:

     Their light cycle SMASHES rocks, explodes in a million bits.

                              RUSH
                  WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!

                                MEGA
                  I-    I GOT SCARED!

     Krod shoots gap.      D-rezz is ready to smash him with his
     Romball.

                               I-BEEM
                  No!   It's Krod! Tron is OVER THERE!

     D-rezz makes mental switch, hurls Romball.

     Romball bounces down solid rock, onto game grid, rolls with
     ferocious speed, DIAGONALLY across the grid.

     Romball curves to track Tron - like a great bowling shot.

     Romball clips rear wheel of Tron's lightcycle.       Lightcycle
     vaporizes. Tron skids and tumbles.

     I-beem zaps beside Rush and Mega.       Krod and D-rezz join them.

     Tron climbs over rocks, escaping through a TUNNEL.

                              RUSH
                  We've got him now.    Let's go!

     WHOOSH! Electro-fire Romball careens across grid, bearing
     down on them.

     Group DIVES CLEAR.

     D-rezz swings in a foot, stopping the Romball - inches short
     of mowing down Krod.

                              KROD
                  I could have done that.

     He strobes, freezes, hits the deck.


50   INT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM TUNNEL

                  We can't go any further.

     Ahead, vast old circuitry has been "eaten through" by dull
     throbbing greenish MEMORY LEAKAGE. Paths of unaffected
     material are narrow and maze-like.

                                RUSH
                  What is it?

                              KROD
                  Don't ask, dude.

                              MEGA
                  It's a memory leak, once it starts,
                  it infects everything.

                              I-BEEM
                  Touch it and you crash forever.     We
                  cannot risk it.

                                MEGA
                  I agree.

     D-rezz grunts.

                              KROD
                  Then it's settled.

                  Stop. Listen to me. You might not
                  believe there's a world outside of
                  this one, but let's just say a guy
                  named Sinclair is depending on me.
                  If Tron got through here, then I can
                  too. Who's with me?

     D-rezz steps forward, then I-Beem.      Shamed, Krod joins them.
     Finally, Mega makes it unanimous.

                              RUSH
                  Good. I-beem, take D-rezz, see what's
                  up ahead. We'll guard this portal
                  until you come back.

     I-beem and D-rezz buddy up and depart on a recon mission.

     Krod pulls off his disk, nervously practices boomerang throws.

                              RUSH
                  Better show me how to use mine.

                              KROD
                  No problem. It's all in the velocity-
                  vector ratio.

     Rush pulls the disk off his own back.      He throws - disk flies
     wild - he runs to retrieve it.

     Mega retreats to a side area, partially eroded by memory
     leakage. She finds the remnants of COM CIRCUITRY and stares
     data beams into its transducer.

     She moves to exit past him.        He snags her arm, pulls her
     back and KISSES HER.

     Energy ZAPS between them, racing through their body circuits.

     Rush downloads the spiky sensation.        Mega remains cold and
     bewildered.

     Outside, Krod tosses his disk, moving to track as it arcs
     through the air. He notices Rush and Mega kissing. Digs it

                  You ram hog!

     leakage. It FRIES and de-rezzes, sucked into the molten

                 Guys!   Go around - behind Tron!

     Rush darts down to help D-rezz. Mega, Rush hurry ahead.     I-
     beem zaps, zags and reforms, scared out of his mind.

     D-rezz hurls his Romball -

     Romball pings off two walls, comes at Tron from behind.

     Tron spins - milliseconds to spare - and flips clear.
     Retrieves his disk on the way down.

     Romball slams off a wall, heads back to D-rezz, but Tron's
     disk HITS IT, knocking it off course.

     D-rezz dives for ROMBALL - but it falls into the memory leak
     and FRIES TO BITS.

     Tron plants for a clear shot at D-rezz.

     Rush JUMPS down from above, right in front of D-rezz.

                               RUSH
                 Ouch!

     His ankle.    He straightens, standing in front of D-rezz.

     Lays eyes on Tron.

                               RUSH
                  Hey!   Pick on somebody your own size!

     D-rezz is twice as big as either of them.

     Tron's eyes are cold, lifeless, calculating.       Scanning his
     new opponent without success.

                              RUSH
                  You've got no data on me.

     Rush pulls his disk off his back, poised for a duel.

     Tron moves with calculation, grips his hyper-etched disk.
     Circling his prey.

     Throws again -

     BRRANGG -

     Rush DUCKS -

     Tron's disk slams D-rezz.     D-rezz tries to catch the disk,
     but he's just too slow.

     Rush throws his disk. Beginner's luck - it banks off a wall
     and nearly smacks Tron. Rush snags it on the way back, before
     it tumbles into memory leakage.

     Tron jumps up two levels.     Retrieves his disk.

                              RUSH
                  D-rezz, pull me up!

     D-rezz hoists Rush up.     Fingers grab upper deck.

     Tron jockeys for position.     Throws disk -

     Disk strikes D-rezz in the ribs.     Blast damage.

     D-rezz loses footing.

     Rush grabs upper level.

     D-rezz slips toward memory leakage.

     Rush grabs D-rezz's hand - he weighs a ton.

     Mega, Krod and I-beem can't get here to help -

                  Hang on, man! HANG ON!

     But D-rezz's big hand slips out of Rush's.

     D-rezz PLUMMETS into memory leakage, zapping away in a blaze
     of glory -

                              RUSH
                  NOOOO!

     He comes to his feet, facing Tron.       Determined.

                              RUSH
                  I know who you are. Encom security
                  program Tr856 - TRON!

     Tron pauses.    Processes.

                              RUSH
                  Who is your User??

     Tron glitches at the question.

                              RUSH
                  Who programmed you?? I know your
                  encryption code. Tell me your User
                  or I shut you down.

     Tron throws his disk.

     Rush dodges. He sends waves of data energy through floor
     circuits, reaching into Tron's body.

                              RUSH
                  I can shut you down with a nine digit
                  code. WHO IS YOUR USER?? 392 -

     Tron's body animates painfully, as the first three code digits
     click into place.

     Tron FLIPS away, breaking contact with floor.        Data transfer
     stops. Tron steals away through a tunnel.

     Rush pursues.

     Krod, Mega and I-beem clamber for a way to follow.


54   INT.   OBSOLETE COMPUTER GAME ARENA

     Circular, riddled with memory leaks.

     Rush hurries to the center.       No sign of Tron.

                  Here's your encryption code! 3-6-2-
                  6-6-8 -

     Rush sends data coursing into floor circuits. It radiates
     up walls, across bridges... And finds TRON in hiding.

     Data races into Tron's body. Six code numbers engage; he
     glitches. He LEAPS to breaks the contact, flinging his disk -

     Tron's disk SLAMS Rush.       Rush tumbles off a ledge, dangling
     over a memory leak.

     Tron pounces in.    Snags his disk.

     Tron steps on Rush's hand.         Pain energy jolts Rush's circuits.

                                RUSH
                  ARRGGHHH!    3-6-2-6-6-8-7 -

     Rush slips, grabs a slim protrusion.         Feet zapping an inch
     from the memory leakage.

     Tron throws his disk for a final time.         It arcs wide, coming
     around directly at Rush.

     Tron leans down, gazing into Rush's eyes.

                                 RUSH
                  362668766!

     Burst of SEARING DATA surges off Rush's hands, radiating up
     circuitry, loading into Tron's body. All nine code numbers
     LOCK in.

     Tron's body seizes. He fights the data intrusion, but his
     circuits sequentially SHUT DOWN.

     Tron's airborne disk wobbles and darkens.

     Tron tumbles off the edge, plummets past Rush.

     Disk misses Rush, skates into darkness.

     Mega, Krod and I-beem hurry in and see:

     Rush, climbing to safety.

     And below: Tron's body slips into the memory leakage, zapping
     away to bits.

                                 KROD
                  You got him!

     But Mega looks dreadfully worried.     She slips away...

     Krod and I-beem climb down and help Rush to his feet.

                              KROD
                  Game over, dude.

                              I-BEEM
                  You crashed him!

     Rush gazes off the precipice. Remains of Tron is consumed
     by the swamp of memory leakage.

                              RUSH
                  It's more than I wanted. Now I'll
                  never know who his User is.

                              KROD

     Krod slams him, makes him stop.

                  Rush, now you can finish pinging
                  Mega's EPROM!

     Rush looks around.

                              RUSH
                  Where is Mega?

                              I-BEEM
                  She was just here.

                              KROD

                              RUSH
                  MEGA??

     Rush searches. He finds Tron's disk, picks it up.     It's
     dark and lifeless, circuits gray.

                              RUSH
                  Mega...

     SOUNDS echo around them.       Coming fast.    Electro-metallic
     footsteps.

     Rush, Krod and I-beem bunch together and pivot.

     Black-clad FINITY FIGHTERS appear, blocking all exits.            Disks
     ready for attack.

     Rush double-takes on faces among them: QUANTZ, tall silent,
     hardcore (looks like real-world Phlegman) And BOOLE, rotund,
     seen it all (like real-world Kelter).

                              KROD
                  I recognize... Trouble.

                              I-BEEM
                  They're scanning us.

                               RUSH
                  I-beem, go for help.      Zap your butt
                  out of here.

     But I-beem freezes, terrified.         Fighters tighten perimeter.

     A hush.   Footsteps.      Clunk-zap...    Clunk-zap.

                              DARK FIGURE (O.S.)
                  It had to happen. But why now of
                  all times?

     Rush and Krod turn.       Fighters defer to:

     A DARK FIGURE, limping forward, one leg badly deformed by
     data corruption.

                              DARK FIGURE
                  A User shows up.

     Rush is surprised, then pleased.         Somebody finally gets it.

                              RUSH
                  Yeah, I'm a User. A superior being.
                  The first to enter this realm. And
                  you are - ?

     Figure's circuitry lights.         Finally, we see the face...

     It is FLYNN.

                                FLYNN
                  The first.

                               RUSH

                  Yeah, he's a lunatic!

     I-beem panics, zaps away in an energy beam. He reforms
     further along for a "breath", then zaps further away. Three
     FINITY FIGHTERS chase him.

     Rush is amazed to find him self in the presence of Encom's
     former leader.

     Flynn comes closer, recognizing Rush.

                              FLYNN
                  Rush Nortebi. I remember hiring

                  Somebody tipped these guys off about

                  Not soon enough.

     Fighters step aside, Mega enters, furious at Rush.

                              MEGA
                  You weren't supposed to beat Tron.
                  I thought for sure he'd finish you.

                                 RUSH

     Mega and Rush ooze mutual contempt.    Rush turns on Flynn.

                              RUSH
                  No wonder I couldn't figure it out.
                  I assumed Tron User was on the
                  outside! If I'd known this, I would
                  blown past him and come straight for

     Flynn yanks Tron's disk from Rush, peers over the precipice.
     Below, the last of Tron is consumed by memory leakage.

     Flynn ponders Tron's lifeless disk. He falters on his bad
     leg. Mega throws an arm around to help him stand. Melancholy
     energy courses between them.

                  You did everything you could.

     They know each other well.

     Rush registers jealousy, but larger concerns prevail:

                              RUSH
                  Flynn never died...
                      (dawning)

                  That's how you got here... I know -
                  that's how I got here too.

     Flynn studies Rush, anger rising.

                              FLYNN
                  The day after I hired you, you start
                  sucking up to Sinclair. You thought
                  I didn't know. Bet he offered your
                  a partnership for this, right? You
                  have no idea the damage you've done.

                              RUSH
                  I'm only getting started. Man, you
                  were the company joke. Now I see
                  why. You melted down your lab to
                  take this little joyride. You got
                  stuck here so all you can do is wreck
                  other people's hard work.

                              FLYNN
                  Open your eyes, geek. My lab was
                  rigged. My "death" was no accident.
                  I pushed the button just in time to
                  escape... Almost in time.

     He indicates his deformed leg.     Mega, Krod and the others
     listen with awed bewilderment.     These two guys speak of a
     world unknown to them.

                              RUSH

     Flynn scowls at Rush. Sin number two.       Flynn slips Tron's

     I-beem de-rezzes, reforms, zaps himself toward the nearest X-

                guy, so I could do the dreaming.
                Right off, he wanted to "capture the
                market" on data transmission. Had
                this plan called "X-Net", based on
                flawless efficiency, hyperlock
                security, encryption protocol
                uniformity. Blah blah. I was the
                boss, I told him to forget it. I
                knew it could go bad. But the guy
                had trouble taking no for an answer.
                He arranged for my lab to melt down.
                Sinclair took over my company and
                put X-Net on a fast-track. And here's
                where it's brought us.

     City descends into panic. X-Takk Troops evict Programs,
     seize prisoners and mercilessly hunt down resistors.

     X-Net Construction Crews build the Optik Highway with
     relentless precision, blasting aside the old city's splendid
     structures.

                            RUSH
                What are they doing??

                            FLYNN
                Beating the competition.

     X-Takk Troops storm closer - by the hundreds.

                            MEGA
                They've got us outnumbered.

                            FLYNN
                We've got to choose our battles
                wisely. This way!

     He leads them down a secret portal, into:

     Group moves along a catwalk, coming to a view of:

     X-Takks herd Captured Resistor Programs, lining them up for
     execution.

                            KROD
                Rush, why is X-Net doing this?!

     A Kid Program runs to this Captured Father Program.

                             KID PROGRAM
                No!   Let my daddy go!

     X-Takks haul Kid Program clear, then BLAST the Captives with
     de-rezz weapons. Captives glitch, thrash and expire.

                            RUSH
                How long has this been going on?

                             FLYNN
                For years.

     Like any other day. Except a high-rise building's lights
     flicker off. A subway escalator stops. A traffic light

     A TV store: All TVs in the window flip to one channel, which
     happens to be running a commercial for X-Net - theme: Total

                Sinclair never told us about this.
                X-Net is creating the very terror
                that makes people want the security
                of X-net!

                  And to think, Rush - all this time,
                  you've been working 24/7, trying to

     X-Takk troops blast Captive Programs.

                              MEGA
                  Tron was our late hope.

                              RUSH
                  We've got to stop this!

     X-Takks hear Rush's shouts.     An overwhelming force.

     Flynn and Mega shove Rush into a tunnel, closing the portal -

     Flynn hastens their journey.

                Rush was trying to expose us!

     Mega, Boole and Quantz move along, shoving Krod and Rush.

                            RUSH
                We've got to tell people on the

                            FLYNN
                Plexor shut down all the I/O ports.
                Only HE communicates with the outside.
                Sinclair holds all the cards.

     Flynn turns on Rush - one of Sinclair's cards.

                            FLYNN
                How did you get here?!

                            RUSH
                Megan Randall sent me.
                    (points out Mega)
                Her User. She fixed your lab and
                sent me here to take out Tron.

                            FLYNN
                Megan Randall? I remember her.
                Smart, wise beyond her years. I
                can't believe she'd fall for
                Sinclair's lies.

     He glances at Mega, then shoves Rush along.


67   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT

     Flynn, Mega, Fighters bring Rush and Krod into the clandestine
     Fighter base. Like a wartime casualty center, with corrupted
     Fighter Programs lining corridors.

                            RUSH
                What happened to them?

                Try to attack Plexor head-on, this
                is what happens. Because of you,
                there will be millions more.

                  Lock up these two. We'll hold them
                  for ransom. Or use them for target
                  practice.

     Flynn and Mega turn to go.      Boole and Quantz use PROD LANCES
     to herd Rush and Krod.

                              RUSH
                  Flynn. You think I'm Sinclair's
                  flunky, but I'm not.

     Flynn pauses.    Rush speaks low, so X-Net Captives can't hear.

                              RUSH
                  I'm sorry about Tron.

                              KROD
                  Yeah, we're - Sorry?

                              RUSH
                  We were just doing a job, we had no
                  way of knowing the truth.

                              KROD
                  No way at all.

                              RUSH
                  Flynn, I was wrong about you. You've
                  been doing the right thing in here.
                  Plexor has to be shut down. Sinclair
                  has to be exposed.

                              KROD
                  Like he said.

                              RUSH
                  Krod and I are ready to help.

                              KROD
                  We are?

     Flynn puzzles over Rush.

                  Mega, what do you read in him?

     Mega's circuits OVERLOAD, she flies back -

     Rush, startled, looks at his finger.

     Fighters muscle Rush and Krod away.

     Flynn holds Mega, anger re-ignited.

     Fighters toss Rush and Krod in the JAIL BLOCK with the BIG X-

                  The User called Flynn is here.

     Sinclair reads the text, blind-sided.         Sees a photo of Flynn.

                              SINCLAIR
                  That's impossible.

74   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT

     Flynn reviews Fighter training. Troops throw disks, battle
     in pairs, repair weapons, tweak armor circuitry.

     Flynn carries Tron's dark disk, contemplating it.       He moves
     past a line-up of his finest Fighters.

                              FLYNN
                  If X-Net is allowed to open it's the
                  beginning of the end of a free and
                  open cyberspace. We can't let Plexor
                  get away with this. Our game plan
                  has not changed. Tron was specially
                  programmed to break into X-Net and
                  shut down power supplies. We would
                  then exploit these weak points and
                  cripple the system. Tron's role was
                  essential One of you must take his
                  place.

     He holds up Tron's disk.

                              FLYNN
                  Who among you can power Tron's disk
                  and carry out his mission?

     All Fighters take a step forward.

                              FLYNN
                  It's the most dangerous job. If
                  you're not up for it, nobody's going
                  to blame you.

     All stand firm.

     Flynn lays Tron's disk in the first Fighter's hands. Fighter
     summons his will, causing the disk to glow faintly. But it
     soon goes dark again.

     Next Fighter holds the disk, bearing down, animating the

     Mega worries: One-by-one, Fighters fail to power Tron's
     disk. Flynn reaches the end of the line.

     Mega puts her hands out to receive the disk.

     Flynn hesitates, then hands her Tron's disk.

     Mega clenches it, concentrating deeply. Her energy infuses
     the disk, animating its circuits stronger than anyone.

     Bur soon, her eyes strobe, her body circuits overload.

     She lets go.    Tron's disk thunks the floor, goes dark.

     Mega hardens her resolve.

                  There are other ways to crash Plexor.
                  I will return to him, he still trusts
                  me. I will get close and crash him
                  with direct contact -

                              FLYNN
                  It's futile. Plexor's personal
                  defense measures are massive.

     Other Fighters chime in, but they don't know what to do.

     A FIGHTER SENTRY dashes in.

     WHAM!

     A wounded Fighter is struck down. Triangular DEATH DISK
     swings wide, takes out another, then the last...

     Mega and Flynn spin to see:

     Plexor steps forward, retrieving his Death Disk.         Blocking
     their exit.

                              PLEXOR
                  Mega, move aside! I will finish
                  him!

     Instead, she shields Flynn's body.

                              MEGA
                  Strike us down. There will always
                  be more to oppose you.

     Sinclair's circuits snap with rage.

                              PLEXOR
                  What programming has he installed
                  in you??

                               MEGA
                  Flynn!   Go with the others!   Run!

                              FLYNN
                  I'm not leaving you with this phreak.

     Plexor brings back his DEATH DISK.

     In the shadows: Rush, creeping along the periphery, gaining
     position on Plexor.

                  Plexor, get over the control thing.

     Plexor readies his disk to FIRE -

                              RUSH
                  Drop the disk!

     He pivots, hurls Death Disk at Rush.

     Rush dives clear, sends his data energy into surrounding
     circuits. Circuits activate around Plexor, surging PAIN
     DATA into his body.

                              FLYNN
                  I'll be damned.

                                MEGA
                  Rush?!

     But Plexor resists Rush's data infusion, freezing the circuits
     around his feet. Cutting off the flow.

     Death Disk slices walls, arcing back toward Plexor -

     Rush LEAPS at Plexor.

     BLANG!

     Plexor is solid-state, like a cast iron statue.    Rush flips
     airborne, goes down hard.

                                RUSH
                  ARRGH!

     Plexor considers Rush, astonished by his audacity.

                              RUSH
                      (sucks air)
                  Is that all you've got?

     It's a millisecond's distraction - Death Disk returns to
     Plexor's hand, but swings wide and GRAZES his ARM, leaving a
     swath of painful CORRUPTION.

                                PLEXOR
                  Raagghh!

     X-Takks hustle in with hefty NEGABYTE BLASTERS.

                                FLYNN
                  Rush!    This way!

     Flynn, Mega and Flynn dash across the bridge.

     NEGABYTE BEAMS slice walls, erasing all data in their path.
     Rush, Flynn and Mega dive into a tunnel, escaping by inches.


90   EXT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT / DATA PIPE

     Rush, Mega and Flynn, pursued, rendezvous with Krod, Boole
     and Quantz.

                               BOOLE
                  This way!   Down the pipe!

     Rush helps Krod, Quantz and Boole into a data pipe.       One by
     one, they WHIRL away in the flow of chromatic data.

     Flynn and Mega have a breathless moment to consider Rush.

                              MEGA
                  He's better than I thought.

                              FLYNN
                  He's been sent for a reason.

                                 MEGA
                  What reason?

                              FLYNN
                  Don't know yet. Sometimes we have
                  to trust the bigger plan.

     Mega struggles to compute.

     Rush turns to help Flynn down the pipe. Mega assists.
     Flynn's wounded leg gives out, he slips. Rush holds him,
     but loses his balance, slides down.

                               RUSH
                  Mega!   Quick! Jump!

     But she hesitates -

     VELCRONIC BEAMS snag her from behind - pulling her back onto
     the ledge.

     Rush tumbles down the flume, glancing back to see:

     Mega, hauled away by X-Takk Troops.

                                 RUSH
                  MEGA!!!

     Fighters, Krod, Rush and Flynn surf down the data WHIRL,
     accelerating away from the hot zone.

     X-Takks jump in after them, but are all swallowed by the
     flow - gone.


91   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT / MAIN HALL

     Bashed and ruined, littered with fallen Fighters.

     Plexor nurses his injured arm, commanding the mop-up.

     X-Takks bring Mega to their leader.

                                X-TAKK 1
                  We got her!

     Mega stands defiant.

     Plexor regards her sternly. Extends his hand to her shoulder,
     cupping the back of her neck.

                              PLEXOR
                  You committed a fatal error.

     DATA ENERGY SURGES from his eyes, flushing her body circuits.
     She fights intensifying input, but soon weakens. She glitches
     and shuts down, falling into the arms of X-Takks.

                              PLEXOR
                  Their strategies and tactics lie
                  encrypted in her memory. Bring her!
                  I will hack from her what I need.


92   INT.   DATA PIPE NETWORK

     Flynn leads the way, surfing the chromatic hyper-speed flow
     with Quantz and Boole.

     Rush and Krod struggle to master the technique, rolling,
     slipping, recovering, grabbing each other.

                              RUSH
                  I got it, I got it, I got it.

     Boole surfs around them, heading into a squirrely curve.

                                KROD
                  AWWWWWWW!

     Krod swings high, out of control.     Dumps in front of Rush,
     who flips him upright.

     Rush and Krod swerve and gathers speed, shooting past Quantz,
     Boole and Flynn - pivoting to surf BACKWARDS!

                              KROD

                              RUSH

     Rush flips up and surfs on his hands.       Krod attempts to match
     the move.

                                 BOOLE
                  Look out!

     Rush and Krod crane around to see:

     DATA PIPE spills into a massive DATA FLUME.

                  AHHHHHHHH!


93   EXT.   DATA FLUME

     Rush and Krod plummet into surging hot data, out of control.

     Flynn and Fighters expertly surf huge waves.


94   EXT.   DATA BUFFER SHORE

     Flynn, Boole and Quantz drag Rush and Krod from data shallows.
     Everyone's circuits are hot and overloaded.

                                KROD
                  I'm cool.    Not a problem.

     They let him go him go.       Krod glitches, collapses.

     Rush gets to his feet, head spinning.

                              RUSH
                  They took Mega.

                  It's like the forty-sixth level of
                  ConquerDome 6.1, while winning a
                  side game of Tetras Ultra, doing six
                  Instant messages and debugging a
                  demo.

     Boole, Quantz and Krod are confused, but Flynn gets it.

                              FLYNN
                  All at the same time.

                               RUSH

     Flynn accepts a handshake from Rush.

                              FLYNN
                  We're going to need all the help we
                  can get. Boole, can we make it to
                  the dark zone from here?

                              BOOLE
                  There is one possible route.

                              FLYNN
                  We'll meet up with the code monkeys
                  and combine forces.

      beams zap them to bits.


97    INT.   REAL WORLD - NIGHT

      Computer Users react with frustration, as their programs

                   side.

                               PLEXOR
                   Where will they strike?

                               MEGA
                   Flynn does not decide until the hour
                   of his attack. But he trusts me
                   completely. When he knows the place,
                   I will know it as well.

                               PLEXOR
                   Perfect. They will be met with a
                   final thrashing. Yes, let them come.

      They pass through the gate, arrive in the corridor.

                               MEGA
                   Have you further instructions for
                   me?

                               PLEXOR
                   None for now. But stay close.

      They lock gazes.     Barcode data surges between them.

                               PLEXOR
                   You came to me full of glitches and
                   random routines. Look at you now.
                   What an extraordinary piece of
                   programming I have made of you. I
                   created X-Net to the same standard
                   of flawless beauty. Soon, its
                   perfection will become all that is,
                   and all that ever will be.

      With a smirk and a final jolt of data, Plexor leaves her.


106   INT.   PLEXOR'S CPU

      Plexor crosses into his inner sanctum. Raises his disk,
      initiates RUBY BEAM link with Sinclair.

      Mega appears on a balcony above, in the shadows, secretly
      observing Plexor.


107   EXT.   DARK ZONE

      Howling, barren, dim.      Circuitry left unpowered for eons.

      Rush and Krod follow Flynn and Fighters, into treacherous
      canyons, across vast planes.

      Rush hears something and pulls the group behind cover.

                                 RUSH
                   Over there!

      Three massive X-NET X-PORTER VEHICLES rumble by. Imprisoned
      in the rear are hundreds of Programs. Cruisers blast a path
      through mountains and speed away.

                               KROD
                   Those Programs think they're just
                   being transferred!

                               RUSH
                   Can we take out those X-Net guys?

                               FLYNN
                   Our forces are too thin. We can't
                   risk a battle that would reveal this
                   position.

      From another direction appear two Code Monkey Programs.

108   INT.   LAST FIGHTER CACHE

      Deteriorating silicon lattice.     Flynn, Rush, Krod and Fighters
      arrive to a meager encampment.

                                CODE MONK N1J
                   Greetings.

                               FLYNN
                   Hey guys. This is Rush and his main
                   man Krod. They defected from Plexor's
                   forces to fight with us.

      A buzz of hope penetrates gloom.       Nobody has defected from
      Plexor before.

                               CODE MONK N1J
                   We made progress decoding X-Net's
                   power supply encryption.

                                FLYNN
                   Excellent.   Let's see.

      In a make-shift lab, CODE MONKEYS demonstrate, working at
      mind-boggling speed, assembling a small intricate HOLOGON
      DEVICE (conical pyramid-shaped encryption key).

                               KROD
                   I've seen that somewhere.

                               RUSH
                   It's the encryption pattern on
                   Plexor's disk.

                               FLYNN
                   Good eyes. We've got Mole Programs
                   who score chunks of Plexor's personal
                   code anywhere they can find it.
                   These guys fit the pieces together.

      Flynn falters on his bad leg.       Quantz and Boole support him.

                               FLYNN
                   Time is running out!

      Rush approaches Code monkeys as they toil blur-speed, trying
      to fit the final code piece - a flat square. Pyramidal
      HOLOGON looks exactly like the X-Net desk toy we saw in Rush's
      cubicle.

                              KROD
                   Yow. I get tired just watching these
                   dudes.

      Rush sees:    Compilers try to fit the square inside the
      pyramid.

                               RUSH
                   Just for laughs, try putting the
                   circle on top of the pyramid.

      Code Monkeys place the square on top of the pyramid.

                   We can break into any X-Net facility
                   and fry the power supply.

                               RUSH
                   But once Plexor knows we have it,
                   he'll change the code.

                   Then we should take out the power

                   home.

                                RUSH
                   But...   Meg said -

                               FLYNN
                   I'm sure she'll do everything she
                   can. It might not be enough.

      Flynn removes a cover-plate from his leg, trying to hide the
      damage from Rush. Suspicious, Rush pulls the plate aside.

                                RUSH
                   Oh, man.

      Flynn's data corruption has worsened. His leg throbs with
      the drab glow of irreversible MEMORY DRAIN.

                               RUSH
                   Why didn't you tell anyone it was
                   this bad?

      Flynn looks at his leg.     Then at Rush.

                               FLYNN
                   Rush. I think Meg suspects the truth
                   about Sinclair.

                   That's why she sent you here. She
                   knew you're the one guy who could
                   find out.

                               RUSH
                   I thought she hated me.

                               FLYNN
                   She believed in you more than you
                   believed in yourself.

      It sinks in.    Wow.

                               RUSH
                   Do we really have a shot at winning
                   against Plexor?

                               FLYNN
                   We have his master key. And we have
                   Mega working on the inside.

                               RUSH
                   Mega... Are you sure about her? I
                   get the feeling she plays both sides.

                               FLYNN
                   Plexor programmed her to perform his
                   will. He's a control freak. I'm
                   not. I programmed her to have a
                   will of her own. Whatever she
                   decides, it's up to her.

                               RUSH
                   Sounds dangerous.

                                FLYNN
                   Sometimes you've got to trust the
                   bigger plan.

      Krod and Fighters approach.

                   Guys... Rush is right about our
                   final attack. If we've only got one
                   shot, we should go for Plexor's
                   central server. If we insert the
                   hologon key in the main power supply,
                   we can trigger a meltdown. Plexor
                   will be have his best troops standing
                   in our way.

                   Getting past them was the ultimate
                   task I programmed Tron to carry out.

      He takes up Tron's dark disk.

                               FLYNN
                   I turbo-charged him to burn hot and
                   burn fast. Who else could handle
                   the operating code in this disk?

      He extends the disk to Rush.

                               FLYNN
                   You.

                               RUSH
                   Uhhh, I don't think so.

                               BOOLE
                   It could mean the difference between
                   winning and losing.

                               KROD
                   Hey, I'll try.

      Rush holds off Krod, takes the disk.

                               RUSH
                   What do I do - ?

      Waves of Rush's DATA ENERGY surge into disk circuitry.

                               RUSH
                   Yow!

      He buckles and shakes.    Hands zapping.    Knees trembling.

                                FLYNN
                   Steady. It's all about giving as
                   much as you get. Let it become a
                   part of you.

      Rush clenches teeth, concentrates.     Grips the disk.

      Energy surges back and forth, up Rush's arms, around the
      disk. He holds tight, ready to scream -

                               KROD
                   Awesome, dude! Don't let go!

      Fighters are amazed, as TRON'S DISK POWERS UP -

      And RUSH'S body circuits DAZZLE in the ruby circuitry patterns
      of TRON.

                   Damn, look at that...     He did it.

      Rush looks at his arms, astounded. His circuitry strobes in
      hues of brilliant red. Disk animates and unfolds, revealing
      infinite surface variations.

      Rush feels new power surging inside his body. His eyes
      harden, keen like Tron's. Rush LEAPS BACKWARD, goes airborne,
      lands on a ledge high above. Amazing balance.

                                KROD & FIGHTERS
                   YES!   Excellent move, dude!

                                 RUSH
                   It feels...    Awesome.

      Rush's voice is a little deeper, with a digital edge.       It
      surprises him.

      He cocks his disk and THROWS.

      Disk rockets across the landscape, a mile away and STRIKES
      an X-NET SURVEY POST, blasting it to bits. Disk arcs high,
      shoots back toward Rush.

      Rush looks worried for a second, ready to duck -

                               FLYNN
                   Don't flinch, Rush!   It's your disk
                   now.

      Disk snaps back into Rush's hand, painlessly.       Throbbing
      with energy.

                               RUSH
                   Oh man, this is good.

      Rush pulls a new LIGHT WAND from a thigh bracket. It extends
      into a hundred-foot vaulting pole. Rush VAULTS across the
      canyon, lands with precision. Light pole retracts into the
      wand in a nanosecond.

                                KROD
                   Awwwww!   Where can I get one of those?

      Another two vaults and a leap - Rush tosses his disk into a
      spiral, steps off it mid-air (like stairs), and lands
      perfectly - rejoining the group.

      Cheers from Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys.       Flynn
      shakes Rush's hand - energy surges between them.

      weapons.

      Widen to reveal:

      BATTALION of X-Takks, lined in precise rows, filling the
      vast hall. Since Adolf Hitler, no one has displayed such an
      awesome military machine.


112   INT.   PLEXOR'S INNER SANCTUM

      Mega sneaks in, alone. She pulls her disk off her back and

      A RUBY BEAM converges off her disk, reaching skyward.

      Cybavor comes alive.     Circuits RAGING.    Eyes pulsing.

      Plexor summons an X-Net Worker Drone.

      Cybavor leaps like a hyena, bounds the length of the hall.
      DIVES at the Worker Drone...

      And DEVOURS HIM mercilessly.

      Energy sparks fly, circuits zap, as the Cybavor digest the
      energy, GROWS LARGER, then SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE (like DNA),
      then regrows the missing halves.

      Now the Cybavor is a PAIR of nasty, snarling Cybavors.

115   EXT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER

      On the fortress perimeter, X-Takks stand watch at the base
      of a deep security moat.

      They turn, eyes scanning. Behind them, a LIGHT POLE extends
      into the canyon, then swings across.

      It's "tronified" Rush, using his vaulting pole to ferry
      Fighters across the moat edges.

      He returns to the far side, landing momentarily on a lone
      central pinnacle to make the distance.

      Rush vaults back to gather Krod, who's the last to cross.

                               RUSH
                   Don't take this the wrong way.

                   Don't drop me.

      He hugs Krod and vaults them across.    Krod clings and
      struggles, then YELPS -

      X-Takks hear and scan the pinnacle and moat edges.

      On top of the pinnacle, Rush and Krod hunker.      Flynn signals
      from the far side "stay down!"

      X-Takks patrol below, pausing to gaze up.

      Atop the pinnacle, Krod's circuits energy-zap with fear.
      Rush holds him down.

      At last, X-Takks move on.

      Rush extends his light pole to the moat floor - vaults to
      the far side with Krod.

      Krod stabilizes, looks around.

                               KROD
                   Yeah, I recognize this place.    I

      Code Monkeys, Flynn and Krod, Quantz and Boole dive between
      Rush's legs, emerging on the other side. Barrier overcome.

      Rush leaps out of the firewall, clutching his white-hot disk.

                   No sweat.
                       (to himself)

      Plexor - with Mega and the Cybavors two paces behind - leads
      an army of X-Takks.

      A Cybavor growls at Mega.          She growls back.

                   There it is.     That's the portal.

      Plexor masses his forces around a closed ENCRYPTION PORTAL.
      It is a dark semispheric aperture, left unlocked (but closed).

      X-Takks come from all directions, all levels.

      Flynn pauses to see X-Net Patrols in motion, across bridges,
      through tunnels. All around.

                   shuts down. And the more of us come
                   out of here to tell about it.

      Rush takes the hologon, stows it.

      Pumped looks between Code Monkeys, Boole and Quantz.           Krod

      X-Takks stand thick, weapons pointed at the closed aperture.

      Plexor marks time.    Cybavors poise to attack.

      Mega, emotions rising, takes a step back.


122   EXT.   DARK PORTAL

      Flynn falters on his wounded leg.     Fighters steady him.

      Rush steps forward, places a hand on the semispheric aperture.
      Mechanism activates.


123   INT.   PORTAL

      Plexor tenses, eager for the slaughter.

      X-Takks cock weapons, take careful aim.

      Cybavors use energy "food" to bifurcate into FOUR.

      Mega RUNS from the scene. Around a corner, she collides

      She glances over the new "tronified" Rush. Despite herself,
      she's impressed. But there's no time for talk.

                               RUSH

      X-Takks are upon them, and the battle is joined.

      X-Net disks fly by the hundreds.

      Krod and Code Monkeys fire a SQRAM projectile, which opens
      mid-air into a super-wide circular magnetic field "net".

      SQRAM field sucks in X-Net disk and zaps them to ash.

      X-Takks charge.

      Rush flips down from above, throws tron-disk -

      Disk ricochets of ten X-Takks, mows them down.

      Rush retrieves his disk, lands near Krod and Fighters.

                               RUSH
                   Block this choke point, slow them

                   Not a problem.

      He throws his disk behind his back, takes out an approaching
      X-Net goon.

      Rush hurries away with Mega and Flynn.

      Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys are besieged by a hundred
      X-Takks.

      Flynn hobbles, helped by Mega.     Rush leads them around a
      corner, in sight of:

      MAIN POWER SUPPLY.     Massive reactive CORE CONTAINMENT CUBE.

      Rush comes to the edge of a deep, narrow moat. Bottom is      a
      channel of ROILING, MOLTEN CHROMATIC DATA. No bridges.

                             RUSH

      Rush and Mega dodge, fling their disks with lethal accuracy -

      X-Takks crash and fall, tumbling into the moat abyss, flashing
      as they hit the molten bottom.


128   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER CORRIDORS

      Krod, Boole and Quantz bait a phalanx of X-Takks, Code Monkeys
      spring a DEGAUSSING CHARGE, which cuts off a column at the
      base. Column tumbles, crashing X-Takks, blocking the way.

      High fives among Krod and Fighters.

      One Small X-Takk breaks through, ZAPPING through the air,
      reforming, ZAPPING CLOSER.

      Fighters turn to blast him.

      But Krod recognizes the pattern:

      X-Takks attack the group, including I-beem.

      I-beem zaps away, reappearing next to an X-Takk. He steals
      the X-Takk's NEGABYTE BLASTER and mows down three X-Takks,

      Rush extends his Light Pole to the ledge, moves to gather

      It's bravado: They know his odds are dismal. Flynn slumps
      into an alcove, which is only big enough for him. He pulls
      a supply of SPIKED MINI-DISKS, ready to defend himself.

      Rush throws his arm around Mega and VAULTS across the moat,
      landing on the far side - gaining a slim foot-hold below a
      core ENTRY POINT.

      Flynn chooses his moment, leans out and throws. His mini
      disks take out X-Takks on the ledge. Their bodies tumble
      into the moat, flashing as they hit.

      Flynn spins, the wall behind him opens.       At the end of a
      square corridor stands:

      PLEXOR.   Flanked by his four snarling Cybavor beasts.

                                PLEXOR
                   Flynn. Your moment of obsolescence
                   is upon you.

      Across the moat, Rush and Mega climb to the entry point.

      Flynn plays for time, stalling Plexor so he doesn't catch
      sight of them.

                               FLYNN
                   Freedom, Plexor. It's the better
                   idea. That's why Mega chose my side.

                   removed, X-Net will simply BE.

      With a hand signal, he commands his Cybavors.         They raise
      up, poised to attack Flynn.

                               FLYNN
                   Crash me. Hack me. Do what you

      All four Cybavors pounce on Flynn, hurling him off the ledge,
      mauling him as they go down, dividing into eight - Plummeting
      toward the MOLTEN DATA far below.

      Plexor steps out of his corridor, relishing the view:      Remains

      Rush and Mega duck inside entry point, pelted by disks.

      Before them: A vast, brilliant, energized LATTICE. Power
      surges in rings, drawing down huge columns. Every piece of
      geometry is based on perfect squares, made of mirror-finished
      rare earth elements.

      Rush pulls the HOLOGON KEY into view. Facets resonate with
      energy patterns like those in the core.

                             RUSH
                 We plug this into the control cell,
                 X-Net is history.

                             MEGA
                 Let's do it for Flynn.

      They share a heartbeat of solidarity.      Rivalry gone.

      X-Takks stream in, firing.

      Rush and Mega charge the center, throwing disks, fighting
      back-to-back.

131   CONTINUED:

      Problem is, ENERGY RINGS move continuously down the columns -
      and the columns are spaced close - leaving just enough time
      between ring-passes to jump through.

                                  RUSH
                   NOW!

      He and Mega JUMP, nearly raked by down-flowing ENERGY RINGS.

      X-Takks fire NEGABYTE BLASTERS - but many of the beams are
      caught in the energy flow and sucked away. That's how intense
      this place is.

      X-Takk Soldier is grazed, stumbles into ENERGY COLUMN. RING
      rakes down and ZAPS him nasty - reducing him to bits, sucking
      his energy to the levels below.

      Rush and Mega encounter oncoming X-Takks - they must split
      up. They fling disks, taking out X-Takks, dodging fire -
      working their way deeper.

      Meg and Rush throw their disks simultaneously.     Both disks
      score hits, then arc to return.

      Rush and Mega catch each other's disk. They each look at
      the strange disks - it's just not the same. The do a quick
      swap and keep fighting.

                                  MEGA
                   Over there!

      The CONTROL CELL.    Dead center.


132   INT.   CONTROL CELL CHAMBER

      Rush and Mega battle off three X-Takks - the way is clear.

      Rush leaps, crashes planes of silicon.     Stows his disk, pulls
      out the HOLOGON.

      Spots the control cell's key receptacle - SHAPES MATCH.

      Rush moves to insert the hologon.

      A DISK STRIKES his arm - HOLOGON flies wild.

                                  RUSH
                   AAARRGGGHHH!

      PLEXOR drops from above, riding an OPTIK SHAFT.

                               PLEXOR
                   Where did you get that?!   No one
                   knows this code but me!

                               RUSH
                   Your software has the biggest flaw
                   there is, Plexor. You can't see you
                   own mistakes.

      Plexor snatches his Death-disk, corners Rush for the kill.

      Mega's disk crashes silicon, comes at Plexor - But his
      defense field repels it. He slams it aside and it's raked
      away by downward flowing energy rings.

      Rush DIVES at PLEXOR. He's like a statue. But this time
      RUSH holds him and infuses tron-energy, breaking down Plexor's
      defense field, eating into his body circuits. It's fractal
      zapping fireworks - evenly matched foes battling face-to-
      face.

                                 RUSH
                   Do it Mega!

      Mega scoops HOLOGON off floor, makes for CONTROL CELL -

      Plexor's hand shoots out, GRABS HER, stops her like iron.

      Plexor exerts his power, holds Rush and Mega by the throats
      with his two hands, backing them toward a surface ripping
      with HOT ENERGY RINGS.

      Rush and Mega struggle, an inch from death -

      ZAAAAAA -

      Plexor stops, annoyed.      Turns and sees:

      Krod, Fighters and I-beem have arrived, firing blasters at
      Plexor's SPINAL NEXUS. It hardly makes a dent, but it creates
      a fleeting opportunity for Rush -

      Rush ducks forward, SHOOTS his disk off his back, smacking
      Plexor in the throat. Mega falls clear -

      Rush hurls Plexor against energy rings - Energy rakes down
      his body, but he fights the effects an DOES NOT MELT DOWN.
      He step away, shakes off the damage, retrieves his disk into
      a hand.

      Mega snags the hologon -

                                 MEGA
                   RUSH!

      She tosses it to Rush, who's already airborne -

      Rush catches hologon, sails to the control unit -

      Jams hologon into its receptacle.

      Plexor cocks his death disk, EYES FLASH ELECTRO-PSYCHOSIS -

      Hologon REACTS with CENTRAL CELL -

      Shockwaves RADIATE -

      Energy rings go dim, then dark -

      Silicon shatters to ash -

      X-Takks power down. X-Net armor de-rezzes, leaving innocent
      civilian Programs. They shake off the mind-control and rise
      unshackled.

      And Plexor, like all things X-Net, chatters and glitches.
      His code erodes, his bits darken, the fiber of his being
      erodes from inside.

                               MEGA
                   Now who's obsolete?

      Rush executes a final leap, extending his feet for the final
      blow, straight at Plexor - CRASH - shattering him to bits.

      Rush finally breathes.       Sees I-beem, Krod, Quantz, Boole,
      Code Monkeys.

                                  RUSH
                   Thanks guys.

                               KROD
                   I'll never let you forget it.

      Boole tosses Rush his tron-disk.


133   EXT.   CYBERSPACE VISTA POINT

      Rush, Mega, Krod, I-beem, Fighters and liberated Programs
      stow disks and step to a high vantage point.

      Before them expands a vista of cyberspace.

      Power-down of X-Net radiates in all directions, leaving
      everything else intact. Beautiful, exotic old data networks
      instantly begin to regenerate into the open space.

                                  MEGA
                   We're free.     At last we're free.

134   EXT.   X-NET GRAND OPENING CEREMONY - MORNING

      Sinclair commands the podium:

                             SINCLAIR
                 In a world exposed to increasing
                 data corruption, I hereby switch on
                 the first global network offering
                 100% guaranteed data security.
                 Flawless performance, zero downtime.
                 The world works hard, the world
                 deserves...

      He throws a switch. HUGE monitors blaze with X-Net logos
      and graphic portals. Countdown 3,2,1...

                              SINCLAIR
                 X-NET!

      CROWD CHEERS.   MEDIA BUZZES...

      X-Net instantly CRASHES.    All screens jam, glitch and DIE.

      Crowd is stunned.    Sinclair is mortified.


135   EXT.   CYBERSPACE VISTA POINT

      Krod, I-beem, Boole, Quantz and Code Monkeys CHEER.

      Mega embraces Rush.    Energy sizzles between them.

                             MEGA
                 I underestimated you.   Thanks.

      She presses her lips to his.    It's electric.

                             KROD
                     (to I-beem)
                 You knew she always liked him.

                             CODE MONK B3T
                 Is she pinging his EPROM?

                             CODE MONK J2R
                 I can't see from here.

      But out of triumph, a sudden concern -

      Rush's body shoots DATA ENERGY into Mega, into ground
      circuits... Lightshow overload intensifies and spreads.
      Mega backs away in pain.

                               MEGA
                   Rush, what is it?

      Rush's body DRAINS AWAY into the energized circuitry.

                                   RUSH
                   Guys!   Mega!     NOOO!

      He reaches a hand to Mega.          PAIN ENERGY ZAPS her, but she
      clasps his hand anyway...

                                   KROD
                   Help him!

      Code Monkeys attempt desperate measures, but soon it's over.

      Bits of Rush dissipate into surrounding circuitry, then BEAM
      SKYWARD in blazing curtain, like a quantum aurora borealis.

      Mega is left with a handful of nothing.

                               QUANTZ
                   It's the way it should be.

                   He's going back to the place he
                   belongs.


136   EXT.   CYBERSPACE TRANSITION

      Rush's energy body hurls across cyberspace.

      Bits streak, light bends -


137   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - NIGHT

      Rush materializes in the target chair.          Human flesh, real
      clothes. Same as the moment he left.

      He bolts up, realizes where he is.          Looks at his hands.
      Sees Jo-jo the rat staring at him.

      Meg and Dewey hurry over to unstrap Rush.          Meg holds his
      hands, checks the integrity of his body.

                                MEG
                   Rush.   You made it!

                   Like a bad cold, I'm always coming
                   back.

                                 VOICES
                   He made it!    Rush! You okay?!

      Rush looks around. Miles ("Krod") and a group of oddly-
      familiar Co-WORKERS. People who look just like I-beem,
      Quantz, Boole and the Code Monkeys.

                               RUSH
                       (double-takes on Meg)
                   I met a program you wrote. She's
                   just as incredibly beautiful and
                   confusing as you.

                               MEG
                   I know. Mega told me all about what
                   you did in there.

                               RUSH
                   She gave you my coordinates.     That's
                   how you uploaded me?

                                MEG
                   Yes.   Your coordinates...     and his.

      They look across the room.

      At the control console stands a MAN with his back to us.
      He's curiously examining Meg's equipment.

                               THE GUY
                   She's done an amazing job here, Rush.

      He turns.    It's FLYNN.    In the flesh.    Leg healed.

                                 RUSH
                   Flynn!

                               FLYNN
                   I told you to trust the bigger plan.

                               MEG
                   I'd come to suspect Flynn was alive,
                   inside. But I had no way to know
                   for sure.

                               FLYNN
                   You picked the right guy to send in.

                   Working down here, I became convinced
                   someone tried to murder Flynn. But
                   the only person I could confide in
                   was the guy I suspected most.

      Elevator opens.

      Sinclair charges in, furious.    Trailed by SECURITY MEN.

                               SINCLAIR
                   What are you people doing down here!?!
                   Get back to work! X-Net has CRASHED!
                   We'll all be ruined!

                               FLYNN
                   Speak for yourself, Sinclair.

      Sinclair wheels to see Flynn: Alive, standing in front of
      him. Trapped by the ugly truth, Sinclair turns rage on Meg.

                               SINCLAIR
                   I ordered you to destroy this
                   equipment!

      Rush gets in Sinclair's face.

                               RUSH
                   Hey, jerk, she doesn't do your dirty
                   work. Neither do I. Not anymore.
                   You lied to me, to all of us. You
                   want to deal with somebody? I'm the
                   guy who crashed X-Net.

      Sinclair goes for Rush. Rush delivers a solid punch.
      Sinclair grabs his bloody nose.

                               SINCLAIR
                   You're fired, everybody get out.

                               FLYNN
                   No, Sinclair. I'm back. And I'm
                   the boss again. You're fired. Not
                   only are you fired, you're going to

                   the SEC, the Justice Department and

                       (to SECURITY MEN)
                   Hold him until the police get here.

                   Yes Sir, Mr. Flynn.

      SECURITY MEN haul out Sinclair.

                   X-Net is dead. But Encom lives.
                   We're going to bring this company
                   back to its place as the leader in
                   finding the next big thing. I'll

                   So, effective immediately, I'm
                   appointing two bold, bright,
                   courageous people to head worldwide
                   operations.

      He presents Rush and Meg.        They're stunned.

                               FLYNN
                   You both earned it.

                       (to Phlegman)
                   Does that mean a bigger cubicle?

      Cheers all around.    Flynn approaches Rush and Meg.

          EXT. VIETNAM -- DAY

          A HUEY COBRA in slow motion, crests an impossibly
          beautiful jungle ridge, flying low and straight at us.

          INSIDE THE COBRA
          A GUNNER sprays fire down at unseen anti-aircraft. All
          that can be see on the ground are whizzing TRACERS flying
          up at the chopper.

          

          

          

          
          "Tropic Thunder 4.
          The chopper skims the treetops heading toward a hot LZ...

          EXT.,, HOT LZ -- DAY

          As the Cobra comes in hard, about TWENTY INFANTRYMEN are
          emerging from the tree-line, in a chaotic fire fight with
          twice as many VC SOLDIERS.
          As the. chopper tries to land, the gunner tosses a couple
          of grenades behind the Americans, sending about ten VC
          flying. But the bulk of the platoon is getting GUNNED
          DOWN by the enemy.
          A. heavy set grunt, FATS, looking like he is in great
          pain, is'running full speed for the chopper, taking fire
          from all over.
          Fats looks a 'lot like JEFF PORTNOY, star of ."Doody For
          Dinner".
          BROOKLYN, an.18 year-old cherry from Brooklyn, is also on
          the move, towards the.chopper...Clutching his thick black
          glasses, and a. map, and triangulating coordinates, he' is
          frantically trying to call in an air strike on his radio
          backpack. A GRENADE EXPLODES ten feet away knocking him
          on his ass.
          He gets up, shaken, just in time to be BAYONETED. through
          the stomach by a VC SOLDIER...
          The VC soldier turns around just in time to be machine-
          gunned down-5y MOTOWN who has all sorts of stomizd
          shit" on his fatigues, an ace of spades in his helmet,
          along with some graffiti scrawl that reads "and God
          spoke" including cut-off sleeves that reveal his
          impressive pipes. He, is a 'bad muthaf.ucka.

          MOTOWN
          That's for Brooklyn, Muthafucka!
          Underneath the hovering chopper, OSIRIS,a black, buffed
          out Rambo-looking Sergeant, is letting loose his M-16
          with abandon, yelling at the pilot to get the bird lower.
          It does.
          Fats grabs. the mortally wounded Brooklyn and slings him
          over his shoulder, Brooklyn's shirt is blown open
          revealing his entrails...in shock, he clutches his liver
          in his right hand, and is trying futilely to put it back
          in his body...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 5.
          FATS heaves Brooklyn onto the floor of the still-airborne
          chopper just as it gets low enough, and returns to
          firing. He unleashes a hailstorm of lead at the
          approaching VC...

          OSIRIS

          FATS! GET YOUR ASS ON THIS CHOPPER NOW!

          LET'S MOVE!

          4 41
          FATS ignores him and continueb firing. MOTOWN comes
          running up to the chopper...

          in about thirty seconds!
          Osiris turns on Motown, pulling his .45 in the midst of
           the mayhem. He pushes it up into Motown's neck.

          OSIRIS

          FOUR LEAF IS DEAD MEAT, SOLDIER! AND YOU

          GOT ZERO 0' HUNDRED HOURS TO GET YOUR ASS

          ON THIS CHOPPER BEFORE YOU JOIN HIM!
          Osiris, standing on the skid, motions for the chopper
          pilot to take off.

          chopper...It begins to hover...

          .We PUSH IN ON BROOKLYN dramatically as he raises his
          head. Looking off to the tree line, he points a crooked
          finger...

          BROOKLYN
          It's him. It's Four Leaf...
          Everyone turns to-see...
          FOUR LEAF, who looks a lot like CHRIS MICHAEL SPEEDMAN
          from the "Scorcher" trailer, . burst through the treeline,
          half limping, half crawling heroically through the
          massive firefight in SLOW MOTION.
          He is being chased.by about-FIFTY _VIET...CONG SOLDIERS...
          Everyone on board seems mesmerized. Osiris sees it, and
          can't believe his eyes... nevertheless, he screams to the
          pilot. I

          OSIRIS

          GO! GO!
          Fats, still on the ground, in defiance of Osiris, grabs
          the chopper's runner, and in a superhuman show of
          strength, OR IS IT WEIGHT, holds it with-all-his might,
          preventing it from flying away.
          The pilot struggles with the controls, as Fats continues
          his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm,
          providing weak cover for Four Leaf.
          The chopper is now gaining momentum, and pulls Fats about
          ten feet-off-the ground. He is, about to lose his battle
          with the helicopter.
          Four Leaf, riddled with bullets, and delirious, is
          fighting a losing battle to gain ground... He doesn't
          even have a gun...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 7.
          Osiris looks at the dejected faces of his men, then at
          Fats... a flash of anger and compassion comes over his
          face.. .
          FOUR"LEAF, Christ-like and arms extended, sinks to his
          knees, his body now absorbing unbelievable amounts of
          lead...

          OSIRIS

          I HOPE YOU FAGGOTS LIKE HAMBURGER BECAUSE

          THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA BE

          BRINGING BACK TO THIS BIRD.. .COVER ME!
          Weak smiles flicker across the face of the men as they do
          just that... unleashing lead all around Osiris as he jumps
          out of the chopper like an Apache warrior.
          Fats drops off the runner of the chopper, shooting his
          machine gun in cool SLO MO.
          Screaming a war cry, Osiris makes a beeline for Four
          Leaf. Dancing between the raindrops, he dodges tracer
          fire ...
          Osiris finally makes it and kneels beside Four Leaf,
          cradling his head. Four Leaf's eyes are glassy, and his
          body and arms are ripped open all over like a rag doll.

          FOUR LEAF
          Get outta here. I'm worm food, man, you
          dig?

          OSIRIS
          (beginning to cry)
          What, and give up all that California
          pussy you been talking about? Shiiit.
          Someone's gotta show me around L.A...

          FOUR LEAF
          (cracking a bloody smile)
          Shit. . .the only way you're gonna get a
          piece of LA pussy if is you go out to the
          graveyard and dig some up...
          Osiris looks down at Four Leaf's now missing arms...

          OSIRIS
          Well ...y...you better come along and
          bring the shovel...
          He starts to choke up.

          gonna see another sunset.
          (long philosophical beat)
          Why does a man want to pick up sticks
          against another man... 'Stead of usin'
          them sticks. to prop a man up?
          Osiris nods, now crying like a baby... ï¿½4Id Iu I. Igft

          DON'T YOU DIE ON ME FOUR LEAF... .THAT'S AN

          ORDER!!!

          FOUR LEAF
          (beginning to fade)
          Hold my hands... 'cause I got somethin'
          to say...
          Osiris looks down.at Four. Leaf's bloody, stringy stumps.
          There's nothing to hold...

          FOUR LEAF
          Are, you holding them?

          OSIRIS_

          (WEEPING)
          Oh, I'm holding them..

          FOUR LEAF
          I ain't never been worth a. nothin' in
          this life, and it's kinda late to start
          b e i' a somethin' now. But you... you
          are my... b-b-brother.
          Four Leaf screws.up.his .face and begins to cry--except
          that he can't. He tries again... and can't.. Hescrews
          up his face grotesquely...

          FOUR LEAF
          You are my...
          WE NOW PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are actually on location
          shooting this war scene with about 50 CREW MEMBERS
          watching, surrounded by millions of dollars worth of film
          equipment.
          Four Leaf, actually the superstar. playing him, Speedman,
          is getting increasingly self-conscious, becoming more and.
          more aware of the-crew waiting for him to cry.
          The actor playing Osiris, KIRK LAZARUS, is also getting
          uncomfortable holding Speedman's not-crying head.

          TRAILER, now he is AFRICAN AMERICAN and speaks with an
          American accent-- IT WILL BE EXPLAINED SOON!)
          The person perhaps most upset about it all is the skinny'
          young British director, DAMIEN DORFMAN. Coiled at the
          monitor and covered in bug bites and sunblock, wet towels
          around his neck, and clearly not made for jungle
          life.. .he' mouths the words "you are my brothers..'." as
          if trying to will the tears from Speedman's dry eyes.

          SPEEDMAN
          (breaking character)
          I'm sorry, can we cut, Damien?
          Damien grips his headphones in confusion, looking around
          to his cadre of assistants and ADs...
          The chopper continues to hover, soldiers continue to
          fight, except a few are starting to wonder what's going
          on.

          SPEEDMAN
          CUT! We gotta cut, Dorf!

          DAMIEN

          (CONFUSED)
          What? What did he say?
          (to 1st AD)
          Play it through! Still rolling!
          Now the extras have stopped fighting -- except for a few
          way far back.

          1ST AD
          Play it through! Still rolling!

          SPEEDMAN
          No! Not still rolling! Cut!
          Damien runs towards Speedman.
          Fats, who is young fat comedy gross-out star JEFF
          PORTNOY, gets up from the ground, rubbing his butt.

          PORTNOY
          OW, SHIT! I fell right on my ass bone!
          Other "dead" extras begin to hold their heads up and look
          around. Some are amputee stuntmen.

          director. Tekkies scurry around, lots of confusion. Are
          they cut, or what?
          Brooklyn,'.played by the not-famous KEVIN SANDUSKY,Ihold s
          his bloody "liver" up to hand off to someone.

          SANDUSKY:
          Mr. Dorfman? Are we cutting sir? Cause .I
          think they put w ay too much blood in my
          liver again.

          DAMIEN
          STILL ROLLING! Get down Kevin, you're
          dead!
          Sandusky immediately complies, he seems to be the only
          actor listening to the director.

          SPEEDMAN
          I'm sorry.. I can't do it, Dorff.
          Damien runs up to Speedman. They are the center of
          attention -- the whole crew watching them.

          DAMIEN
          It's good, keep going. This is a big shot
          so keep going, let it come. No arms,
          you're hanging on, it's-al-1-coming out...
          It's real, death, life, brotherhood and
          we just... let's keep it going now...
          He starts to back out, turning his finger in the "still

          up a bank -- Speedman in drag. They yell at each other

          ."Simple Jack", the story-of a mentally
          impaired farm hand who can "talk" to

          story of war hero Four Leaf Tayback in

          (very serious)
          All I want is to make the real Four Leaf
          here proud. It's his story, he lived it
          and wrote it in his book. That's why
          we're here. But really, I mean, how cah
          we begin to understand what he-- what you
          --went through?
          Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for
          a beat. He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only
          two HOOKS.
          Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying
          to "get inside" him as much as possible.

          But the good news for Damien Dorfman and
          his troops -- the Oscar buzz is already
          starting! So for El News I'm Julie--
          All of a sudden Portnoy, wearing a Tropic Thunder cap all
          askew and surfer shorts with no shirt, bursts out of the
          bushes. He screams wildly and GRABS Julie, who cracks up
          laughing at his "stunt". '

          Me so horny!! Me so horny!!
          He jumps into the pool with her! What a crack up!

          EXT. RUN DOWN "RESORT" HOTEL -- DAY

          It is the one hotel in the area, and it looks like it has
          been through a war, which it probably has. It has been
          taken over as the Tropic Thunder production headquarters.
          We see a mix of PRODUCTION PEOPLE and HOTEL WORKERS.

          VOICE OF TODD
          We're shutting you down, Dorf.

          INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY

          Damien sits behind his desk, looking scared. Vietnam
          photos, maps, and sketches cover the walls. Standing in
          the office are ASSORTED CREW, including Cody and Four
          Leaf, who whittles a stick with his hooks, never looking
          up.

          They are all staring at a speaker phone.

          DAMIEN
          You can't do that Todd.

          VOICE OF TODD I
          Yes we can.. The dailies are not good.

          DAMIEN
          Dailies are always bad! Bad dailies, good
          movie! Isn't that what they say?

          VOICE OF TODD
          I never heard that saying. Look, Damien.
          Fact: You're. three weeks behind and
          you've been shooting for five days. Fact:
          we greenlit this project at a very
          specific number, a number Walter and I
          could get in bed. with, and fact--.

          (starting to lose it)
          Todd, it really isn't necessary for you
          to,keep saying "fact" before everything.
          It's kind of implied, that if you are
          saying.it--

          VOICE OF TODD
          Alright.. I'm just.trying to keep the
          emotion out of it, so I thought I would
          say."fact" before each fact, so it would
          be less-upsetting -- I

          VOICE OF WALTER
          Ok, Damien, this is Walter, I'm just
          gonna jump in.and bad-cop.it here for a
          second. Dude, I mean, 46,000 dollars for
          Chris Michael Speedman's masseuse's
          miscellaneous living expenses? It sounds
          like the inmates are running the asylum.

          DAMIEN
          Well, yes, that's exactly-it,.Walter if-
          you actually came out here you would see
          that .these actors are--

          VOICE OF TODD
          (loud out of'nowhere)
          The actors didn't blow up the rainforest
          and forget to turn on the camera Damien!
          I have a lot of tolerance, but when. Lt

          Damien looks a bit bewildered by that. His hot young

          HOT YOUNG ASSISTANT
          Sorry.

          It's Chris Michael, he says it's
          important.
          Damien, shaking now, steps out on to the balcony and
          slides the glass door shut.

          Though the hotel is a shambles, the view out on to the
          bay is spectacular.

          In stark contrast to the hotel where everyone else is
          living, Speedman is in what looks like an Asian
          presidential palace overlooking the ocean.
          SPEEDMAN is standing on the deck, trying hard to hold the,
          phone with his hook hands. "Simple Jack" plays on a flat
          screen inside.

          SPEEDMAN
          Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw
          a little pep talk your way. I know today
          was rough, and you're probably mad at
          yourself for not getting the shots, but
          that's the way these movies go. We all
          boot it from time to time, and today was
          just one of those days. Happens.

          DAMIEN
          (sickly sweet)
          Yes it does. It does. Though I do think
          you have to realize Chris, that you are
          somewhat responsi--

          Oh, also needed to let you know, and I.
          .know you're like wrapped up with the
          movie, but I really need that new chef
          like we talked about, you know to really 4
          get that super-ripped thing happening.
          This guy is great but all he makes are
          dumplings. And they stiill haven't worked
          out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4I

          right now Chris --

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah, of course, I just know we talked
          about getting super-super-ripped for that
          starvation sequence
          Speedman's other line goes. He sees the caller I.D.

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh,, shit-- can you hang on a sec, D?
          He switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the

          RICK PECK, head of the Peck Agency, sits in his office,
          overlooking. Los Angeles. He has a headset on.

          PECK.
          Guess what I'm staring at right now?

          WE INTERCUT BETWEEN SPEEDMAN AND PECK

          SPEEDMAN
          What?

          PECK
          I'm looking at your ugly mug on the back
          of Vanity Fair magazine in beautiful
          living color with the two cute cuddly
          pandas from cuteville. It's insane.

          We see Pedk is holding a Vanity Fair with an ad on the
          back: it is a picture of Speedman looking earnest,
          holding two baby PANDAS. The caption reads:

          "PANDAS...THEIR SURVIVAL IS NOT SO BLACK AND WHITE"

          PECK
          The credibility factor that the pandas
          give you is priceless, and strangely, if'
          you see this picture, what really strikes
          me is the credibility that you give them.
          I've been getting psychotic feedback all
          day. Hey did you get the basket I sent?
          WE SEE: A survival-themed gift basket in a camouflage
          backpack, There's a satellite phone, camouflage
          sunblock, etc.

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah. Thanks.

          PECK
          You sad? What's wrong?

          SPEEDMAN
          No I'm fine. I've just been having a
          tough time over here. They still havn't
          got the TiVo hooked up and... I don't
          know... Lazarus is getting all this Oscar
          buzz already --

          PECK
          Is that what this is about? Crazy Kirk
          Lazarus goes and places his entire body
          in some experimental Malaysian dipping
          sauce so he can actually be black, of
          course he's gonna get buzz. Listen to
          what I am telling you. He is clinically
          mentally not right.

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah but the way they talk about him. I
          mean, he played a retarded guy and won an
          Oscar, I play a retarded guy and don't
          even get a nomination. I don't know, I
          mean you said "Simple Jack" would be my
          "Elf" but with Oscars. Those were your
          exact words.

          I don't believe those were my exact words
          but let's get beyond that to the root of
          this. Remember the moment you chose to do,
          this', and I wanted you to do the ESP
          robot thing with Wolfgang Petersen? And I
          said stay home be happy and you said "no,
          Rick I need to play a real human being"
          and I said "okay" and then I said "are
          you sure?" and you said that you needed
          this-for your soul?

          SPEEDMAN
          Yes but --

          PECK
          Which I totally respected and now you're
          doing the crazy surfer three..sixty move
          on me,..which I love by the-way-- but-you
          said fuck it, I gotta do it for my soul
          And-that's why I hate you.. Because you
          were RIGHT. And you're in. the Phuc Long

          Fatburger.being an actor-And, I would
          wager, forcing everyone around you to
          rise to your level. Am I right? I mean
          you are over there forcing a bunch of
          PUSSY actors to gel, straighten up and.
          become a platoon. And it hurts. Am I
          right?
          Speedman actually seems tohave bought-this

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah. You are right.

          PECK
          Alright, that's what.I thought. Now get
          to work genius soldier. I'll handle the
          .TiVo.
          Peck hangs up abruptly.

          ON SPEEDMAN
          Speedman punches the button on his cordless and puts. it
          down. He ponders Rick's words as he gets caught up
          watching the end scene of "SIMPLE JACK" on his TV.
          He has forgotten Damien is on the other line.

          him.

          Finally, after a few moments of listening to this, Damien
          explodes. He throws the phone on the ground and jumps up
          and down on it. He notices the crew staring at him. He
          tries to look as if that just didn't happen.
          He opens the sliding glass, and heads straight to the
          door. He continues walking through his office, out into
          the main offices. He motions for his assistant to join
          him.

          It is an APOCALYPSE NOW theme party. Vegas style. Tiki
          torches,, buffets. PLAYBOY PLAYMATE DANCERS circa 1967 are
          dancing on a deck in front of a banner that reads "ONE
          WEEK DOWN!". The crew and cast are partying their asses
          off.

          WAITERS, dressed like bald Marlon Brandos in full face

          PORTNOY, not looking very sober, jumps up on the stage
          with the dancers and starts doing a striptease.

          ENTRANCE TO THE DECK
          Damien walks in, watching this scene from Caligula going
          down. He looks in a deep funk.
          Portnoy STAGE DIVES straight onto the lawn, landing with
          a thud in front of Damien.

          DAMIEN,
          Jeff. Jeff are you alright?.We.need to
          talk -- as.a cast, as a platoon, right
          now.

          withthe bandana?-The big guy?-I was
          supposed to meet him here. He has a-
          package of mine.
          Kevin Sandusky ("Brooklyn" from the movie) comes up to

          Uh, no. I think--
          But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug

          SANDUSKY
          Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find
          you. I know this is a party, but this
          afternoon after work I was breaking down
          my M-16, and I have to say, in the night
          watch scene, a minute and a half is a
          pretty short amount of time to assemble
          it.

          Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge
          opportunity. To be working with all these
          great actors, and you.

          DAMIEN
          You're the only one who auditioned.
          You're the only one who did the two week
          boot camp, Sandusky.

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird.
          Wasn't the point that we were all
          supposed to bond?

          DAMIEN

          (BITTERLY)
          Yes, that was the point.
          Damien, grabs a drink from a passing tray, and downs it.
          We follow A WAITER as he passes Speedman with a tray of
          food.
          Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a
          spring roll off the tray. He resumes talking to LAZARUS
          who is deeply uninterested.

          people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time.
          with them... watching them.. Watching all
          the retarded stuff they did.

          LAZARUS
          Huh, I always found mere observation a
          little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to
          mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram
          the source of the pain. Then live it.

          SPEEDMAN
          (trying. to keep up)
          Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the
          first time in-my life..
          (searches for the word)
          Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer,
          retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth
          retarded. In a `weird way I had to
          unlearn what it was to be... .NOT
          retarded.

          LAZARUS
          Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was
          smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was
          retarded. So you can afford to play
          retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky
          tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there.
          Especially.knowing how the Academy is

          ping-pong competition. Peter Sellers,
          "Being There", infantile? Yes.
          Retarded? No.
          He claps a hand on Speedman's shoulder.

          LAZARUS
          You went full retard, man. You never go 14
          full retard. Don't believe me? Ask Sean
          Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard.
          Went home empty handed.
          Speedman sees this for the truth it is. How could he be
          so stupid?

          LAZARUS
          (cruelly, driving it home)
          But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could
          be your ticket to Oscar gold. I'd lose
          the hook hands though... cripples don't
          give the Academy wood either.

          SPEEDMAN

          (DAZED)
          Oh.
          Lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass
          and heading for the bar. Speedman stands hurt, delicately
          holding the spring,roll in his hook.

          ON THE OTHER SIDE,OF THE ROOM
          Damien paces the party. He looks more miserable and high
          strung than ever. He discovers Redykulous, surrounded by
          his posse and a CAMERA CREW.

          DAMIEN
          Redykulous... I need to talk to you.

          REDYKULOUS
          What up, money.

          DAMIEN
          (in a hushed tone, aware of
          the cameras)
          We're having a cast meeting, right now
          We need to come together as a unit --
          The camera crew moves in for the close-up. . .making Damien
          uncomfortable ... Redykulous takes it in stride. Throughout
          the scene he is TEXT MESSAGING someone.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 32.

          REDYKULOUS
          Uh-huh...
          Damien is made uncomfortable by the cameraman who has i
          started manually zooming in and out on him in a dutch
          style camera move...
          DAMIEN i
          Do you mind if we step away for a moment?

          REDYKULOUS
          From what?
          Damien tries to indicate the crew.

          DAMIEN
          (whispering even lower now)
          From the...uh...you know... .this area..

          REDYKUL:OUS
          Oh, I see...sure
          They take a few steps away from the bar... The entire
          camera crew follows.

          DAMIEN
          Oh. Hah! No, I mean away from the
          cameras.
           you understand?. Away from
          (indicating the crew)
          them...

          REDYKULOUS
          No.

          DAMIEN
          What?

          REDYKULOUS
          No. I can't do that. If Redykulous
          steps away from the cameras then my
          .people don't get to see the real
          Redykulous. The show is called "Utterly
          Redykulous".

          DAMIEN
          Well this is about work ...my show so to.
          .speak. Do you understand?

          REDYKULOUS
          I guess. But not really. Your show and
          my show are the same thing. This is gonna
          help your show, trust me.

          My show AND the soundtrack drops the same
          time "Tropic Thunder opens. So you get
          that crossover audience everybody wants
          on your opening weekend, which will
          dictate your revenue streams all the way
          through DVD release, pay per view,
          etcetera.
          Damien thinks this over for a second. It does sort of
           make sense. He then notices the chmera crew pushing in k I , 1 '144%
          for a close up He awkwardly tries to get away from
          them...

          DAMIEN
          Excuse me, everyone! If I could have
          your attention!
          Nothing. No one notices except Speedman. Damien grabs a
          couple bottles off the bar and BANGS them together.

          DAMIEN
          Sorry to break up the party, but I just
          wanted to call your attention to a cast
          meeting tonight! Big meeting! Future of
          the film depends on it!

          (UNRAVELING)
          Not to mention my entire bloody life!
          Damien in a final cry of frustration, SMASHES a bottle on
          the bar. He succeeds only in cutting his hand.

          DAMIEN

          GODFUCKITI SHIT!
          Speedman comes up, placing a calming hook on Damien's
          shoulder. He steps to the fore.

          SPEEDMAN
          (slowly, deliberately)
          "When... we.'.. put... aside... our...
          differences... we see we're kind of the
          same."
          Within moments, the place settles completely.

          SPEEDMAN
          (Long beat...-then almost
          quietly.)
          "When we put aside our differences, we
          see we're kind of the same. Let's be
          friends, I know we will do great things
          together."

          That's a quote from my children's book,
          "The Boy Everybody-Was Jealous Of." I
          know it's just a book for. kids, but I
          think it applies to.making a movie as
          well. 'Course... I know a lot of the
          reason things are maybe messed up is ME.
          The guys look at each other -- maybe he's not so bad.

          SPEEDMAN
          I was looking-at it all backwards. You
          guys are lost. You heed.me to.lead you,
          to help you gel, and straighten.up --
          like a PLATOON!
          A long beat.

          made me.H-h-h-h-h-happy!
          The entire party cuts.up.in loud hysterics. Speedman
          looks hurt. The DJ puts on-a Redykulous track really
          loud, and the, place gets even crazier.

          EXT. BEACH - LATER

          Damien, drunk, walks along, illuminated by the light of
          the moon. He holds' a bottle of wine, which.he chugs..In
          the distance, the party rages.

          When a herd loses its way, the shepherd
          must kill the bull that leads them
          astray..
          Damien turns around., startled. FOUR LEAF is standing
          eerily in the bushes by the sand.

          FOUR LEAF
          You don't know which way is up, do you
          private`? You couldn't find a dixie
          coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your
          prick. and showin' you the way...
          Damien doesn't know what the fuck that meant.
          Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes.
          Damien's eyes widen in fear.

          A raindrop cannot carve a valley. An ant
          cannot defeat a buffalo. But a tempest
          can cleave that mountain to make the
          valley, and an army of ants can fell the
          mighty buffalo.

          DAMIEN
          (seeing the wisdom of this)
          Yes...

          FOUR LEAF
          If the lion, although king of the jungle,
          is thrown into the sea, he will
          drown... but...if...

          (long pause)

          DO YOU!?
          He lunges at Damien and grabs him by the collar with both
          hooks. '

          DAMIEN
          (near tears now)
          I want to!!! But not really!!

          (BEAT)
          Someone's an ANT? Or something???

          FOUR LEAF
          I put my story in your limp Brit hands
          and you will not fail me!!
          (long pause)
          My boys were worse pussies than these
          guys. But the shit is what made us a
          unit. A whole. You must put them in the

          SHIT.
          He releases Damien and takes a large draw on his
          cigarette...

          FOUR LEAF
          There's a place. About a hundred clicks
          from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the
          jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties.
          Nothing but triple canopy jungle and
          cockroaches the size of melons.
          Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his
          weirdness.

          FOUR LEAF
          Rig up your documentary cameras'in that
          jungle, give me and Cody a few of those
          smoke bombs and some charges and we could
          light up the jungle so those lily-dick
          actors would think they were in the
          middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them
          thinking they're getting shot at, and
          you'll have your movie.
          Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as
          though he has been bitten. He holds out a small squished
          mosquito' between the claws of his prosthesis.

          FOUR LEAF
          You must put them.under your thumb the
          way this. bug is under mine... .under YOUR
          control.

          DAMIEN
          I see ...yes ...They would 'be under my
          total control... finally. I could shoot
          the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty.
          Away from their pampered pussy posses and
          helpers...

          FOUR LEAF
          Yes... yes...

          DAMIEN
          Put them in the real shit. Film them
          with real fear in their eyes. REAL FEAR!

          .REAL EMOTION! YES! YES, FOUR LEAF, FUCK

          YES!!
          Damien and Four Leaf share a crazed look. COOL MUSIC UP
          as WE PUSH IN and...

          CUT TO:

          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

          A CHOPPER skimming the treetops, illuminated by a lonely
          moon...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 37.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          Cody is piloting. Damien and Four Leaf are in the back
          sitting, across from Speedman, Portnoy, Redyk and Lazarus
          and Sandusky.
          We move across the faces of the actors, all in
          brainbuckets, who all look confusted and unhappy, except
          for Sandusky who seems excited.
          Speedman clutches the camouflaged gift bag from his agent
          Rick Peck.

          PORTNOY

          (FINALLY)
          So, uh, any idea how long we'll be gone?
          Because I left most of my... vitamins
          back at the hotel.
          The other actors chime in with similar concerns,
          regarding sleeping arrangements, make up facilities,
          etc... '

          FOUR LEAF
          Save your breath, maggots!
          They all shrink back. Four Leaf's fierce posture is
          undercut as the helicopter lurches, sending Damien
          sprawling onto hire.

          DAMIEN
          That'sâ¢right. Maggots.

          EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN

          The chopper lands in a small clearing as the sun rises
          behind a mountain.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          Damien and Four Leaf, in DI mode, hustle the "grunts" off
          the chopper.

          DAMIEN

          GO!!!
          Apparently they are not moving fast enough -- Four Leaf
          and Damien shove the guys out of the chopper onto the
          ground.

          MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!
          The group, scared shitless, start falling out of the
          doors of the chopper, more like a bunch of oysters than a
          crack platoon.
          Four leaf jumps on the skid of thy chopper and motions to
          Cody, who lifts off. It kicksï¿½up a violent backwash, 0, Iq y
          forcing the guys to duck. and cover.

          FOUR LEAF
          See you in hell!
          As the noise of the helicopter fades, the group starts.
          trying to orient itself in their new surroundings.' The
          Jungle. Black, dense, unforgiving.
          All around them can be seen the remnants of a war that
          has been over for thirty years. A grave marker,. half of
          an old rusted outâ¢'downed chopper.
          All are absorbing the spookiness, except Portnoy who
          seems very upset.

          PORTNOY
          This is bullshit!
          Damien marches over to him, and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY in
          the face.

          Everyone hands over their phones.
          Speedman, however, turns away from the group, getting his.
          satellite phone out of the gift bag. He surreptitiously
          stows it down the front of his pants.

          smashes the phones with a draatic flair. The guys GROAN.
          Damien turns on them with a crazy gleam in his eye.

          DAMIEN
          Okay, girls... now that I have your
          attention, I will tell you fuckfaces what
          we're doing here. You are no longer
          actors in a movie. You,are grunts in a
          war. These men around you are your
          brothers.
          The guys look at each other, unhappy.

          DAMIEN
          Congratulations. You've just landed in
          "the shit". Your objective is to head
          north and liberate the village at D'ang
          Kwook Hill, at which point "Four Leaf"
          gets himself captured, at which point you
          rescue him, at which point we will
          chopper you home. We will also be
          rigging this entire valley of death with
          hidden cameras so that every glorious
          moment gets on film. And believe me it
          WILL be glorious. If it looks real,
          chances are good it probably is. You
          wanted to be actors? You wanted to
          occupy the skin of another human being?
          Get ready to occupy the skin of a
          terrified U.S. Infantry grunt, surrounded
          by death, crawling up Satan's arsehole.
          There's going to be enemy fire. Booby

          He pulls out a laminated packet.

          "Four Leaf", since you're the Captain
          here, here's the scene list and the map.
          (he throws them at him)
          Think you can handle it? From now on,
          Whatever we get on film is our movie,

          CODY
          So, I'm thinkin' as soon as Damien gives
          us the go ahead, we'ï¿½ust their cherry
          with a few airbursts, then alpha-alpha
          till they come running right at, us, then
          a good of fashioned firefight,
          maintaining our distance.
          Four Leaf ignores him, instead looking around the jungle,
          looking almost lost.

          CODY
          I been meaning to tell ya the whole
          shoot. I'm probably one-a your biggest
          fans. Your book was kinda my "Catcher in
          the Rye". It inspired me to become a gyro
          man.
          Four Leaf gives Cody nothing -- except his usual stoic
          stare.

          CODY
          I'm actually sort of a war nut. I mean I
          never was in the service, but for me
          blowing shit up in a war films is sort of
          my way of paying tribute to the real
          deal. And you sir, are the real deal.
          Nothing.

          CODY
          Hey, I was wonderin' what kind of sidearm
          you carry? Looks to me like a--

          FOUR LEAF
          (very scary)
          I don't know what it's called. I just
          know the sound it makes when it takes a
          man's life.
          Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio.

          CODY
          Ok, we're ready to rock and roll.
          (to walkie-talkie)
          Damien, come in. Cameras are up,
          ordinance are up. Ready to kick the tires
          and light the fires on your say so.

          EXT. JUNGLE - THE ACTORS

          WE are close on the seemingly broken.walkie talkie,.which
          has heard none of this. We PULL BACK to reveal the guys,
          staring at Damien's corpse in total shock. All except
          Speedman, who looks on with a smirk.

          PORTNOY
          I think he's like... dead.

          SPEEDMAN:
          (with a chuckle)
          Nice, very nice, Dorf. . .Very nice,
          wherever you're hiding!

          REDYKULOUS
          I don't think he's hiding.. I think he
          just died!
          Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse.
          pulls a wrist into frame.

          SANDUSKY
          He doesn't. have a pulse ...or a head.
          He then grabs a bent and rusty.piece of metal.

          SANDUSKY
          Must've been one of those Claymore mines.
          This old Jungle must.be full of them.,

          REDYKUZOUS
          You bet your ass it is. That's why a
          percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are
          helpin' solve the problem!
          Damien's corpse emits a disturbing death rattle.
          Speedman busts up laughing. They turn to him -- what the
          hell?
          Speedman throws an-arm.around Sandusky, -like an indulgent
          older brother.

          SPEEDMAN
          C'mon! Don't you get it? This is what
          .Dorf was talking about -- our slice of
          the Nam! He's trying to get in our
          heads!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 43.

          GUERRILLAS P.O.V -- FROM THE SURROUNDING JUNGLE
          They are right behind the treeline, watching the guys
          from about thirty feet.

          SPEEDMAN
          That whole "life and death" speech in the
          chopper? He's meshing 'with us! What do
          you think all that "playing God" was
          about?
          The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief --
          except Lazarus.

          LAZARUS
          Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is
          dead!!
          Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn't want to take sides.

          SPEEDMAN
          Kirk. I know you're the big fancy actor
          here, but, no offense, I've done a lot
          mote effects driven event films, and I
          think I can spot a prop body.

          ON THE GUERRILLAS
          The LEAD guerilla signals for all his guys to hold their
          fire and pick their targets...

          ON THE ACTORS
          Suddenly, The walkie-talkie lying on Damien's body
          crackles to life:

          CODY (ON WALKIE)
          -- I repeat, we are now go for mission!

          DAMIE--
          The walkie crackles unintelligibly. Speedman picks it up,
          showing it to the guys. See?

          SPEEDMAN

          (SMIRKING)
          Alright, can we start the scene now? Or
          do you need a formal invitation?!
          (checking the list)
          Scene 12A, ext. Jungle. Day. Ambush.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 44.
          Speedman closes his eyes, taking a second to get into
          character. He opens them, and grabs. his gun and creeps
          towards the bushes, stealthily..

          SPEEDMAN
          (as Four Leaf)
          I got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats.
          The group remains motionless., Speedman gives Portnoy a ,M in MAIM
          "c'mon!" type look. Portnoy doesn't know what he means...

          SPEEDMAN
          I said, I got a baaad feeling on this
          one, Brooklyn...
          Oh! He's acting!
          Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts walking.
          stealthily around.with him, on high.alert.for Charlie.
          Swinging his gun unpredictably.

          ON THE GUERILLAS
          They are a mere ten or fifteen feet from Sandusky on the
          other side of the. trees... they back off as. he waves his
          gun...

          BACK ON THE ACTORS'

          SANDUSKY
          (-as Brooklyn)
          Me too, cap'n.

          (BEAT)
          Hey, cap?: If.I told you something,
          something kinda personal, you wouldn't
          think I was crazy, right?

          SPEEDMAN
          Naw, man. I know you ain't crazy
          Brooklyn...

          SANDUSKY
          Well,. if I told you that I, I never
          actually, well, been with a girl...you
          wouldn't, like, think I was, like, queer
          .or nothin'... would you.?

          SPEEDMAN
          .Naw, man... I wouldn't think you was a
          queer.

          Redykulous shrugs and joins in, too:

          REDYKULOUS
          (acting really "black guy"

          SCARED)
          Sh...sh...shit ...When I get back to the
          world, I'm gonna find me the finest piece
          of Detroit nubian mugambo, and fuck it
          till I broke its back.

          PORTNOY
          The last "mugambo" you ever tasted was in
          your momma's soup bowl. I wouldn't mind
          slurpin' on a little of that --

          SPEEDMAN
          That's enough outta you Fats. Don't you
          worry, Brooklyn. You gotta lotta days a
          fucking ahead of you and I for one ain't
          gonna let Charlie...
          Lazarus can't handle it anymore.

          LAZARUS
          What the FUCK is wrong with you people?!
          Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back.
          He addresses the treeline.

          SPEEDMAN
          Sorry Damien! Back to one... action!
          (he gets back in character)
          Don't you worry, Brooklyn, You gotta

          LOTTA--

          LAZARUS
          Yo, asshole! Mothafucka just DIED!
          Speedman sighs, annoyed.

          SPEEDMAN
          How many more takes you wanna wreck? Some
          of us are taking this seriously.
          Lazarus looks likes he wants to explode. But instead he
          becomes eerily calm. He begins an impressive
          transformation -- Everything except for his skin color
          returns to his real identity, a pompous Irish prick.

          LAZARUS
          (Heavy Irish)
          Jaysus! There isn't going to be any
          movie, ya gobshite!

          LAZARUS (cont'd)
          Damien is dead, Speedman. Yes,_the show
          must go on, but this is feckin' madness.

          PORTNOY
          (re: Lazarus transformation) i
          Wow. That was really cool.

          THE GUERILLAS
          Are watching this, poised to attack.

          BACK ON THE ACTORS
          Speedman and Lazarus argue, more heated now.

          SPEEDMAN
          Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped
          something.
          He mimes picking something , off, the ground.

          SPEEDMAN
          It's called your character. Don't worry,
          I won't tell the Academy!
          Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have
          seized the moment.
          The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for
          Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and
          debris kicks up all around him.

          SPEEDMAN
          You happy now? We're out of position for
          the effect! Am I the only one who read
          .the script?! This is the ambush!
          A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks
          of wood and shrapnel everywhere.

          SANDUSKY
          I think they're really shooting at us!

          SPEEDMAN
          What are you guys worried about? These
          guys are pros. The unions would tear
          them a new ass-if any of us got hurt.
          The actors stay down, looking scared.

          SPEEDMAN
          Come on, you guys! Let's use this!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 47.
          No one follows Speedman's lead., Fine, he'll go it alone.
          Speedman begins shooting at the guerillas alone, and
          doing a very good job of it, going through an assortment
          of absurd action style maneuvers throughout.
          Redykulous looks around, and then decides to get up and
          join him. Sandusky and Portnoy look at each other -- what
          the heck -- and follow. They all fire at the unseen
          enemy, letting out very convincing WAR CRIES.

          ON THE GUERRILLAS
          Not knowing it's only blanks, and awed by the power of
          the actors' automatic weapons, and the intensity of their
          screams, they drop back...

          GUERILLA LEADER
          
          The guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up
          RPGs...

          EXT. JUNGLE - HILLTOP CLEARING

          Four Leaf looks out into the jungle below, he can hear
          the firefight, but, Cody can't.

          FOUR LEAF
          Hear that?
          Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives.

          CODY
          What? I still can't get Damien on the
          radio. I bet he forgot how to use the
          Walkie again. What do you say we get a
          little... pro-active?
          Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger.

          BACK ON THE ACTORS
          Still fighting, oblivious that the guerillas are about to
          blow them to kingdom come with RPGs.
          But before the guerillas have a chance--

          

          

          

          

          I
          t' Tropic Thunder 48.

          ON CODY
          He pushes down the plunger...

          ON THE GUERILLAS

          BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!!
          Dirt flies, the guerillas don't know what the hell is
          going on =- except that someone is suddenly bombing the
          shit out of them. They beat a hasty retreat.

          EXT. JUNGLE HILLTOP CLEARING

          Cody and Four Leaf watch Cody's handiwork with
          binoculars. A smoke cloud slowly rises from the jungle.

          CODY
          Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!.
          Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring
          straight at 10 GUERILLA FIGHTERS with their submachine
          guns pointed straight at them.

          CODY
          Oh shit.

          FOUR LEAF
          Oh yeah.
          And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of
          consciousness...

          EXT. JUNGLE -- THE ACTORS

          Speedman motions for everyone to "cease fire".

          SPEEDMAN

          (PUMPED)
          Aaaaand... CUT! Jesus!. Alright! That's
          the trailer 'right there!

          REDYKULOUS
          That was some sick shit! I wasn't even
          thinking bout the camera!
          The guys' adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all
          around. Lazarus is not happy. He looks off into the
          jungle, sensing that someone was out there.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 49.

          SANDUSKY'
          So what do we do now?
          Speedman pulls out the map, frowns at it.

          SPEEDMAN
          Damien said to head north. I'm guessing
          they've got more of these "battles" and
          Viet Congs rigged for uls on the way.
          (into it)
          Alright, let's hump-our shit to D'ang
          Kwook! Let's didi double time! We got a
          lot of clicks to cover!
          Speedman heads off into a particularly dense section of
          jungle. After a beat, he reappears, looking a little
          lost.

          SANDUSKY
          Uh...Sir, isn't it that way?
          Kevin points in the other direction. Speedman glances
          down at the map, which he rotates around, right side up
          now.

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh yeah. Thanks, uh...

          SANDUSKY
          (can't believe it)
          Kevin. Kevin Sandusky.

          SPEEDMAN
          Right. Okay, To D'ang Kwook! Lets do-it-
          to-it!
          Everyone follows Speedman. Lazarus, very reluctantly,
          brings up the rear, still looking off into the jungle. A

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING

          It is a large, secret heroin processing facility,
          surrounded by barbed wire fencing. It is in a clearing
          in the jungle, by a small river.
          There's a GUARD TOWER overlooking a main gate, which
          leads into a big open courtyard area. The main structure
          is a low, concrete military-looking building.
          It's all populated with tough-looking, well-armed
          badasses.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 50.
          CODY AND FOUR LEAF, both hog-tied and unconscious, are
          marched through the courtyard, and into a building.

          INT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - COMMAND CENTER

          We are behind the back of the person who is in charge. In
          front of him, we see workers busily manufacturing tar
          heroin, in a sweatshop like atmosphere.
          A cadre of guerilla fighters domes in, sweaty and tired.
          The Lieutenant steps to the fore -- this is BYONG. He's
          badly shaken.

          BYONG
          
          The Unseen Leader shakes. his head.

          EXT. BAMBOO FOREST -- DAY

          The actors are slogging along, through a tall thicket of
          bamboo. They look exhausted -- except for Speedman, who
          always manages to look like.a.movie star.

          PORTNOY
          So... we're just supposed to keep
          walking?

          SPEEDMAN
          We'll see some action soon enough. And
          try to stay in character. We're on
          camera..

          PORTNOY
          What do you mean "soon"?

          

          

          

          

          ,I
          Tropic Thunder 51.

          SPEEDMAN
          Whenever Damien decides it's time, I
          guess.

          PORTNOY
          When's that?

          SPEEDMAN
          I don't know. That's the whole point.
          Damien wants us tired and confused.

          REDYKULOUS
          Yeah, well I'm definitely qualifying for
          those objectives.
          Everyone chimes in -- they all need a break. Lazarus
          notices the mutinous vibe and smiles.

          SPEEDMAN
          Fine, fine. Okay, let's take a break,
          but be on the lookout for anything.
          Charlie doesn't care if you're on a break
          or not.
          Speedman plunks down and opens the map. He seems puzzled.
          Lazarus eyes him suspiciously. Sandusky walks off to take
          a leak. Lazarus then watches him go.
          Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee. He hears
          something rustle next to him.

          LAZARUS (O.S.)
          Psst. Hey.
          Sandusky turns to see Lazarus peeing uncomfortably close
          to him.

          LAZARUS
          Speedman is watching. I don't have much
          time. I don't really need to piss. I
          need to talk to you. You went to the
          boot camp Sandusky, right? You can read

          LAZARUS
          Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That
          hoor's melt really thinks this is a
          movie. And he's got the lot of ya
          convinced.

          filming us?

          I

          LAZARUS
          Of course not! It's only a matter of
          time before he walks us into more mines
          or more of whoever the hell was shootin',
          at us. That muppet's going to get us all
          killed. I need to convince everyone.to
          turn around, but I .can't do it without
          the map. You're the only one who can
          read it. Can I count on you?

          SANDUSKY
          Well, yeah, I.guess. But

          LAZARUS
          Good man, Good man.
          Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing,
          shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group.
          Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to?
          Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee
          again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see
          Speedman, right next to him.

          SPEEDMAN
          I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't
          need to pee. I need to talk to you.
          Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat
          and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create
          a red pee.stream.

          SPEEDMAN
          Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and.
          he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all
          of us. The men respect you, because you
          went to boot camp and rehearsal.
          (patting his shoulder)
          And you're pretty handy with that map. I
          need you on my side, Kyle.

          talk to some of the Dreamworks
          brass... there'll probably be a Teen
          Choice award in it for you. You have
          that potential.

          SANDUSKY
          Well, I --

          SPEEDMAN
          Good man. Good man.
          Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look.

          EXT. JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE - LATER

          The guys continue to trudge along a hugely overgrown
          path. Speedman machetes through the overgrowth.

          SPEEDMAN
          If we stay on this trajectory we should
          be reaching the village any minute now.
          At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating
          from Portnoy.

          SPEEDMAN
          Buck up,, Fats ...we got a long road ahead
          of us...

          PORTNOY

          (SICK)
          No... its just that I don't feel so hot...
          I left my medication at the hotel.

          REDYKULOUS
          (to himself, snickering)
          Yeah, I'd like to check out some of those
          "meds" for my own self.
          Lazarus moves up to Speedman.

          LAZARUS
          Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a
          village don't you think we would have hit
          it by now?

          SPEEDMAN
          Quit your carping, we're right where
          we're supposed to be!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 54.
          WHUMP! All of a sudden Speedman disappears out of
          frame...
          We see he has fallen chest deep into the edge of a SLOW

          MOVING RIVER.

          LAZARUS
          .(laughing)
          Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that
          map?
          S.pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map.

          SPEEDMAN
          Yes! There is! Its just a little more'
          down to the... lefty-down part from the:
          village.
          (checking the scene list)
          Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat
          Raid at the end of the second act.

          LAZARUS
          I don't see a "Sampan" boat!

          SPEEDMAN
          Any second now one should come by.
          Alright men, into the water!
          Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water.
          They all hold their rifles above their heads.

          LAZARUS I
          - L-et-'-s-stop this-char-ade-,sha-l-l-we? We
          need to quit faffin' about and turn.
          around NOW! And...
          Lazarus grabs Sandusky.

          LAZARUS
          Sandusky agrees. with me. Don't you,
          Sandusky?
          Kevin is caught, not sure what to d

          SPEEDMAN
          Wait! First of all...
          Now Speedman grabs him.

          SPEEDMAN

          second, need I remind you,. I am your

          LAZARUS
          No, yer an actor. Arid if memory serves,
          a pretty shite one.
          The actors react -- Damn! Oh Snap! Shit! Speedman steels'
          himself.

          SPEEDMAN
          THAT'S THE WAY OUT! That's our only
          chance!

          PORTNOY
          Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until
          they send help! Or maybe try to get back
          to the hotel.

          SPEEDMAN
          Help from where! Need I remind you that
          Damien's orders were to --
          (right at Lazarus)
          --stay in character.
          (to the guys)
          Now, I already have an international box
          office presence, but for some of you, I'm
          guessing you might not want to screw this
          movie up!
          This actually seems to affect the actors. Lazarus can't
          believe it.

          SPEEDMAN
          .okay...C'mon, boys! This way. Let's go
          get those Viet Congs!
          Lazarus throws down his gun. He's had it.

          LAZARUS
          Jay-sus Fuck! It's Viet Cona! Not Viet
          Congs! Viet Cong, you plunker! And, hey,
          if you're so sure of yourself, why don't
          you let Kelvin have a look at the map?!
          Kevin doesn't know what to do -- he doesn't want to get
          in the middle of this. Speedman continues to be the tough
          guy.

          SPEEDMAN
          Be my guest.
          Speedman hands over the soggy map. Kevin looks. After a
          long beat...

          We've been going the wrong way. 'We were
          supposed to be doing this:
          Sandusky traces his finger along the correct route -- a

          Oh, man, this is not' cool, this is not
          cool at all.
          Speedman grabs the map back from Sandusky.

          SPEEDMAN
          I can't believe you people!. You're
          pussing out on me? We are supposed to be
          a unit!

          LAZARUS
          No one is "pussing out." They just
          prefer not. to die.out here. Sandusky, can
          you get'us back to the landing zone
          without the map?

          SANDUSKY
          It might be tricky, but maybe.

          LAZARUS
          Okay, which is it, gentlemen? Playin' war
          with Mister Box Office? Or staying
          alive?

          abandon this movie?
          A long tense. beat -- finally, Sandusky walks towards
          Lazarus. Everyone follows him.
          Speedman looks stunned. After a moment, he shakes his
          head and begins crossing the river, holding his rifle
          with both hands over his head.

          finish the movie alone!
          (turns to Lazarus, under his

          BREATH)
          And when I give my acceptance speech,
          I'll be sure to thank you, Lazarus, for
          staying out of that scene. And come Oscar
          night, we'll see who feels a little "full
          retard"!
          He reaches the other side of the river.

          going!

          I'm going to "EX'S. JUNGLE. DUSK. FOUR
          LEAF PINNED DOWN AND ALONE". And, I can
          shoot it alone.
          They'watch him trudge into the foliage.
          U2'S "BULLET THE BLUE SKY" comes up as the men watch
          Speedman disappear...

          We slowly push in on a lone figure silhouetted against
          the purple sky, trudging along the top of a trail to
          nowhere.

          CLOSER
          Speedman walks through the scary jungle, exhausted. He is
          tired, lonely and hungry. The jungle is making all sorts
          of terrifying noises. Finally he stops and regards the
          treeline.

          "Why"?! I dunno...maybe because they had
          one good part for a black man in this
          movie and they gave it to a white guy.

          LAZARUS
          Oh...I see...Put another way -- you're
          mad because I can act "black" better than

          Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly
          avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw.
          Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart.

          SANDUSKY
          Okay! That's enough! Jesus Christ! It's
          not enough we have people shooting at us!

          memory recall our director being blown
          up by onel?
          That shut them up.

          Sandusky is right... we could all learn a
          little from his common sense approach.
          From now on we walk Indian style,
          footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you
          take first position.
          He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and
          pushes him out front. Sandusky gives him a look.

          now becoming full on RAIN.
          He clutches an Equal packet and. the Cherry Chapstick.
          Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a
          tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He
          then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents
          into his hand,.and takes. a lick, savoring every granule.
          He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him. A
          rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and
          begins to stalk his prey.
          Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of.
          fur...
          Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness,

          Tropic Thunder 62.

          RICK

          anyone see you do this?

          SPEEDMAN
          I don't think so. I'm out in.the bush.
          Alone.

          RICK

          your hands on some-bleach, some hydrogen
          peroxide and some lime. Your gonna wanna
          cut the body in quarters ... the femurs are
          gonna be a bitch... that's normal...
          Speedman'nods eagerly, absorbing it all, not noticing a

          PIANO. WIRE BEING SLIPPED AROUND HIS NECK...
          Suddenly, he'is being choked.-He drops the phone, gasping
          for.air...

          RICK (O.S.)
          Chris? Breathe.! It's gonna be ok.. I'm
          calling that publicist right now, the one
          J Lo hired when she was'hammered and
          killed that kid with her Jetski.
          A guerilla shoots the phone. They quickly tie Speedman.up
          and whisk him'off into the jungle.

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND -- DAWN

          Speedman is being led through the courtyard in:shackles.
          He looks up to the guard towers.
          There are security cameras everywhere. In Speedman''s
          mind, movie cameras. He nods, into it.

          SPEEDMAN
          (under his breath)
          Alright. P.O.W camp. Scene 67..Bring it
          on Dorf.

          INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT

          Cody is just coming to. Four Leaf is already at the
          slatted window, watching...

          CODY
          Where are we?

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 63.

          FOUR LEAF
          In a detention hut. And they got
          Speedman...

          FOUR LEAF'S P.O.V. --
          A guard shoves Speedman hard with a rifle butt. Speedman
          over "acts" the pain.

          BACK ON CODY AND FOUR LEAF
          Cody gets up, starting to freak out

          CODY
          What? Why? We gotta get outta here! Are
          they gonna kill us?
          Four Leaf turns on him, grabbing him with one of his
          hooks.

          FOUR LEAF
          Pull it together private! Shut your trap
          before you get us killed! You understand
          me , lilydick? !
          Cody backs off, still scared.

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER

          Speedman is in a windowless hut, his feet and hands tied
          to a chair.
          There are security cameras in the corners of the room,
          which Speedman continually plays to.
          Byong stands across from him, watching him calmly.

          A

          BYONG
          What were you doing in our poppy fields?

          SPEEDMAN

          (CONFUSED)
          Poppy fields?

          BYONG
          Who sent you here?

          SPEEDMAN

          ("ACTING")
          Corporal Four Leaf Tayback...Serial
          number 694529987.

          

          

          

          
          'Tropic Thunder 64.

          BYONG

          (CALMLY)
          Perhaps some hot tea will make conversing.
          a little easier?

          SPEEDMAN
          You bastard.

          BYONG
          What? just thought you might like.
          some...

          SPEEDMAN
          Corporal Four Leaf Tayback. And oh.
          yeah. . .THIS is from my uncle... SAM!
          He HEAD BUTTS Byong in the face,. sending him reeling into
          the back wall.
          Beat.

          SPEEDMAN
          (under his breath)
          You.ok? You leaned into it, man.orry.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. BAMBOO CAGE --.DAY

          A pissed off Byong and a couple of guards throw Speedman
          into a small cage that is suspended by rope over the edge
          of-a marsh.
          He looks around, impressed with the production design. He
          looks up,.sees another security camera observing him. He
          turns it on.

          SPEEDMAN
          May God protect you from the mighty arm
          of the 51st Tropic Thunder to the end! My
          men will seek you out and mete. out a
          cruel justice!-
          Byong and the guards look at him, a bit confused.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. RICE PADDY -- DAY

          Looking up we see a circle of faces. Our guys, looking
          down on something awful.. . .that thing is:

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 65.
          PORTNOY, delirious and groaningt

          SANDUSKY
          I think he's dead.
          A wet fart seeps out of Portnoy.

          REDYKULOUS
          No. Just smells like hens dead. Smelled

          44M
          like that all night.

          LAZARUS
          What's wrong with him?

          PORTNOY

          (LYING)
          Nothing! Probably just the beginning
          stages of some ... . kinda...jungle fever.
          More bad noises.

          PORTNOY
          If we can work out some rig to carry mï¿½? I
          think it might subside in a little bit...
          No one touches him.

          LAZARUS
          Alright. Sandusky?
          Sandusky looks up at him. Is he serious?

          SANDUSKY
          What?

          LAZARUS
          You and Redykulous are gonna have to
          carry Portnoy. God help you.
          He marches off.

          SANDUSKY
          God help me?

          REDYKULOUS
          God help him that bitch ever find his
          blackface minstrel show ass alone with me
          in the real world.
          Redykulous and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up
          Portnoy on a make shift stretcher.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 66.

          EXT. HILLTOP

          Our guys are humping, with Fats in the makeshift
          stretcher.
          They look exhausted. As they crest. the ridge, Redykulous
          spots something.
          ''I , I n n4ï¿½N11

          REDYKULOUS
          Look!
          From behind, Sandusky grabs him and forces him to the
          ground.

          SANDUSKY
          SHH! Everybody down!
          The guys hit the dirt. Lazarus crawls up to join them.
          He pulls out his binoculars, and surveys the scene.

          I

          BINOCULAR POV
          It is the Flaming Dragon compound...

          ON THE GUYS

          " LAZARUS
          Fook me! I knew it!

          -SANDUSKY
          Knew what?

          LAZARUS
          "EXT. P.O.W. PRISON CAMP -- DAY"! Oranges
          and Lemons,,, the bells of St. Clements.
          Speedman was right. We 'are shooting the
          movie.
          Sandusky grabs the binoculars and starts'looking...

          LAZARUS
          (to himself),
          How could I be so stupid.

          SANDUSKY
          I don't think so... . looks to me like some
          sort of heroin processing plant. Look at
          the cooking vats, and the guards.
          Sandusky continues looking through the binoculars.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 67.

          LAZARUS
          How do you know all,this?

          SANDUSKY
          It was a long trip. I read the in-flight
          magazine. We're in the Golden Triangle,
          the biggest drug producer in the world.
          Uh-oh.

          BINOCULAR POV
          It is SPEEDMAN, who is being dipped in and out of the
          water in his bamboo cage, while a bunch of guards stand
          around and laugh. Whenever he comes up for air, he is

          YELLING:

          SPEEDMAN

          CUT!1
          (into the water, then out)

          CUT1!

          BACK TO 'SCENE

          LAZARUS
          What do you see?

          SANDUSKY
          It doesn't look good.
          Lazarus grabs the binoculars.

          LAZARUS
          Sweet Mother of Jaysus.
          Suddenly: GUNFIRE ERUPTS ALL AROUND!
          A BAND OF GUERILLAS have spotted them and are running at
          them, firing automatic weapons...
          The guys scream, and start a frantic retreat down the
          hill. Portnoy suddenly gets well enough to run out of his
          stretcher for dear life...
          In fact, he is actually beating them down the hill.. .when
          suddenly WHUMP! He falls into a PIT!

          PORTNOY

          HELP! GUYS! WAIT!
          REDYKULOUS stops and turns around and runs back to him,
          heroically pulling him out. BUT...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 68.
          There is more fire coming all around. He gives up,
          reverses tactics, and starts KICKING PORTNOY IN THE
          CHEST, trying to KICK HIM INTO THE HOLE !

          11

          PORTNOY
          Ow! Fuck Dude! What the fuck?!
          He screams in pain! Finally, WHUMP!! He disappears
          into the'hole. REDYKULOUS whistles for the guys to join
          him, and they all pile into the hole.

          IN, THE HOLE
          Totally black... . they huddle, trying to muffle their
          heavy breathing...

          ABOVE. THE HOLE
          The guerillas all frantically look around for the guys.
          No sign of them. One of them signals for them to keep
          moving.

          HOLE
          Footsteps can be heard above leaving the area. Sandusky
          lights a match. Portnoy is weeping in pain.

          SANDUSKY
          Must be one of those underground tunnels.
          The-cou-ntr-y-is-l-itte-red-with them. Je-f-f
          must have found one of the entrances,:.
          Portnoy is on his side in pain, whimpering.

          PORTNOY
          My ass...I think I took one in the ass...

          SANDUSKY
          Lemme see...
          Sandusky rolls him.over, and off camera, helps him remove
          his pants... All the guys recoil in horror.

          REDYKULOUS

          AWW JEEESUS MAN!

          SANDUSKY
          How did it get infected so fast?
          More ad libs of disgust...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 69.

          SANDUSKY'
          Okay Jeff...This is gonna hurt like hell,
          but I have to take my finger and see how
          deep the slug is, and if I can dig it
          out. Take a breath. Redykulous, hold his
          hand...
          Beat... Sandusky puts his hand off camera.

          I

          PORTNOY
          Hey Dude! What are you doing! Cut it
          out! That's not the bullet hole. The
          bullet hole is over here!
          It dawns on the guys that they have NOT been looking at
          the bullet hole. Ad-libs of even MORE disgust.

          SANDUSKY
          OH! my bad. You just got grazed. You're
          gonna be fine.

          EXT. BAMBOO CAGE -- DAY

          Speedman is exhausted, slumped in his cage. He is covered
          in a few leeches. Byong appears with his usual cadre of
          guards. He nods, and they grab Speedman, and drag him
          out of the cage.

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON HQ - COURTYARD

          Byong leads Speedman to the center of the courtyard. A
          HUSH falls over the soldiers.
          They begin to part, as someone very important is
          arriving.
          Finally, the unseen leader emerges. He is a LITTLE BOY,
          no older than 12 years old, but has the eyes of a killer.
          He smokes a cigar. This is TRAN.
          He stops in front of Speedman, staring him down. Then, in
          a show of alpha male dominance, he tears his shirt off,
          revealing an impressive set of gruesome tattoos -- a
          flaming dragon raping a monkey, raping a skull, raping a
          rat. He holds a stick.

          SPEEDMAN

          (WARILY)
          Uhhh..I don't think I got the new
          pages...

          Tran points across the courtyard where...
          A"4 Iv I. InM y
          CODY AND FOUR LEAF ARE MARCHED OUT. Cody looks scared out.
          of his mind. Speedman takes this in.
          Traci nods, and TWO GUARDS start to BEAT THE BEJEESUS out
          of Cody and Four Leaf. Then Tran gets out his own stick
          and starts to BEAT SPEEDMAN...

          TRAN

          DO YOU WANT THEM TO DIE? DO YOU WANT THEM

          TO DIE!!

          SPEEDMAN
          No! Puh-Puh-pulease don't h-h-h-hurt
          them... I
          Tran cocks his head curiously. He stops beating him..He
          signals.for the guards to stop beating the others. A long
          beat.

          TRAN
          Say that. again.,

          SPEEDMAN
          Please don't hurt them?I

          TRAN
          No...like you did before!
          Silence.

          TRAN

          SAY IT!
          He threatens to hit him, Speedman recoils.

          SPEEDMAN
          Puh-puh-puhlease don't h-h-hurt them?
          A hush falls over the crowd. Tran'seyes widen.

          TRAN

          INT. TRAN'S QUARTERS -- DAY

          Speedman is now seated in a comfortable, ornate chair,
          though his feet and hands are still bound. Tran and
          Byong and a few cohorts, stand across from him,
          whispering.

          TRAN'S ENTOURAGE

          SPEEDMAN
          What? You.. You saw Simple Jack?

          TRAN
          We love the tale of this man, Simple
          Jack.
          Tran snaps his fingers, and an assistant shows Speedman a
          battered VHS BOX OF SIMPLE JACK. Speedman looks lovingly
          at it.

          TRAN
          We do not have many luxury here. Simple
          Jack is the only movie we possess. We
          have watched it many, many times. How is
          the word? Genius?
          Speedman smiles big. They smile back at him. It's a
          small world after all.

          BODYGUARD
          (broken English)
          You should have got Oscar.

          SPEEDMAN
          Thanks. I mean even just the

          SPEEDMAN
          No, I mean it is great to.be nominated,..
          if you are, or that's what I hear.
          Whatever. It's a popularity contest.

          TRAN
          No. We will hold.you,for ransom.--.much

          He pulls out a cell phone.

          TRAM
          Is it possible to.have picture?

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh, sure, absolutely.
          Speedman tries to throw an arm around Tran, a guard grabs
          the arm., and twists it back. Speedman shrieks in pain.

          TRAN
          You mustn't touch me.
          The guard snaps the picture.

          ABODYGUARD
          That came out really good.

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- NIGHT

          The entire camp is assembled. Guards lead Speedman onto a
          platform; behind Tran.

          SPEEDMAN
          The whole movie?

          TRAN
          Yes. Begin.

          SPEEDMAN
          Hey, I know you're big fans and that's

          GREAT--
          Tran smacks Speedman in the, head with a rifle butt.
          Speedman crumples to the ground. The crowd cheers.

          SPEEDMAN

          OW!!
          Tran stands over him, screaming into his face:

          TRAN

          YOU WILL PERFORM, DO YOU UNDERSTAND??

          YOU WILL PERFORM OR DIE11! MONKEY-

          Speedman gets up, begins a scared, unenthusiastic

          EXT. HOLE -- DUSK

          Sand}asky slowly lifts his head out, surveying the
          territory. It looks clear. He drops back down.

          INT. HOLE -- DUSK

          The actors look miserable. Portnoy-looks.like his face is
          going to fall off

          SANDUSKY
          It looks clear, but I can't be sure. I
          say we stay in here till it's dark.

          REDYKULOUS
          I can't believe this is how it ends for
          Redykulous. I'm a triple platinum
          recording artist., Shit.

          PORTNOY
          (shivering and wheezing)
          I gotta get back to the hotel. I'm not
          gonna make.it...

          SANDUSKY
          Forget it. That guard patrol knows we're
          out'here. They'll be looking for us.
          Anyway, Speedman's in that compound. And
          no one else knows but us.

          LAZARUS
          That's right. So here's the plan.
          Everyone leans forward expectantly.

          LAZARUS
          We sneak out of here, make our way back
          to the hotel and once we're safe, we
          alert the government of Speedman's
          situation.

          REDYKULOUS
          Sounds good.

          SANDUSKY
          Whoa whoa whoa ... . wait! So, we're just
          gonna leave him here?

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 75.

          REDYKULOUS
          Yeah, and I don't wanna spend another
          minute getting the full on smell'o vision
          in this hole with his stinky ass.
          Everyone agrees. They start packing up. Sandusky looks
          horrified.
          SANDUSKY Au II4
          WAIT! Look, I don't think I've met a more
          wildly self involved human than Speedman,
          but you're just gonna leave him here? I
          mean, come on. He's a person, guys.
          These drug lords are killers. I mean,
          they eat their enemies. We leave him
          alone now, he doesn't have a chance in
          hell.

          LAZARUS,
          That tosser is in there because of his
          own stupidity. As far as I'm concerned,
          he brought it on himself.

          REDYKULOUS
          Besides, how could we possibly rescue
          him? Get real, Sandusky, we don't know
          what the fuck we doing out here.

          SANDUSKY
          We've gotten this far. Look, we're making
          a movie about one of the greatest rescues
          ever. It's a true story,, right? I mean,
          those guys weren't superheroes! They
          were just put in extra-ordinary
          circumstances, and they rose to the
          occasion.

          PORTNOY
          Yeah, but they were trained soldiers.
          They knew how to take care of themselves.

          SANDUSKY
          And we don't? They believed they could do
          it. They believed in each other. Look,
          I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

          (BEAT)
          I mean, some of us might not come back.

          REDYKULOUS
          You mean, like, not on the same flight?
          Sandusky just looks at them. They know that is not what
          he meant.

          I NEED MY DRUGS!

          SANDUSKY
          Jeff -- I know this is really hard for
          you,.â¢but you're gonna have to kick some
          time, and it might as well be now.
          (he turns to Lazarus)
          Kirk, I've always admired you as an
          actor. But as a person, I have to say,
          not that impressive.' You got a.few
          Oscars. Got any balls?
          Lazarus takes this in.

          SANDUSKY
          Redyk. Whadda.you say? You talk a good
          game, but how's it gonna feel when you're
          sipping Cristalle with your homies.in the
          hot tub back in.Cali knowing you left.a
          man to die back here? You gonna rhyme
          about that? ,
          There is a long beat.

          REDYKULOUS
          Shit. I only wish they was filming this
          for my show. I'm in.
          He looks to LazaruS.,Lazarus takes a long dramatic pause..
          Then...

          LAZARUS
          (with resolve)
          We could fooster about for donkey's
          years..Let:'s quit acting the maggot and
          nix that mentaller.
          The guys look at each other. What did that mean?

          Hi, Rick. It's Chris--

          INT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - COMMAND CENTER

          Byong presses pause on a tape recorder he's holding up to
          Chris's satellite phone. Tran watches, very serious.

          RICK (O.S.)
          Chris?

          WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM

          BYON G
          Yes, that was Chris. But you will not
          speak with him again. And do not bother
          trying to trace this call.

          RICK
          What's going on? Who is this?

          BYONG
          We are Flaming Dragon. Speedman is with
          us now.
          There is a long silence as Rick processes this. Then he
          nods slowly.

          RICK
          Oh. Really. Well I never heard of your
          little agency. But if you wanna poach my
          client? Lemme tell you something. His
          career's been in a death spiral since
          Simple Jack, so why don't you all go fuck
          yourselves! Oh, and I bet he hasn't even
          told you about the whole panda thing! He
          killed a panda! And next time you're at
          a cocktail party with Paris Hilton, or at
          Kate Mantellini's choking down some egg
          whites with Ron Howard, DON'T LET THAT
          SLIP, because chances are, I ALREADY DID!

          Messin' with a man's brain.

          The guys have set up a camp, with.a small fire. Everyone
          watches as Sandusky diagrams a plan in the dirt.

          SANDUSKY'
          Here's us. Here's the compound.Here's
          where Speedman was. It looks like they
          move him at night, cause he's not here
          now. Unfortunately we have no idea what
          the layout of that place is.

          But Speedman does. If we can get in
          there, and find him, maybe he can help us
          sneak him out.

          PORTNOY
          (sweating and in pain)
          I got an idea.
          Everyone turns to Portnoy.

          PORTNOY
          It might be a little crazy, but...

          REDYKULOUS
          Crazy is better than nothin'.

          SANDUSKY
          What is it?

          PORTNOY
          (intermittent pain noises)
          Back in '98, I did a low budget titty
          comedy for skinemax, "Sex Camp". Anyway,
          me and the campers from the uncool camp
          had to break into the rich girls' camp.
          So we did it by building a catapult.
          They shot us over the wall and we
          parachuted down.
          The guys all look at each other... then finally:

          LAZARUS
          That's the stupidest idea I've ever
          heard.

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say
          we wait till just before dawn and sneak
          over the fence. Take our chances. You
          guys ok with that?
          The group nods in approval.

          SANDUSKY
          Good. Then let's get some rest. Me and
          Redyk are on first watch.
          (to Lazarus)
          I'll wake you in two hours, and we'll
          switch.
          They break up. Portnoy comes up to Sandusky, extremely
          freaked out.

          SANDUSKY
          Yes you are.

          PORTNOY
          Then you gotta tie me up. I'm serious.
          Tie me to a tree. No matter how much I
          scream, or however much-I plead, you.must
          not untie me. I will be cunning, I will
          be in pain, and Iwill lie. The devil
          works this way. I will say, do, and
          excrete many regrettable things. But.no
          matter what.. .you must leave me alone.
          Beat..

          SANDUSKY
          Okay.. .Lazarus, you heard him. Tie him
          up. We'll get you through it.

          Speedman has now been moved back to the cage. He is doing

          Yeah. . .well at least you have someone to
          think about.

          EYES!!!! (VOMITING NOISE)

          SANDUSKY
          I don't think we're in love.

           PORTNOY (O.S.)
          Ohh... . thank God...its Over ...it's
          finally over...

          SANDUSKY:
          It'.s kind of depressing. That feeling of
          not having anyone who really loves you..
          Redykuloils. puts his arm around Sandusky to comfort him..

          REDYKULOUS
          Hey, it's cool.. I think you're extremely
          lovable.
          Weird silence.

          SANDUSKY
          What?

          REDYKULOUS
          (removing his arm)
          I mean like ...like,. I know what you mean.
          I have love problems myself!

          PORTNOY.(O.S.)

          OH-H-GOD-! ITS--NOT-OVER!

          SANDUSKY
          .No you don't. What would the great
          Redykulous, know about Girl Problems.
          You're ten girls deep 24 hours a day!

          REDYKULOUS
          .That's the problem.
          Silence.

          Ohh...phew...

          REDYKULOUS
          I know-impossible huh. That's what I
          say sometimes, but its true. Talk abort
          living a loveless life. At least you
          have someone who loves you. I don't even
          have that.

          SHATTERED GLASS RUBBING AGAINST AN OPEN

          WOUND!

          REDYKULOUS
          When I think of the nights, alone in my
          penthouse, when I've longed for the
          gentle touch of another dude, to feel his
          skin against mine, or his sweet breath on
          my face.

          PORTNOY (O.S.)

          Most of the time, when I'm writing about
          ho's in my songs, 'I really mean Niggaz.
          Creatively, that's the only way I can
          cope.

          SANDUSKY
          So what! You're gay! You're also a great
          artist and-businessman ... why not rap
          about that?
          ï¿½u IÂ° I. 11ï¿½jm

          and fragrances go south? It's all such a
          lie.
          Now he begins to cry .a. little. Sandusky embraces him.

          SANDUSKY.
          Shhh...shhh... .shhh..shhh..shhh... .That's
          it...let it out.

          If you tell anyone I'll have someone

          SANDUSKY
          I'm not gonna tell anyone, and your not
          gonna shoot me... .th-at's it...l-et -tout.
          Redykulous pulls back, and collects himself.

          REDYKULOUS
          Aww shit... (sniff sniff) I can't. believe
          it's possibly the last day of my life,
          and I'm not even gonna be able to let my
          fans know how truly 'Utterly Redykulous I
          really am.

          SANDUSKY
          (with total sincerity)
          Listen, I know how utterly Redykulous you
          are. Even for just.thisone
          moment. . .and sometimes that enough.

          INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- NIGHT

          Cody, still awkwardly holding the hooks, is yelling at
          Four Leaf.

          CODY
          So all of "Tropic Thunder" is bullshit?

          FOUR LEAF
          No! Four Leaf and his men were real, it
          happened!

          CODY
          Are you even a VET!?

          FOUR LEAF
          YES! Well ...no! I mean, kinds! Yeah! Not
          exactly. I served honorably in what they
          called the "forced service". Sanitation
          Detail at the United States Pentagon.

          CODY
          So you were some two bit criminal who got
          caught and sentenced to clean toilets at
          the Pentagon? I IDOLIZED YOU MAN!

          FOUR LEAF
          God-dammit, would you LISTEN! I was a
          fuckup, sure, but one day as I was
          cleaning the office of some Top-Brass big-
          wig, I came across a file headed for the
          shredder marked top secret. It was Four
          Leaf Tayback's file. A nobody. No family.
          Nothing. Killed in Action. They were
          gonna bury the whole thing. Total black
          op.

          CODY
          So you decided to take his identity?

          FOUR LEAF
          NO! I gave him one! I wrote the story
          And I gave the American people a hero!
          Yes, I am not technically Four Leaf, but
          if I didn't pretend to be him then nobody
          woulda ever known who he was! See what
          I'm sayin'?

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 88.

          CODY
          And you cashed in!

          FOUR LEAF
          I was a fuck up my whole life! This guy
          had a story worth-telling, and nobody
          woulda ever known!
          Cody slumps in the corner, looking spent and lost.

          FOUR LEAF
          I'm sorry, man.. I'm responsible: for this
          .whole mess.

          EXT. JUNGLE -- PRE-DAWN

          PORTNOY wakes up, still tied to. the tree, looking like
          shit. But realizes something-that makes him ecstatic:

          PORTNOY
          I'm clean! I'M CLEAN!!!!!
          He struggles to his feet, doing a celebratory dance. He
          immediately gets nauseous again and heaves.

          CLOSE ON THE FLAMING DRAGON INSIGNIA
          Pull back to reveal that it is on a piece of paper being
          pulled from a fax machine.
          The text below reads:
          "Flamingg. Dragon has Speedman.lfyou want him, the price is $5O Million."
          There's a phone number below it.
          Reveal we're in...

          INT. AGENCY OFFICE -- LOS ANGELES -- DAY.

          Rick frowns at the fax. His Hot Assistant comes in.

          Rick, you better check your email.
          He punches up his email. He opens a video attachment. We

          SEE:

          ON RICK'S COMPUTER
          A bad quality video of Speedman sitting in the
          interrogation room.

          BYONG(V.O.)
          Mr. Rick Peck. So far you have refused
          to give us the respect we asked for.

          SPEEDMAN
          Well, I guess that really varies from
          project to project--
          Byong SCREAMS at Speedman, who cowers. Even Rick
          flinches.

          TRAM (V.0.)
          Wrong answer!! You work for me now!! Do
          you understand! Like my desk or my gun,

          fuck-it-is!

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND -- PRE DAWN

           SERIES OF SHOTS as the guerillas ready for an attack...

          EXT. CAMPSITE -- PRE-DAWN

          The guys are suiting up for combat. They apply burnt cork
          to their faces for camouflage.

          SANDUSKY
          This is it. You know what you need to
          do.' Tropic Thunder on three, two, one...

          GUYS

          TROPIC THUNDER!
          They make their way down the hill.

          EXT. FENCE LINE -- PRE-DAWN

           They reach the fence. The coast looks clear and they each
          scamper over...
           Finally, it's PORTNOY'S turn. He's clearly too heavy.
           The fence groans under'his weight. He launches himself --
          and...
          THWANG!!! Slams painfully into the razor wire of the
          fence.
          GUARDS hear the noise. They raise their weapons and
          listen.. They see nothing in the pre-dawn darkness...
          The actors run to the wall and clumsily pull PORTNOY
          down, just in time.
          Everyone's inside the perimeter... they quickly make their
          way along the fence line to the entrance of the main
          building, ducking away to avoid a LONE GUARD.

          INT. MAIN BUILDING

          Sandusky makes a series of hand gestures, indicating for
          them to'split up and search for Speedman. A beat. The
          guys all shrug, not understanding. Sandusky repeats the
          hand gestures. Finally he has to speak.
          i 1, 11 11^ï¿½%

          SANDUSKY I 4I4
          (in a loud whisper, also
          signalling what.he's saying)
          FAN OUT! 'GO ROOM BY ROOM ! IF YOU SEE, nci 16,
          SPEEDMAN, give the signal!
          We follow PORTNOY, working his wayldown a hall. He peaks
          around a half opened door...

          A DARKENED ROOM
          .PORTNOY turns on his flashlight to reveal he is in fact
          in... HEROIN HEAVEN! Wall to wall packets, ready,for
          shipment.. PORTNOY is paralyzed. He spots a box with the
          words "For U.S.A., 100% pure, dilute before ingesting".
          His mouth LITERALLY waters, and'a drop. of .spittle oozes
          from his bottom lip. He doesn't know what to do. He
          gently takes two handfuls of the heroin from the box.
          marked "pure". It's like holding two grenades...

          HALLWAY
          Sandusky moves silently toward a door. He kicks it'open
          to reveal...

          SPEEDMAN
          Shackled to the floor. Delirious, he sits bolt upright.

          SPEEDMAN
          You mu-mu-make me ha-aa-ppy.

          SANDUSKY
          Oh sweet Jesus. Hold tight, Buddy! I'll
          be right back!
          Sandusky runs off to get the guys.

          HALLWAY
          Sandusky rounds up Redyk and Lazarus, points to both of
          his eyes, signalling that he's got "eyes",on Speedman.
          They take a step in that direction. Redykulous stops
          them, and makes a made up, absurd signal for "Where is
          Portnoy?", somehow trying to mime looking for a fat guy.
          No one knbws what he is doing.

          REDYKULOUS

          (FRUSTRATED)
          Where is Portnoy?!

          SANDUSKY
          Shhh!
          A muffled, anguished animal noise that could only be
          PORTNOY emanates from a nearby door. They run towards it.
          Redykulous kicks it in.

          HEROIN HEAVEN
          The 'gang flies in, to discover Portnoy holding the bags,
          crying.

          REDYKULOUS
          What are you doing, man!

          SANDUSKY
          Come on, let's go! We found Speedmani

          PORTNOY
          I don't care! It doesn't matter what I
          do! I'll always be a screw-up! No one
          will ever respect me...

          REDYKULOUS
          That's not true! Listen, back in the
          day, I used to think I couldn't produce a
          record simply because...

          SANDUSKY
          .he's gay.
          Uh-oh. That's not what Redykulous was about to say. Beat.

          REDYKULOUS
          Actually I was going to say poor.

          SANDUSKY
          Sorry...

          people laugh!

          PORTNOY
          You said my farts made them laugh! Leave
          me ALONE!!

          REDYKULOUS.,
           That ain't true Portnoy! Lotta people be
          fartin' and not be gettin' 20 large a pop
          for it!

          OUTSIDE THE DOOR
          .TWO GUARDS hear the noises inside, head. in to check it
          out.

          HEROIN ROOM
          The guys hear the guards enter the far side of the room.
          They can't see the guys through the.shelves packed with
          heroin packets.

          SANDUSKY
          Damnit! We need to go!

          No, I can't do it.

          I need it! I need it!! This'is all I
          deserve.

          REDYKULOUS
          Come on, man...
          And.the guards emerge. around a corner! They jab their
          rifles.at:the guys and SCREAM AT THEM TO PUT THEIR HANDS

          UP!
          The guys all slowly raise their hands...
          Then, in a moment of craziness, PORTNOY CHARGES THE

          GUARDS, PIE-ING THEM IN THE FACE WITH THE HEROIN PACKETS.

          PORTNOY

          LAUGH AT THAT!! LAUGH AT THAT BASTARD!!
          The guards let off a BURST OF MACHINE GUN FIRE as Portnoy
          grinds it into their noses...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 95.

          INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- CONTINUOUS

          They hear the fire. Four Leaf runs to the window. Through
          it he sees the commotion...

          CODY
          What?

          FOUR LEAF
          Something's happening! Get me the hooks!

          HEROIN ROOM
          Portnoy watches as the white faced guards fall to their
          knees, choking and groggy. After a beat, they collapse.

          PORTNOY
          Let's move! We got about sixteen hours
          before they wake up!
          They run out.

          SPEEDMAN'S CELL
          The guys run in. Redykulous breaks the lock off
          Speedman's ankle with his rifle butt. Sandusky keeps
          watch by the door.,

          REDYKULOUS,
          C'mon! We're busting you out!

          SPEEDMAN
          Muh-my nnnname is Juh-Jack. Some folks
          call muh-me Simple Juh-Jack.

          REDYKULOUS
          What's wrong with him?

          SANDUSKY
          I think he thinks he's Simple Jack. Like
          from the movie?

          LAZARUS'
          Shite. I was afraid of this. The same
          thing happened to me when I played Neil
          Armstrong in "Moonshot". They found me in
          an alley in Burbank re-entering the
          Earth's atmosphere in an old refrigerator
          box.

          REDYKULOUS
          I heard that movie was good.

          SANDUSKY
          Can you fix him?!

          LAZARUS
          I'll try.
          Lazarus takes Speedman's face in his hands, forces him to
          look at him.

          LAZARUS
          .You're Chris Michael Speedman!

          SPEEDMAN
          Ah 1-1-likes pie.

          LAZARUS
          You're the greatest star in the world!
          There's a flicker of intelligence in Speedman's eyes. It
          passes.

          INT. CODYAND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- CONTINUOUS

          Four Leaf wedges one of the hooks in the. door jamb, and
          Cody does the same with the other. In one fell swoop,
          :they bust. the door off its hinges.

          E-X-T . DE-T-EN-T-ION-HU-T----DAWN-
          They emerge into the chaos. IT IS DAYLIGHT NOW. A GUARD
          runs by, Four Leaf uses the hook to trip him up. Cody
          knocks him out and grabs his machine gun. He tosses the
          guard's pistol to Four Leaf.

          CODY
          By the way, what's your name anyway?

          FOUR LEAF
          Marvin Kaminsky.

          CODY
          you ever been in this jungle?

          FOUR LEAF
          Nope. First time outta the states
          actually.
          He shoots off a round and they run for cover.

          INT. SPEEDMAN'S CELL -- CONTINUOUS

          Lazarus is right in Speedman's face. He seems to be
          getting clearer...

          LAZARUS
          The world needs you! It` needs its stars!
          You make people forget how awful and 1ï¿½ I Ii I. 1 ,14M
          depressing their lives are! People love
          your work! And... I love your work, too.
          Speedman is quiet.

          SPEEDMAN I
          Uhhhh-uh-I'm... Spah-speeedman?

          LAZARUS
          Simple Jack was magnificent!

          SANDUSKY
          Is it working?

          LAZARUS
          JESUS! Give me time, Sandusky! I'm not re-
          programming a VCR!!
          (back to Speedman)
          You really committed yourself. And for
          that you DESERVED AN OSCAR!
          Speedman registers this.

          LAZARUS

          (FRUSTRATED)

          C'MON CHRIS! DAMMIT! YOU MUST KNOW WHO

          YOU ARE!
          Lazarus's own words make him stop and think.

          LAZARUS
          (almost to himself)
          You know who you are... . you do Chris.
          Long beat.

          LAZARUS
          Unlike me. What am I doing? I can't do
          this. How can I convince a man he is who
          we know he is, when I can't even convince
          myself of the same thing.
          He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down.

          so insecure alla a sudden?! You're Kirk
          Lazarus! You're like the greatest actor

          LAZARUS
          Am I Redykulous? ... AM I!...Or.am I just
          acting like that's who I am?
          No. The sad fact is... I'm not Sergeant

          .Armstrong. I'm not even .Kirk Lazarus.
          (a beat)
          I have no idea who I am.
          The guys look at him... it's the first time he has let
          his guard down.

          SANDUSKY
          Kirk, this is NOT the time!

          LAZARUS
          And I guess when you-do themath... .and

          He winks at Sandusky.

          REDYKULOUS
          That's right! We're.not what we're
          called, or who we pretend to be. We are
          what we are in our hearts. And to me,
          looking into your heart, you're a hero..
          Lazarus looks to Redykulous.

          LAZARUS
          You mean that?

          And I'll second that.
          They all'turn to see...SPEEDMAN. The million-dollar smile
          is back!

          SPEEDMAN
          Now let's get the hell outta here!
          Speedman leads the men to the door. Sandusky tosses
          Speedman'a machine gun.

          SPEEDMAN
          Thanks Kevin.

          SANDUSKY
          My name...you remembered my name. You
          gotta show us the way outta here Chris.

          SPEEDMAN
          Follow me.
          This time they do...

          HALLWAY
          The guys run toward the opening to the courtyard,
          Speedman leading the way...

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- CONTINUOUS

           They huddle close to the wall, unseen, surveying the
          situation: about 20 GUARDS on full alert... a JEEP about
          30 feet away... beyond that, A HELIPAD with the
          compound's chopper, maybe 200 yards in the distance...

          SPEEDMAN
          That's their supply chopper.

          SANDUSKY
          If we could create a diversion, we could
          get to that jeep and drive it right over
          there...

          "Ttopic Thunder 100.

          PORTNOY
          Anybody here know how to fly a
          helicopter? Cause that would come in,
          handy too.

          SPEEDMAN
          You want a diversion? I'll give you a
          diversion. Is this baby loaded?
          He holds up the machine gun...

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah, but...
          And with'that, Speedman runs out in to the courtyard,..
          the opposite direction from the jeep, doing a CRAZY WAR'

          WHOOP...
          A BUNCH OF GUARDS turns to,see.him... he does a-SUPER
          MACHO TUCK AND ROLL, landing perfectly and EMPTYING HIS

          CARTRIDGE ON. THE GUARDS...

          SANDUSKY
          (to.himself)
          .they're blanks...
          There is a long moment of silence as the guards just
          stare at Speedman. He seems a. bit surprised that. they are
          not dead,. as do the guards themselves. They cock their
          weapons, about to shoot him when.,..
          A HAIL OF-BULLET FIRE-erupts-behind-the-gu-ards... They
          turn...WE REVEAL CODY AND FOUR LEAF BEHIND THEM, THEIR

          GUNS FIRING INTO THE AIR!!

          SANDUSKY
          Let's move!
          The.guys jump into the jeep, Sandusky at the wheel, and
          'gun it..

          SANDUSKY
          Chris, come.on!
          Speedman jumps. into the jeep as it passes by. They are
          speeding toward the helipad.

          SPEEDMAN WATCHES FOUR LEAF AND CODY, WHO CONTINUE

          SHOOTING AT THE GUARDS...

          SPEEDMAN
          Four Leaf! Effects guy! Come on!!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 101.
          But they can't break away, they-are trying to run toward
          the jeep but are under too much fire...

          SPEEDMAN

          WE GOTTA GET THEM, GO AROUND!!
          Sandusky swings the wheel hard. . .the jeep careens back
          toward the firefight...they come in hard, and SKID TO A

          STOP NEXT TO FOUR LEAF AND CQDY..1.
          Cody jumps in the jeep, but FOUR LEAF DOESN'T...

          SANDUSKY
          Get in the Jeep!

          FOUR LEAF
          You go... I got real bullets! I'll cover
          you.. It's the only way you'll make it!

          CODY
          Marvin, you gotta --

          FOUR LEAF
          Just go!!
          Sandusky looks at Speedman... they both know he's right.
          They go... leaving Four Leaf in the dust, still firing...
          The jeep speeds up to the helipad... the guys jump out.
          Just as the last guy is out...

          BOOM! A HUGE BLAST FLIPS THE JEEP INTO THE AIR...
          Across the courtyard is TRAN... who just fired an RPG at
          our guys!
          The guys are freaked and shaken, but start to get in the
          chopper... Sandusky pushes Cody in...

          A

          SANDUSKY
          Start the chopper now Cody!
          Cody nods, getting his bearings... and hitting the
          ignition...the BLADES SLOWLY HUM TO LIFE, BEGINNING TO
          TURN... Portnoy grabs Cody's gun and hangs by the runner,
          shooting towards approaching guards...

          WHAT WE SEE NEXT SHOULD PLAY OUT VERY MUCH THE SAME AS

          THE OPENING OF THE MOVIE:
          Tran is reloading his RPG...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 102.
          REDYK and LAZARUS GET. IN, and SPEEDMAN grabs a live
          machine gun off the ground and fires toward TRAN and his
          men.

          LAZARUS

          WE GOTTA GO NOW!! LET'S MOVE!!

          CODY

          BUT FOUR LEAF --

          LAZARUS

          WE'RE. ALL DEAD MEAT IF WE DON'T.LIFT OFF

          NOW!! DO IT CODY!!
          Cody reluctantly pulls up the throttle. The chopper.
          begins to LIFT OFF...

          SPEEDMAN.

          FOUR LEAF IS STILL OUT THERE!

          LAZARUS

          WE GOTTA GO! PORTNOY GET YER ASS IN THIS

          CHOPPER!!

          PORTNOY

          I'M TRYING!!
          Portnoy is not being heroic, he, is genuinely having
          trouble getting in.-the chopper.
          But then Speedman sees something...

          SPEEDMAN
          It's him...

          SPEEDMAN'S POV
          FOUR LEAF... much-like.Speedman playing him in the
          beginning of the. movie... Arms extended, his body riddled
          with bullets...

          LAZARUS

          FOOCK!
          Cody lowers the chopper ... Speedman jumps out...

          SPEEDMAN
          Cover me!
          Speedman runs towards Four Leaf, through a hailstorm of
          bullets...PORTNOY AND THE GUYS PROVIDE AS MUCH COVER AS

          THEY CAN...

          

          

          

          
          i- Tropic Thunder 103.
          Speedman reaches Four Leaf and collapses beside him,
          cradling his head.
          Trap's men continue to bear down on them...

          FOUR LEAF
          Go on...get outta here. I'm worm food,
          you dig?

          SPEEDMAN

          DON'T YOU DIE ON ME!
          (then totally surprised)
          You have hands?

          ON THE CHOPPER
          The guys are busy shooting off their attackers, but they
          see this moment happening...

          BACK TO SPEEDMAN AND FOUR LEAF
          The life is draining from Four Leaf (Marvin)...

          FOUR LEAF
          I ain't Four Leaf, Chris. We're in this
          mess because of me.

          SPEEDMAN
          (can't get over it)
          How did you get hands?

          FOUR LEAF
          I ain't never been worth a nothin'...and
          it's too late to start bein' a somethin'
          now.
          Speedman tries to understand. He is welling up with
          emotion.. .real emotion.

          FOUR LEAF

          (SINCERELY)
          But you... you can tell the story. . .You
          have to tell the real story...
          And Four Leaf... or Marvin... dies.
          Speedman begins to weep. Tears. Yes, he is crying, for
          real...

          AND WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL THIS PLAYING ON A GIANT VIDEO

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- DAY

          Peck is tied up, in ragged, prisoner clothes, hanging in
          the cage. He has been there a while.

          PECK
          Ok, look, you wanna go through this
          again, let's do it. I see more for you
          than this. This whole 'big fish in the
          little scary jungle pond' thing. I see
          you as a front man, as a leader, not just
          of this little rebel guerilla warrior
          group. I see it big picture. Is it music,
          is it movies? Is it a series on Fox? I
          don't know. But I do know it is not
          happening with you staring at me doing my
          "I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings" routine
          for you and the peanut gallery for
          another six months. It's old school
          already.
          TRAN and some HENCHMEN watch, unamused. Tran nods, one of
          the henchmen turns a handle which lowers the cage into
          the water. After a moment, it comes back up with a
          soaking Peck.

          PECK
          (not missing a beat)
          And it makes me sad to see you chomping
          on the stogie and you're not even
          fourteen or whatever. I'm thinking "what
          hole does that need to fill, that you
          have to keep dipping me into the water to
          somehow feel better about yourself?" I
          can be a partner to you, not just a
          captive.

          Tropic Thunder

           106.
          PECK (cont'd)
          But you have to allow me into your inner
          workings, into your headspace to
          facilitate that. And"to do that you gotta
          let me outta the cage,'both figuratively
          and literally. Until you can let me go, I
          you.can't let you go. Do you get that?
          He gets dunked in the water again.

          PECK
          Obviously not. Dare I bring up.a sore
          subject. Can we do a little business on
          the blackberry privileges? Cause you're
          killing me here.

          TITLE SEQUENCE

      1   EXT. MOUNTAINS, NEAR GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - NIGHT

          The snow covered Alps stand out clearly in the light of a full
          moon.  A fortress-like CHATEAU is situated in a flat saddle of
          forest partway up the mountain, next to a frozen lake.  The
          property is surrounded by high stone walls, and the stately
          grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards
          with dogs.


      2   EXT. CHATEAU - NIGHT

          The driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars.  A formal-
          dress party is in progress... a private reception for a middle-
          eastern dignitary.  Tuxedoes men escort their diamond-encrusted
          ladies through the huge front doors, where they doff their
          overcoats and are politely scanned with hand-held metal
          detectors by white gloved security staffers.

          The walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake, forming
          a kind of rampart.  There is an opening, to a kind of waterway
          or canal, which connects to the private docks inside the
          grounds.  There is a steel grating across the opening.  The
          bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter.

          With the house visible BG, we CRANE DOWN below the parapet wall
          along which a guard is a white exposure-suit is walking... down
          along the dark wall to the grating... TILTING DOWN to see a
          glow pulsing under the ice.

      
      3   EXT. BENEATH THE ICE, UNDERWATER - NIGHT      
      
          Camera moving toward:  A FIGURE in diving gear working at the
          metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch.  One bar has
          already been cut out.  Two quick cuts and a second bar falls to
          the muddy bottom.  Lit now only from the floodlights filtering
          down through the ice, the figure slips through the bars and
          swims powerfully along the stone canal wall.

          Seem from below, the figure is a black shadow moving against
          the rippled-glass of the ice above.


      4   EXT. CANAL AND BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

          A dock extends into the frozen canal, just behind a large
          boathouse.  There is a faint chipping sound.  The ice breaks
          quietly, and the pieces are slid back.  A head appears, in a
          rubber drysuit hood.  The DIVER slips the regulator out of his
          mouth and turns slowly, scanning...  revealing:

          HARRY TASKER.  Our hero.  Harry floats with just his eyes above
          the surface, silent as a water snake, as a guard passes on a
          footpath nearby.

          After a few beats Harry slips out of his tanks and fins,
          letting them sink, and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock.
          He moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse.
          Opening a WATERPROOF BAG, he pulls out a walky talky.

                              HARRY
                    Honey, I'm home.


      5   INT. / EXT. SURVEILLANCE VAN, MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

          Meet Harry's partner, ALBERT "GIB" GIBSON, an overweight twenty-
          year-man with a lived in looking face.  Gib answers Harry via
          his headset.

                              GIB
                    Roger that. 
                         (he covers the mike and
                          turns)
                    Hey, Fize!  Get your butt in
                    here.  Harry's inside.

          Outside, FAST FAISIL, an Iranian-American, finishes making
          yellow snow and hurries back to the van.  They are parked on a
          winding mountain road a half-mile from the chateau, whose
          lights are visible through the trees.

          Faisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto
          nightvision scope.  The eerie green image lurches as he sweeps
          the grounds, locating the boathouse.


      6   EXT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

          Concealed in the shadows, Harry is shucking out of his drysuit.
          Underneath is he is wearing black tux pants, suspenders,
          cummerbund and a formal shirt.  He puts a tiny plug, like a
          hearing aid, deep in his ear canal.  A SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER.
          Very advanced.

                              HARRY
                    Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you
                    copy?

                              GIB (OVER)
                    It's Talkradio.  You're on the
                    air.

          Harry slips into his shoulder harness... holster on one side,
          containing his .45 auto Glock-22, and the transmitter pack for
          the ear-piece slung on the other.  He slips on a formal jacket,
          concealing the rig.  Then a final touch.  A little aftershave
          from a tiny plastic vial.

          Harry adjusts his bow-tie and strides confidently out of the
          shadows, crossing quickly to the main house.  He looks
          ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and
          his hair slicked back.  He enters the main house through a back
          service entrance.


      7   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                                
          Harry strides through the huge kitchen like he owns the place.
          The kitchen staff are scurrying around, too busy to really
          notice.  He finger-tastes a dish as he passes.

                              HARRY
                         (French/ subtitled)
                    This needs more garlic.

          He breezes through unchallenged, exiting into the--


      8   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          Here the party is in full swing.  Harry blends smoothly into
          the crowd of foreign dignitaries, businessman and minor mid-
          east nobility.  They are a high-octane mixture of new oil money
          and old European money, and run the spectrum from stodgy
          bankers to playboy arms dealers.

          Harry strolls amiably among the glittering woman, the cigar
          smoking men, casually snagging a glass of champagne and a
          canape from the passing waiters.  He nods to someone as if he
          knows them.  Greets another is quite fluent Arabic.  People in
          his wake look at each other like "Do you know him?"   They
          shrug, go on with their conversation.  Harry moves through the
          crowd.  Scanning.

                              HARRY
                    There's Daddy Petrobucks.

          HARRY'S POV - Through the crowd is sees JAMAL KHALED, the host
          of the party and owner of the chateau.  He is fat and animated,
          greeting guests with a flourish.  As Harry watches he warmly     *
          greets a beautiful WOMAN.  They become absorbed in a             *
          conversation.

          The woman glances up and sees Harry checking her out.  There is
          a frank moment of returned interest.  Then the crowd shifts,
          cutting off their view of each other.


      9   INT. STAIRCASE AND SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          Harry makes his way up the grand staircase to the second floor.  *
          He slips through doors into the private area of the mansion.     *


     10   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

          The doors open and Harry slips into the darkened library.  He    *
          crosses quickly to a window and opens it onto a terrace.         *


     11   EXT. BALCONIES - NIGHT                                           *

          Harry goes onto the terrace, and in a display of acrobatic       *
          prowess, he pulls himself up onto the third floor balcony        *
          directly above.  He lets himself into--                          *


     12   INT. KHALED'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                     *

          Khaled's office is ornately furnished.  Beautiful antiques
          glint in the moonlight coming in the French-doors.  Harry
          crosses to an immense desk and boots up the computer there.
          Bathed in the glow from the screen, he pulls a FLAT BOX,  about
          the size of a paperback,  from the back of his cummerbund.  He
          connects it quickly to the modem port in the back of the
          computer.

                              HARRY
                    Modem in place.  Transmitting...
                    now.

          He pushes a button and a green light comes on.


     13   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib and Faisil watch as their monitor screen lights with DATA
          from Khaled's private computer.

                              FAISIL
                    Affirmatory.  We are in.                               *

          Fast Faisil is a computer ace.  His fingers fly on the keyboard
          as he types rapid key commands.  We see familiar "windows
          appear".  The words are all in Arabic characters.

                              FAISIL
                    These are encrypted files, guys.
                    This is going to take me a few
                    minutes.


     14   OMITTED                                                          *


     15   INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   *

          TIGHT ON LIBRARY DOOR.  It opens a crack and a dental mirror     *
          comes out, looking around like a U-boat periscope.  Seeing the
          coast is clear Harry slips out.  But just as he is closing the
          door, a GUARD rounds the corner ten feet away.  Harry turns
          smoothly.  He smiles sheepishly and moves toward the guard.

                              HARRY
                         (In Arabic/ subtitled)
                    Where's the john around here?  I
                    have to take a major leak.

          The guard points warily down the corridor.  Harry nods and
          heads that way, back toward the party.


     16   INT. MAIN HALL/ STAIRCASE - NIGHT

          Harry comes down the staircase amid the glitter of the party.
          He is sipping champagne and looking bored.  He sees two
          security guys moving purposefully through the crowd toward the
          stairs, walkies in their hands.  He turns away as they pass him
          and pretends to study a large fragment of bas-relief... a
          temple frieze depicting a war chariot drawn by four horses.

          He senses someone next to him and turns.  It is the WOMAN.  She  *
          is captivatingly beautiful, and her gaze is piercing.

                              HARRY
                         (indicating the bas-
                          relief)
                    Magnificent, isn't it?

                              WOMAN
                    Yes.  Hi, I'm Juno Skinner.  I
                    thought I knew most of Khaled's
                    friends but I don't believe I
                    know you.

          Harry offers his hand to her.

                              HARRY
                    Renquist.  Harry Renquist.


     17   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib whirls to the screen displaying the mission database.  He
          scans rapidly for--

                              GIB
                    Skinner.  Skinner.  Come on...

          Gib finds the entry he's looking for.  Juno's picture and data
          appear on the screen.

                              GIB
                    Juno Skinner.  Art and
                    antiquities dealer, specializing
                    in ancient Persia.


     18   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          Harry turns back to the fragment of frieze.

                              HARRY
                    This is Persian, if I'm not
                    mistaken.

                              JUNO
                    Very good.  It's sixth century
                    B.C.  Do you like the period?

                              HARRY
                         (shameless)
                    I adore it.


     19   EXT. DOCK/ BOATHOUSE (NIGHTVISION POV) - NIGHT

          Seen through the starlight scope, we see one of the guards
          shining his light on the hole in the ice and then on Harry's
          footprints leading to the boathouse.  He calls to one of the
          other guards, who comes running over.


     20   INT. MANSION - NIGHT

          Harry, still with Juno, hears Gib in his ear:

                              GIB (VO)
                    Harry, we got a problem.  Guards
                    are swarming all over the dock.

          Harry glances up the stairs.  Khaled's SECURITY CHIEF is
          gesturing to several of his men, and speaking quickly into a
          walky.  Three SECURITY MEN come down the stairs, scanning the
          crowd.  Harry turns smoothly away from them and takes Juno's
          arm.

                              HARRY
                    Do you dance, Ms. Skinner?

          He steers her toward the dance floor.


     21   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib, listening, rolls his eyes.  He looks through the night-
          vision scope.  Guards are running around outside the chateau.
          Harry's stirred up the hornet's nest.  Faisil is still jamming
          at the keyboard.

                              FAISIL
                    Okay, files are unlocked.  I'm
                    in. I'm down, baby.  I got my
                    hand up her dress and I'm going
                    for the gold.  I'm--

                              GIB
                    Just copy the goddamn files!
                         (into his headset)
                    Harry, don't be stopping to smell
                    the roses, now.  You hear me,
                    Harry?


     22   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          Harry whirls Juno aggressively across the dancefloor.  She
          responds deftly.  They are well matched.  She parries each of
          his smooth moves with a flourish.  It is a contest of wills,
          and a surprised appraisal for each that the other is worthy.
          Juno is hot.  He bends her back at the waist, then snaps her
          up.  She twirls into the crook of his arm.  Their faces are
          inches apart.  Wow.  The music ends and she gives him a wry
          grin.

                              JUNO
                    Well.  And I thought this was
                    going to be just another bunch of
                    boring bankers and oil
                    billionaires.

                              GIB (OVER)
                    Harry, seconds count, buddy.
                    Ditch the bitch, let's go.

                              HARRY
                    Unfortunately, Juno, I have a
                    plane to catch.

          She slips a card out of a pocket in her otherwise sheer dress.
          She hands it to him, maintaining eye contact.  Serious sparks.

                              JUNO
                    Call me, if you'd like to see
                    some of my other pieces.

                              HARRY
                    I'd like that.


     23   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib can't believe this conversation.

                              GIB
                         (to Faisil)
                    Son of a bitch is with her two
                    minutes and she's ready to bear
                    his children
                         (to Harry)
                    What's your exit strategy Twinkle
                    Toes?


     24   EXT. CHATEAU/ FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

          Harry nods to the security men at the door as he strides
          confidently through.  He goes down the steps to the broad
          terrace above the motor court.  Behind Harry, a GUARD lowers
          his walky talky and starts after him.

                              GUARD
                    May I see your invitation, sir?

          Without turning, Harry slips a small flat box out of his breast
          pocket.  A REMOTE DETONATOR.

                              HARRY                                        *
                    Here's my invitation.                                  *

          He pushes the button and--                                       *

          KABOOM!  The  second floor office windows blow out in a fiery
          explosion.  Using the diversion, Harry leaps off the terrace
          before the guard can open fire.


     25   INT. / EXT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib sees the rising fireball a half-mile away.  He starts the
          van.

                              GIB
                    Aw, shit.  Here we go--


     26   EXT. CHATEAU AND GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Harry sprints across the snow-covered lawn, through the trees.
          Guards with automatic weapons run after him, firing.  The snow
          explodes around him with bullet hits.

          TWO DOBERMANS pelt toward Harry, leaping at him in perfect
          unison.  He waits... and knocks their heads together in mid-
          leap with a crack like a baseball bat.  The dogs drop to the
          snow, wobbling around like they're drunk.

          As Harry sprints on, ANOTHER DOBERMAN lunges out of the bushes
          ahead, leaping directly for his throat.  Harry grabs the dog
          and shot-puts him up into a tree without breaking stride.  Dog
          Fu.  The dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch,
          looking down in amazement.


     27   EXT. PERIMETER WALL/ MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

          Harry leaps down on the outside of the wall, hitting a snow
          bank and sliding downhill.  He sprints down the gentle slope
          toward the highway.

          Harry looks back as TWO GUARDS ON SKIS come out of a guard
          station beside the main entrance.

          TRACKING WITH THE SKI-GUARDS, searching through the trees with
          lights.  They have lost Harry.  They stop.  A snowbank behind
          them EXPLODES as Harry leaps out.  He disables them both with
          vicious street-fighter moves.  Harry looks upslope as--

          A service gate opens in the perimeter wall and TEAMS OF
          SECURITY MEN in white snow-suits pour out, some on skis, some
          on SNOWMOBILES.  A HELICOPTER rises over the wall in a blast of
          swirling snow.  Its xenon lights rake through the trees,
          casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow.

          ON Harry, snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one
          of the disabled guards.  He pops the boots quickly into the
          bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guard's FN FAL
          rifles slung across his back.

          The helicopter swoops downhill, its searchlight blazing through
          the forest.  Snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski-patrols
          zig-zagging among the trees.

          Harry slashes expertly downhill.  He cuts a distinguished
          figure in his black tux.  Automatic weapons fire rips through
          the trees from behind him.  Harry is going flat-out.  The xenon
          light hits him.  A 7.62 mm machine gun in the chopper rips the   *
          slope into white clouds around him.  Harry slashes, turns,
          weaving among the trees at breakneck speed.  A snowmobile is
          closing in, outflanking him.  He turns toward it, suddenly.
          Hits a mogul.  Uses the air to slash his skis right across the
          rider's face.  The snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the
          night.


     28   INT. / EXT. VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

          GIB'S VAN takes an icy turn in a hairy slide.

          INSIDE Gib is peering upslope, trying to see what's going on.
          All he can see are lights and gunfire.

                              GIB
                    Harry, what's your twenty?  I
                    need a position, buddy--

          Suddenly a skier in a black tux launches across the road from
          the slope above, RIGHT OVER THE VAN, and lands deftly
          downslope.

                              GIB
                    Uh... right!  I'll catch you on
                    the next bend.

          Behind the van, pursuing guards leap across the road.  Only
          about half can make the jump.  The rest crash horribly.  The
          helicopter thunders overhead.


     29   EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

          Harry sees the chopper start an attack run.  He comes out into
          the open, going straight downhill like a rocket.  The chopper
          gets suckered in...  trying to hit him, getting right down
          behind him... and suddenly-- Harry slides to a stop in an
          explosion of powder and whips up the rifle.  P-P-P-POW!  He
          rakes a burst across the windshield.  The startled pilot
          swerves and-- Suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front
          of him.

          K-WHACK!  The main-rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper
          drops into the snow, plowing into a snowbank.  It slides right
          to the edge of a steep ridge and stops, teetering.

          Firing from a snowmobile, one of the guards puts a burst right
          across Harry's path.  Harry's skis are hit and he tumbles,
          comes out of it...  running down the hill like a juggernaut in
          his heavy boots.  He has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow.

          Harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed
          chopper, which still has its engine running.  The ski patrol
          opens fire from upslope.  Rounds whacking against the disabled
          helicopter.

          Harry looks down the slope and gets an idea.  He jerks the
          unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage, rocking it.
          It slips over the edge.  He leaps inside as it topples forward
          and slides down the slope.


     30   INT./ EXT. HELICOPTER - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

          Harry adds throttle and works the footpedals, using the tail-
          rotor to steer.  The chopper had snow-skids, and Harry is
          skiing the damn thing down the mountain.

          The copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its        *
          skids.  Bullets are hitting the fuselage, and everything around
          it.  Skiers are wiping out, hitting trees.  A snowmobile hits
          a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine.

                              GIB (OVER)
                    Harry!  Where are you!

                              HARRY
                    In the helicopter.


     31   INT./ EXT. VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

          Gib slides the van around a curve.

                              GIB
                         (deadpan, to Faisil)
                    He's in the helicopter.

          Big is scanning above for the chopper.  Then upslope he sees
          the burning fuselage skiing expertly among the trees.

          The chopper hits a jump and launches into the air-- It crashes
          through trees, still soaring and-- Gib looks up, screaming as--
          The chopper drops right toward him-- He hits the brakes and--
          BLAMMO!  It drops onto the road ten feet in front of the
          skidding van...  then slides over the edge and tumbles into a
          rocky canyon where is BLOWS UP!  The fireball lights up the
          night.

          Gib and Faisil jump out of the van.  They look downslope at the
          burning wreckage.

                              GIB
                    Harry?  HARRY?!

                              HARRY
                    What?

          Gib and Faisil spin to look behind them.  Harry is lodged in
          tree-branches hanging over the road.  Gib hands his MP-5K        *
          machine gun to Faisil and reaches up to Harry, who grabs his     *
          hand and pulls.  Harry tumbles down into the snowbank.  He
          stands, brushing snow off his tux, and clomps toward the van in
          his ski-boots.  He is completely unruffled.

                              HARRY
                    Let's go.  We can still make our
                    flight.

          As Faisil is getting into the van behind Harry, TWO GUARD TEAMS
          ON SNOWMOBILES roar around the bend behind them, fish-tailing
          on the ice.  Faisil OPENS FIRE.  One snowmobile swerves over
          the embankment.  The other pulls up broadside, and the guards
          duck behind it.  Gib floors it and the van roars down the
          mountain.  Faisil is still Ramboing on full-auto.

                              FAISIL
                    This is GREAT!!  I never get to
                    shoot!

                                                      CUT TO:


     32   EXT. DULLES AIRPORT - NIGHT

          An American Airlines 747 touches down amid puffs of tire smoke.


     33   EXT. SUBURBAN D.C. STREET - NIGHT

          A NON-DESCRIPT SEDAN pulls to the curb in a neighborhood of
          modest middle-income tract homes.  The street is deserted.  It
          is 4 A.M.  Gib is at the wheel, dropping Harry off at his
          house.


     34   INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

          Harry is emptying his pockets... passport, business cards etc.
          All documents under his name "Renquist".  He double checks that
          his pants and jacket pockets and empty.  Gib fastidiously puts
          the items into a plastic zip-lock.

                              HARRY
                    Empty.  Go.

          Gib starts handing him items from a briefcase.  This should all
          feel like a tired ceremony between them.

                              GIB
                    Harry Tasker wallet.  Harry
                    Tasker passport.  Plane ticket
                    stub, hotel receipt, Tasker.  Two
                    postcards of Lake Geneva.  House
                    keys.  Souvenir snowing Swiss
                    village.

          Gib snows him how is snows when you shake it up and turn it
          over.

                              HARRY
                    What's this for?

                              GIB
                    For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your
                    kid something.  You know.  The
                    dad thing.

                              HARRY
                    Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick
                    me up at eight.  The de-brief is
                    at ten hundred.

          Harry opens the car door.

                              GIB
                    Hey, hey, hey... what are we
                    forgetting?

          Gib holds up Harry's gold wedding band.  Harry puts it on.

                              HARRY
                    What a team.  See you at eight.

                              GIB
                    Yep.  Sleep fast.


     35   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Harry slips inside.  He sets down his suitcase and walks
          quietly down the hall.  He pauses at a door with lurid labels
          and stickers plastered all over it (Toxic Waste,  STAY OUT!, IF
          IT'S TOO LOUD YOU'RE TOO OLD, etc.)

          Harry silently opens the door and looks in at his sleeping
          daughter, DANA.  She looks like an angel in the moonlight
          coming in the window.  In fact, she is a typical 14 year old
          girl, and therefore hardly an angel.  But to Harry she is
          unflawed.


     36   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Harry, undressed now, slips into bed next to... a lump in the
          covers which we presume to be a human being.  This is HELEN
          TASKER, Harry's wife of 15 years.  He kisses her on the cheek
          and she stirs.  She rolls toward him, giving him a sleepy hug
          and a kiss.

                              HELEN
                         (a drowsy murmur)
                    Hi, honey.  How was the flight?

                              HARRY
                    Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.

                              HELEN
                    Okay.

          As she drifts off, Harry puts his head on the pillow and stares
          at the ceiling.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


     37   INT. TASKER HOUSE - DAY (MORNING)

          TIGHT ON SWISS VILLAGE.  It is snowing.

          ON DANA,  reaching to the present Harry just gave her.

                              DANA
                    Hey, thanks dad.  I never had one
                    of these.

          They are in her room, which is your basic room from Hell.
          Pearl Jam posters, and an unbelievable clutter of junk,
          magazines and cheap jewelry.  Harry kisses her on the cheek, to
          which she submits dutifully.  He looks at his watch and heads
          for the door.

                              HARRY
                    You better hurry.  You're going
                    to be late for school.

          Harry hurries out and Dana considers the Swiss village a
          moment.

                              DANA
                    Really lame.

          She plonks is straight in the wastebasket.


     38   INT. HALLWAY/BEDROOM/ BATHROOM - DAY

          Harry strides down the hall, avoiding their small but            *
          incredibly ugly dog, GIZMO, who skitters past him going the      *
          other way.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, don't forget to feed Gizmo!                      *

          Harry crosses the bedroom, hurrying past Helen who is clearly
          rushing to get ready herself.  We get our first good look at
          Helen.  She is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an
          outfit.  Her hair is wrapped in a towel.  To call her plain
          would be inaccurate.  She could be attractive if she put any
          effort into it, which doesn't occur to her.

                              HARRY
                    I'm late.

                              HELEN
                    Me too.

          They talk without looking at each other, the way people who
          have been together a long time do.

                              HELEN
                    How'd it go at the trade show?
                    You make all the other salesmen
                    jealous?

                              HARRY
                    Yeah.  You should have seen it.
                    We were the hit of the show with
                    the new model ordering system,
                    the one for the 680... how you
                    can write up an order and the
                    second the customer's name goes
                    into the computer, it starts
                    checking their credit, and if
                    they've ordered anything in the
                    past, and if they get a
                    discount...

          She is already tuning him out.  And it hits us:  SHE HAS NO
          IDEA WHAT HARRY REALLY DOES.

                              HELEN
                         (barely listening)
                    That's fabulous Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Yeah, it was wild.

          Harry glances at her, oblivious to him and brushing her teeth.
          He smiles.  The best lies are told with enthusiasm.


     39   INT. FRONT HALLWAY, LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Gib opens the door, knocks a bit, then strolls in like he lives
          there.  He is wearing dark Ray Bans, like he's doing a Roy
          Orbison impression.  Gizmo runs toward him, yapping, but Gib
          gives him the evil eye.

                              GIB
                    Come any closer I'll kill you.

          The dog backs up, whining plaintively.  Gib throws his jacket
          over the back of the couch and then, inexplicably, he takes out
          a pack of CAMELS and sets it on the mantelpiece.  He adjusts
          its position carefully.  Hmmmm.


     40   INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          Harry  and Helen maneuver around each other expertly.  She is
          doing her make-up.

                              HELEN
                    The plumber came yesterday.  He
                    said they have to dig under the
                    slab or something and it's going
                    to be six hundred dollars to fix.

          Harry is not really paying attention as he ties his tie in
          front of the mirror.  His mind is elsewhere.  He couldn't care
          less about there domestic problems.

                              HARRY
                    Uh huh.  Okay.

                              HELEN
                    It's not okay.  It's extortion.

                              HARRY
                    What did you tell him?

                              HELEN
                    I slept with him and he knocked
                    off a hundred bucks.

                              HARRY
                    Good thinking, honey.

          Harry kisses her on the cheek and exits.


     41   INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Gib enters and pours two cups of coffee.  Dana is drinking
          orange juice from the bottle at the fridge.

                              GIB
                    Hi, kid.

                              DANA
                    Hey, Gib.  What up?

          She EXITS, eating an uncooked pop-tart.  Harry comes in a
          second later and Gib hands him his coffee.

                              HARRY
                    Thanks dear.

                              GIB
                    Here, check these out.

          Gib hands Harry the glasses.  Harry studies them, seeing the
          VIRTUAL VIDEO DISPLAY inside the left lens of the Ray Bans.
          Harry glances down the hall, making sure no-one is looking,
          then he puts them on.

          HARRY'S POV - INSIDE THE GLASSES - A black and white video
          image of his own living room.

                              GIB
                    The CCD camera and transmitter
                    and inside a pack of smokes.
                    Slick little unit, huh?

          IN POV we see Dana enter the living room.  She looks around
          carefuly, then quickly lifts Gib's jacket and slips out his
          wallet.  She palms two twenties in the blink of an eye and puts
          the wallet back.  Pro moves.

                              HARRY
                    Son of a bitch!

                              GIB
                    What?

          Harry whips off the glasses and charges out of the kitchen.
          Gib goes after him.


     42   EXT. HOUSE - DAY

          Dana comes out the front door, letting it slam behind her, and
          runs to her boyfriend, TRENT, who is waiting for her in the
          driveway on his idling YAMAHA.  Trent is 16, dressed in grunge-
          rock style, trying to look tough.  Harry comes out the front
          door as Trent revs the motor.

                              HARRY
                    Dana!!

          She waves from the back of the bike as Trent pops the clutch
          and they shoot down the driveway.

                              DANA
                         (yelling over the
                          engine)
                    Can't stop, I'm late.  Bye, Dad!


     43   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR/ STREETS OF WASHINGTON - DAY

          They are driving through D.C.  Harry is still shocked by his     *
          daughter's behavior.

                              GIB
                    Kids.  Ten seconds of joy.
                    Thirty years of misery.

                              HARRY
                    She knows not to steal.  I've
                    taught her better than that.

                              GIB
                    Yeah, but you're not her parents,
                    anymore, you and Helen.  Her
                    parents are Axl Rose and Madonna.
                    The five minutes you spend a day
                    with her can't compete with that
                    kind of constant bombardment.
                    You're outgunned, amigo.

          Gib and Harry turn onto Pennsylvania Avenue, heading toward
          Lafayette Square.  Capital Hill is behind them.


     44   INT. TEKTEL OFFICES - DAY                                        *

          Harry and Gib come out of an elevator on the 12th floor.         *
          Behind the receptionist is a burnished metal sign which reads    *
          TEKTEL SYSTEMS.  They cross a open floor of cubicle spaces.      *
          There is the hum of activity everywhere.  A normal day at a      *
          normal business.                                                 *

                              SECRETARY                                    *
                    Morning, Mr. Tasker.                                   *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    Morning, Charlene.

                              GIB
                    See, kids now are ten years ahead                      *
                    of where we were at the same age.
                    You probably think she's still a
                    virgin--

                              HARRY
                    Don't be ridiculous.  She's only --
                    how old is she?

                              GIB
                    Fourteen, Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Right.  She's only fourteen.

          They go into a corridor.                                         *

                              GIB
                    Uh huh.  And her little hormones
                    are going like a fire alarm.  I                        *
                    say even money that physicist on                       *
                    the bike is boinkin' her.                              *

                              HARRY
                    No way.  Not Dana.

          They stop at a door, like any other along the corridor.  It is   *
          blank.                                                           *

                              GIB
                    Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just
                    a river in Egypt.  She's probably
                    stealing the money to pay for an
                    abortion.

                              HARRY
                    Will you just open the door!                           *

          Gib touches a plastic card to an unmarked spot just above the    *
          doorknob.  There is the CLUNK of a SOLENOID LOCK.                *

                              GIB
                    Or drugs.


     45   OMITTED                                                          *


     46   INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

          They enter a long corridor, which is featureless except for      *
          video surveillance cameras.  They walk along the silence for a   *
          moment, then .  .  .                                             *

                              GIB
                    Twenty here, fifty there... I
                    figured my wife's boyfriend was
                    taking it.

                              HARRY
                    I thought you moved out.

                              GIB
                    Well .  .  .  I moved back in.
                    My lawyer said it would give me
                    a better claim on the house in
                    the property settlement.  Don't
                    change the subject... you owe me
                    two hundred bucks.

          They approach another door, with a (bulletproof) glass window    *
          in it.  Beyond is a brightly lit room, with a woman sitting at
          a desk... and nothing else.  Gib presses a buzzer.


     47   INT. OUTER SECURITY ROOM - DAY

          JANICE sits at the non-descript desk like a receptionist... but
          she is a highly trained security specialist.  She is also hefty
          through the shoulders, aggressively unattractive and utterly
          humorless.  She watches them on a monitor screen as they stand
          outside the door.  Harry and Gib appear as living X-Ray images.
          Their weapons are visible in their shoulder harnesses.  Janice
          puts one hand automatically on the butt of a .45 tucked in a
          holster riveted beneath her desk.  She buzzes Harry and Gib in
          with the other.

                              JANICE
                    Gentlemen, please idenitify
                    yourselves to the scanner.

          Harry and Gib step up to the combination retinal-thumbprint-
          voice scanners.  Harry presses his thumb against a black-glass
          plate for laser scan, and looks into the eye-piece of the
          retinal scanner.

                              HARRY
                    Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two
                    four.

                              GIB
                    Albert Gibson.  Three four nine
                    nine one.

          Their clearance appears on a monitor on Janice's desk.

                              JANICE
                    Thank you.  You are cleared.

          She stands to give them plastic I.D.  badges which they hang
          around their necks.

                              GIB
                    Janice, how many years have you
                    been buzzing us in?

                              JANICE
                    Ten, Mr. Gibson.

                              GIB
                    And you still reach for your
                    piece every time.

                              JANICE
                    Yes sir.

                              GIB
                    God!  You have no idea how much
                    that turns me on.  I've never had
                    the courage to say this before
                    but... I love you, Janice.

                              JANICE
                    Yes, sir.

          He kisses her wetly on the cheek as he goes by.  She does not
          react is any discernible way.

          They pass through a heavy stainless steel door which opens
          automatically.  Beyond is a kind of airlock... a SALLY PORT.
          Behind a lexan shield are TWO GUARDS armed with MP5s.  They nod
          but do not speak at Harry and Gib pass them.

                              HARRY
                    You better watch it.  She might
                    file on you for sexual
                    harassment.

                              GIB
                    In her dreams.


     48   INT. OMEGA SECTOR INNER SANCTUM - DAY

          Gib and Harry pass through the inner door of the sally port
          into a large austere atrium.

          ANGLE FROM ABOVE as they cross.  A huge graphic logo covers the
          floor.  Across the center is says OMEGA SECTOR.  In smaller
          print, around the perimeter, is the motto: "THE LAST LINE OF
          DEFENSE".

          They enter a high-tech office space.  It is a maze of glass
          partitions surrounding a central floor-space of cubicles.
          There is a hushed quality here.  People do not joke.  They do
          not hurry.  There are a lot of computer screens displaying
          information from around the world.  It looks like a combination
          of NASA mission control and FBI headquarters.

          Fast Faisil greets them, yawning, as they pass his partitioned
          cubicle.

                              HARRY
                    Come on, Fize.  We're late for
                    our butt-grinding.

          Faisil gulps his coffee and hurries after them.


     49   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          A dark and severe conference room, with large-screen computer
          displays at one end.  Glowering at one end of the long,
          polished table, is SPENCER TRILBY, the chief of Omega Sector.
          Visualize a cross between Colin Powel and J.  Edgar Hoover.

                              TRILBY
                    Jesus, Harry!  You guys really
                    screwed the pooch last night.
                    Please tell me how I can look at
                    this, that it's not a total pooch-
                    screw.

                              HARRY
                    Total is a strong word--

                              GIB
                    There are degrees of totality.

                              FAISIL
                    It's a scale really, with
                    "perfect mission" on one end and
                    "total pooch-screw" on the other
                    and we're more about here--

                              TRILBY
                    Faisil.  You're new on Harry's
                    team, aren't you?

                              FAISIL
                    Yes.

                              TRILBY
                    So what makes you think that the
                    slack I cut him in any way
                    translates to you?!

                              FAISIL
                    Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we
                    got.

          He hits a button and a photo of Khaled fills a wall-screen.

                              FAISIL
                    Jamal Khaled.  We think he's
                    dirty so we raid his financial
                    files...  Check it out...

          Faisil hits some buttons and a second screen lights up with the
          data for their raid.

                              FAISIL
                    One hundred million in wire
                    transfers from the COMMERCE BANK                       *

                              GIB

                    And we know that a week ago four                       *
                    MIRV warheads were smuggled out                        *

                    So far this is not blowing my
                    skirt up, gentleman.  Do you have                      *
                    anything remotely substantial?                         *

                    It's pretty limp, actually.                            *

     50   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          It is the interior of a huge law office.  Helen works there as
          a paralegal.  She is going to the break room for coffee with
          her friend, ALLISON, a secretary.  Allison is black, younger
          then Helen, and still single.

                              HELEN
                    I mean, it's not like he's saving
                    the world or anything.  He's a
                    sales rep for Chrissakes.
                    Whenever I can't get to sleep I
                    ask him to tell me about his day.
                    Six seconds and I'm out.  But he
                    acts like he's curing cancer or
                    something.

                              ALLISON
                    So I guess you didn't get away                         *
                    for the weekend after all?                             *

                              HELEN
                    Are you kidding?  Harry had to go
                    out of town.

                              ALLISON
                    I'm shocked.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah.  You know Harry.

          Helen's nerdy boss BRAD, comes up behind her, scowling.

                              BRAD
                    Helen, have you pulled those
                    files yet?  I need them by lunch.

                              HELEN
                    I won't let you down, Brad.

          Brad leaves.

                              HELEN                                        *
                         (under her breath)                                *
                    You little pencil-neck.                                *
                         (to Allison)                                      *
                    So... yo... sista!  D'you do                           *
                    anything interesting?

                              ALLISON                                      *
                    Oh... Eric and I drove up to this                      *
                    little romantic inn, and...                            *
                    pretty much lapped champagne out
                    of each other's navels for two
                    days.

                              HELEN
                    You bitch.

                              ALLISON
                    Girlfriend, you got a man.  You                        *
                    just have to take control .  .
                    .  set up the right mood.                              *

                              HELEN
                    Harry only has two moods: busy...                      *
                    and asleep.

                              ALLISON
                    Then you better do something to                        *
                    jumpstart that man's motor.  You
                    know... wake up the sleeping
                    giant of his passion.

          They both crack up at that one.


     51   INT. OMEGA SECTOR (DATA CENTER) - DAY                            *

          Harry meets up with Gib and Faisil coming from the ANALYSIS      *
          Department.                                                      *

                              HARRY
                    What'ya got?

          The following will play as they wind their way through the rows  *
          of data-analysis workstations.

                              FAISIL
                         (handing Harry a
                          printout)
                    Here, check this out--

                              GIB
                    It's a two million dollar
                    disbursement from Khaled to...
                    Juno Skinner.
                         (Harry raises an
                          eyebrow)
                    Uh huh.  The babe at the party.                        *

                              HARRY
                    It doesn't mean anything.  She
                    buys antiquities for Khaled.

                              GIB
                    Nope.  The art buys are in a
                    separate ledger.

                              FAISIL
                    And this is a little above market-                     *
                    rate for the horizontal bop, even                      *
                    for a total biscuit like her.

                              HARRY
                    Alright, I want a complete workup
                    on her.  Do we know where she is?

                              FAISIL
                    Uh huh.  Right here in river
                    city.

                              HARRY
                    You're kidding.

                              FAISIL
                    She lives in Rome, but she does
                    stuff here the Smithsonian and
                    has a lot of diplomatic
                    connections, so she has offices                        *
                    here.                                                  *

          Gib starts tangoing with an imaginary partner.

                              GIB
                    Sounds like a job for a
                    specialist.


     52   INT. TASKER HOUSE/ KITCHEN - NIGHT (10PM)

          DING!  Harry opens the microwave as his dinner finishes re-
          heating.  He sits down alone at the kitchen table and pulls the
          Saran-wrap off the plate.  Another solo supper two hours late.
          His motions are so automatic we gather that this is the rule,
          not the exception.  Helen comes in from the living room,
          holding the suspense novel she is reading.

                              HELEN
                    I need you to talk to Dana.  The
                    vice principle called and she cut
                    class again this afternoon.

                              HARRY
                    I'll handle it.

          Harry picks up his porkchop and goes out the back door.


     53   EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

          A basketball hoop is bolted to the garage and Dana is shooting
          baskets in the driveway.  Moths orbit the outside floodlights.
          She sinks one, dribbled back to the foul line.  Harry comes up
          behind her and lifts the ball out of her hands as she stands
          poised to shoot.  She turns.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why
                    weren't you in class today?

                              DANA
                    He lies!  I was there!  I was in
                    the nurse's office, cause I had
                    a headache.

                              HARRY
                    You seem fine now.

                              DANA
                    Great!  You're going to believe
                    that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over
                    your own daughter.

                              HARRY
                    I'm not sure what to believe
                    anymore, young lady.  You never
                    used to lie to me.  But lately
                    you don't seem to know the
                    difference between right and
                    wrong.

          Dana studies something really fascinating at the end of a
          fingernail.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, are you listening to me?

                              DANA
                    Yeah, Dad.

                              HARRY
                    You know you can always talk to
                    me.  Right?  Whatever is going on
                    in your life, your mom and I'll
                    understand.

                              DANA
                    Okay, Dad.

                              HARRY
                    You'd tell me if there was
                    something wrong, wouldn't you,
                    pumpkin?

                              DANA
                    I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do
                    I look even remotely like a
                    pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a
                    cupcake or a honeybear either!
                    And you don't understand anything
                    Dad...

          Dana runs into the house, agent.  Hold on Harry, superagent,     *
          unable to comprehend the mind of a 14-year-old.  He looks up to  *
          see Helen at the backdoor.                                       *

                              HELEN                                        *
                         (macho voice)
                    "I'll handle it".

     55   INT. / EXT. LIMO - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

          A BLACK LIMO cruises through a morning fill of bright promise.

          INSIDE, Gib is at the wheel in a chauffeur's uniform.  He talks
          to Harry, riding in the back, without turning.

                              GIB
                    It's all set up...  ghost phones
                    and fax, all the usual stuff.
                    You have a suite at the Marquis
                    Hotel under Renquist.  Okay,
                    reality check.  Go.

                              HARRY
                    Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--


     56   INT. JUNO'S OFFICES - DAY

                              HARRY
                    --corporate art consulting
                    company in San Francisco.  I have
                    an appointment with Ms. Skinner--

          Harry is extending his business card to the receptionist as
          Juno breezes into the lobby from a corridor.  She is dressed
          sharply and looks as stunning as Harry remembers.

                              JUNO
                    Harry!  I thought I might see you
                    again.  I just didn't  except you
                    to call so soon.

          Juno lingers a second or so long on the handshake.

                              HARRY
                    Well, what's the point of
                    waiting?

                              JUNO
                    I agree.

          There is definitely unholy magnetism here.  She indicates for
          Harry to walk with her and leads him through the suite of
          offices.  There are mounted fragments of ancient sculpture in
          niches on either side, and beautifully restored mosaics and
          tablets of hieroglyphics mounted on the walls.

                              JUNO
                    So your clients want something
                    for the lobby of their new
                    corporate headquarters?

                              HARRY
                    That's right.  They want
                    something...  dramatic.  I spoke
                    to a number of people who said
                    you're the one to see.

          Juno leads Harry through a door into a large warehouse area.
          There is a bustle of activity as workmen unpack crates.  An
          overhead crane is used to move huge stone pieces.  There are
          massive columns, and statues two stories high.  Even the entire
          facade of a tomb.

                              JUNO
                    So what did these... people...
                    say about me exactly?

          They stroll amongst the statues, as coveralled workmen move
          around them with tools, scaffolding, pneumatic equipment.  Most
          of the workers are middle-eastern.

                              HARRY
                    Let's see... that you can read
                    ancient Sanskrit without having
                    to sound out the words.  And that
                    other dealers and archeologists
                    don't like you much.

                              JUNO
                    Those wimps.  It's because I use                       *
                    my diplomatic contacts to export
                    cultural treasures from countries
                    which tell them to take a hike.
                         (yelling in Arabic to
                          two workmen)
                    I told you to move those crates
                    an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's
                    get going.

          We realize that A WORKMAN is watching them intently from
          nearby.  He is an intense looking MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN in his mid-
          thirties.

                              JUNO
                    You see, a lot of these pieces
                    are from ancient Persia.
                    Unfortunately, ancient Persia is
                    twenty feet under the sand of                          *
                    Iran, Iraq and Syria.  Not the
                    most popular places lately.  So
                    I've had to become an expert in
                    international diplomacy.

          Juno stops and looks at Harry.  Her smile indicates the
          possibility of more than just business.

                              JUNO
                    Well, do you see anything you
                    like, Mr. Renquist?

                                                      CUT TO:


     57   INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

          Harry, Gib and Fast Faisil are in a luxury suite at the MARQUIS
          HOTEL.  It is a corner suite, with a spectacular view of the
          city.  Faisil is routinely sweeping the room for bugs with an
          electronic DETECTOR.

                              HARRY
                    She's importing stuff from all
                    over the mid-east.

                              GIB
                    She could be moving money, guns.
                    Anything.

                              FAISIL
                    And the second you left there, we
                    started getting calls to the                           *
                    ghost numbers.  They were
                    checking out the Renquist front.

                              HARRY
                    Okay.  Let's step up the
                    surveillance on her.  Put on two
                    more guys.


     58   INT. JUNO'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

          WE FOLLOW the WORKMAN we saw watching Harry earlier.  He
          catches up with Juno, who is going through the doors to the
          office area.  His name is MALIK.

                              MALIK
                    Ms. Skinner?  Can I speak to you
                    for a moment please, in your
                    office?

          His manner is self-effacing.  Humble.  He doesn't meet her
          gaze.  She nods and they go into the private office.


     59   INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY

          MALIK comes in behind her and closes the door.  The moment they
          are away from public observation, his manner changes.  His
          humble posture straightens and his eyes flash intensely as he
          approaches her.  Without warning he SLAPS HER HARD ACROSS THE
          FACE.

                              MALIK
                    You stupid undisciplined bitch!

          Her jaw clenches but her reaction is surprisingly submissive.

                              JUNO
                    It's a good thing you pay me
                    well.

                              MALIK
                    Do you realize that there are
                    surveillance teams watching this
                    place right now?  Your phones are
                    almost certainly tapped.  And you
                    are busy laughing and flirting
                    like a whore with this Renquist,
                    who may be a--

                              JUNO
                    No.  He checked out okay--

          Malik slaps her again.

                              MALIK
                    That is for interrupting.
                         (He backhands her)
                    And that is for being wrong.  We
                    do not tolerate mistakes.

          Juno bites her lip.

                              JUNO
                    What do you want me to do?

                              MALIK
                    Find out who this Renquist it.

                              JUNO
                    How?

                              MALIK
                    Use the gifts that Allah has
                    given you.


     60   INT. TEKTEL SYSTEMS OFFICES - DUSK                               *

          The phone rings on the desk of CHARLENE, Harry's secretary at    *
          Tektel Systems, the permanent front-company for Omega Sector.    *

                              SECRETARY
                    Hello, Tektel Systems.  Mr.                            *
                    Tasker's office.


     61   INT. TASKER HOUSE - DUSK

          Helen is in the kitchen, showing Dana how to put icing on a
          large birthday cake.

                              HELEN
                    Hi, Charlene?  It's Helen.  Is he
                    there?


     62   INT. TEKTEL OFFICES - DUSK

          Charlene doesn't hesitate a microsecond.

                              CHARLENE
                    Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs.
                    Tasker.  Let me try him in there.
                    Hold please.

          She punches a key, engaging a digital scrambler and connecting
          to--


     63   INT. SUITE AT THE MARQUIS - DUSK

          A PHONE RINGS.  Gib opens his briefcase and looks at the
          console of the cellular scrambler-phone inside.  The display
          reads TEKTEL/CALLER ID POS -- TASKER, HELEN.                     *

                              GIB
                    It's Helen.                                            *

          Harry picks up the phone.  INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING WITH HELEN.

                              HARRY
                    Hi honey.  What's going on?                            *

                              HELEN
                    Sorry to bother you in a meeting,
                    but you have to promise me that                        *
                    you'll be home at eight.  I don't                      *
                    want Dana and I sitting here by
                    ourselves like we were last year.
                    You promise?

                              HARRY
                         (laughing)
                    Baby, I said I'd be there.
                    Really.  Trust me.
                         (the room phone RINGS)
                    Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.

          RING.  Harry raises an eyebrow as he answers.

                              HARRY
                    Hello?  Oh, Juno, hi.
                         (pause)
                    Well sure.  I can be there in
                    twenty minutes.

          Harry hangs up.  Gib, checking his watch, has a look like he's
          got a bad gas pain.

                              HARRY
                    What?  It's on the way.  She says
                    she's got something for me.

                              GIB
                    Yeah, right.


     64   INT. JUNO'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

          A WORKMAN guides Harry through the maze of statuary.  He points
          toward the back of the warehouse and then leaves.  Harry is
          left alone in the vast space.

          Only a few lights are on, rendering the place somewhat Gothic.
          Harry strolls in the direction the workman pointed.  Ahead of
          him, is the huge facade of a royal tomb.  There is a flickering
          light inside.  A shadow moves across the wall in the entryway.

                              HARRY
                    Hello?

          He enters the stone doorway of the tomb.  FOLLOWING HARRY as he
          steps into the inner chamber.  There is an oil-lamp burning on
          a stone sarcophagus, the only light.  The room appears empty.

          REVERSE ON HARRY.  Behind him a figure emerges from a shadowed
          alcove.  It is Juno.  She looks ethereal in the strange light.

                              JUNO
                    Hello, Harry.

          Harry whips around, startled.

                              JUNO
                    Do you like my tomb?  The museum                       *
                    financing fell out, so I thought                       *
                    your clients might be interested.

                              HARRY
                    It's certainly... dramatic.

                              JUNO
                    Especially in this light.  This
                    is the only light they had then,                       *
                    so I like to study it this way.
                    I love this place.  I love all
                    ruins.

                              HARRY
                    Is that why you got into this
                    business?

          Juno turns to him in the flickering half-light.  She moves
          closer.  Her eyes seem to glitter.

                              JUNO
                    I've always been a collector at
                    heart.  When I see something I
                    want, I have to have it.

                              HARRY
                    And you have a reputation as
                    someone who gets what she wants.

          She is very close to him.  Her eyes seem to glitter in the
          light from the oil lamp.  She is unbelievably beautiful.

                              JUNO
                    Yes, I do.


     65   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib is sitting in the car, in the shadows, up the street...
          with his earphone in place.  Listening.

                              GIB
                    Harry, this is your conscience
                    speaking...


     66   INT. TOMB - NIGHT

          Juno picks up the lamp and walks along the wall, holding it up
          so that the flickering shadows seem to bring the bas-relief
          figures to life.  Stone faces shift and change, stone eyes
          move.

                              JUNO
                    Look at this.  People who dies
                    twenty centuries ago.

          Juno presses her cheek against the cold stone.  She runs her
          fingers slowly across the figures.  It is strange and erotic.

                              JUNO
                    They breathed and loved and wept,
                    just like us.  And now their
                    ideals, their religions, their
                    social orders... are gone like
                    mist.  What did any of it matter?

          She crosses to Harry.

                              JUNO
                    I only hope they lived well.
                    That they got what they wanted.

          She puts her hands on him and pulls herself close.  It is a
          hypnotic moment.

                              JUNO
                    Getting what you want is the only
                    important thing.

          She kisses him, very lightly, with infinite sensuality.


     67   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

                              GIB
                    Harry?  Listen to the following
                    code word.  Helen.  H-E-L-E-N.
                    Now, do you want me to I beep
                    you?


     68   INT. TOMB - NIGHT

          Harry breaks the kiss... slowly pulling back.

                              HARRY
                    Yes.

                              JUNO
                    Yes what?

                              HARRY
                    Uh, yes, it is important.

          Juno is moving in for a more passionate lip-lock when-- BEEP
          BEEP BEEP!!  Harry pulls his beeper off his hip and looks at
          it.  The moment is spoiled.

                              HARRY
                    Uh, it looks like I have to run.
                    I'll call you tomorrow.  Your
                    proposal is very interesting.


     69   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib lets out a big exhale of relief.  He looks at his watch.


     70   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Helen and Dana are sitting expectantly at the dining room
          table.  There is a big cake, and presents piled on the buffet.
          The food is getting cold.  Helen looks at her watch.

                              DANA
                    See.


     71   INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Harry is changing clothes, getting ready to be Harry Tasker      *
          again, as Gib drives through evening traffic.  Gib keeps
          checking the rearview.

                              GIB
                    We have a friend.  Five cars
                    back, inside lane.  They've been                       *
                    on us since we left Juno's.                            *

          Harry adjusts the passenger side mirror.

                              HARRY
                    Station wagon?

                              GIB
                    Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?

                    Copy that.  We're rolling.

                              GIB
                    Helen's going to be pissed.

                              HARRY
                    See, that's the problem with
                    terrorists.  They're really
                    inconsiderate when it comes to
                    people's schedules.


     72   INT.  STATION WAGON - NIGHT

          There are three men in the car.  YUSIF and MAHMOUD are in the
          front, with Mahmoud driving.  In the back, shadowed, we can
          just make out ABU MALIK.  Yusif is massively built, with a body
          like a beer-keg.  Mahmoud is skinny and intense.

     74   INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR - MALL - NIGHT

          Harry puts his SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER into his ear canal.

                              HARRY
                    Test two three.
                         (Gib nods, receiving)
                    Pull over here.

          Gib pulls the car to the curb near the mall entrance.  Half a
          block behind them the station wagon does the same.  Harry slips
          on the virtual-image sunglasses and gets out of the car.


     75   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          Harry pauses on the sidewalk a moment to light a cigarette.  He
          coughs slightly.

                              GIB
                         (in his ear)
                    You don't smoke, dickhead.

          Harry lets his hand drop to his side, holding the pack of
          cigarettes casually.  He turns his hand.  The tiny lens in the
          cigarette pack glints.

          POV VIDEO SCREEN --inside the left lens of the glasses.  The
          camera in the cigarette pack reveals Yusif and Mahmoud getting
          out of their cars, crossing the street half a block away.

          HARRY strolls into the mall.  It is an open promenade design,
          with a moderate crowd of shoppers and movie-goers.  Harry
          watches in the glasses as Mahmoud and Yusif slip through the
          crowd behind him.

                              GIB (VO)
                    What's the plan?

                              HARRY
                         (apparently mumbling to
                          himself)

     76   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib looks in the rearview, studying the car behind him.

                              GIB
                    There's another guy, still in the
                    car.

                              HARRY
                         (on radio)
                    Stay on him.

          All Gib can see is a silhouette in the car.  A soft cherry
          glow, the tip of a cigarette in the dark.  No features.


     77   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          Harry turns off the main concourse, into a narrower walkway
          between shops.  In the video-glasses he watches Yusif and
          Mahmoud, who have split up to look less conspicuous, as they
          track him through the pedestrian traffic.


     78   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib in on the cellular phone.

                              GIB
                    Helen?  Hi, it's Gib.  Harry
                    remembered something he left at
                    the office.  You know Harry.

          As he is talking he sees that a bus has blocked his view of the
          station wagon.


     79   INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          She sighs fatalistically.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah, Gib.  I know Harry.

          Helen hangs up the phone just as Dana strides through the room,
          putting on a jacket and heading for the front door.

                              HELEN
                    Where are you going?

                              DANA
                    Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough
                    about us to be here on his
                    birthday, then why should I care?
                    I'm going to a movie.

                              HELEN
                    No you're not.  You're going to
                    stay here until your father gets
                    home and have cake!

                              DANA
                    Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows
                    we exist.

          We see the hurt in her eyes.  She doesn't hate her father.  She
          just misses him.

                              HELEN
                    That's not true, honey--

                              DANA
                    It is true!  He doesn't know
                    anything about me.  He still
                    thinks I'm like ten years old or
                    something.  As long as I just
                    smile and say yes to whatever he
                    says, like his good little
                    fantasy daughter, he thinks
                    everything's fine.  But it's not
                    fine.  Nothing's fine.

          Dana runs out the kitchen by the other door.  Helen runs
          after her.

                              HELEN
                    Dana!  Come back here!

          The slamming door is her answer.


     80   EXT. MALL - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Yusif sees Harry, up ahead, enter a public restroom.  He
          signals Mahmoud with his eyes and the two of them close in on
          the restroom.


     81   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib hangs up the car-phone.  Ten the bus blocking his view
          finally pulls away and Gib see that the station wagon is
          empty.  No silhouette.

                              GIB
                    Oh shit.
                         (into his headset)
                    Harry, I lost the third guy.
                    Harry?


     82   INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT

          Harry can't answer because Mahmoud just entered the room behind
          him.  Harry is at one of the urinals, apparently taking a leak.
          Mahmoud goes to the mirror.  Starts combing his hair.  He
          doesn't much notice the pack of Camels sitting on the counter
          nearby.  Harry is whistling.  Shaking himself.

          HARRY'S POV - In the video glasses Harry sees himself and
          Mahmoud.  Yusif comes into the restroom, seemingly ignoring
          both Harry and Mahmoud, as if heading for the stalls.  As he
          passes behind Harry he reaches into his coat--

          Harry spins lightning fast.  He knocks away the SILENCED PISTOL
          aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block, capturing
          Yusif's arm in an arm-lock.  The shot goes wide, shattering a
          urinal.

          Harry slams his palm into Yusif's face like a piledriver, and
          spins him against the steel stalls.  The silenced pistol goes
          skittering across the floor.

          Mahmoud whips a pistol out of his waistband.  Still holding the
          bear-like Yusif, Harry draws his Glock so fast we can barely
          see him move.  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  Three .45 slugs  go through
          Mahmoud's chest, shattering the mirror behind him.  He flops on
          his butt, slumping against the wall.

          Yusif, who is easily Harry's size, bellows and grabs his gun
          arm.  They smash against the walls, struggling for the gun.
          Yusif, locked to Harry, hurls him against the stalls.  They hit
          a locked door, which pops open, banging inward.

          Yusif drives Harry to the floor.  Harry's head is between the
          shoes of an OLD GUY sitting on the can, who looks down
          uncomprehendingly at him.

          Yusif slams Harry's gun hand repeatedly against the doorframe
          of the stall.  He twists Harry's wrist brutally.  He even
          pounds against Harry's hand with his knee.  The old guy winces.
          That's got to hurt.  Harry cries out in pain and the gun drops.
          Yusif reaches for it, but Harry kicks it under the stalls.

          He punches Yusif in the face, driving him back.  They grapple,
          spinning.  Harry drives Yusif's head into the counter.  Then he
          elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the filthy
          floor.  Harry grabs Yusif's hair and pounds his face repeatedly
          against the rim of a urinal.  In case you haven't noticed, this
          is a messy, nasty fight.  Survival is like that.

          Yusif sags into submission.  Harry pulls a nylon zip-strip out
          of his pocket and uses it like hand-cuffs, securing Yusif's
          wrists.


     83   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          Gib is running full out, drawing his gun.  He has one finger
          jammed in his ear.  His gut is doing the rumba as he runs.

                              GIB
                    Harry?  Harry, you copy?!  Shit!


     84   INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT

          Harry is pulling Yusif to his feet when the door bangs open
          behind him.  He turns, thinking it is Gib.  It's not.  Malik
          raises a FULL-AUTO BERETTA 92-F and opens fire.  Harry spins
          Yusif between him and the machine pistol.  Yusif's beer-keg
          body stops the spray of 9mm slugs form hitting Harry long
          enough for him to dive into a stall.

          Malik hoses the room with the Beretta.  The metal stalls are
          riddled with hits.

          HARRY is in the stall with the old guy, who's just sitting
          there.  The walls of the stall are pimpling with the hits on
          the far side.  Harry reaches under the stall, retrieving his
          Glock.

          MALIK goes empty.  Harry hears that and pops out, cranking off
          rounds--

          Malik is a blur going out the door, as Harry's shots shatter
          tiles on the doorframe.  Then silence.

                              HARRY
                         (to the old guy)
                    Sorry.


     85   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          MOVING WITH MALIK, who backs rapidly away from the restroom,
          reloading.

                              GIB (OFF)
                    FREEZE!!!

          Malik spins to see Gib nearby, going into a firing stance
          behind a light-standard.  The terrorist doesn't hesitate.  His
          Beretta ROARS at 900 rounds per minute.

          Gib tries to hide behind the light-standard, which is about
          half as wide as he is.  Shots hit all around him, shattering
          window glass behind him.  His stomach sticks out from behind
          the pole.  He sucks it in. Now his butt is sticking out on the
          other side.  Shots clang into the steel column, and riddle
          everything behind him.

                              GIB
                    WRONG!  THIS IS NOT GOOD!

          Just when it looks like Gib is going to get a 9mm tummy tuck,
          Malik turns and sprints away, through shocked pedestrians.
          Harry runs out of the restroom, trying for a shot, but there
          are too many people in the line of fire and Malik knows it.

                              HARRY
                    Get back to the car!

          Gib nods and heads the other way as Harry takes off after
          Malik.  Malik is fast and vicious.  He hurls people out of the
          way, sending shoppers sprawling.  Harry is ruthless in his
          pursuit.  They pound through the mall and out onto the street--


     86   EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Malik sprints straight into traffic.  A car screeches, not
          stopping in time... Malik goes right over the hood.  Harry
          leaps over the hoods of cars after him.  Malik sees Harry
          coming after him like a juggernaut.

          He turns and sees a MOTORCYCLIST coming down the street,
          accelerating from a right-turn.  Malik runs at him, clothes-
          lining him right off the bike.  The terrorist picks up the
          nimble little Kawasaki 250, which is still running, and leaps
          on.  He pops the clutch and takes off.  Harry pounds after him
          like a locomotive.  He sees Malik turn, taking the bike path
          into a large PARK.  Harry cuts into the park on a diagonal.


     87   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

          ON HARRY, running.  Ahead is a MOUNTED COP.  Harry doesn't
          break stride, heading right for the cop on the horse.  The cop
          turns, surprised, a split second before-- Harry pulls him off
          the horse and slams him to the ground (he's wearing a helmet).

                              HARRY
                    Federal Officer in pursuit of
                    suspect!  Sorry.

          Harry is in the saddle and galloping after Malik before the cop
          can get his gut out of the holster to stop him.

          MALIK roars through the park on the Kawasaki.  He looks back,
          amazed to see Harry charging after him on a horse.  They
          scatter joggers and bicyclists, people walking their dogs.

          TRACKING WITH THEM as they rocket through the park.  Malik
          leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees.
          Harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling.
          Malik fires his Beretta straight back at Harry, emptying it.
          He drops the pistol and crouches over the bike, twisting the
          last bit of throttle out of it.  They are going flat out,
          through the trees, in a kinetic blur.


     88   EXT. STREET - NEAR MALL - NIGHT

          Gib, panting and heaving, pulls his car into traffic.  The Unit
          Seven car pulls out as well, up the block.

                              GIB
                    Harry, what's your twenty?


     89   EXT. PARK/ STREETS - NIGHT

          Harry is legging the police horse hard.  He has his reigns in
          one hand, his Glock in the other.  It's the wild west.

                              HARRY
                    Westbound in the park... suspect
                    is on a motorcycle... he's going
                    to  come out on Franklin.  Hang
                    on--

          Harry leaps a park bench like he's in a steeple chase.

                              HARRY (CONT'D)
                    I want you on 14th in case he
                    turns south.  And I need Seven on
                    the north side to box him in.


     90   INT. /EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib is weaving furiously through traffic.  He slides into a
          turn.

                              GIB
                    Copy that.

                              HARRY
                    And make it fast.  My horse is
                    getting tired.

          ON GIB, mouthing "Your horse?"


     91   EXT. STREET - NEXT TO PARK - NIGHT

          Malik explodes through the bushes and out onto the street.
          Cars skid around him, out of control.  He turns south.  Weaving
          through traffic.  Harry leaps the hedgerow behind Malik and
          gallops among the spun-out cars.  He goes right over the hood
          on one which is blocking his path.  The driver ducks as the
          horse's hoof cracks the windshield.


     92   EXT. STREET/ HYATT REGENCY HOTEL - NIGHT

          Up ahead traffic is stopped, jammed tight at a light.  Malik
          goes into the oncoming traffic lanes, which are empty.  Gib's
          car slides around the corner in a blare of horns and comes
          barrelling down the street toward him.  Gib cranks the wheel
          the slides the car broadside, blocking both lanes.  Malik locks
          up the brakes and the bike slides to a stop.  Then the
          terrorist pops the clutch and wheels the bike around-- Jumping
          the curb and going straight at the entrance of THE HYATT
          REGENCY HOTEL.

          Bellmen and guests scatter as the bike roars right at them.
          The sliding doors and opening for a bellman coming out with
          bags and Malik blasts past him into the lobby.

          HARRY ducks, galloping through the doors after him.


     93   INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

          Acres of marble and red carpet.  Liveries porters.  Guests
          dressed for evening, the men in suits, diamonds on the women.
          And sudden pandemonium as Malik roars through the lobby, with
          Harry charging along behind him.  Malik guns it across the
          lounge, knocking over tables.  He gets air at the top of  the
          steps going up to the RESTAURANT.

          Harry swerves to avoid a panicking guest and finds himself
          careening toward the JAZZ QUARTET at a full gallop.  He gathers
          the animal and LEAPS (in glorious SLOW MOTION) over the
          bassist, who is diving for the carpet.  Harry and horse land
          deftly and then he urges his mount right up the steps after
          Malik.


     94   INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Malik roars between the tables, looking around wildly for a way
          out.  Harry charges in, ducking to avoid the chandelier.
          Waiters, trays, dinners, tables... everything seems to be
          flying at once as people dive out of the way.


     95   INT. HOTEL - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          MALIK skids out into the main hall by another door, and sees--
          the ELEVATORS.  The door is just closing on one of them.  He
          guns it and slides through the doors.

          HARRY RIDES out of the restaurant in time to catch a glimpse of
          Malik as the doors close.


     96   INT. SCENIC ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          Harry canters the horse into the next elevator, which has just
          been boarded by an older couple.  He has to practically lie
          down on the horse to fit through the door.  The animal barely
          fits, nose to tail, in what turns out to be--

          A GLASS ELEVATOR with a view of the whole atrium of the hotel
          as it rises, right to the top of the building.  Harry looks
          through the glass at the elevator car next to him, fifteen feet
          away.  Malik is inside, punching a button.  He glances up and
          sees Harry.  There eyes meet for a moment, just before Malik's
          car ascends rapidly.  Malik's malevolent glare is etched on
          Harry's retinas.

          The older couple is jammed against the side-wall by Harry's
          panting, snorting horse.  It clomps around the tight elevator.
          The woman is trying to crawl between her husband and the wall.

                              HARRY
                    Can you just press the top floor,
                    please.

          The man nods mutely and complies.  Their elevator takes off,
          rising after Malik's.


     97   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

          Gib runs in with Faisil and Keough.  They follow the path of
          destruction, growing more and more amazed.  Gib yells to one of
          the porters.

                              GIB
                    The guy on the horse?!

          The porter points at the elevators.


     98   INT. / EXT. SCENIC ELEVATORS - NIGHT

          Harry has slid off the horse to get next to the control panel.
          He can look up at an angle and see Malik in the car above him.
          His thumb hovers over the emergency stop button.  If Malik gets
          out at any floor, Harry will have a moment to react and stop.
          Malik can look down and see this.  He knows Harry's got him.
          He just keeps going, floor after floor, using the time to
          think.

          The older woman is still just staring, trying not to breathe.
          The horse flicks her in the face with his tail.


     99   INT. /EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT                                       *

          The rooftop has a spectacular view of the city.  TRACKING WITH   *
          Malik as he comes out of the elevator, rides to the far edge of  *
          the roof and slides to a stop.  He looks  down twenty stories.

          THE SECOND ELEVATOR  arrives.  The doors part and Harry comes    *
          out, with his Glock poised and ready.  He sees Malik revving     *
          his bike.  The terrorist brodies the bike into a fast one-
          eighty and speeds back toward the edge of the roof.  Amazingly,
          he increases speed, ROARING RIGHT OFF THE EDGE,  ARCING THE
          BIKE SUICIDALLY OUT INTO SPACE!

          Harry rides to the edge in time to see Malik, on his bike,
          CLEAR A 60 FOOT JUMP and SPLASH INTO THE ROOFTOP POOL of a       *
          LOWER BUILDING next to the hotel!

          Harry is out of control now, seeing the guy setting away.  He
          wheels his mount and charges across the roof to get some
          running space.  Then he turns again, back toward the edge Malik
          jumped from.  He kicks the horse's flanks and yells HAAHH!!
          The horse's hoofs thunder on the roof as they go full tilt
          toward the edge.

          But a horse is not a motorcycle.  It is slightly smarter.  It
          slams its front hoofs down together, stopping suddenly.  Harry
          goes right over its head.  He flies forward, almost going right
          off the roof.  He slams to the edge, with his legs dangling
          over, holding onto a piece of pipe with one hand.  His Glock
          tumbles down into darkness.

          Harry sees Malik far below, climb out of the pool, running to
          the roof door of the other building.  Getting away.  Harry
          clambers up onto his own roof, breathing hard.  He walks over
          to the horse.

                              HARRY
                    What the hell were you thinking?
                    We had the guy and you let him
                    get away.

          He looks into the horse's innocent brown eyes.  Pats its neck
          fondly.

                              HARRY
                    What kind of  cop are you?


    100   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Helen is asleep at the dining room table next to a half-eaten
          cake and some melted ice cream.  His unopened presents are
          piled at one end of the table.  She raises her head as Harry
          enters sheepishly.

                              HARRY
                    Look, I know you're upset.  I'm
                    really sorry, honey.  I raced
                    home as quick--

                              HELEN
                    It's okay, don't bother, Harry.

          He goes to her and puts his arms around her.  He is tender with
          her.  He wishes he can tell her the truth.

                              HARRY
                    I'm sorry.  Thank you for the
                    party.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah.  It was great.

          Helen finds a smile for him somewhere.  She really does love
          him, though more and more often lately she finds her heart in
          pain.

                              HELEN
                    Let's go to bed, Harry.  There's
                    only one present you have to open
                    tonight.

          She grins and arches one eyebrow meaningfully.


    101   INT. BEDROOM / BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Helen walks Harry to the edge of the bed and sits him down.
          She puts her hand on his chest and pushes, causing him to lie
          back.

                              HELEN
                    Don't move.  I'll be right back.

          She turns on the stereo.  A Kenny G disc she put in there
          earlier.  Soft tenor sax flows around the room.  Helen enters
          the BATHROOM and shuts the door partway.  She opens a cupboard
          and quickly pulls out some things she hid there earlier.  A
          bottle of champagne on ice.  Two glasses.  Some trashy
          lingerie.

                              HARRY
                    Come on to bed, you don't have to
                    brush your teeth.

                              HELEN
                    I'll just be a second.  So what
                    happened tonight at the office?

                              HARRY
                    I couldn't believe it.  I go back
                    to get this report I need, right,
                    and the phone is ringing, so like
                    a bonehead I answer it--

          Helen is hurrying to put on the unfamiliar lingerie.  G-string
          panties and low-cut bra.  She holds up the garter belt, turning
          it backward and forward, trying to figure out which way it
          goes.

          ON HARRY, yawning.  Lying with the ease of years of practice.

                              HARRY
                    It's the big client in Japan,
                    and it's the middle of the
                    morning there and their whole
                    system is crashed... this guy's
                    having a meltdown--

                              HELEN
                         (keeping him talking)
                    What'd you do, honey?

                              HARRY
                    Well I pull out the manual on
                    their setup, which is the new 680
                    server...

          Helen is pulling up the black stockings.  She fastens the
          garters to the tops.  Her features are a scowl of
          concentration.  She is very earnest in her preparations.

                              HARRY (CONT'D)
                    ...and I'm troubleshooting it
                    with them over the phone...
                    talking to a translator, right,
                    who's getting half of it wrong...
                    it was unbelievable...  really
                    wild.

                              HELEN
                         (putting on black
                          pumps)
                    It sounds wild.  So now you're a
                    big hero, right?  For fixing
                    their system.

                              HARRY
                         (faintly)
                    Uh huh.

                              HELEN
                    My husband the hero.

          Red lipstick.  Then she puts a little perfume on her wrists.

                              HELEN
                    I'll be right there, honey.  Just
                    a minute.

          Harry doesn't answer.  Helen puts a little perfume down the
          front of her panties.

                              HELEN
                    Just a second.

          Helen quickly pours two glasses of champagne.  Then she slinks
          around the doorframe, making her entrance.  She looks like a
          living 900 number.  Helen stands before the bed, looking down,
          holding the champagne glasses.

          ON HARRY: sprawled on the bed, fully clothed, snoring softly.
          A little bit of drool is coming out the side of his mouth.

          HOLD ON HELEN, all dressed up with no place to go.  She gazes
          down at him, her shoulders slumping.

                              HELEN
                    Happy Birthday, Harry.

          She sighs deeply and downs her champagne in one long gulp.

                                                      CUT TO:


    102   EXT. STREET/ NEAR HIGH-SCHOOL - DAY

          It is the following morning.  Harry and Gib are staked out
          watching the front of Dana's school.  Actually, Harry is staked
          out, scanning the crowds of kids with binoculars.

          Gib just keeps looking at his watch.  He picks up a cellular
          phone and pretends to call the office.

                              GIB
                    Hey, did that guy Harry chased
                    last night call in to give
                    himself up yet?  Cause apparently
                    that's the only way we're going
                    to catch the son of a bitch --

                              HARRY
                         (not listening)
                    Okay.  Here she comes.


    103   EXT. STREET - DAY

          HARRY'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS - We see Dana come out to the
          curb and meet Trent, who pulls up on his bike.  She gets on
          behind him, adjusts her walkman headphones over her ears and he
          launches out into traffic.


    104   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY

          Harry, who is behind the wheel, pulls out after her.  Trent
          weaves radically through the light traffic, going in between
          the cars.

                              HARRY
                    Look at the way the little punk
                    is driving.  He's all over the
                    place.  Look-- he hasn't
                    signalled once.

                              GIB
                    Goddammit!  That's outrageous.

          Harry speeds up.  Somebody honks as he cuts them off to stay
          with Trent.


    105   EXT. MOTORCYCLE - DAY

          ON DANA AND TRENT as she looks back and sees Harry following
          her.  She is mortified that her father is actually tailing her

                              DANA
                    Oh my God!  I think that's my
                    dad!

                              TRENT
                    Hang on!

          Trent downshifts and punches it.  The nimble little bike
          screams as it zips between cars.


    106   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY

                              HARRY
                         (clenching his jaw)
                    So, you wanna play huh?  You
                    little--

                              GIB
                         (rolling his eyes)
                    That's it.  Get 'im Harry
                         (he draws a pistol)
                    We'll teach that little puke not
                    to signal.


    107   EXT. MOTORCYCLE

          BACK ON TRENT, who's actually a really good rider.  He zig-zags
          through the cars, cutting between them at the next light where
          Gib and Harry get blocked.  He cuts a sharp right turn and
          disappears.


    108   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY

          Harry is stuck in stopped traffic.  He pounds the wheel in
          frustration.

                              GIB
                         (exploding with
                          laughter)
                    Ha!  The little prick ditched
                    you!  That is so goddamn funny.

                              HARRY
                    Son of a bitch!

                              GIB
                    Can we go to the office now, Mr.
                    Superspy?

                                                      CUT TO:


    109   INT. OMEGA SECTOR / I.D. ANALYSIS ROOM - DAY

          Harry is sitting at a computer workstation, lit by the monitor
          screen.  Gib and Faisil look on as he clicks through HEADSHOTS
          of known terrorists.  CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.  Harry is very
          focussed.  He stops.  He goes back one.  Studies the face.


    110   INT. ANALYSIS ROOM - TIGHT ON THE SCREEN - DAY

          A defiant looking Syrian with a full beard.

          HARRY holds up his hand, blocking out the beard, concentrating
          on the eyes.

                              HARRY
                    That's him.


    111   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Harry slaps photos down in front of Trilby.

                              HARRY
                    Abu Kaleem Malik.

                              FAISIL                                       *
                    Now he's formed his own splinter
                    faction called CRIMSON JIHAD.

                              GIB                                          *
                    Guess he thought the other
                    terrorist groups were too warm
                    and fuzzy for his taste.

                              FAISIL
                    They call him "The Sand Spider".                       *

                              TRILBY
                    Why?

                              FAISIL
                         (he shrugs)
                    Probably because it sounds scary.                      *

                              TRILBY
                    This is impressive, gentlemen.
                    Of course, it would have been
                    even more impressive if you
                    actually knew where he was.

                              HARRY
                    We'll get him.

                              TRILBY
                    Yes.  You will.
                         (meaning-- you damn
                          well better)
                    Harry, I still want you in
                    charge, even though your cover is
                    blown.  Just keep a low profile.
                         (he slaps a newspaper
                          on the table)
                    I generally prefer it when my
                    covert operations don't make the
                    front page.

          The agents look at the headlines:  WILD WEST CHASE.  Harry and
          Gib wince.


    112   EXT. HELEN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          Harry and Gib pull to the curb in front of the building.

                              GIB
                    What's going on?

          Harry gets out of the car and turns back, leaning in the door
          to talk to Gib.

                              HARRY
                    Look, uh... I've got to talk to
                    Helen about this thing with Dana.
                    I'm just going to run in and see
                    if she can get away for lunch.

                              GIB
                    You want me to just hang-- ?

                              HARRY
                    Just hang a minute.

                              GIB
                    I'll just hang then, shall I?


    113   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          Harry enters the office of Helen's firm.  He stops at
          reception.

                              RECEPTIONIST
                    Hello Mr. Tasker.  Just a second,
                    I'll  buzz Helen.

                              HARRY
                    No.  No, I'd like to surprise
                    her.  Thanks, I know where her
                    desk is.

          He smiles and breezes past her before she has a chance to
          object.


    114   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

          TRACKING WITH HARRY as he moves through the offices.  He passes
          through a library-like maze of records stacks.  Through them he
          can see Helen at her desk.  But as he approaches, still
          concealed, ALLISON puts a call on hold and whips around to
          Helen.

                              ALLISON
                    Helen!
                         (grinning
                          conspiratorially)
                    It's your mystery man.

                              HELEN
                    Simon?  Ohmygod.

          Helen, normally the image of composure, goes suddenly fluttery
          and nervous as a high-school girl.  She takes the phone,
          turning away from Allison.

                              HELEN
                    Hello, Simon?
                         (pause)
                    It's all right.  There's no one
                    around.

          Helen glimpses Allison with her ears cocked and gives her a
          scowl and a shooing motion.  Allison turns away, grinning.


    115   INT. OFFICE - STACKS OF RECORDS - DAY

          ON HARRY, behind the stacks, reacting.  He silently mouths
          "SIMON?!"


    116   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

                              HELEN
                    You mean right now?
                         (she looks around
                          guiltily)
                    I guess so.  Okay.  I'll be right
                    there.
                         (pause)
                    Yes.  I can't wait.  Bye.

          She hangs up, a little flushed.  Then turns to Allison.

                              HELEN
                    Can you cover me for an hour?

                              ALLISON
                    Just an hour?  You should tell
                    this stud to take more time.

                              HELEN
                    Will you shutup.  I should never
                    have told you about him.

          Helen grabs her purse and rushes out, going right past the
          stack where Harry is standing, dumbfounded.  He looks like he
          was slammed in the stomach with a lead pipe.  His whole like is
          unravelling.


    117   EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          Gib sees Harry crossing the street, holding his stomach.  He
          seems dazed.  He is not so much walking to the car as wandering
          in its general direction.  He stops, in the street.  Gib gets
          out of the car and rushes to him.  He pulls him out of the path
          of a bus which is HONKING irritably.

                              GIB
                    You look like you got gut-kicked.
                    What's the matter?  You sick?

          Harry leans against the car for support.

                              HARRY
                         (barely audible)
                    He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen.
                    It's Helen, Gib.

                              GIB
                    Something to do with Helen, is
                    what I'm getting.

                              HARRY
                    She's having an affair.

          Harry's best friend in the world brightens with the news.  He
          slaps him on the back.

                              GIB
                    Congratulations.  Welcome to the
                    club.

                              HARRY
                    It can't be.  Not Helen.

                              GIB
                    Nobody believes it can happen to
                    them.

                              HARRY
                    It can't be.

                              GIB
                    Same thing happened to me with
                    wife two.  I had no idea until I
                    came home and the house was
                    empty.  I mean empty.  She even
                    took the ice-cube trays from the
                    fridge.  What kind of person
                    would think of that?

                              HARRY
                         (not listening)
                    I still don't believe it.

                              GIB
                    Relax.  Helen still loves you.
                    She just wants this guy to bang
                    her.  It's nothing serious.
                    You'll get used to it after a --

          Harry wheels around on Gib, grabbing him by the lapels, and
          slams him against the car.

                              HARRY
                    STOP.  CHEERING.  ME.  UP.

          We see in Harry's rage, frustration, and hurt confusion a
          vulnerability we never expected to see.

                              GIB
                    What'dya expect Harry?  She's a
                    flesh and blood woman.  And
                    you're never there.  It was only
                    a matter of time.

          Harry sags.  His friend is right.  Gib opens the car door and
          helps him in like an invalid, talking soothingly the whole time--

                              GIB
                    I say we concentrate on work.
                    That's how I always got through
                    it whenever my life turned to
                    dogshit.  Let's catch some
                    terrorists and then you can beat
                    the crap out of them.  You'll
                    feel better.

          Gib gets in and starts the car, full of stoic cheer for Harry.

                              GIB
                    Women.  Can't live with 'em.
                    Can't kill 'em.


    118   INT. OMEGA SECTOR / LISTENING ROOM - DAY

          Harry and Gib are in the LISTENING ROOM.  Banks of tape-decks
          recording calls, rows of technicians in cubicles processing and
          collating transcripts.

                              GIB
                    He's giving us a blank check on                        *
                    wiretaps.  So I've set 'em up on
                    all of Juno's shipping agents,
                    her clients, and Faisil made up                        *
                    a list of possible contacts that
                    Crimson Jihad might have in this
                    country.  Now all we can do is                         *
                    wait --                                                *

          He notices Harry is not listening.

                              GIB
                    Is this national security stuff
                    boring you?

                              HARRY
                    Put a tap on her phone.

                              GIB
                    What're you talking about?  We
                    have that.

                              HARRY
                    Helen's phone.  Her office line
                    and the line at my house.

          Gib gives Harry a stricken look, and glances around nervously.
          He pulls him into an empty office.

                              GIB                                          *
                         (a whispered hiss)                                *
                    Okay .  .  .I have two words to                        *
                    describe that idea.  In.  Sane.
                    Unauthorized wiretap is a felony,
                    pard.

          Harry grabs him and rams him up against the wall, his teeth
          clenched.

                              HARRY
                    Yeah, and we do it twenty times
                    a day.  Don't give me that crap.
                    Just put on the taps.  Now.

                              GIB
                    Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.

          Harry releases him and turns away.  Gib straightens his jacket,
          looking at his friend like he's completely losing it.


    119   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          That night Harry is actually there on time for dinner.  He
          glances at Dana, who has been eyeing him warily.  She looks at
          her peas.

                              HARRY
                    How was school today?

                              DANA
                    Fine.

          Harry takes a bite of his food, watching her.  Silence.  Helen
          glances at him.

                              HELEN
                    So.  You came by to see me today?

          She is a too casual, masking her nervousness.

                              HARRY
                    I was in the area, and I thought
                    you might like to have lunch.

                              HELEN
                    They must've just missed me.

                              HARRY
                    They said you had to run out.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They
                    needed some documents down at the
                    court house.  I barely made it.

          Harry watches her lying to him with some amazement.  You can
          see the jaw muscles clenching.

                              HARRY
                    So, a little excitement in an
                    otherwise dull day.  Did is work
                    out okay?

                              HELEN
                    Oh, sure.  Fine.
                         (she gets up suddenly)
                    I'll get some more gravy.

                              DANA
                    I'm done.

          Dana bolts.  She has eaten about four bites.  Harry sits at the
          table, alone.  He feels isolated, knowing that everybody is
          lying to everybody else.  He is a man without a center, lost.

                                                      CUT TO:


    120   INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ LISTENING ROOM - DAY

          TRACKING ALONG THE BANK OF RECORDERS.  Harry comes to a
          particular set of machines.  He reaches past the technician and
          picks up the hard-copy of the transcripts.

          ON HARRY walking and leafing through the phone transcripts.
          Gib watches him through a glass partition, shaking his head
          slowly.  Harry freezes, staring at the page and WE HEAR THE
          SOUND OF THE CONVERSATION OVERLAID:

                              HELEN
                    Hello?

                              SIMON
                    Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe
                    to talk?

                              HELEN
                    Yes.  Go ahead.


    121   INT. CAR - FLASHBACK SEQUENCE - DAY

          A man in his mid-thirties, sitting in a car SOMEPLACE (DAY),
          speaks into a cellular phone.  This is SIMON.  He is dark
          haired, and fairly good-looking in an off-beat way.  He is
          unshaven and his clothes look slept in.  He glances around in
          a furtive manner.

                              SIMON
                    I can't talk long.  Can you meet
                    me for lunch tomorrow?  I must
                    see you.


    122   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

          NOW WE SEE HELEN, at her office.

                              HELEN
                    Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?

                              SIMON
                    The same place.  One o'clock.  I
                    have to go now.  See you
                    tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.


    123   INT. LISTENING ROOM - DAY

          The last line is played ON HARRY, reading.  Now he is seeing
          the proof in black and white.  He slowly crumples the paper in
          one hand, his expression dark.


    124   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Helen is reading in bed.  She glances up as Harry comes into
          the room.  Gives  him a quick smile.  Too quick.

                              HARRY
                    I thought we might have lunch
                    tomorrow.

                              HELEN
                    I can't, honey.  I promised
                    Allison I'd go shopping with her.
                    Sorry.

          Harry watches her smoothly lying to him.  It's surreal to him.

                              HARRY
                    No problem.

          He surreptitiously picks up Helen's purse from a dresser and     *
          goes into the hall.                                              *

          THE FRONT DOOR OPENS and Harry comes out, walking Gizmo on a     *
          leash.  Harry walks briskly along the sidewalk, jerking the
          poor dog along twice as fast as his little legs will go.         *


    127   EXT. SIDEWALK, BY GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          He reaches Gib's car, half a block up, and hands him Helen's     *
          purse.  Gib eyes the dog warily.  He growls at it.  Gizmo hides  *
          behind Harry's legs.

                              GIB
                    Look, Harry.  I know this is
                    rough.  I felt the same way the
                    first time it happened to--

          Harry holds up one finger.  His eyes and expression are so
          intense, Gib just soft of trails off.

                              GIB                                          *

          TIGHT ON THE PURSE sitting on the seat next to her as Helen
          drives through the city.


    131   INT. / EXT. N.D. SEDAN - DAY

          Harry drives while Gib watches--


    132   INT. SEDAN, CLOSE UP ON MAP - DAY

          A COMPUTERIZED MAP below the dash.  Helen's purse appears as a
          moving blip on a street-map of the city.


    133   INT. / EXT. SEDAN - DAY

                              GIB
                    Okay, she's turning on
                    Seventeenth.  Make a left, you
                    should see her.

          Harry makes the turn.

                              HARRY
                    There she is.


    134   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

          Up ahead they see Helen's RED ACCORD pulling into a parking low
          next to a CAFE.  Harry parks the car a block away and gets out
          his binoculars.


    135   EXT. HELEN'S CAR THROUGH BINOCULARS - DAY

          HARRY'S POV through the scope.  Helen gets out of her car and
          looks around as she walks to the cafe.  It is not a nervous
          look, but it is clear she is making sure she is not followed.
          She goes inside.


    136   INT. SEDAN - DAY

                              HARRY
                    Give me audio.

          Gib hits a switch and they hear the clamor of the cafe at lunch
          rush come over a speaker.


    137   INT. CAFE - DAY

          The restaurant is nothing fancy.  A little dark.  Helen makes
          her way to a booth in the back.  Sitting in the shadows, facing
          the door, is SIMON.  She sits down opposite him.  He doesn't
          smile or kiss her in greeting, but glances around the room like
          he expects a threat to leap out at any moment.

                              SIMON
                    Are you sure you weren't
                    followed?

                              HELEN
                    I kept looking back, like you
                    taught me.  I didn't see anyone.

                              SIMON
                    Okay.  It's just, things are a
                    bit hot for me right now.  If I
                    get a signal...
                         (holds up a cigarette
                          lighter meaningfully)
                    I may have to leave suddenly.

                              HELEN
                    I understand.

                              SIMON
                    It's my job to risk my life, but
                    not yours.  I feel bad about
                    bringing you into this, but
                    you're the only one I can trust.

          Simon creates an atmosphere of danger.  His haggardness give
          him an air of mystery and desperation.

                              HELEN
                    Where were you?  On a... uh,                           *
                    mission?

                              SIMON
                    Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert                            *
                    operation.  And this one got a
                    little rough.

                              HELEN
                    Worse than Cairo?                                      *

                              SIMON
                    Cairo was a day at the beach next                      *
                    to this.


    138   INT. SEDAN - DAY

          Harry and Gib turn to each other, shocked with the dawning
          awareness.

                              GIB
                    Guy's a spook!

                              HARRY
                    Yeah, but for who?                                     *

                              GIB
                    He could be working her to get to
                    you.

          Harry waves his hand, silencing Gib.

          INTERCUT FROM HERE ON BETWEEN HARRY/GIB AND HELEN/SIMON.


    139   INT. CAFE - DAY

          SIMON puts a newspaper on the table, sliding it over to Helen.

                              SIMON
                    Did you read the papers
                    yesterday?

                              HELEN
                    Yes.

                              SIMON
                    Sometimes a story is a mask for
                    a covert operation.  See-- two
                    men killed in a restroom, and two
                    unidentified men in a running                          *
                    shootout, ending at the                                *
                    Marriot...


    140   INT. SEDAN - DAY

          HARRY AND GIB react, realizing that it is the story of their
          operation gone awry.


    141   INT. CAFE - DAY

                              HELEN
                    That was you?!

                              SIMON
                    You recognized my style.  See,
                    you're very good.  You're a
                    natural at this.


    142   INT. SEDAN - DAY

          Harry starts to get it.  Then is dawns on Gib.

                              GIB
                    The guy's a fake!  He's taking
                    credit for our moves.


    143   INT. CAFE - DAY

          HELEN LEANS CLOSE TO SIMON.  She clearly is hanging on his
          every word.

                              HELEN
                    Tell me what happened?

                              SIMON
                    I'm sorry, I can't.

                              HELEN
                    You can trust me completely.

                              SIMON
                    I know.  But it would compromise
                    your safety too much to know
                    certain things.

                              HELEN
                    Right, of course.  I was worried
                    when I didn't hear from you that
                    night.

                              SIMON
                    It's strange.  I knew I was in a
                    woman's thoughts when I was
                    shooting it out with those
                    assassins.


    144   INT. SEDAN - DAY

          HARRY REACTS to the outrageous fabrication.

                              GIB
                    Unbelievable.


    145   INT. CAFE - DAY

          BUT HELEN is eating it up.

                              HELEN
                    Were they trying to kill you?                          *

                              SIMON
                    Three of them.  Hardly worth                           *
                    talking about.  Two won't bother                       *
                    me again.

                              HELEN
                    And you chased one?

                              SIMON
                    Something came over me, I just
                    had nail him, no matter what the                       *
                    risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I
                    thought he had me, a couple of                         *
                    times.  But I really can't take
                    credit .  .  .

                              HELEN                                        *
                    You can't?                                             *

                    No.  It's the training.  It                            *
                    shapes you into a lethal                               *

                    thinking.                                              *

                    Not here.  I'll call you and
                    we'll rendezvous again.
                         (he looks around)
                    We have to leave separately, so
                    we aren't seen together.  For
                    your safety.

                              HELEN
                    You'll call me then?

          Thinking he is supercool.


    157   EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY

          Simon pulls into a used car lot, which is a run-down place.  A
          hodge-podge of makes and models, a few that might aspire to be
          classics.

          Simon backs the Vette into an open space on the front line.  He
          reaches into the back seat and pulls out a dayglo sign showing
          the SALE PRICE of the car.  He sticks it back on the dash.  The
          car doesn't even belong to him!


    158   EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM CAR LOT - DAY

          Harry and Gib pull up.  They watch as Simon jumps out of the
          Vette and goes into the sales office.

                              GIB
                         (laughing)
                    He's a goddamn used car salesman.
                    This just gets better.
                         (catching himself)
                    Sorry Harry, I know this is
                    painful.

          Harry's eyes are slitted down lethally as he stares across the
          street.


    159   INT. CAR LOT SALES OFFICE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)                 *

          TIGHT ON A TAPE PLAYER, with Simon's hand adjusting the volume.
          The sound of traffic noise and middle-eastern music blares from
          the deck.

          PULL BACK to see Simon on the phone, talking loud, as if over
          the din of a real place.

                              SIMON
                    It's a great little bar, Amanda,
                    you'd love it.  Beirut's a great
                    place if you know the city.                            *
                    Listen, this isn't a secure line.
                    I'll tell you all about it when
                    I get back tomorrow... if I live.
                         (pause)
                    Scared?  Never!  Except of you--

          During this, the owner of the place, DOUG WURTZ, has come out
          of the back room and looked out at the lot.  What Doug sees is--

          HARRY, browsing among the cars.

          DOUG turns from the window and bears down on Simon, who sees
          him coming and speeds up his rap.

                              SIMON
                    --I have to go, baby.  A guy's
                    coming toward me--

          Doug grabs the phone out of his hand and slams it in the
          cradle.

                              DOUG                                         *
                    Simon, look out there.  You see
                    that man?  Notice how he's
                    looking at the cars.  He's called
                    a customer.  I know it's been a
                    while, but do you remember what
                    you're supposed to do when we
                    have a customer?


    160   EXT. CAR LOT - DAY

          Simon bounces jauntily up to Harry, talking before he's even
          reached him.

                              SIMON
                    It wants you too.  Feel it
                    vibrate?  How about a little
                    spin?

          Simon opens the passenger door and sits Harry inside, then runs
          around the car.  He leaps over the closed door into the
          driver's seat and starts the car.

                              SIMON
                    You gotta jump in.  That's rule
                    number one.  It takes a little
                    practice, but there's no way
                    around it.


    161   EXT. STREET - DAY

          Simon swings the car out onto the boulevard, kicking back.

                              SIMON
                    See, it's not just the car, it's
                    a total image.  An identity you
                    have to go for.  This isn't some
                    high-tech sports car...  it
                    doesn't even handle that great.
                    But that's not the idea, is it.

          Simon gives Harry a big grin.  Harry returns a knowing chuckle.
          Ha ha.

                              SIMON
                    What're we talking about here?
                    Pussy, right?

                              HARRY
                    Absolutely.

          Simon laughs.  Harry laughs.  A big lusty, male-bonding kind of
          laugh.

                              SIMON
                    Well then this is a vital piece
                    of equipment.  Used properly, it
                    can change your life.  See, you
                    cruise.  No racing.  This ain't
                    a Ferrari.  You check out the
                    scenery, let the scenery check
                    you out.  You got to take it
                    slow.  Old cars are like good
                    women... they heat up fast.

          How do you grin warmly while your eyes are so cold?  Ask Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Keep talking.

                                                      CUT TO:


    162   EXT. TACO STAND - DAY

          Simon is holding court.  Over tacos, he waxes eloquent on his
          greatest area of expertise.  We see Harry laughing, going along
          with the guy.  Pretending to bond.

                              SIMON
                    Let's face it, Harry, the Vette
                    gets 'em wet.  But it's not
                    enough.  If you want to really
                    close escrow, you gotta have an
                    angle.

                              HARRY
                    And you've got one.

                              SIMON
                    It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm
                    not that much to look at.  No
                    really.  I can be honest.  But I
                    got 'em lining up, and not just
                    skanks, either.  Some are.

                              HARRY
                    So what's your angle?

                              SIMON
                    Sorry.  Trade secret.

                              HARRY
                         (grinning)
                    Sure.  Set me up and then don't
                    tell me.

          Simon leans forward, conspiratorially.

                              SIMON
                    Okay, just ask yourself.  What do
                    women really want?  You take
                    these bored housewives, married
                    to the same guy for years.  Stuck
                    in a rut.  They need some
                    release.  The promise of
                    adventure.  A hint of danger.  I
                    create that for them.

                              HARRY
                    So you're basically lying your
                    ass off the whole time?  I
                    couldn't do it.

                              SIMON
                    Well, think of it as playing a
                    role.  It's fantasy.  You have to
                    work on their dreams.  Get them
                    out of their daily suburban grind
                    for a few hours.

                              HARRY
                    Isn't that hard to keep up, in
                    the long run?

                              SIMON
                    Doesn't matter.  I like change.
                    You know, constant turnover.  As
                    soon as I close the deal, it's
                    one of two more times, then
                    adios.

                              HARRY
                    Use 'em and lose 'em.

                              SIMON
                    Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta
                    pick your target.  They have to
                    be nice little housewife types.
                    School-teachers.  But, I'm
                    telling you, you get their pilot
                    lit, these babes, they can suck-
                    start a leaf-blower.

                              HARRY
                    What about the husbands?

                              SIMON
                    Dickless.  If they took care of                        *
                    business, I'd be out of business,
                    know what I mean?

                              HARRY
                    Those idiots.


    163   EXT. STREET/ VETTE - DAY

          They are cruising along, with Harry driving this time.

                              HARRY
                    You working on someone right now?

                              SIMON
                    I always have a couple on the
                    hook.  You know.  There's one
                    right now, I've got her panting
                    like a dog.  It's great.

          Unconsciously, Harry's hands clench the wheel tighter.

                              HARRY
                    What does she do?

                              SIMON
                    Some kinda legal secretary of
                    something.  Married to some
                    boring jerk.

          Harry takes a corner too fast.  The tires squealing.

                              SIMON
                    And she could be so hot, if she
                    wanted to be.  She's like a dying
                    plant that just needs a little
                    water.

          When Simon is looking, Harry is open and encouraging...  they
          laugh together... then when he looks away Harry goes snake-
          eyed.  He could kill Simon with one punch.  He's visualizing
          his wife getting porked by this guy.

                              HARRY
                    But with you, she gets to be hot,
                    right?

                              SIMON
                    Red hot.  Her thighs steam.

          They laugh together.  Harry's laugh is getting a bit brittle.
          He speeds up, his knuckles white on the wheel.  Now for the big
          question: HAVE THEY OR HAVEN'T THEY?

                              HARRY
                    Sooooo... she's pretty good in
                    bed, then?

                              SIMON
                         (yelling suddenly)
                    Hey, slow down you're gonna miss
                    the turn!


    164   EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY

          Harry comes barrelling into the lot at forty.  He cranks the
          wheel and hits the emergency brake, slewing the car into a
          smoking bootlegger-180.  It screeches backward, sliding right
          into its parking space perfectly.

          Simon is bugeyed.  But he is non-plussed for only about two
          seconds.  Then he's back to selling.  He scrambles out and goes
          around to Harry, coughing in the cloud of tire smoke.

                              SIMON
                    See.  You and this car were meant
                    for each other.  Why fight it?
                    Sure, I have a couple other
                    buyers lined up, but I like your
                    style.  Whattya say?  Should we
                    start on the paperwork?

                              HARRY
                    Let me think about it.  Hold it
                    a day for me?

          Simon grins and winks.

                              SIMON
                    Because it's you.


    165   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Dana is in the living room, watching TV when she sees her
          mother cross through, dressed to go out.

                              HELEN
                    Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell
                    your father I may be late.

                              DANA
                    Where are you going?

                              HELEN
                    Out.

          Dana is momentarily puzzled by the reversal of roles.


    166   INT. ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

          ON HELEN, checking herself in the hall mirror.  She looks at
          her big dowdy purse.  Hating it suddenly.  She pulls her
          pocketbook out and rummages on the top shelf of the hall closet
          for a small handbag, then charges out.

    167   OMITTED


    168   INT. / EXT. SEDAN - NIGHT

          Harry is driving.  Gib pulls a sheaf of pages out of his
          briefcase and hands them to him.

                              GIB
                    Here's today's transcripts.
                    There's nothing interesting.

                              SIMON
                    Nothing from Simon?

          Keeping one eye on the road, Harry riffles through the sheets.
          He glances at the top of the last couple of sheets.  He scowls.
          Then SUDDENLY SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.  The car dives to the curb,
          bumping one wheel.  Harry gets out and charges around to Gib's
          side.  Gib gets out, his expression blank.

                              HARRY
                    Give me the page.

                              GIB
                    What are you talking about?

                              HARRY
                    It skips from page nine to
                    eleven.  Where's page ten?

                              GIB
                    Aw, it's gotta be a typo--

                              HARRY
                    GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!

          Harry hammers his fist against the car-window right next to
          Gib.  It explodes inward in a shower of glass.

                              GIB
                         (shrugging)
                    Okay.  Here.

          He fishes a crumples sheet of paper out of his pocket.  Harry
          grabs it from him, straightening it.

                              GIB
                    Jeez, Harry.  Seek help.

          As Harry begins to read, we go into FLASHBACK.


    169   INT. USED CAR LOT OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK

          ON SIMON - He is talking into the phone in hushed, urgent
          tones.

                              SIMON
                    Helen.  I need your help.  Can
                    you meet me tonight?

          INTERCUT WITH HELEN at her office.


    170   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK/INTERCUT

                              HELEN
                    What's happened?

                              SIMON
                    It's serious.  That's all I can                        *

          BACK TO THE PRESENT.  Harry checks his watch.                    *

                    Shit!  It's almost eight.                              *

          He jumps back in the car and activates the GPS locator.
          Helen's purse-blip flashes on the grid map.

                              HARRY
                    She's still at my house.                               *

                              GIB
                    The purse is still at the house.


    172   INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

          Harry growls and slams the car into gear, roaring out into
          traffic.  Horns honk as he cuts off people.  He is oblivious.
          He grabs his rover.

                              HARRY
                    Unit Two?  Unit Seven?

                    Copy that.

                              GIB
                    Wait a minute!  Are you out of
                    your mind?  You can't pull agents
                    off a priority surveillance to
                    follow  your wife!    It's gross
                    misappropriation of Sector's
                    resources, it's...  it's a breach
                    of national security.

          Harry drives on, ignoring him.  Gib grabs his shoulder, shaking
          him.

                              GIB                                          *

                    I have to stop you.

                              HARRY
                    Whatya going to do?   Tell?

                              GIB
                    Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our
                    butts.  So your life is in the
                    toilet.  So your wife is banging
                    a used car salesman.  Sure it's
                    humiliating.  But be a man here--

                              HARRY
                    You tell on me, I tell on you.

                              GIB
                    Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a

                              HARRY
                    What about that time you trashed
                    a six-week operation because you
                    were busy getting a blow-job?

                              GIB
                         (instantly contrite)
                    You know about that?

          Harry turns to him.  His glare could melt metal.  Gib gives a
          fatalistic shrug.

                              GIB
                    Take Franklin, it's quicker.

          Harry makes the turn, squealing tires.

                              GIB
                    You don't have any pictures
                    though, do ya.  Huh?                                   *


    173   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

          Helen pulls  her car under the bridge.  She checks her watch.
          Helen notices that her hand is shaking.  She looks around and    *
          the place seems deserted.  She is about to leave when she sees
          headlights flash briefly in the shadows.

          A red-and-white Vette emerges from the darkness and pulls up
          next to her.  Simon motions for her to get in quickly.


    174   EXT. PARKING LOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS - NIGHT

          LONGSHOT  on Simon and Helen in the Vette, coming out of the
          parking low under the bridge.  We are watching them through a
          sophisticated telephoto night-vision device.


    175   INT. UNIT TWO SEDAN - NIGHT

          Agent MORTON lowers the SCOPE and picks up his rover.  He puts   *
          the car in gear to follow.

                              MORTON

   175A   INT./EXT. SIMON'S CAR

          Simon makes a show of checking the mirrors.

                              SIMON
                    Now don't be alarmed... but if
                    I'm spotter, it would be best if
                    they don't see you.  You should
                    keep your head down until we're
                    out of the city.

          He pushes her head down onto his lap.  She crouches there, with
          her cheek against his thigh.  He's cruising along, loving it.


    176   INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib is trying to watch the computerized city map on the screen,
          but Harry keeps cornering so fast he loses his place.

                              MORTON (RADIO)
                    The woman has her head in the
                    guy's lap.

          Harry is doing a jaw-clenched slow burn.

    184   EXT. HIGHWAY LEAVING CITY - NIGHT

          It is a highway heading away from the city.  IN A LONG LENS
          SHOT, the Vette appears over the brow of a hill.  A moment
          later A HELICOPTER rises up behind them, A DRAMATIC REVEAL.  It
          follows the Vette.

                              CONDOR (VOICE OVER/RADIO)
                    This is Condor.  We have the

       The headlights of the Vette light up a ratty single-wide
       mobile home, on the outskirts of a TRAILER PARK off the
       highway.  Simon and Helen get out of the car.

                            SIMON
                 My place in the city is too
                 hot right now.  So is the
                 penthouse in New York.  But

       He takes her inside.

       INT. SIMON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                   190

       Helen feels awkward in the small, junky space.  A tape deck
       is playing cool jazz.  Simon hands her a glass of cheap wine.
       He clinks her glass with his.

                           SIMON
                 To our assignment.

                           HELEN
                 What is it you need me to do?

                              SIMON
                    Helen, I want you to be my wife.

                              HELEN
                    I'm married!

                              SIMON
                         (quickly)
                    Just for the operation in Paris.
                    I need to be married.  They'll be
                    looking for a man traveling
                    alone.

                              HELEN
                    We're going to Paris?

                              SIMON
                    Helen, there's a double agent in
                    my outfit... I don't know who.
                    There's no one I can trust.
                    Except you.  Can you get away?
                    Just for two days.

                              HELEN
                    I don't know.  I have to think...

                              SIMON
                    Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.

          He clears a place for her on the bed, shoving clothes and
          magazines out of the way.  She sits down and he tops off her
          glass from the wine bottle.


    191   EXT. BILLBOARD AND TRAILER PARK - NIGHT

          The agents have gathered behind a billboard.  Harry, Gib and     *
          the other three agents have donned black jumpsuits.  They
          finish fitting battle-harnesses, then they grab black ski-       *
          masks.  They don them in perfect unison.  Commando precision.
          Harry leads off and they quick-time from behind the billboard,
          closing in on Simon's trailer.


    192   INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          Helen looks up at Simon and nods slowly.

                              HELEN
                    Okay.  I'll do it.

          Simon shoots over and sits next to her, taking her hand.

                              SIMON
                    You are incredibly brave.  I have
                    to remind myself the fear you
                    must be feeling.  I've lived like
                    this for years, so I'm used to
                    it.  Every day when I get up, I
                    think it might be my last.  But
                    it makes you appreciate life.
                    And the moment.  Because that may
                    be all you have.

          He moves a little closer.  Casting his spell.

                              SIMON
                    To pull this cover story off, we
                    have to look exactly like two
                    people who are intimate with each
                    other.  The enemy can spot a fake
                    easily.

          He puts his hand on her knee.  She tenses up instantly.

                              SIMON
                    You see what I mean?  That
                    reaction would give us away in a
                    second.  Try to relax.

                              HELEN
                    It's just that... it's been
                    sixteen years since anyone but
                    Harry did that, I--

                              SIMON
                    Relax.  There, that's better.
                    Let yourself slip into the role.

          He puts his other arm around her shoulders and pulls her slowly
          into a kiss.  This doesn't seem real to Helen.  She finds
          herself not pulling away.  He lowers her slowly until they are
          lying together on the bed.

                              SIMON
                    There you go.  That's right...

          He slides his hand up her thigh.  The fingers, stroking in
          little circles, slips under her skirt.  And--

          She suddenly EXPLODES, pushing on his chest, forcing him up off
          her.

                              HELEN
                    NO!  Stop!
                         (he keeps kissing her)
                    Get off me RIGHT NOW!

          Simon struggles with her.  She gets one knee up under him and
          levers him up.  She pushes him to a standing position.  She
          sits up on the bed, straightening her skirt.

          He looks forlorn and pathetic.  Now he's going to try
          pleading...

                              SIMON
                    If not for me, do it for
                    democracy.


    193   INT. / EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          KABOOM!!  The back wall of the trailer is blown outward by tiny
          shaped-charges.  The concussion throws Simon forward on top of
          her.  Five BLACK-SUITED FIGURES swarm in, carrying machine
          pistols and flashlights.


    194   INT. TRAILER - HARRY'S POV - NIGHT

          Lit by the beam of the flashlight, he sees Simon on top of
          Helen, her knees up on either side of his hips.  It looks bad.
          Simon and Helen sit up... stunned.  They look like two rabbits
          in the headlights of a truck.  She screams.


    195   INT. TRAILER - ON SIMON - NIGHT

          Reacting as all his years of bullshit have suddenly
          materialized as a nightmarish reality.  He is stunned.
          Blinking, mouth hanging open.


    196   INT. / EXT. TRAILER - SIMON'S POV - NIGHT

          WHAT SIMON SEES -- Five demonic figures, backlit by the XENON
          LIGHT from a helicopter.  Smoke and dust swirling in the rotor-
          wash.  The figures lunge toward them, grabbing them both.
          Helen struggles fiercely as Gib (disguised) pulls her up.
          Harry yanks Simon to his feet.


    197   EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          Gib comes out first with Helen.  She struggles like a wildcat,
          frankly surprising the hell out of Harry.  Simon is brought
          out, dazed and compliant.  Helen whips around, KNEEING GIB
          right in the balls.  Gib OOPHS and doubles over, and Helen runs
          for it.

          Harry leaves Simon with the other agents and runs after Helen.
          She sprints through the trees, Harry pounding after her.  He
          grabs her and gets her in a headlock.  She bites the hell out
          of his arm.  Harry yells and lets her go, just as-- Keough runs
          up and matter-of-factly clips her on the head with his weapon.
          Standard operating procedure.  Which is why he can't understand
          why Harry punches him, knocking him down.

          Harry supports a sagging Helen, gesturing sharply to the other
          agents and going RRRRR-RRRR to make his point (since he can't
          talk without her recognizing his voice).  They head for the
          cars.

                                                      CUT TO:


    198   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM/OBSERVATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

          An empty room with a single stool under a light, and a large
          two-way mirror.  The door opens and Helen is escorted in by
          Keough, still wearing his jumpsuit.  Helen has a black hood
          over her head.  Keough undoes a pair of handcuffs, freeing her,
          then leaves quickly.

          Helen whips the hood off and blinks in the light.  She wheels
          at the sound of the door locking and runs to it.  Pulls twice
          on the handle, without effect.  She crosses to the mirror and
          peers at her reflection, trying to see if anyone is there on
          the other side.


    199   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS is a dark chamber.  We see Helen
          perfectly, peering in, though she sees nothing.  Harry and Gib,
          in silhouette, sit at a console.  Harry speaks into a
          microphone.

                              HARRY
                    Sit down.


    200   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          ON HELEN'S SIDE of the mirror we hear Harry's voice shifted by
          a DIGITAL PROCESSOR.  It is a cold booming mechanical voice.
          Harsh and inhuman.

                              VOICE (HARRY)
                    I said SIT DOWN.
                         (she does)
                    Who do you work for?

                              HELEN
                    Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath.
                    I'm a legal secretary.

                              VOICE (HARRY)
                    Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And
                    what were you going with the
                    international terrorist, Carlos
                    the Jackal?  Taking dictation?

                              HELEN
                    He said he was an American agent.


    201   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          INSIDE THE CONTROL room we can see Harry, Gib and, through the
          glass, Helen.  Their voices sound normal on this side.

                              HARRY
                    How long have you been a member
                    of his faction?

                              HELEN
                    I don't know anything about a
                    faction.  I just met Simon...  or
                    whatever his name is...  a couple
                    of weeks ago.  I barely know him.

                              GIB
                    That's not what it looked like
                    when we found you.

          Harry scowls at Gib in the dark.  Helen flushes, remembering.

                              HARRY
                    How did you meet him?

          FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:


    202   INT. MALL - DAY/FLASHBACK

          We see Helen sitting at table at a mall near where she works,
          having a cappucino and a croissant.

                              HELEN (V.O.)
                    About two weeks ago I was at the
                    mall, having coffee...

          Simon appears behind her, sort of stalking up to her.  He
          approaches quickly the last few steps and slips into the seat
          next to her.  His manner is furtive.  He keeps looking around,
          as if for hidden assasins.  He hands her a briefcase.

                              SIMON
                         (speaking very low)
                    Keep this for me.  I can't afford
                    to be taken with it.  National
                    security is at stake.  I'll
                    contact you if a can.  Okay?  Oh--

          He seems to suddenly spot something OFF CAMERA and dashes off
          the other way.


    203   EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - DAY/FLASHBACK

          Helen walks back to her office building, carrying the
          briefcase.  She keeps looking over her shoulder.


    204   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK

          She has the briefcase on her desk while she works.  She keeps
          glancing at it as she types.  Finally she hunches over it and
          starts picking the locks with a paper clip.

          TIGHT ON SECOND LOCK, popping open.

          ON HELEN as she opens the case.  She gasps.

          INSIDE THE CASE are the following items:  A tiny camera, some
          loose tapes, some circuit diagrams, some transcripts that look
          like gibberish which must be ENCRYPTED, some street maps of
          Beirut, Rome and Berlin, and a Walther P.P.K.  PISTOL.  Helen,
          eyes wide, closes the case.


    205   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT / PRESENT

          Helen shrugs, finishing up her story.

                              HELEN
                    I should have gone to the police,
                    I suppose.

                              GIB
                    But you didn't.  Why not?

                              HELEN
                    I don't know.  I guess... I
                    wanted to see what would happen.

                              HARRY
                    What did happen?

                              HELEN
                    Three days later, he called me.
                    He told me to meet him at
                    Overlook Park.


    206   EXT. OVERLOOK PARK - SUNSET/FLASHBACK

          Through the trees is a sweeping view across the Potomac to
          Georgetown and Embassy Row.  Helen is sitting on a park bench
          when Simon shows up, sitting beside her.  She hands him the
          briefcase.

                              SIMON
                    Thank you.  You saved my life.
                    What's your name?

                              HELEN
                    Helen.

                              SIMON
                    You can call me Simon.
                         (he touches her hand)
                    You're very brave to do this...
                         (then notices the locks
                          have been opened)
                    You opened it.

                              HELEN
                    I just glances inside.


    207   EXT. OVERLOOK PARK - CLOSE UP ON SIMON

          CLOSE ON SIMON, looking right into her eyes.

                              SIMON
                         (solemn)
                    Then you know.


    208   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT / PRESENT

          Harry shakes his head and rubs his eyes, picturing the whole
          thing.

                              HARRY
                    Why did you continue to see him?

                              HELEN
                    He needed my help.

                              HARRY
                    Not because you were attracted to
                    him?

                              HELEN
                    No.

                              HARRY
                    You weren't attracted to him at
                    all?

                              HELEN
                    Well, maybe a little.

                              GIB
                    Is this a common thing for you?
                    Cheating?

                              HELEN
                    No!  Never!

                              GIB
                    So, it was your first time.

                              HELEN
                    I wasn't cheating!

                              HARRY
                    Tell me about your husband, Mrs
                    Tasker.

                              HELEN
                    Harry?  What can I say about
                    Harry?  He's a sales rep for a
                    computer company.

                              HARRY
                         (hard question for him)
                    Would you say he was boring,
                    then?

                              HELEN
                         (she sighs, nodding
                          fatalistically)
                    Yeah.  I suppose he is.

                              GIB
                    So sex with him isn't exactly
                    making your flag wave anymore.

          Harry cuffs him on the shoulder.  Signals with a scowl for him
          to stay out of it.  Gib smirks.  Harry's put him through enough
          shit the last couple of days, it's time for a couple digs.

                              HELEN
                    That's none of your goddamn
                    business!  What kind of questions
                    are these?

                              HARRY
                    You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs.
                    Tasker, so I suggest you
                    cooperate.  If we want to know
                    the most intimate details of your
                    life, you'd better tell us.

          Helen glowers at the mirror.  Her hands are shaking and she
          hates it that they can probably see she is afraid.

                              HELEN
                    My husband is a good man.

                              GIB
                    But he's not exactly ringing your
                    bell lately, right?  I mean--

          Harry covers the mike and whips around on Gib.

                              HARRY
                    Let me handle this part.  Do you
                    mind?
                         (to Helen)
                    Why did you go to Carlos'
                    hideout?

                              HELEN
                    He wanted me to go with him on a
                    mission, to pose as him wife.

                              HARRY
                    And you agreed?

                              HELEN
                    Yes.

                              HARRY
                         (amazed)
                    Why?

          Helen searches herself for the explanation.

                              HELEN
                    I don't know.  I guess I needed
                    something...

                              HARRY
                    What did you need?

                              HELEN
                    I needed to feel alive.  I wanted
                    to do something...  outrageous.
                    And... I don't know... it felt
                    good to be needed.  To be
                    trusted.  To be special.

          In verbalizing it she just feels smaller, more pathetic that
          she ever did.  She hates the unseen voices for making for try
          to explain her deepest, unvoiced needs.

                              HELEN
                    There's so much I wanted to do in
                    this life, and it's like I
                    haven't done any of it.  And the
                    sand's running out of the
                    hourglass.  I want to be able to
                    look back and say:  See!  I did
                    that.  It was wild and it was
                    reckless and outrageous and I
                    fucking did it!
                         (she glares at the
                          mirror)
                    And I frankly don't give a shit
                    if you understand this or not.

          Gib looks at Harry, eyebrows raised.  Whew!  Harry is studying
          his wife like she's some fantastic new species.

                              HARRY
                    This Simon.  Did you sleep with
                    him?

                              HELEN
                    No.

                              GIB
                         (covering the mike)
                    She's lying.

                              HARRY
                    You didn't have sexual relations
                    with him?

                              HELEN
                         (acidly)
                    Look, if you ask me everything
                    twice, this is going to take a
                    really long time.  And I have to
                    get home to my family.

                              GIB
                    You're not going anywhere.

          Helen loses it.  It is fury and fear, tears and rage all at
          once--

                              HELEN
                    Let me out of her!  Right now!

                              HARRY
                    Answer the question--

          She picks up her stool and charges toward the mirror, swinging
          it with all her might.  It bounces off harmlessly.

                              HELEN
                         (she swings again,
                          yelling)
                    I didn't sleep with him!
                         (and again--WHAM!)
                    You hear me, you chickenshit
                    bastards--

          WHAM!  She hits the mirror again.

                              GIB (INHUMAN VOICE)
                    Everyone tries.  It's
                    unbreakable.

          WHAM!  WHAM!  WHAM!  The mirror suddenly stars from side to
          side with huge cracks.  She's about to beat her way through it.


    209   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          INSIDE THE OBSERVATION ROOM Harry and Gib jump back.

                              GIB
                    She could be telling the truth.

                              HARRY
                         (to Helen)
                    Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker.
                    There is only one more question.

          Helen drops the stool.  She stands there panting.  Her fury
          spent, she begins to cry.

                              HELEN
                    What?

                              HARRY
                    Do you still love your husband?

                              HELEN
                         (softly)
                    Yes.

                              HARRY
                    Louder please.

                              HELEN
                    I love him.  I have always loved
                    him and I will always love him.
                         (she wipes at her eyes)
                    Can I go home, please?


    210   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          INSIDE THE OBSERVATION ROOM Harry states at her.  He smiles.

                              GIB
                    Now what?

                              HARRY
                         (leaning forward to the
                          mike)
                    There is only one solution to
                    your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You
                    must work for us.

                              GIB
                         (whispering to Harry)
                    Oh shit.  Harry... what're you
                    doing?

                              HARRY
                         (like: isn't it
                          obvious?)
                    I'm giving her an assignment.
                         (to Helen)
                    I am offerring you a choice.  If
                    you work for us we will drop the
                    charges and you can go back to
                    your normal life.  If not, you
                    will go to federal prison, and
                    your husband and daughter will be
                    left humiliated and alone.  Your
                    like will be destroyed.

                              HELEN
                    Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--

                              HARRY
                    Yes or no.

                              HELEN
                    What do you think?  Of course
                    yes!  What's involved?

                              HARRY
                    You will be contacted with the
                    assignment.

                              HELEN
                    My husband can't know about this.

                              HARRY
                    No one must know!  Especially
                    him.  You must appear to live
                    your life normally, conveying
                    nothing.  The security of this
                    nation depends on it.  Can you do
                    that?

                              HELEN
                    I think so.

                              HARRY
                    Think carefully.  You will be
                    lying to the man you love.  The
                    person who trusts you the most.

                              HELEN
                         (fearless)
                    I can do it!

                              HARRY
                    The code name of your contact
                    will be Boris.  Your code name
                    will be--

                              HELEN
                         (excited)
                    Natasha?

                              HARRY
                    No.  Doris.


    211   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          ON HELEN, not liking her wimpy code-name.


    212   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The unit-seven van pulls up in the spooky shadows under the
          bridge, stopping next to Helen's red Accord.  The door slides
          open and Helen gets out, helped my black-garbed hands.  She is
          wearing her hood, which is whisked off by one of the hands.
          She whirls in time to see the door slide shut and the van speed
          off.  She watches it drive off into the night.


    213   EXT. ROCK QUARRY - NIGHT

          The van pulls up near the edge of a large quarry.  The door
          opens and Simon is pushed out, followed by Harry, who is in his
          black jumpsuit and wearing a ski-mask.  Gib follows as Harry
          guides Simon to the edge of a sheer drop.  Harry whips off the
          hood and Simon takes in his surroundings.

                              SIMON
                    Yeeaoowww!!

                              HARRY
                    You son of a bitch.  Did you
                    really think you could elude us
                    forever, Carlos?

                              SIMON
                    Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My
                    name's Simon.  Look, just let me
                    go.  There's no need to kill me.
                    I haven't seen your--

          Harry whips off his ski-mask.

                              SIMON
                    -- face.  Shit!  Shit!!

          Simon has ducked his head and won't look at Harry.  Then it
          dawns...  He looks up, brightening hopefully.

                              SIMON
                    It's you!  Hey, you still
                    interested in that Vette at all?

                              GIB
                    You can drop it now, Carlos.  The
                    game is over.  Your career as an
                    inter-national terrorist is too
                    well documented.

                              SIMON
                    No... I sell cars.  That's all!
                    Not even foreign cars.  Nothing
                    international, I swear.  I'm no
                    terrorist.  Everything I said was
                    a lie... you have to believe me.
                    I'm actually a complete coward.
                    If I ever even saw a gun I'd--

          Harry whips his pistol out in one liquid motion and snaps the
          muzzle right in front of Simon's eyes.

                              SIMON
                    -- faint.  Aahhh!  Don't kill me.
                    I'm not a spy.  I'm nothing.  I'm
                    navel lint.  I have to lie to
                    women to get laid.  And I don't
                    score much.  It's pathetic.
                         (he looks down)
                    See, look... would a spy pee
                    himself?

          Harry is finally sickened by his grovelling.  He pulls Simon
          away from the edge, then gestures with his gun.

                              HARRY
                    Beat it.

                              SIMON
                    No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot
                    me.

          Harry starts back to the truck.  Simon stays right with him,
          facing him, terrified to turn away.  Like a dog following him.

                              SIMON
                    Please don't.  You can have the
                    car for free--

                              GIB
                    Take off, dipshit!

          Gib finally shoves Simon back and Harry contemptuously cranks
          THREE ROUNDS into the ground by his feet, forcing him to dance
          backward.  The two agents get into the van and tear off in a
          cloud of dust.  Leaving Simon alone in the moonlight, miles
          from nowhere.

                                                      CUT TO:


    214   INT./ EXT. SEDAN - DAY

          TIGHT ON LOCATOR SCREEN as a blip moves across the grid of city
          streets.  Gib drives while Harry watches the screen.

                              HARRY
                    We should pick up visual at the
                    next light.

          The scrambler phone in Harry's briefcase rings.  He picks it
          up.

                              HARRY
                    Morning, boss.


    215   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - DAY

          INTERCUT WITH SEDAN.  Spencer Trilby stands glowering as he
          talks to Harry.

                              TRILBY
                    Harry, this report on last
                    night's operation is the thinnest
                    piece of crap I've ever seen from
                    you.  I'm sure you won't mind
                    giving me a little more detail on
                    why all these assets were
                    deployed.


    216   INT./EXT. SEDAN - DAY

                              HARRY
                    Absolutely.  But can it wait?
                    I'm on a critical surveillance
                    right now.

          Harry spots something up ahead.  He snaps his fingers and
          points, then whips a pair of gyro-stabilized binoculars to his
          eyes.

          HARRY'S POV THROUGH SCOPE:  Trent, on the Yamaha with Dana on
          the back, rides through the intersection up ahead.  Dana bops
          to the sound coming over her walkman headphones as Trent zips
          between cars.  Gib makes the turn, pulling in behind them at a
          distance.

                              TRILBY
                    Harry.  Is there anything you
                    want to tell me?

                              HARRY
                         (innocently)
                    No.  Not that I can think of.

          THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ominously on Spencer Trilby.

                              TRILBY
                    Harry?  You know we never fire
                    anybody.

          Click.  Harry hangs up the phone slowly.

                              GIB
                    We're dead, right?  So...
                    where'd you put the transmitter?

                              HARRY
                    In her Walkman.  It's the one
                    thing I knew she'd be taking.


    217   EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

          Harry walks toward the closed warehouse doors, past Trent's
          parked Yamaha.  We hear MUSIC from inside.


    218   INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

          INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE, we see what it is that Dana has been
          doing when she skips school.  A garage band of teenagers,
          mostly older than her, are playing loudly.  Dana has the
          microphone, belting out a punchy cover of the old Cream classic
          "Sunshine of Your Love".  The guitar parts have been industrial-
          ized, and it actually sounds pretty hip.

          Harry watches from the shadows, standing behind a pillar not
          far from the stage.  Watching his daughter gyrating in the
          spotlight.  His reaction is hard to read.


    219   INT. WAREHOUSE - CLOSE UP OF CIRCUIT-BREAKER - DAY

          TIGHT ON THE MASTER CIRCUIT-BREAKER as Harry's hand throws the
          switch.


    220   INT. WAREHOUSE - STAGE - DAY

          The stage is plunged into darkness and the music stops
          abruptly.  Before the band members can react, they hear the big
          metal doors rolling and sunlight blazes in.  Dana stares into
          the glare, seeing an ominous silhouette standing there.  The
          shadowy figure walks toward them.

                              FIGURE
                    You! Come with me.

          The figure comes straight toward Dana.  To her horror is turns
          out to be her dad.  Her heart stops.

                              DANA
                    Oh my Gooooood.


    221   EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

          Harry appears through the doors, marching Dana by the arm.  He
          walks her over to some industrial junk nearby, overgrown with
          weeds, and sits her down for a talk.

          She is sullen, still mortified from getting dragged out in
          front of her friends.

                              HARRY
                    There are going to be some
                    changes Dana.  You're going to
                    start following some rules.  And
                    I'm going to be there to see that
                    you do.

                              DANA
                    Yeah, right.

                              HARRY
                    You're going to stay in school.
                    Do you understand?

                              DANA
                    Why?  So I can wind up like you?
                    What's the point?

          You think Harry's going to really rain on her parade.  But he
          doesn't.  He becomes very tender.  He pushes the hair back from
          her face.

                              HARRY
                    Did I tell you about the time we
                    first met?

          She looks up at him, puzzled?

                              HARRY
                    You were quite young at the time.
                    All wet and still attached to
                    your mom by a cord.  You opened
                    your eyes and looked right at me.
                    And I knew then I would always
                    love you with all my heart.

          Dana stares at her father with a dawning awareness.  This is
          not just some chump that she has to put up with.  This is her
          father.  He is a part of her.  No matter what happens they are
          in this thing together.  Tears start to run down her cheeks.

                              HARRY
                    Somewhere along the way I got
                    lost, honey.  I forgot about what
                    was really important.  I'm sorry
                    pump-- I mean--

          She grabs his in a fierce hug.  Harry closes his eyes, letting
          the moment purify him.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, regarding this singing--

          She pulls back, suddenly wary.  Oh shit.

                              HARRY
                         (grinning)
                    You were pretty good.


    222   INT. / EXT. SEDAN - DAY

          Dana sits wedged into the front seat between Gib and Harry.
          Father and daughter are singing raucously loud, with the
          windows down.

                              HARRY/ DANA
                    I've been waiting so long To be
                    where I'm going In the sunshine
                    of your looooove

          They crack up after the long sustain.  They are both suffused
          with a glow of rediscovery.  Harry pulls the car to the curb in
          front of Dana's school.

                              DANA
                    Dad, how come you know the words?

                              HARRY
                    Honey that song came out in 1968,
                    when I was exactly your age.

                              DANA
                    Unbelievable!  Trent told me he
                    wrote it.  He's history.


    223   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          The image of a family dinner.  Helen is avoiding Harry's eyes.
          Harry looks over at Dana and she gives him a tiny smile.  Then
          she rises from her half-finished dinner and heads out of the
          kitchen.

                              DANA
                    I'm done.

                              HELEN
                    Where are you off to young lady?

                              DANA
                         (pointing toward her
                          room)
                    I have a book report.

          Helen watches her go.  That's strange.

                              HARRY
                    So last night was pretty
                    exciting, huh?

                              HELEN
                         (alarmed)
                    What?
                         (then smoothly--)
                    Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I
                    thought the damn towtruck was
                    never going to get there.

          Harry smiles, reaching for more chicken.  The phone RINGS.
          Helen controls the urge to run to it.

                              HELEN
                    Hello?

                              METALLIC VOICE
                    Doris?

                              HELEN
                    Oh.  Yes?


    224   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - NIGHT

          GIB, AT OMEGA SECTOR, uses the SPEECH SYNTHESIZER to disguise
          his voice.

                              GIB
                    Listen carefully.  Go to the
                    Hotel Marquis in one hour.  Pick
                    up an envelope marked Doris at
                    the front desk.  And dress sexy.


    225   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          BACK ON HELEN as she reacts to that.

                              HELEN
                    What?

                              VOICE
                    Get going!
                         (CLICK)

                              HELEN
                         (thinking for a second,
                          then--)
                    Uh... well, okay then.  You sound
                    terrible.  I'll run out right
                    now.  Just call the prescription
                    in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no
                    problem.  Bye.

          Harry smirks, listening to her lie.  She's good.  The smirk
          drops as she turns.

                              HELEN
                    Allison is sick in bed.  I have
                    to go over there, honey.

                              HARRY
                    Sure, hon.

          She walks unhurriedly out of the room.  Behind her back, Harry
          is grinning.  The second Helen is out of his sight line, she
          runs up the stairs.  Harry waits a moment then picks up the
          phone.


    226   INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ ELECTRONIC LAB -- NIGHT

          Gib is in a corner of the electronics lab, in an area dedicated
          to DIGITAL AUDIO PROCESSING.  The phone in his briefcase rings.
          Gib answers.

                              GIB
                    You've reached a new low with
                    this one.  I can't believe you're
                    crazy enough to use the room at
                    the Marquis.

                              HARRY
                    Why not?  You think I can afford
                    a suite like that on my salary?
                    Is Jean-Claude done yet?                               *

          Gib looks over at a SOUND RECORDING BOOTH nearby.  In it a FAT   *
          FRENCH AGENT, JEAN-CLAUDE is doing voice recording from a hand-  *
          written page.

                              GIB
                    Not quite.


    227   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - INSIDE THE BOOTH - NIGHT

          We hear Jean-Claude record a line on a tiny DAT tape recorder.   *
          He speaks with a cosmopolitan French accent.  Close your eyes    *
          and he's Charles Boyer.

                              JEAN-CLAUDE                                  *
                    No no.  Do it slowly.  Very
                    slowly.


    228   OMITTED                                                          *


    229   INT. HOTEL MARQUIS - NIGHT

          A big luxury hotel downtown, with an opulent lobby.  Helen
          enters, looking different than we have ever seen her.  She has
          been commanded to be sexy, and she is.  Her black slinky dress
          is cut at mid-thigh, showing some good legs we haven't been
          aware of.  She's pulled her hair back and added pearls.  Now
          she looks elegant and hot.  Playing the role.


    230   INT. HOTEL - FRONT DESK - NIGHT

          She goes to the front desk and signals the ASSISTANT MANAGER
          with her eyes.  He comes over to her.

                              HELEN
                    Do you have an envelope for
                    Doris?

          The man nods.  Saying nothing, he reaches under the counter and
          hands her the envelope.  She opens it as she walks across the
          lobby.  In contains a room key, a small bugging device, and a
          phone number.


    231   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

          TIGHT ON A PAY PHONE as Helen finishes dialing the number.  She
          scans the lobby as the phone rings--

                              METALLIC VOICE
                    Listen.  You are a prostitute
                    named Michelle.  Go to the room.
                    A man will be there.  He is a
                    suspected arms dealer.

                              HELEN
                    Do I have to... you know-- ?

                              VOICE
                    No.  He has particular tastes.
                    He likes to watch.  You will say
                    his regular girl, Carla, is sick.
                    If he likes you, he will tell you
                    what to do.  You must plant the
                    bug near the telephone, by the
                    bed, before you leave.  If you do
                    not accomplish your mission, the
                    deal is off.


    232   INT. HOTEL/ TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT

          Helen exits an elevator and walks down the long hallway toward
          the suite.  She stops by a mirror and checks her look.  Decides
          she is too uptown.  She pulls the neckline of her dress down so
          it shows more shoulder, then hitches up the hem.  Ditches the
          pearls.  Puts on some red lipstick.

          Now she doesn't look hot and elegant... just hot.  She
          practices a slinky walk, getting into the role.

          Suddenly she remembers her wedding ring.  She pulls on it.  It
          probably hasn't been off in years.  She licks her finger and     *
          twists it off.  Yoww!  She puts it on her right hand and turns   *
          the modest diamond palm-side in .  .  .  Out of site.  Then,     *
          reading the number off the key, she goes to the room and
          unlocks the door.


    233   INT. SUITE - NIGHT

          Helen comes in hesitantly.  The lights are off.  The suite is
          large and richly furnished, with a breathtaking view of the
          city.  It is the room Harry was using, posing as Renquist.  A
          FRENCH-ACCENTED VOICE comes from the next room.

                              VOICE
                    In here.

          She goes into the bedroom.  There is a dark figure sitting in
          a chair, just a silhouette.

                              MAN
                    Step into the light.

          It is a corner room.  The drapes on one side are closed,
          shadowing the man, but open on the other just enough to let in
          a slash of moonlight.  She steps forward into it.

          TIGHT CLOSE UP on the figure.  We can just make out that it is
          Harry, though Helen cannot.  TILT DOWN to show his hand, out of
          sight behind the chair-arm, as he manipulates the pause button
          on the DAT tape deck.

                              HELEN
                    I'm Michelle.  Carla's sick.  She
                    thought you might like me, so --

          Harry goes SSSSHHHH.  Silencing her gently.  He silently clicks
          off the PAUSE button.  The DAT recorder plays.  Charles Boyer,
          deep and hypnotic, speaks from Harry's outline.  Harry
          lipsynchs.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Let me do the talking.  You are                        *
                    very pretty.  You may start by                         *
                    unzipping your dress.

          PAUSE button.  She starts to yank the zipper down.               *

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    No no.  Do it slowly.  Very
                    slowly.

          Helen turns her back to him, and draws the zipper down           *
          languorously, revealing her creamy back.  She is not wearing a   *
          bra.                                                             *

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now slip the dress down...                             *
                    slowly.

          Helen is starting to get into the ritual.  She lets the dress    *
          slip off her shoulders.  It slides down her body to the floor.   *
          She steps out of it, still in high heels.                        *

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now slide the nylons off one by
                    one.

                              HELEN
                         (puzzled)
                    I'm not wearing any.

          Harry winces.  He starts the next line immediately.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    That's good.  Now the panties.                         *

          The ritual continues as she strips slowly (this will be
          tastefully done).  She conceals the bugging device in her hand
          as she sets her clothes on the bed near the phone.  Helen is
          still concentrating on her mission.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now turn, cheri, in the
                    moonlight.  Let your body flow
                    like water.

          She turns.  Her skin is beautiful in the silvery light.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now dance for me.  Go on.

          Helen has no idea what to do, but she improvises quite well.
          The scrutiny of the shadowed man, who is fully clothed, and her
          raw vulnerability are a quiveringly powerful erotic
          combination.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Let your hands be a lover's hands
                    on your own skin as you move.
                    Yes, that's it.

          TIGHT ON Harry's eyes as he studies her.  His game, meant to
          give her a dangerous fantasy, is actually turning him on
          mightily.  He is amazed to see her playing the role, getting
          into it.  This is not the Helen is thought he knew for sixteen
          years.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now, lie on the bed and close
                    your eyes.

          She does.  Harry rises and goes to her, bringing the tape deck.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Keep them closed.  Do not open
                    them.

          He sits on the bed, next to her, but without touching her.  He
          strokes her hair, lovingly.  Then runs his fingertips over her
          eyes, down her cheeks.  To her it feels delicate and delicious.
          Part of her is enjoying this a lot.  But Helen is torn between
          wanting to flee and knowing that nothing the man has done so
          far is enough to cause her to abort her mission.

                              HELEN
                    I thought you only liked to
                    watch.

          Harry goes SSSHHH.  It's all he can do.  He bends over her and
          brings his lips slowly down to her.  He touches them to hers so
          slowly that she barely knows he is kissing her.  Then he takes
          her in a passionate kiss.

          And she grabs the lamp on the bedside table and SMASHES IT OVER
          HIS HEAD.  Harry flies off onto the floor, groaning and
          semiconscious.

          Helen flips on the light and grabs her clothes, starting to
          dress rapidly.  She still doesn't recognize Harry, who is face
          down.  He groans and starts to rise.  She kicks him in the ribs
          and finishes putting her dress on.  She sticks the bug under
          the night table and grabs her shoes.  Mission accomplished,
          motherfuckers.

          Harry grabs her ankle.  She raises one shoe to kosh him again,
          and sees who it is.  Freezeframe.  Total shock.  She can't even
          form the question.

                              HELEN
                    Harry-- ?!


    234   INT. SUITE DOOR - NIGHT

          CRASH!!  The door lock is shattered by tremendous force and
          THREE MEN burst into the room.  We may recognize them as
          workers from Juno's shop.  They are wielding pistols and are
          clearly part of Malik's terrorist brigade.

          Harry is still groggy, and he doesn't want to start anything
          with Helen there, and risk her getting shot.  He acquiesces as
          they pull him to his feet.

                              HELEN
                    He's got nothing to do with this.
                    It's me you want, right?

                              HARRY
                         (to lead TERRORIST)
                    Let the hooker go.  She's not
                    important.

                              HELEN
                    Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle
                    this.

                              LEAD TERRORIST
                    Shutup, both of you.

          During this exchange, the thugs have handcuffed Harry's hands
          behind his back.  The leader gestures to one of the men to
          bring Helen along.  Helen and Harry are dragged roughly out of
          the room with pistol-muzzles stuck in their ribs.


    235   INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

          The door from the corridor bangs open and the thugs hustle
          Harry and Helen down the fire-escape stairs.

                              HELEN
                    Listen, you don't need him, he's
                    nothing.  He's a sales rep for a
                    computer company, really--

          The thug leader cuffs her across the head to shut her up.

                              HELEN
                    That was unnecessary.


    236   INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT                                      *

          A stairwell door opens and the terrorists rush Harry and Helen   *
          through the basement labyrinth.                                  *

                              HELEN
                    What were you doing there?

                              HARRY
                    You wouldn't believe me.

          A pistol muzzle is jammed hard behind Helen's ear.

                              TERRORIST LEADER
                    Talk again, I kill you.

          They are hustled across a loading dock to a RENTAL VAN waiting   *
          with the door open.  A fourth terrorist slides the van door      *
          shut after they get in and gets in behind the wheel.  The van    *
          takes off.

                                                      CUT TO:              *

    237   OMITTED                                                          *


    238   EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

          The rental van pulls up to a G-3 JET warming up outside a
          private hanger.  The van doors open and the hostages are
          brought out.  Harry sees a long black LIMO pulling up behind
          the van.  The driver, an enormous man names AKBAR, hurries to
          open the passenger door.  A slender pair of ankles emerge,
          followed by the rest of Juno Skinner, looking devastatingly
          beautiful but now quite sinister.

          To Helen it is like a living James Bond film, with the jet, the
          limo, the terrorists, and now an exotic femme fatale, dressed
          to kill, approaching them.

                              JUNO
                         (with a wry smile)
                    Hello, Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Juno.  I wish I could say it's a
                    pleasure to see you again.

                              HELEN
                    You know her?

          Juno signals with her eyes and the terrorists march the
          prisoners toward the plane.

                              JUNO
                    Who's your little friend?

                              HELEN
                    I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my
                    husband.  And you are?

                              JUNO
                         (to Harry)
                    So now it's Tasker?  Not
                    Renquist?


    239   INT. G-3 JET - NIGHT

          They enter the luxurious passenger cabin of the plane.  Helen
          has never seen anything like this.

                              HELEN
                    Look, Harry's not part of this.
                    He's just a sales rep.

                              JUNO
                    No, my dear, he is a federal
                    agent.  He killed two of my
                    colleagues the other night.

                              HELEN
                    No, you don't understand, we've
                    been married for 15 years--

                              HARRY
                    Look, Juno, this is just some
                    whacko hooker I met in the bar.

          AKBAR and the other terrorists push Helen and Harry into seats
          and strap them in.

                              HELEN
                    Harry, what's the matter with
                    you?  Tell them the truth.  We're
                    married, we have a daughter--

                              HARRY
                         (looking at Helen
                          contemptuously)
                    I don't know what this crazy
                    bitch is on.  You should just cut
                    her loose, so we can get down to
                    business.

                              HELEN
                    Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where
                    did I get this?

          Helen grabs the locket, dangling on a chain around her neck,
          and opens it to show Juno.

          THE PICTURE IN THE LOCKET -- Harry and Helen together, smiling.

          Harry roles his eyes.  Great, Helen.  A FLIGHT HOSTESS walks up
          carrying a tray.  Juno smiles graciously at Helen.

                              JUNO
                    Something before take-off?

          The hostess whips a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR off the tray and zaps
          Helen in the shoulder.

                              HELEN
                    Oooowww!!  That hurt.  You biii--

          She slumps.  Juno looks at Harry.

                              JUNO
                    She was telling the truth, wasn't
                    she Harry?  She really doesn't
                    know.  Interesting.

          Juno nods and the hostess zaps Harry.  He slides into
          unconsciousness as the plane engines begin to SCREAM.


    240   EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

          The G-3 lifts into the night sky, turning south.


    241   EXT. PIER - NIGHT

          A small FREIGHTER is tied up to a half-crumbling pier.  Next to
          the pier is a dilapidated corrugated-metal warehouse building,
          two stories high.  There are floodlights on the dock but beyond
          is black night, with the ghostly shapes of mangroves and palms.
          It is an abandoned facility on what appears to be a tiny island
          in the Caribbean.

          There is a lot of activity.  Three U-RENT TRUCKS are parked by
          the warehouse, as well as some other vehicles.  About thirty
          men, clearly CRIMSON JIHAD TERRORISTS are busy at various
          activities.  Many of them carry AK47 assault rifles.

          MALIK is supervizing them as they finish unloading a tarp-
          covered object about 15 feet high from the ship.  A rusting
          gantry crane trundles it into the warehouse.  Malik looks up as
          an AEROSPATIALE HELICOPTER thunders toward them over the black
          Caribbean water.

          The helicopter lands and Juno steps down from the front door.
          The sliding door is opened and Akbar and the others pull a
          groggy Harry and Helen out of the aircraft.  They are covered
          by hoods.

          Malik walks up to them and pulls their hoods off.  Harry takes
          in his surroundings and looks back into the eyes of Malik.
          Lethal energy flows between them.

                              MALIK
                    Who is this woman?

                              JUNO
                    His wife.

                              MALIK
                         (seeing the
                          possibilities)
                    His wife?  Good.  Bring them.


    242   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          Malik leads the entourage into the warehouse, where brilliant
          floodlights illuminate--

          THREE HUGE STONE FIGURES, lined up in the middle of the space.
          The tarp is removes from the object they just unloaded,
          revealing a FOURTH STATUE.  The figures are cracked and
          obscured by centuries, but they are unmistakably warriors
          mounted on horseback.  The legs and arms are missing on some,
          but the massive heads and necks remain.

                              JUNO
                    Incredible, aren't they?  Warrior
                    figures from the Persian Empire
                    of Darius the First, around 500
                    BC.  I call them "The Four
                    Horsemen".

          She approaches the nearest figure, caressing its flank.  A man
          with a jackhammer steps up to her.

                              JUNO
                    They're absolutely priceless.

          She shrugs and nods to the man with the jackhammer.  He blasts
          right into the body of one of the Horseman, destroying it.
          Stone fragments fall away, revealing a cavity cut with great
          precision inside the figure.

          Inside is a BRIGHT METAL CONTAINER.  Four terrorists pull it
          out and set it on the ground.  It is six feet long and coffin-
          like.  Malik steps up to it, his eyes glistening.  A hush has
          fallen over the group.

                              MALIK
                    Open it.

          The latches are released and the lid lifted.  Inside is
          machined metal object, roughly conical, about five feet long.
          Malik signals to Harry to step closer and look.

                              MALIK
                    Do you know what this is?

                              HARRY
                    Can you give me a clue?  It could
                    be a water heater for all I know.

          Malik grabs Helen, jerking her roughly forward.  He whips out
          a knife and inserts the point under Helen's jaw, forcing her
          head back and drawing blood.

                              MALIK
                    Do you know why you have been
                    brought here?

                              HELEN
                    N-no.

                              MALIK
                    So that this man can verify to
                    the world that Crimson Jihad is
                    now a nuclear power.

                              HELEN
                    How can Harry do that?  He's a
                    salesman for chrissakes.

                              MALIK
                    If we were wrong about him...
                    then the last thing you see will
                    be your blood spraying in his
                    face.

          Harry steps forward, his face grim.

                              HARRY
                    This is a Soviet MIRV-Six, from
                    an SS-22N launch vehicle.  The
                    warhead contains 14.5 kilos of
                    enriched uranium, with a
                    plutonium trigger.  The nominal
                    yield is 10 kilotons.
                         (in Arabic, subtitled)                            *
                    Release her and I'll cooperate.

          Malik lowers the knife from her jaw.  He turns away from her
          like she has ceased to exist and yells at the terrorists to
          remove the other weapons.  Jackhammers tear into the stone
          figures.

          Helen is just staring at Harry, her mouth open.  He turns to
          her, not knowing what to say.  He shrugs sheepishly.

                              HARRY
                    What can I say?  I'm a spy.

          She just looks at him for a long time.  She moves closer,
          staring and staring, letting it sink in.  Then she hauls off
          and slugs him right in the jaw so hard is almost knocks him
          down.

                              HELEN
                    You bastard!!  You lying son of
                    a bitch!!

          Terrorists grabs her and restrain her.  She starts to cry.

                              HARRY
                    I'm sorry, honey.

                              HELEN
                    Don't call me honey!  You don't
                    ever get to call me honey again.
                    You understand?!  You pig!

          Juno looks at them both and laughs.  She offers Helen a tissue.

                              JUNO
                    Here you go, dear.

          NEARBY, Akbar is going through the contents of Helen's handbag
          and Harry's wallet.  He rips open the bottom stitching and
          pulls out the geo-positioning transmitter.

                              AKBAR
                    Abu!  Look at this!                                    *

          Malik looks at the tracker and then smashes it to the floor.
          Helen looks at the crushed transmitter.  She stares at Harry
          with dawning realization.

                              HELEN
                    You bugged me?!!

          Juno cracks up at this.


    243   INT. CITATION JET - NIGHT

          The jet has become a mobile tactical-command center, with Gib,   *
          Faisil, and several other agents working out of portable         *
          equipment cases.  Faisil looks up from a computer screen         *
          suddenly.

          Gib goes up to the cockpit.  They are on approach and the
          lights of Miami fill the front window.

    244   INT. WAREHOUSE - NO NAME KEY - NIGHT

          TIGHT ON BLACK AND WHITE VIEWFINDER IMAGE of the terrorists'
          handycam.  Harry is speaking directly into the camera,
          finishing up his message.

                              HARRY
                    ...and I can verify that they
                    have the arming box and all                            *
                    equipment necessary to detonate
                    the four warheads.  This is
                    absolutely the real thing,
                    gentlemen.

          The camera swings off Harry to Malik, standing before the rest
          of the Jihad warriors, who are assembled behind the four bombs.

                              MALIK
                    You have killed our women and                          *
                    children, bombed our cities from
                    afar like cowards, and dare to
                    call us terrorists--

          Over the image of Malik, a LOW-BATTERY warning begins to flash.

          CUT TO SCENE, as Malik speaks into the camera, which is head by
          one of his men.  The CAMERAMAN is sweating, wondering if he
          should interrupt.  He gulps nervously as Malik drones on.

                              MALIK
                    -- But now the Oppressed have                          *
                    been given a mighty sword, to                          *

                    area, immediately and forever,
                    Crimson Jihad will rain fire on
                    one major US city each week until
                    these demands are met...

          BACK TO VIEWFINDER IMAGE.  BATTERY warning flashing faster.

                              MALIK
                    ... First one weapon will be
                    detonated on this uninhabited
                    island as a demonstration of

                    willingness to be humanitarian.
                    However, if there demands are not--

          In a burst of static the image GOES BLACK.

          The cameraman nervously lowers the camera, ashen faced.
          Malik's eyes are black with murder.

    245   INT. BUILDING - NIGHT

          A filthy, crumbling cinderblock building (near the warehouse).
          A few bare light bulbs with bugs zipping around then, and no
          glass in the windows.  Harry and Helen are brought in by two
          TERRORIST GUARDS.  Juno follows then into the bleak room.
          Guards shackle them to steel chairs with handcuffs.

          A MAN enters the room carrying a small suitcase.  He has skull-
          like features.  He opens the suitcase and Harry has a good view
          of the contents:  medical instruments, needle-probes, drills,
          Dremel tools with saw blades.

                              JUNO
                    This is Samir.  See if you can
                    guess his specialty.

                              HARRY
                    Oral hygiene?

                              JUNO
                    Not exactly.

                              HELEN
                         (scared)
                    What's going on, Harry?

                              JUNO
                    Samir is just going to ask Harry
                    a few questions.  See, we're not
                    even sure which agency Harry
                    works for.  Now, Samir is
                    absolutely first class, but on
                    the other hand we have Harry,
                    here, who has managed to lie
                    convincingly to the woman he
                    loves for 15 years.  So it will
                    be interesting to see how long he
                    can resist.

                              SAMIR
                         (holding up a syringe)
                    This will help.

          Samir injects Harry in the arm with the syringe.

                              HARRY
                    You know, you should swab that
                    with alcohol.  I might get an
                    infection.

                              SAMIR                                        *
                    I'll return when this has taken                        *
                    effect.  Then we'll talk.                              *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    I'm looking forward to it.                             *

          Samir exits.                                                     *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    Why are you helping these raving
                    psychotics.

                              JUNO
                    Because they're very well-funded
                    raving psychotics, and I'm
                    getting a lot of money.

          She kneels down in front of Harry, stroking his leg.

                              JUNO
                    You think I care about their                           *
                    cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.                         *
                    See, America is on top now .  .                        *
                    .  but so was Rome, once.  All                         *
                    civilizations crumble.  One
                    nation succeeding over another.
                    What does it mean in the long
                    run?  The only important thing is
                    to live well.  And...  living                          *
                    well takes money.                                      *

                              HARRY
                    You're damaged goods, lady.

          Harry's words are beginning to be slightly slurred.  The drugs
          are taking effect.

                              JUNO
                         (indicating Helen)
                    Did you tell her about us, Harry?

                              HARRY
                    There is no us, you psychotic
                    bitch.

                              JUNO
                    Sure.  Say that now.

          Juno puts her arms around him and kisses him passionately.  She
          breaks, looking at Helen to savor the effect.  Helen is
          trembling with rage.

                              JUNO
                    Thanks for everything, Harry.  It
                    was good while it lasted.

          Juno crosses to the guard and takes a hand-grenade off his
          belt.  Then she goes to Helen and places it between her knees.
          She pushes Helen's knees together to hold the spoon against the
          grenade then pulls the pin.

                              JUNO
                    Now just keep your knees
                    together, and you'll be fine.

                              HELEN
                    Something you obviously have a
                    hard time doing!

                              JUNO
                    Hold that thought.

          Juno leaves.  Harry looks dopily at Helen.

                              HARRY
                    There was nothing.  I swear.

          Helen doesn't believe him, and why should she.  She looks up     *
          from staring at the grenade, to see that Harry's head has
          slumped forward.

                              HELEN
                    What did he give you?

                              HARRY
                         (groggy)
                    Sodium amytal, maybe some other
                    truth agent.

                              HELEN
                    It makes you tell the truth?

                              HARRY
                    Yes.

                              HELEN
                    Is it working yet?

                              HARRY
                    Ask me a question I would
                    normally lie to.

                              HELEN
                    Are we going to die?

                              HARRY
                    Yup.                                                   *

                              HELEN                                        *
                    I'd say it's working.

                              HARRY                                        *
                    They'll either torture us to
                    death, shoot us in the head, or
                    leave us until the bomb goes off.

                              HELEN                                        *
                    Okay, okay.  I get it.  How long                       *
                    have you been a spy, Harry?

                              HARRY
                    17 years.

                              HELEN
                    My God.  Have you had to...  have
                    sex with other women in the line
                    of duty?

                              HARRY
                    I don't take those assignments.

                              HELEN
                    What about Juno?

                              HARRY
                    She's really a fox, isn't she?

                              HELEN
                    Did you pork her Harry?

                              HARRY
                    No.
                         (pause)
                    But I wanted to.

                              HELEN
                         (crying)
                    Are you a total lying,
                    scumsucking pig Harry?

                              HARRY
                    Looks that way.


    246   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          ON MALIK as he pokes through Harry and Helen's stuff on the
          table.  He picks up Helen's wallet and opens it.  ECU WALLET -
          a picture of Harry, Helen and Dana.  Malik stares at it a
          moment.  Then motions to one of his men.


    267   INT. TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT

          Samir lifts Harry's head and sees that he is pretty shitfaced.

                              SAMIR
                    Is there anything you would like
                    to tell me before we start?

                              HARRY
                    Yes.  I'm going to kill you
                    pretty soon.

                              SAMIR
                         (calmly preparing his
                          instruments)
                    I see.  How exactly?

                              SAMIR
                    Well, I thought I'd break your
                    neck, then use you as a human
                    shield, then kill the guard with
                    that knife there on your table
                    and take his gun.

          Samir approaches Harry with a long steel needle probe.

                              SAMIR
                         (humoring Harry)
                    And what makes you think you can
                    do all that?

                              HARRY
                    Because I picked the lock on
                    these handcuffs...

          He holds them up to show Samir.  Then he explodes out of the
          chair-- Breaks the torturer's neck-- Spins him between himself
          and the guard-- Who then hesitates to fire-- Giving Harry the
          split second he needs to grab the knife from the table and
          throw it into the guard's eye, killing him instantly.

          Helen is flat blown away.  Wow.  It only took a few seconds for
          Harry to reverse the situation.  Her Harry!  He picks up the
          guard's 9mm pistol and staggers over to her.

                              HARRY
                    Don't move.

          He kneels down in front of her.  Gently he slips his hands
          between her thighs, getting a grip on the grenade, then sliding
          his fingers slowly over the spoon to hold it securely.

          He stops moving, suddenly.  She realizes with a sudden jolt of
          terror that he has frozen.

                              HELEN
                    What is it?

                              HARRY
                         (staring transfixed)
                    God, you have great legs.

                              HELEN
                    Harry... snap out of it!

          She sees how shitfaced he is.  He holds the grenade up, gripped
          safely so the spoon can't fly off.

                              HARRY
                    Go it, baby.


    248   EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

          Harry and Helen emerge from the building, creeping through the
          shadows.  She stops him for a second.  Gets very close to him,
          whispering, crouched in the shadows.

                              HELEN
                    Tell me something before this
                    stuff wears off and you start
                    lying again.

                              HARRY
                    What?

                              HELEN
                    Do you still love me?

                              HARRY
                    Yes.

                              HELEN
                    As much as you used to?

                              HARRY
                    No.
                         (she deflates)
                    Much more.

          She looks into his eyes, and knows he is telling the truth.

                              HELEN                                        *
                         (grinning)                                        *
                    It wore off.

          At that moment, they hear yelling from the cinder-block
          building.

                              HARRY
                    They found the bodies.  Come on--


    249   EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT

          Harry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of
          the mangrove swamp.  A LIGHT HITS THEM.  TWO TERRORISTS,
          running around the corner, open fire with AK47s just as Harry
          and Helen reach a cluster of palm trees.  The trunks explode     *
          with bullet hits as they run through the darkness.               *

          As the two terrorists move through the trees, Harry lunges from  *
          the shadows and grabs one from behind.  He wrests his rifle      *
          away and swings it at the other, knocking his AK down.  The      *
          first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him, but Harry
          grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner.
          Then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two-
          hand neck-breaker-- SNAP.

          Two more run around the corner of a building.  Harry stomps his  *
          foot down on one of the AKs, which is lying across a log.  It    *
          flips into the air and he catches it in firing position .  .     *
          .  and takes them out with two well-aimed bursts.  Helen comes   *
          out of the shadows staring at Harry in amazement.  His shirt is
          ripped, he is scratched and bleeding, holding an assault rifle   *
          expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal.             *

                              HELEN
                    I married Rambo.                                       *

          He grabs her and kisses her passionately.

                              HARRY
                    Let's go.

    254   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          LOOKING DOWN FROM A CATWALK on the activity below the four
          horsemen statues and several utility trucks almost fill the
          floorspace.  A rental truck is being loaded with conventional
          weapons, including machine guns and several HAND-LAUNCHED
          STINGER MISSILES.  One of the nukes has been lowered into a pit
          cut in the concrete floor.  Malik and most of the terrorists
          are gathered around it.

          A GUARD, F.G.  on the catwalk, watches intently from the
          railing.  So intently that he doesn't head Harry sneak up on
          him.  SNAP.  Harry catches the guard's MAC-10 machine pistol
          before it can hit the floor.  He and Helen crouch behind a
          steel pillar, watching the proceedings below.  Helen keeps
          glancing at the dead guard, killed so effortlessly a moment
          before by her husband.  It is all surreal.

          BELOW, MALIK is shouting in his native language.  He pulls a
          chain from around his neck and holds up a METAL ARMING KEY.
          Then jumps down into the pit and inserts it into the warhead's
          arming computer.  Harry is listening intently, translating for
          Helen.

                              HARRY
                    In ninety minutes a pillar of                          *
                    holy fire will rise at this place                      *
                    as a sign to out enemies.                              *
                         (Malik theatrically
                          turns the arming key)
                    It is done...

          Malik jumps out of the pit.  He signals and terrorists pour
          concrete into the pit, covering the bomb.  He begins ranting
          again.

                              HARRY
                    Now no man can stop us.  We are
                    set on our course.  No force can
                    stop us...
                         (as libbing)
                    ... we're cool, we're badass,
                    blah blah.


    255   INT. WAREHOUSE - DOWN BELOW - NIGHT

          Malik raises his fist and chants some Crimson Jihad slogans.
          The terrorists echo and chant and then cheer, firing their guns
          in the air.  Harry pulls Helen back as ricochets clatter all
          over the inside of the metal building.

          Malik shouts something and all the terrorists go back to work
          at double time.  They are loading warheads Two and Three onto
          trucks (one per truck) and the last, number Four, is being
          wheeled out on a cart to the Aerospatiale outside.


    256   INT. WAREHOUSE - ON CATWALK - NIGHT

                              HELEN
                    If we're on an island, why are
                    they using trucks?

                              HARRY
                    We must be in the Florida Keys .                       *
                    .  .  the Overseas Highway                             *
                    connects the islands to the
                    mainland.

                              HELEN                                        *
                    So there's no border, no customs.                      *
                    They can just drive anywhere they                      *
                    want .  .  .  there's nothing to                       *
                    stop them .  .  .

                              HARRY
                    Just us.

                              HELEN
                    What are you going to do?

                              HARRY
                         (shrugs, like: what do
                          you think?)
                    Go down there and kill everybody,
                    I guess.

          He hands her the MAC-10.  She holds it clumsily.

                              HELEN
                    Oh shit.

                              HARRY
                    Wait here.  If you have to use
                    this, use it.  Don't choke.
                    Okay?

          She nods gamely and Harry starts down the steel stairs to the
          floor below.


    257   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

          ON HARRY, reaching the floor.  He slips behind some packing
          crates.  Then swings into action-- He hurls the grenade as hard
          as he can, down to the other end of the building.  KABOOM!!  He
          uses the distraction to move forward.  But it goes wrong almost
          right away...  A TERRORIST comes around a corner behind him,
          shouts-- Harry dives for cover as the guy fires, but-- He trips
          on a pipe and goes sprawling-- Losing the AK47, which slides
          under some equipment and-- Seven terrorists run toward him,
          with guns raised.

                              HARRY
                         (to Helen)
                    SHOOT!!


    258   INT. WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT

          HELEN fires a burst at the terrorists, actually hitting one!
          But-- The recoil knocks her back, into a metal column, and the
          gun

          FLIES OUT OF HER HANDS.
          It falls to the metal steps and hits-- Going off.  B-B-BLAM!
          The burst kills two more terrorists, and-- The Mac-10
          cartwheels and hits further down.  ANOTHER BURST.  Another
          terrorist is splattered.

          It spins and hits another step-- ANOTHER RANDOM BURST
          MIRACULOUSLY KILLS THE LAST TWO TERRORISTS!!

          She has inadvertently saved her husband.  Harry looks up from
          behind cover-- to see all seven dead.  Now it's his turn to be
          amazed.  He signals to her to run... get off the exposed
          catwalk.  She makes it through the door to the outside stairs
          as bullets start hitting the steel walls behind her.


    259   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

          A TERRORIST with a knife runs at the unarmed Harry.  Harry
          snatches up a jack-hammer and BRAT-TAT-TAT-- Drives it into the
          guy's chest.  Then he-- Grabs an AK from one of the fallen
          terrorists and opens fire.  Malik shouts to the drivers of the
          trucks to get going.  The other terrorists return fire at Harry--
          Who sprints from cover to cover, reaching a side door-- Where
          he rakes one of the passing trucks with a burst-- But
          terrorists behind him in the building have a clear shot and
          rounds hit the wall next to him as he-- Dives through the door--


    260   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          --landing outside.  He takes cover behind an aircraft REFUELING
          TRUCK.  Not a good place.  He is pinned down by automatic
          weapons fire.  He looks around for Helen, who is--


    261   EXT. WAREHOUSE - BEHIND A FORKLIFT - NIGHT

          50 yards away.  She is unarmed and unable to help.


    262   EXT. WAREHOUSE - BEHIND A REFUELING TRUCK - NIGHT

          HARRY cranks up the pump on the refueling truck and grabs the
          nozzle of the hose.  He opens the flow and-- A stream of JET-
          FUEL blasts out of the nozzle and-- Harry fires his AK right
          across the nozzle-- The muzzle-blast ignites the av-gas and he
          has a flame thrower with a 70 foot reach.

          Harry, lit demonically by the inferno, paints the whole area,
          setting vehicles afire, and scattering the terrorists.


    263   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          Through the flames and smoke he sees one of the men hand Malik
          a LAW rocket.  Malik snaps it to his shoulder, preparing to
          fire.


    264   EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

          Harry runs toward the edge of the dock thirty feet away as--
          MALIK fires.  The rocket shoots toward the truck and-- Harry
          leaps toward the dark water as-- KABOOOM!  Behind him the gas
          truck EXPLODES IN A HUGE FIREBALL.


    265   EXT. UNDERWATER - OFF THE DOCK - NIGHT

          ANGLE LOOKING UP, UNDERWATER, AS HARRY HITS THE WATER AND
          dives down.  An instant later a sheet of fire sweeps across the
          surface above him.  Harry kicks hard, trying to swim beyond the
          inferno above him so he can surface.


    266   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON HELEN, watching the burning wreckage of the gas truck.

                              HELEN
                    Oh my God.  Harry.

          A PISTOL ENTERS FRAME.  Its muzzle taps the back of her head.
          She gasps and turns to see-- JUNO, holding the weapon expertly.

                              JUNO
                    My condolences to the window.                          *

          Juno grabs her and yanks her to her feet.  Helen SLAPS JUNO      *
          HARD.  Juno has a slash across her cheek.  Blood trickles down.  *
          She grabs Helen's hand and viciously turns it, seeing the        *
          wedding ring turned inward, the diamond on the palm-side.  Her   *
          face darkens with fury and she points the gun at Helen's face,   *
          preparing to kill her .  .  .                                    *

          And Malik's hand grabs her wrist, stopping her.                  *

                              MALIK                                        *
                    Not now.  We may need a hostage.                       *

          Juno grabs her and twists her around, pushing her toward the     *
          limo nearby.                                                     *

                              JUNO
                    Let's go, Suzy Homemaker.


    267   EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

          Harry is still swimming.  He reaches the edge of the fire and
          surfaces, gasping for breath.  Treading water he scans the
          dock.


    268   EXT. WATER OF THE DOCK - HARRY'S POV - NIGHT

          Amid the fire and smoke, he sees Juno walking Helen at gun
          point toward a LIMO.


    269   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          TRACKING WITH JUNO, approaching the car.  Malik passes, jumping  *
          into the Aerospatiale with his few remaining men.  The fourth    *
          bomb is clearly visible as the sliding door is closed.  The      *
          copter pulls pitch, fanning the flames of the inferno below as   *
          it arcs away.

          AKBAR, the 300 pound terrorist/chauffeur opens the door and      *
          Juno gets into the limo with Helen.  Akbar scrunches into the
          front seat and starts the car.


    270   EXT. RAMP TO HIGHWAY - PREDAWN

          There is just enough light to see some geography.  The island
          is very tiny.  Running right over it and to the horizon in both
          directions is the OVERSEAS HIGHWAY.  The terrorists' trucks
          rumble up an on-ramp past a sign that says MIAMI - 110.  The
          limo is the last member of the convoy.  The Aerospatiale passes
          overhead, hugging the deck, headed for Miami at 150 knots.


    271   EXT. DOCK/ WAREHOUSE - DAWN

          It looks like the aftermath of a battle... burning wreckage,
          black smoke, bodies.  Not a living soul around.  The smoke
          swirls as two big BELL 206 HELICOPTERS settle on the middle of
          the dock.  GIB jumps out of the nearest with an AR-15, scanning
          the wreckage.  Several of his men, and a couple of DEA agents,
          spread out.  Gib breaks into a grin as he sees--

          HARRY, materializing out of the swirling smoke.  Dripping wet,
          clothes ripped and bloody.  But okay.

                              GIB
                    I thought this look like your
                    work.

                              HARRY
                    Let's go.  I'll brief you in the
                    air.

                              GIB
                    You're welcome.


    272   INT. BELL 206 - DAY

          Gib and Harry are working out of brief-case mobile com-units.
          Several Omega agents with headsets are reading maps, giving
          commands, coordinating the evacuation, mobilizing their own
          forces.  The energy is controlled but very high, everybody
          talking at once.  This is the day they all have trained for.
          It is impressive to watch.

                              GIB
                    --you tell the son of bitch this
                    is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat,
                    a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need
                    a patch of the White House ASAP.
                    That's right--

                              HARRY
                         (overlapping)
                    ... the Coast Guard has to clear
                    them back to a twenty mile
                    radius.  Anybody that can't make
                    the minimum safe distance we need
                    an airlift on, immediately--

          Gib whips around to Harry, lowering his headset mike.

                              GIB
                    I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers
                    here in about 12 minutes.
                    They're on maneuvers out of Boca
                    Chica.

                              HARRY
                         (checking his watch)
                    Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the
                    way in.


    273   EXT. OVERSEAS HIGHWAY - DAY

          TRAFFIC on the two causeways is almost non-existent this early
          in the morning.  The three rental trucks, followed by the limo
          about a mile back, are almost the only vehicles.


    274   INT. LIMO - DAY

          Juno has a 9mm pistol aimed at Helen.  She opens the sunroof,
          letting in the morning air and light.  Then pours herself a
          Scotch from the bar.

                              JUNO
                    Like one?

                              HELEN
                         (eyes like steel)
                    Fuck you.


    275   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          HARRY AND GIB are both talking a mile a minute, coordinating
          the evacuation of the highway and the surrounding area.

                              GIB
                    ... well get the Highway Patrol
                    to go through the streets and
                    tell everybody on their damn
                    loudspeakers.  Just the basics...
                    get away from windows, don't look
                    at it... yeah--

                              HARRY
                    Here they come.

          Gib looks out the window in time to see--

          THREE hunch-winged P.S.T.O.L.  HARRIER jets pass them at 600
          knots.

                              HARRY
                         (to the pilots)
                    Roger, Mike Three Five, you are
                    cleared to engage.  Be advised,
                    your targets have Stingers and
                    light machine guns.


    276   INT. COCKPIT OF LEAD HARRIER - DAY

          The pilot, like all jet pilots, seems icy calm.

                              PILOT
                    Copy that, Bright Boy command.
                         (to his wingman)
                    Tally ho.


    277   EXT. OVERSEAS HIGHWAY - DAY

          The terrorists see the Harriers approaching on a low attack
          run, and scramble to get out their Stingers.

          The Harriers open fire with cannons and rocket pods on the
          trucks below.  The 20mm cannons rip the ocean on either side of
          the causeway into plumes of spray.


    278   EXT. HIGHWAY - ON TRUCK - DAY

          One of the Bomb trucks is hit.  It explodes and flies off the    *
          bridge into the water.  The terrorists on one of the other
          trucks fire a Stinger missile.


    279   EXT. ABOVE HIGHWAY - ON HARRIER - DAY

          It arrows up, blowing one wing off the lead Harrier.  The pilot
          ejects as the plane cartwheels into the sea and explodes.


    280   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          Harry sees the battle far ahead... the exploding jet.

                              HARRY
                         (to the pilots)
                    Recommend you use your Mavericks                       *
                    to take out the bridge.                                *

                              PILOT (OVER)
                    They won't set off those nukes
                    will they?

                              HARRY
                    Negative, Mike Three Five.
                    That's a negative.
                         (low, to Gib)
                    Probably not.


    281   EXT. HIGHWAY/ OCEAN - DAY

          The two remaining Harriers make an attack run, launching four    *
          Maverick missiles at the bridge.                                 *


    282   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          The missiles hit the support trestles ahead of the trucks and    *
          .  .  .  K-BOOOOM!!  A whole section of the concrete span        *
          collapses into the water.


    283   EXT. HIGHWAY - TRUCKS - DAY

          The first truck is consumed in the blast.  The last truck        *
          slides to the edge of the gap and stops.                         *


    284   INT. / EXT. LIMO - DAY

          Juno is trying to see what's going on ahead.  All they can see
          is smoke and explosions.  Akbar is speaking heatedly (in
          Arabic) into a walky talky and getting no answer.

          Helen uses this moment of distraction to lunge forward,
          grabbing the gun.  Juno fires wildly as they struggle for
          control of the weapon.  The sound is deafening in the tiny
          space.  The second shot catches Akbar behind the ear, and he
          slumps forward.  His foot mashes down on the accelerator pedal
          and the car surges faster.


    285   EXT. HIGHWAY/ BATTLE SITE - DAY

          The third Harrier fires its 2.75 Rockets and blows the           *
          remaining truck into tinfoil.  Battle over.  Two bombs down.


    286   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          The columns of smoke from the battle are still a couple miles
          ahead of the copter.

                              HARRY
                    Good shooting, Mike Three Five.
                    I need you to stay on station.
                         (to the copter pilot)                             *
                    Okay.  You see that limo?


    287   INT./ EXT. LIMO - HIGHWAY - DAY                                  *

          THE LIMO tracks lazily back and forth across the lanes from one
          guardrail to the other, throwing sheets of sparks where it
          hits.  In is funneling along the causeway, unslowed, like an out-
          of-control-train.


    288   INT. LIMO - DAY

          INSIDE, Helen knocks Juno's hands against the edge of the open
          sunroof and the pistol goes flying out.

                              HELEN
                    You... bitch!!

          Helen is raging, grabbing Juno's head and pounding it against
          anything hard she can find inside the car.  Suddenly she stops,
          looking out the front window.  Juno turns too, off her look, to
          see-- ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.  The causeway is blown away
          about a quarter mile ahead.

                              JUNO
                    Shit!

          Juno climbs through the window into the front seat, tugging on
          the dead driver.  The heavyset Akbar is like a bag of cement.
          Helen look up through the sunroof and sees--


    289   EXT. ABOVE LIMO - DAY

          THE BELL 206 COPTER, descending rapidly.  Harry is climbing out
          onto the skids.  He hooks on arm and leg over the skid and
          hangs down as low as he can.  HELEN stands up in the opening
          and waves her arms.


    290   INT. / EXT. BELL COPTER/ LIMO - DAY

          Gib is yelling at the DEA pilot, who's not thrilled with this
          idea.

                              GIB
                    Get lower, goddamnit!  Right now!

          Harry strains downward with one hand.  Helen reaches up toward
          him.  The car screeches along the guard-rail, slamming against
          it, throwing her from side to side in the sunroof.  Their
          fingers touch, then separate.  She looks-- the limo is almost
          on the precipice.


    291   INT. LIMO - DAY

          INSIDE THE CAR, Juno is desperately pulling on the inert
          driver.  He slumps over on her, pinning her.  She looks over
          the dash as the shattered edge of the causeway rushes toward
          them--


    292   EXT. LIMO - DAY

          HARRY'S HAND grabs Helen's.  He pulls her out of the car just
          as the limo clears the edge.  She is jerked through the
          sunroof, screaming.  The car falls away, arcing gracefully to
          the ocean below.  It hits with an enormous explosion of water.


    293   INT. / EXT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          HARRY PULLS HELEN up onto the skid with him, getting her
          stable.  She is gasping, holding on for dear life.  She looks
          down at the ocean, the burning wreckage on the bridge, the
          whole unbelievable panorama.

          Then she looks at Harry and-- Grins.  She's alive!  And so is
          he.  And not only that, this is the biggest rush of her life.
          Harry grins back.  Surprised and pleased that she is more of a
          soul-mate than he ever knew.

                                                      CUT TO:


    294   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          ANGLE ON A HARRIER, landing in full-hover on the causeway.  The
          shriek of the jet engine is enormous.  It bounces down onto its
          wheels like a big inscect.  The other remaining Harrier is
          already down, behind it.


    295   EXT. BELL 206 - DAY

          TRACKING past burning wreckage to Harry's Bell 206 just
          settling on the highway.  B.G.  the other DEA Bell 206 is
          landing with the Harrier pilot who ejected hanging in a sling.
          Harry jumps out of the open door, followed by Helen and Gib.     *
          Harry looks at his watch.                                        *

                              HARRY
                    Any minute now.

                              GIB
                         (with a megaphone/ to
                          everybody)
                    It's show time.  Don't look at                         *
                    the flash.  Do not look at the
                    flash.

                              HARRY                                        *
                         (to Helen)                                        *
                    We're safe here.                                       *


    296   EXT. CAUSEWAY - DAY

          Helen and Harry move away from the agents.  They are safe and
          together.  They look at each other, and there is nothing to
          say.  Harry removes her wedding band from the wrong hand and     *
          slips it back onto its rightful finger.                          *

          He leans forward to kiss her.  She reaches for him.  Their lips  *
          meet.


    297   EXT. CAUSEWAY - HARRIERS IN BACKGROUND - DAY

          And they are locked together in that position when the sky
          lights up behind them.  Talk about fireworks.  Harry covers her  *
          eyes and they stay in the kiss.                                  *

          They are in no danger, but the effect is stunning.  The classic  *
          mushroom cloud appears at the horizon.  Helen watches, awed,
          the most glorious and terrifying sight of our age.

                              HELEN                                        *
                    That was some kiss.                                    *

          The two young Harrier pilots stand nearby, watching the
          mushroom disperse.  Gib is with the other Omega agents, his
          finger pressed in his ear, listening to his headset.  He waves
          to Harry to come to him.

          Harry detaches from Helen and walks over to him.  Helen watches
          him go... back to work.  She glances over at the two Harrier
          pilots.

                              HELEN
                         (to the pilots)
                    That's my husband.

          HARRY goes into the huddle with Gib and the others.

                              GIB
                    Malik's copter landed twenty
                    minutes ago in Miami.  He's on
                    the top of a high-rise downtown.
                    SWAT's on the scene, and I got
                    the cops sealing off the area.                         *
                    He renezvous'd there with about                        *
                    a dozen more faction members.                          *
                    They're barricaded on the                              *
                    twentieth floor.
                         (he gets very serious)                            *
                    Harry, they have a hostage.  It's                      *
                    Dana.                                                  *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    My Dana!?

                              GIB
                    They must have grabbed her during
                    the night... we didn't know.
                    Sorry, Harry, I--


    298   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          But Harry is already moving.  He sprints toward the nearest
          Harrier, witch is idling nearby.  Gib runs after him.

                              GIB
                    Harry!  We'll get her out!  We                         *
                    have a man inside already .  .                         *
                    .  Harry!!  Aw, shit... here we
                    go.

          Harry walks up to the young pilot...

                              HARRY
                    I need to borrow this thing for
                    a few minutes.

          He pushes past the pilot before the guy can react.

                              PILOT
                    Excuse me .  .  .  sir?!                               *

                              GIB                                          *
                    Force Comm cleared you to give us                      *
                    total cooperation, right?                              *

                              PILOT                                        *
                    Yessir, but .  .  .                                    *

                              GIB                                          *
                    That's coming right from the                           *
                    President, Captain.                                    *

                              PILOT                                        *
                    Yessir.  Uh .  .  .  sir?  You're                      *
                    going to have to sign for the                          *
                    aircraft.                                              *

                              GIB                                          *
                    I'll sign for it.  You got a pen?                      *
                         (one of the agents                                *
                          pulls out a pen)                                 *
                    Here, he'll sign for it.                               *

          Harry is in the cockpit by now.  Gib climbs up.                  *

                              GIB
                    I'd like to remind you that it
                    has been ten years since you were
                    actually in one of these.

                              HARRY
                    If I break it they can take it
                    out of my pay.


    299   INT. HARRIER - DAY

          Harry doesn't have a G-suit or a helmet of anything.  He just
          has his walky on his belt.

          INSIDE THE CRAMPED COCKPIT, Harry looks around for the lever
          which vectors the thrust.  Finds it, and sets it to 90 degrees
          (vertical).  He bangs the canopy closed and brings the throttle
          up to FULL.

                              GIB
                         (to pilot)
                    It'll be fine.  He's got hundreds
                    of hours in Harriers.  Joint-ops,
                    cross-training and all that.

                              AGENT
                    Harry can fly anything.

          The big plane wobbles off the ground like a drunken bumble-bee.

                              GIB
                    He's a little rusty.  It's like
                    riding a bicycle .  .  .  you
                    never forget.  Uh .  .  .  I'd
                    seek shelter!

          It drifts sideways and everybody runs to get out of the way.
          At about six feet above the ground it slides sideways, clips
          the top of a cop car and knocks off the light bar.  It lifts
          unsteadily straight into the sky.  It turns around 180.

                              GIB
                    He's got it.

                              HARRY
                    Sorry.

          Harry pushes the vector lever forward and the thrust-nozzles
          turn, accelerating the plane forward.


    300   EXT. CAUSEWAY - DAY

          Gib is standing, watching Harry go.  He never believes this
          guy.  Harry's voice comes over the walky...

                              HARRY
                    Tell Helen what's going on.  Tell
                    her I love her.  And ask the
                    pilot where the button for the
                    20mm cannon is-- never mind.  I
                    found it.

          The plane disappears toward Miami.


    301   EXT. HIGH RISE - MIAMI - DAY

          AN AERIAL SHOT, circling the building.  It is an unfinished
          building in the high rise district.  The Aerospatiale sits on
          the roof, its rotor turning slowly.  The street below is jammed
          with cars.  Honking horns echo up the glass canyons.


    302   EXT. STREET - DAY

          ANGLE AT STREETLEVEL as cops use bullhorns and bad attitudes to
          clear the street around the building, setting up a perimeter
          two blocks away.


    303   INT. HIGH RISE - DAY

          INSIDE THE HIGH RISE the terrorists have barricaded themselves
          on the twentieth floor.  There are 12 TERRORISTS, all with
          automatic weapons.  Occasionally one of them will fire a burst
          down a stairwell with an AK-47.  Miami-Dade SWAT team members
          are deployed in the stairwell but are keeping their distance.


    304   INT. HIGH RISE - ON THE 21ST FLOOR - DAY

          Malik is sequestered with the bomb.  It sits on the floor,
          still in its shipping case.  Dana stands nearby, looking
          scares.  She is not ties up.  Where can she go?

          She watches Malik go to the warhead and insert his arming key.
          He has a TV set up on some crates, and we see that his video-
          tapes demands are running on CNN.  Harry's face fills the
          screen, verifying the the nuclear weapons as a real threat.  He
          is identified at the bottom of the screen as HARRY TASKER,
          ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION.  Dana stares at her father's face on
          the national news.  It's like a bad dream.  She has been crying
          but she is fairly composed now.

                              DANA
                    I have to go to the bathroom.

          The terrorists ignore her.  A terrified ACTION NEWS REPORTER
          and his CAMERAMAN, under guard by TWO TERRORISTS, are hastily
          setting up to shoot Malik.
                              CAMERAMAN
                    Tape is rolling.

                              MALIK
                    This is a communique from Crimson
                    Jihad.  You have heard from your
                    own expert.  You have seen the
                    Holy fire with your own eyes.  Do
                    not force us to destroy this
                    city.  And do not try to use
                    force against us.  I can trigger
                    this bomb instantly.  All I have
                    to do is turn that key...
                         (he points fiercely at
                          the bomb)
                    ... and five million of your
                    people will die.

          The reporter glances down, nervously.

                              REPORTER
                    What key?

                              MALIK
                         (pointing like the
                          guy's blind)
                    That key right there!

          Malik looks down.  The key is gone.

                              MALIK
                         (to his men)
                    Someone has stolen the key!

          He turns, looking around wildly.  Malik then sees Dana running
          for the stairwell to the roof.  He pulls a pistol and shoots at
          her, but hits the wall as she bangs through the door.  He runs
          after her.


    305   EXT. BUILDING / ROOF - DAY

          ON THE ROOF, Malik bursts through the stairwell door.  His TWO
          MEN have followed him.  Malik stops suddenly when he sees--
          Dana standing at the edge of the roof.  She is holding the
          ARMING KEY by its chain.  Dangling it over the edge.  He
          signals to his men not to fire.

                              DANA
                         (terrified, but
                          thinking)
                    You shoot me, this'll fall.

          Malik advances slowly, his eyes glistening ferally.  She backs
          up a step with each of his, moving along the edge of the roof.
          Malik keeps his pistol aimed at her chest.

                              DANA
                    Don't come any closer.  I'll drop
                    it!  I swear to God.

                              MALIK
                    If you drop it, I will have no
                    reason not to kill you.

          He advances, calling her bluff.  She backs away from him along
          the edge.

                              MALIK
                    Come on, child.  Give me the key.
                         (smiling)
                    Don't you want to live?  I give
                    you my word.

                              DANA
                    No way you whacko.

          She reaches the corner of the building.  Her back touches
          something.  it is the boom of a small crane, used for lifting
          building supplies.  Careful to keep the key dangling over open
          space, Dana climbs up on the lattice-work boom and moves out
          beyond the edge of the building, never taking her eyes off
          Malik.  She is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking
          clearly.

          Malik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her.  He knows
          she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun.  It is a
          game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom.  Dana
          puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better.  It
          is windy and the boom is swinging.


    306   INT. 20TH FLOOR - DAY

          The Crimson Jihad warriors hear a thunderous, shrieking roar
          and look toward the window.


    307   EXT. HIGH RISE - DAY

          RISING INTO VIEW, LIKE A GARGOYLE FROM HELL, IS THE HARRIER.
          It fills the windows completely, hovering only a few feet
          outside.  The terrorists raise their AK-47s to fire just as
          Harry hits the 20mm nose-cannon.


    308   INT. / EXT. HIGH RISE - 20TH FLOOR - DAY

          Glass explodes into glittering mist, and terrorists explodes
          into bloody spray as Harry pivots the plane and the cannon
          sweeps the floor clear from side to side.  The Crimson Jihad is
          vaporized.


    309   EXT. ROOF - CRANE BOOM - DAY

          Malik hears the thunder of the jet and the firing, but from
          where he is he can't see what's going on.  He focuses on the
          key.  He must have that key.


    310   EXT. ROOF - NEAR HELICOPTER - DAY

          Malik's TWO REMAINING MEN run to the helicopter, gesticulating
          to the pilot to get ready to take off.  The pilot revs the
          turbine and the rotor whirls faster.  The two men jump in,
          picking up M-60 machine guns.


    311   EXT. ROOF - CRANE BOOM - DAY

          MALIK IS STILL ADVANCING out the crane boom.  Dana slips as she
          backs up, toppling off the boom.  She is hanging now by her
          hands over a 20 story drop.

          Malik is almost to her.  He needs a hand free to grab her.  He
          sets his gun down on the girder.  He grabs for her wrist.


    312   EXT. ROOF - OVERLOOKING EDGE - DAY

          ANGLE LOOKING DOWN.  Malik, Dana, the street far below.  With
          an unbelievable roar the Harrier sweeps in beneath Dana,
          FILLING FRAME.


    313   EXT. CRANE BOOM / OVER EDGE - DAY

          Harry has the canopy up.  Malik sees Harry, ten feet below.
          His eyes narrow with an all-consuming rage.  He glances at the
          pistol on the beam.  Back at the girl, the key in her teeth--
          So close.

          Harry maneuvers the cockpit directly under Dana.

                              HARRY
                         (shouting)
                    Let go baby!  I've got you!
                    Daddy's got you!


    314   EXT. ROOF / HARRIER - DAY

          Malik lunges for her wrist.  She screams and lets go-- Dana
          drops and hits the windshield of the hovering jet-- Harry grabs
          her with his left hand, right hand still on the stick-- He
          holds her until she can get a grip.  She is lying across the
          nose of the plane.  Harry starts to bank away and--


    315   EXT. CRANE BOOM - DAY

          Malik shrieks in rage.  He grabs his 9mm pistol and leaps off
          the crane--


    316   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          Onto the back of the plane.  He starts crawling toward the
          cockpit.  Dana screams and Harry looks back, but just then--


    317   EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          The Aerospatiale swings around the building right in front of
          them-- The door-gunner OPENS FIRE.


    318   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          Harry banks hard, taking the hits under the wing.  He pivots
          and slides sideways around the building, playing tag with the
          copter.

          He can't do anything radical enough to dislodge Malik without
          tossing off his own daughter.


    319   EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          The helicopter appears around the corner, guns blazing in the
          doors.  Harry pivots the plane and FIRES THE NOSE CANNON.  The
          helicopter is riddled.  It tilts and plummets, auto-rotating
          out of control.


    320   EXT. BUILDING - ANGLE AT STREETLEVEL - DAY

          As the copter hits the ground and explodes.  Fortunately the
          police had created a cleared perimeter.


    321   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          THE HARRIER dips and slews, half out of control.  Malik is
          taking aim with the pistol, right at Harry's head.  Harry grabs
          his daughter with his left hand, holding her with all his
          strength and he-- Jinks the stick hard, just as-- Malik opens
          fire, but-- The plane tilts wildly and Malik topples, screaming--
          He slides along the wing, and falls over the leading edge--
          Only to catch himself on the only available hand-hold-- The
          last Sidewinder missile.


    322   EXT. HARRIER / SIDEWINDER - DAY

          Harry and Malik lock eyes for one long second.  Then Harry hits
          the FIRING STUD.  The Sidewinder drops away and ignites.
          Carrying Malik out over Miami Beach.  It explodes a mile out to
          sea.


    323   INT. HARRIER - COCKPIT - DAY

          HARRY PULLS DANA into the cockpit, settling her on his lap.

                              HARRY
                    Don't touch the stick, baby.

          She stares at her father in amazement.  He banks away from the
          building, accelerating the jet.  He grins at her.  Raises one
          eyebrow.  Woggles the plane's wings.

                              HARRY
                    Hi, pumpkin.


          ONE YEAR LATER


    324   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Dinner at home, and everybody's there.  We come in on the end
          of some story that everybody thinks is hysterical.

                              HELEN
                    ... you should have seen your
                    father, standing there all
                    covered with spaghetti sauce.  He
                    looked like such a dope.

                              HARRY
                    I told the guy---
                         (snorts, it's too
                          funny)
                    I told the guy, this isn't even
                    my order.

          Dana is laughing too, a part of it.  They are happy.  They are
          a family.  Dana gets up, her meal half-eaten as usual.

                              DANA
                    I'm done.

          She heads for the front door.

                              HARRY
                    I seem to remember something
                    about a history project that's
                    due tomorrow.

                              DANA
                         ( busted)
                    Dad.  You just think you know
                    everything, don't you?

          Dana trudges off to her room to do her homework.  The phone
          rings.  Helen answers.

                              VOICE
                    Boris and Doris?

                              HELEN
                         (calmly, signalling
                          Harry with her eyes)
                    Go ahead.


    325   INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

          It is a black tie affair.  Very glitzy.  CAMERA SWOOPS over the
          guests, sipping champagne and dancing.  It is an embassy crowd,
          very international.  HARRY AND HELEN work their way through the
          crowd.  He is in tux, hair slicked back, looking rakish.  She
          is elegant in a low-cut gown and diamond choker.

          Harry scoops two glasses of champagne off a passing tray and
          hands her one.


    326   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          VERY CLOSE ON GIB, hunches in a dark van someplace nearby.  He
          speaks into his headset mike.

                              GIB
                    So, what's the scoop, team?  You
                    see your contact yet?


    327   INT. PARTY - NIGHT

          HELEN AND HARRY smile and nod as if they know people.  Speaking
          very low, Helen answer Gib via SUB-VOCAL transceiver.

                              HELEN
                    Not yet.  But we'll find him.

                              HARRY
                    Dance?

          He whirls her across the floor and the CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP
          as they dance.

                                                      FADE OUT

                            The END
TRUE ROMANCE
 

 
 

 

 


 True Romance by Quentin Tarantino When you are tired of relationships, try a romance. INT. BAR - NIGHT A smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit. CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But, you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool. CLARENCE In "Jailhouse Rock" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck about anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and leaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and he's singing, "Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care". Now, they got him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this horrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him wearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party, big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too 'cause my life depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis. Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette. LUCY I'd fuck Elvis. CLARENCE Really? LUCY When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now. CLARENCE I don't blame you. (they laugh) So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it? Lucy laughs. CLARENCE Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you? LUCY How 'bout me what? CLARENCE How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight? LUCY What are we gonna see? CLARENCE A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter". LUCY Who's Sonny Chiba? CLARENCE He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever. LUCY (not believing this) You wanna take me to a kung fu movie? CLARENCE (holding up three fingers) Three kung fu movies. Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette. LUCY (laughing) I don't think so, not my cup of tea. INT. DINGY HOTEL ROOM - DAY The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots and violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained black. On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of cocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the suitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. "Bewitched" is playing. At the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and FLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic bags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't know it listen to him. DREXL Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit. FLOYD Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit. DREXL That's bullshit. BIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl and Floyd. Walks through the door carrying hamburgers and french fries in two greasy brown-paper bags. FLOYD Naw man, that's some serious shit. DREXL Nigger, you lie like a big dog. BIG D What the fuck are you talkin' about? DREXL Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy. BIG D Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off. DREXL I heard that. FLOYD Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy? BIG D Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang. DREXL Preach on, Big D. FLOYD Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker. BIG D Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers' dicks. DREXL Heard that. Drexl and Big D bump fists. FLOYD Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny. (he takes a hit off of a joint) There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit - DREXL - Because it's good! FLOYD Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere. BIG D Drexl. On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, I'd like to express our gratitude - Drexl and Big D bust up. FLOYD Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit. BIG D So you do eat pussy! FLOYD Naw naw! BIG D You don't like it, but you eat that shit. (to Drexl) He eats it. DREXL Damn skippy. He like it, too. BIG D (mock English accent) Me thinketh he doth protest too much. FLOYD Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up! DREXL Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say? FLOYD I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!" BIG D Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast - DREXL Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do. FLOYD I'd say fuck it! Drexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd sitting all alone. Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching "Bewitched". FLOYD (yelling after them) Ain't no man have to eat pussy! BIG D (not even looking) Take that shit somewhere else. DREXL (marching back) You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it? FLOYD If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy. DREXL With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please. BIG D (glued on TV) I'm hip. DREXL In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun. Without turning away from "Bewitched" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to Drexl. DREXL (to Floyd) All right, check this out. (referring to shotgun) Now, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you. Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away. Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl. Drexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room. The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around. Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again. Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops. Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves. As he gets to the front door he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out. EXT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR - MORNING A big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a sunrise sky as a backdrop. The song "Little Bitty Tear" is heard a capella. INT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR - MORNING Cliff Worley is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently to the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In between singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a security guard uniform. EXT. TRAILER PARK - MORNING Cliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning. He pulls up to his trailer to see something that stops him short. Cliff's POV Through windshield Clarence and a nice-looking YOUNG WOMAN are watching for him in front of his trailer. CLOSEUP - CLIFF Upon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down Cliff's cheek. BACK TO: CLIFF'S POV Clarence and the Young Woman walk over to the car. Clarence sticks his face through the driver's side window. CLARENCE Good Morning, Daddy. Long time no see. INT. TRAILER HOME - MORNING All three enter the trailer home. CLIFF Excuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late. Sorry if I'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected to see this morning. Clarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room. CLARENCE Yeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people. I'm dyin' on thirst, you got anything to drink? He moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator. CLIFF I think there's a Seven-Up in there. CLARENCE (rumaging around the fridge) Anything stronger? (pause) Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you? CLIFF I can, but I don't. CLARENCE (closing the fridge) That's about all I ever eat. Cliff looks at the Girl. She smiles sweetly at him. CLIFF (to Girl) I'm sorry... I'm his father. YOUNG GIRL (sticking her hand out) That's OK, I'm his wife. (shaking his hand vigorously) Alabama Worley, pleased to meetcha. She is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman. However, that's where the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere. Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit magnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama. CLARENCE Oh yeah, we got married. (referring to the magnets) You still have these. (to Alabama) This isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one. I never shit it out, so I guess it's still there. Loverdoll, why don't you be a sport and go get us some beer. I want some beer. (to Cliff) Do you want some beer? Well, if you want some it's here. He hands her some money and his car keys. CLARENCE Go to the liquor store - (to Cliff) Where is there a liquor store around here? CLIFF Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th. CLARENCE (to Alabama) Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too? ALABAMA I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs. CLARENCE Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good. (to Cliff) What do you think would taste good? CLIFF I'm really not very - CLARENCE You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt. (to Cliff) Where's a good chicken place around here? CLIFF I really don't know. CLARENCE You don't know the chicken places around where you live? (to Alabama) Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is. He gives her some more money. CLARENCE This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie. ALABAMA Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy. She opens the door and starts out. Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts. CLARENCE Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what? CLIFF She seems very nice. CLARENCE Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk - CLIFF Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married? CLARENCE Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help. BLACK TITLE CARD: "HOLLYWOOD" INT. OUTSIDE OF CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICER - DAY FOUR YOUNG ACTORS are sitting on a couch with sheets of paper in their hands silently mouthing lines. One of the actors is DICK RITCHIE. The casting director, MARY LOUISE RAVENCROFT, steps into the waiting room, clip board in hand. RAVENCROFT Dick Ritchie? Dick pops up from the pack. DICK I'm me... I mean, that's me. RAVENCROFT Step inside. INT. CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY She sits behind a large desk. Her name-plate rests on the desktop. Several posters advertising "The Return of T.J. Hooker" hang on the wall. Dick sits in a chair, holding his sheets in his hands. RAVENCROFT Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off. (she picks a up a copy of the script) Whenever you're ready. DICK (reading and miming driving) Where'd you come from? RAVENCROFT (reading from the script lifelessly) I don't know. He just appeared as magic. DICK (reading from script) Well, don't just sit there, shoot him. She puts her script down, and smiles at him. RAVENCROFT That was very good. DICK Thank you. RAVENCROFT If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that? DICK Sure. No problem. RAVENCROFT Could we try it now? DICK Absolutely. Dick picks up the script and begins, but this time with a Brooklyn accent. DICK Where'd he come from? RAVENCROFT (monotone, as before) I don't know. He just appeared as magic. DICK Well, don't just sit there, shoot him. Ravencroft puts her script down. RAVENCROFT Well, Mr. Ritchie, I'm impressed. You're a very fine actor. Dick smiles. INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY Cliff's completely aghast. He just stares, unable to come to grips with what Clarence has told him. CLARENCE Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free. CLIFF You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this - (raising his voice) - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head! Cliff pauses and collects himself. CLIFF What do you want from me? CLARENCE What? CLIFF Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money? CLARENCE Do you still have friends on the force? CLIFF Yes, I still have friends on the force. CLARENCE Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on. (pause) Daddy? CLIFF What makes you think I could do that? CLARENCE You were a cop. CLIFF What makes you think I would do that? CLARENCE I'm your son. CLIFF You got it all worked out, don't you? CLARENCE Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems. Alabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag. ALABAMA The forager's back. CLARENCE Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it. ALABAMA I didn't get any chicken. CLARENCE How come? ALABAMA It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open. INT. TRAILER HOME - BEDROOM - DAY Cliff's on the telephone in his bedroom, pacing as he talks. The living room od the trailer can be seen from his doorway, where Clarence and Alabama are horsing around. They giggle and cut up throughout the scene. As Cliff talks, all the noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line. He's talking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force. We see both inside the conversation. CLIFF It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey. WILSON What about him? CLIFF Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale. WILSON Are you still working security for Foster & Langley? CLIFF Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it? WILSON McTeague. CLIFF I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out? WILSON I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place? CLIFF You and Robin moved? WILSON Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla. CUT TO: EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAY Clarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang. Alabama's amusing herself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background. CLIFF They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related. CLARENCE Do tell. Why drug related? CLIFF Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that. CLARENCE No shit? CLIFF Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you? CLARENCE Nope. CLIFF If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should. CLARENCE Who is he? CLIFF Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake. CLARENCE That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me? CLIFF Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it. Clarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it. CLARENCE Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me. CLIFF I got some money I can give you - CLARENCE Keep it. CLIFF Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple. CLARENCE We do make a cute couple, don't we? CLIFF Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around. (pause) I love you son. They hug each other, Clarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand. CLARENCE This is Dick's number in Hollywood. We don't know where we'll be, but you can get a hold of me through him. Clarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her. CLARENCE Bama, we're outta here. Kiss Pops goodbye, Alabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff and gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's bubbling like a Fresca. ALABAMA Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon. CLARENCE (mock anger) What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that? ALABAMA Oh, hush up. The two get into the Mustang. CLARENCE (to Cliff) We'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood. Clarence starts the engine. The convertible roof opens as they talk. CLIFF Bama, you take care of that one for me. Keep him out of trouble. ALABAMA Don't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin' this fella on a short leash. Clarence, slowly, starts driving away. CLARENCE (to Cliff) As the sun sets slowly in the west we bid a fond farewell to all the friends we've made... and, with a touch of melancholy, we look forward to the time when we will all be together again. Clarence peels out, shooting a shower of gravel up in the air. As the Mustang disappears Cliff runs his tongue over his lips. CLIFF The-son-of-a-bitch was right... she does taste like a peach. INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY Dick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor. Things are pretty neat and clean. A nice stereo unit sits on the shelf. A framed picture of a ballet dancer's feet hangs on the wall. The phone rings, Dick answers. DICK Hi, Dick here. INT. HOTEL SUITE - LAS VEGAS - SUNSET Top floor, Las Vegas, Nevada hotel room with a huge picture window overlooking the neon-filled strip and the flaming red and orange sunset sky. Clarence paces up and down with the telephone in his hand. CLARENCE (big bopper voice) Heeeellllloooo baaaabbbbbyyyy!!! Note: We intercut both sides of the conversation. DICK (unsure) Clarence? CLARENCE You got it. DICK It's great to hear from you. CLARENCE Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly. DICK You comin' to L.A.? When? CLARENCE Tomorrow. DICK What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit? Clarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama, wearing only a long T-shirt with a big picture of Bullwinkle on it, crawls behind him. CLARENCE Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me. DICK Get the fuck outta here! CLARENCE I'm a married man. DICK Get the fuck outta here! CLARENCE Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half? Before Dick can respond Clarence puts Alabama on the phone. ALABAMA Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley. DICK Hello, Alabama. ALABAMA I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too. Clarence start dictating to her what to say. CLARENCE Tell him we gotta go. ALABAMA Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it. DICK What? CLARENCE Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow. ALABAMA He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow. DICK Wait a minute - CLARENCE Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there. ALABAMA Don't eat anything. DICK Alabama, could you tell Clar - CLARENCE Ask him if he got the letter. ALABAMA Did you get the letter? DICK What letter? ALABAMA (to Clarence) What letter? CLARENCE The letter I sent. ALABAMA (to Dick) The letter he sent. DICK Clarence sent a letter? CLARENCE Has he gotten his mail today? ALABAMA Gotten your mail yet? DICK Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV. ALABAMA (to Clarence) Yes. CLARENCE Has he looked through it yet? ALABAMA (to Dick) Ya looked through it? DICK Not yet. ALABAMA (to Clarence) Nope. CLARENCE Tell him to look through it. ALABAMA (to Dick) Get it. DICK Let me speak to Clarence. ALABAMA (to Clarence) He wants to speak with you. CLARENCE No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over. ALABAMA (to Dick) He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over. DICK Money problems? CLARENCE Now tell him goodbye. ALABAMA Bye-bye. CLARENCE Now hang up. She hangs up the phone. INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY Dick hears the click on the other end. DICK Hello, hello, Clarence? Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama... hello? Extremely confused, Dick jangs up the phone. He goes over to the TV and picks up the day's mail. He goes through it. BILL: Southern California Gas Company. BILL: Group W. BILL: Fossenkemp Photography. BILL: Columbia Record and Tape Club. LETTER: It's obviously from Clarence. Addressed to Dick. Dick opens it. EXT. TRAILER - DAY A lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in front of it in the shape of a planet. A big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly less kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a fast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer. INT. TRAILER - DAY He steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to his temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder. GUN CARRIER (DARIO) Welcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party. Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men, standing: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy), and Tooth-pick Vic (a fireplug pitbull type). Sitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid mob leader Blue Lou Boyle. Cliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario and Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair. COCCOTTI (to Frankie) Tell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what. In Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits. Cliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff. Frankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his hand, but he has yet to touch a drop. COCCOTTI Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley? CLIFF I give up. Who are you? COCCOTTI I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct? CLIFF I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle. COCCOTTI I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine. (taking out a pack of Chesterfields) Want a Chesterfield? CLIFF No. COCCOTTI (as he lights up) I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice. CLIFF Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence - Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with his fist. COCCOTTI Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got that pain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It ain't any kind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's ever gonna get, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors. They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in front of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your son? Cliff's defeated. CLIFF I've seen him. COCCOTTI Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead. CLIFF What are you talkin' about? COCCOTTI I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks. CLIFF I don't believe you. COCCOTTI That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go? CLIFF On their honeymoon. COCCOTTI I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go? CLIFF They didn't tell me. Coccotti looks at him. CLIFF Now, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years. Yesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me he needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could borrow five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a check. We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me God. They never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never thought to ask. Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil, quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal on the wound. Cliff screams. Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield. Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in the car. Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm in agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand. COCCOTTI Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my old man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from growin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen different things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has seventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen. And if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to hell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna show me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know where they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away from. The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart. He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes. CLIFF Could I have one of those Chesterfields now? COCCOTTI Sure. Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke. CLIFF Got a match? Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter. CLIFF Oh, don't bother. I got one. (he lights the cigarette) So you're a Sicilian, huh? COCCOTTI (intensly) Uh-huh. CLIFF You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers. All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what he's hearing. COCCOTTI Come again? CLIFF It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'? Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic, grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets through Cliff's head. He pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon, and turns to his men. COCCOTTI I haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity in fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this comedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me where that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this fucked-up family for good. Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was all about. Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer. When he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic banana magnet that says: "Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and address)". LENNY Boss, get ready to get happy. TITLE CARD: "CLARENCE AND ALABAMA HIT L.A." INT. DICK'S APARTMENT- MORNING Dick's asleep in a recliner. He's wearing his clothes from the night before. His room-mate FLOYD is lying on the sofa watching TV. The sound of our hands knocking on his door wakes Dick up. He shakes the bats out of his belfry, opens the door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles standing in his doorway. Clarence and Alabama immediately start singing "Hello My Baby" like the frog in the old Chuck Jones cartoon. CLARENCE/ALABAMA Hello my baby, Hello my honey, Hello my ragtime gal - DICK Hi guys. Alabama throws her arms around Dick, and gives him a quick kiss. After she breaks, Clarence does the same. Clarence and Alabama walk right past Dick and into his apartment. CLARENCE Wow. Neat place. INT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND - DAY The Pink's employees work like skilled Benihana chefs as they assemble the ultimate masterpiece hot-dog. EXT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND - PATIO - DAY Clarence, Alabama, and Dick are sitting at an outdoor table chowing down on chili dogs. Alabama is in the middle of a story. ALABAMA ... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go. CLARENCE And here we are. DICK That's a pretty amazing story. CLARENCE Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here? DICK Just like in Detroit, only skinnier. CLARENCE You goin' out? DICK Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class. CLARENCE Good for you. DICK What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day. ALABAMA You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"? DICK Knock wood. He knocks the table and then looks at it. DICK ... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me. CLARENCE Did you meet Captain Kirk? DICK You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope. ALABAMA (finishing her hot-dog) That was so good I am gonna have another. DICK You can't have just one. Alabama leaves to get another hot-dog. Clarence never takes his eyes off her. DICK How much of that letter was on the up and up? CLARENCE Every word of it. Dick sees where Clarence's attention is. DICK You're really in love, aren't you? CLARENCE For the very first time in my life. (pause) Do you know what that's like? Clarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer. DICK (regretfully) No, I don't (he looks at Alabama) How did you two meet? Clarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his Hebrew cream soda. CLARENCE Do you remember The Lyric? INT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT Sonny Chiba, as "Streetfighter" Terry Surki, drives into a group of guys, fists and feet flying and whips ass on the silver screen. Clarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of him, nibbling on popcorn, eyes big as sourcers, and a big smile on his face. EXT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT A cab pulls up to the outside of The Lyric. The marquee carries the names of the triple feature: "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter" and "Sister Streetfighter". Alabama steps out of the taxi cab and walks up to the box office. A box office girl reading comic looks at her. ALABAMA One please. BOX OFFICE GIRL Ninety-nine cents. ALABAMA Which one is on now? BOX OFFICE GIRL "Return of the Streetfighter". It's been on about forty-five minutes. INT. THE LYRIC THEATER - LOBBY - NIGHT Alabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the concession stand. A young usher takes care of her. ALABAMA Can I have a medium popcorn? A super-large Mr. Pibb, and a box of Goobers. INT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT It's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny Chiba taking on all-comers. Alabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food. She makes a quick scan of the theater. Not many people are there. She makes a beeline for the front whick happens to be Clarence's area of choice. She picks the row of seats just behind Clarence and starts asking her way down it. Clarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone moving towards him. He turns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious. When Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine bottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn over Clarence. ALABAMA Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK? CLARENCE Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt. ALABAMA I'm the clumsiest person in the world. CLARENCE (picking popcorn out of his hair) It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen. ALABAMA (picking popcorn out of his hair) What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick. Alabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie. Clarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't easy, and get back into the movie. They both watch the screen for a moment. Then, Alabama leans forward and taps Clarence on the shoulder. ALABAMA Excuse me... I hate to bother you again. Would you mind too terribly filling me in on what I missed? Jumping on this opportunity. CLARENCE Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba. ALABAMA The oriental. CLARENCE The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him. ALABAMA Want some Goobers? CLARENCE Thanks a lot. ALABAMA I thought Sonny was the good guy. CLARENCE He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up. They both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses. TIME CUT: On the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies lie all around him. THE END (in Japanese) flashes on the screen. The theater light go up. Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence. They're both applauding. ALABAMA Great movie. Action-packed! CLARENCE Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass? ALABAMA Sonny kicks ass. CLARENCE You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R. ALABAMA If that was the R, I'd love to see the X. CLARENCE My name is Clarence, and what is yours? ALABAMA Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya. CLARENCE Is that your real name? Really? ALABAMA That's my real name, really. I got proof. See. She shows Clarence her driver's license. CLARENCE Well, cut my legs off and call me Shorty. That's a pretty original moniker there, Alabama. Sounds like a Pam Grier movie. (announcer voice) She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist, and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier! Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge! EXT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT Clarence and Alabama are outside the theater. With the marquee lit up in the background they both perform unskilled martial arts moves. Clarence and Alabama break up laughing. CLARENCE Where's your car? I'll walk you to it. ALABAMA I took a cab. CLARENCE You took a cab to see three kung fu movies? ALABAMA Sure. Why not? CLARENCE Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart. ALABAMA What time is it? CLARENCE 'Bout twelve. ALABAMA I suppose you gotta get up early, huh? CLARENCE No. Not particularly. (pause) How come? ALABAMA Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie? CLARENCE I love to get pie after a movie. ALABAMA Would you like to get some pie? CLARENCE I'd love some pie. INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT Clarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's. It's about 12:40 a.m. Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke. Alabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab. CLARENCE Well, enough about the King. How about you? ALABAMA How 'bout me what? CLARENCE Tell me about yourself. ALABAMA There's nothing to tell. CLARENCE C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady? ALABAMA What do you want to know? CLARENCE Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me? Alabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence. ALABAMA Ask me them again. One by one. CLARENCE What do you do? ALABAMA I don't remember. CLARENCE Where are you from. ALABAMA Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet. CLARENCE What's your favorite color? ALABAMA I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black. CLARENCE What's your favorite movie star? ALABAMA Burt Reynolds. CLARENCE Would you like a bite of my pie? ALABAMA Yes, I would. Clarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off. CLARENCE Like it? ALABAMA Very much. Now, where were we? CLARENCE What kinda music do you like? ALABAMA Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel". CLARENCE What are your turn-ons? ALABAMA Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie. CLARENCE Turn-offs? ALABAMA I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians. CLARENCE Do you have a fella? She looks at Clarence and smiles. ALABAMA I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later. CLARENCE What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? ALABAMA Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out. CLARENCE And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me? ALABAMA Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you. Clarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until it makes that slurping sound. He puts it aside and stares into her soul. A smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin. ALABAMA Aren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy? (eats her last piece of pie) Where to next? INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT It's about 1:30 a.m. Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works. It's a comic book store called Heroes For Sale. Alabama thinks this place is super-cool. ALABAMA Wow. What a swell place to work. CLARENCE Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music. ALABAMA How long have you worked here? CLARENCE Almost four years. ALABAMA That's a long time. CLARENCE I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day. ALABAMA Do you get paid a lot? CLARENCE That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like? ALABAMA You bet. How much is that worth? Clarence gets a box off the shelf. CLARENCE Four hundred bucks. ALABAMA I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books. CLARENCE Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here. She holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman. ALABAMA What's that? CLARENCE That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine. He pulls a plastic-cased "Spiderman" comic form the box. CLARENCE "Spiderman", number one. The one that started it all. Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama. ALABAMA God, Spiderman looks different. CLARENCE He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time. He pulls out another comic. CLARENCE "Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos". One of the coolest series known to man. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about four bucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap. (he opens one up) Just look at that artwork, will ya. Great stories. Great Characters. Look at this one. We see the "Sgt. Fury" panels. CLARENCE Nick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on a chain. OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on a ship. He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain and the ring goes overboard too. So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it. Isn't that cool? She's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and meets her gaze. CLARENCE Alabama, I'd like you to have this. Clarence hands her the "Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos" comic book that he loves so much. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT Clarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis, anything you can imagine. The two walk through the door. ALABAMA What a cool room! She runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed. Later. Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album. Clarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders. ALABAMA Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then? CLARENCE Five. She turns the page. ALABAMA Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis. CLARENCE I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up. LATER - LIVING ROOM Clarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's "Piece of My Heart". CLARENCE You know when you sat behind me? ALABAMA At the movies? CLARENCE Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her. ALABAMA What would make you think that? CLARENCE I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid. ALABAMA You're not stupid. Just wrong. They move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the song. ALABAMA I love Janis. CLARENCE You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died. ALABAMA She OD'd, didn't she? CLARENCE Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took. ALABAMA You mean she got a bad batch? CLARENCE That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire. ALABAMA So he really loved her? CLARENCE Uh-huh. They kiss. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY It's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks around, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a robe and investigates. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Alabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair crying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself. CLARENCE What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do? ALABAMA You didn't do nothing. CLARENCE Did you hurt yourself? (he takes her foot) Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack? ALABAMA Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there. CLARENCE What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off. ALABAMA I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl. Pause. CLARENCE You're a whore? ALABAMA I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know. (pause) I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place. CLARENCE "Heroes For Sale"? ALABAMA Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you. CLARENCE Who? ALABAMA I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day. CLARENCE That dazzling imagination. ALABAMA It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself." CLARENCE Who and what is a Drexl? ALABAMA My pimp. CLARENCE You have a pimp? ALABAMA Uh-huh. CLARENCE A real live pimp? ALABAMA Uh-huh. CLARENCE Is he black? ALABAMA He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying. CLARENCE Is he nice? ALABAMA Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day. CLARENCE What did he do to Arlene? ALABAMA Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary. CLARENCE This motherfucker sounds charming! Clarence is on his feet, furious. CLARENCE Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place? ALABAMA At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date. CLARENCE Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me? ALABAMA What? CLARENCE Will you be my wife? When Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks. ALABAMA Yes. CLARENCE (a little surprised) You will? ALABAMA You better not be fucking teasing me. CLARENCE You better not be fuckin' teasin' me. They seal it with a kiss. LATER - THAT NIGHT CLOSEUP - Alabama's wedding ring. The newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching TV. The movie they're watching is "The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine". Alabama watches the screen, but every so often she looks down to admre the ring on her hand. CLARENCE Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"? ALABAMA I don't believe so. CLARENCE Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer. We hear, off screen, the TV Announcer say: TV ANNOUNCER (off) We'll return to Jimmy Wang Yu in... "The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine", tonight's eight o'clock movie, after these important messages... Clarence looks at the TV. He feels the warmth of Alabama's hand holding his. We see commercials playing. He turns in her direction. She's absent-mindedly looking at her wedding ring. He smiles and turns back to the TV. More commercials. Dolly close on Clarence's face FLASH ON: Alabama, right after he proposed. ALABAMA You better not be fucking teasing me. FLASH ON: In a cute, all-night wedding chapel. Clarence dressed in a rented tuxedo and Alabama in a rented white wedding gown. ALABAMA I do. CLARENCE Thank you. FLASH ON: Clarence and Alabama, dressed in tux and gown, doing a lover's waltz on a ballroom dance floor. FLASH ON: Clarence and Alabama in a taxi cab. CLARENCE Hello, Mrs. Worley. ALABAMA How do you do, Mr. Worley? CLARENCE Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley. ALABAMA Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today? CLARENCE Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley. ALABAMA Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley? Moving on top of her. CLARENCE Not for me. He starts kissing her and moving her down on the seat. She resists. ALABAMA (playfully) No no no no no no no no no... CLARENCE (playfully) Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes... FLASH ON: A big mean-looking black man in pimp's clothes. PIMP Bitch, you better git yo ass back on the street an' git me my money. Pimp on street corner with his arm around Alabama, giving her a sales pitch to a potential customer. PIMP I'm tellin' you, my man, this bitch is fine. This girl's a freak! You can fuck 'er in the ass, fuck 'er in the mouth. Rough stuff, too. She's a freak for it. Jus' try not to fuck 'er up for life. FLASH ON: Pimp beating Alabama. PIMP You holdin' out on me, girl? Bitch, you never learn! FLASH ON: Alabama passionately kissing the uninterested pimp. PIMP Hang it up, momma. I got no time for this bullshit. BACK TO: TV showing kung fu film. BACK TO: Clarence's face. There's definitely something different about his eyes. Clarence springs off the couch and goes into his bedroom. Alabama's startled by his sudden movement. ALABAMA (yelling after him) Where you goin', honey? CLARENCE (off) I just gotta get somethin'. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT Clarence splashes water on his face, trying to wash away the images that keep polluting his mind. Then, he hears a familiar voice. FAMILIAR VOICE (off) Well? Can you live with it? Clarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to Elvis Presley. Clarence isn't surprised to see him. CLARENCE What? ELVIS Can you live with it? CLARENCE Live with what? ELVIS With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted? CLARENCE Yeah. ELVIS You wanna get unhaunted? CLARENCE Yeah. ELVIS Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs. CLARENCE I can't believe what you're tellin' me. ELVIS I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do. CLARENCE You'd really do that? ELVIS He don't got no right to live. CLARENCE Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life. ELVIS I don't blame you. CLARENCE If I thought I could get away with it - ELVIS Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it. Clarence looks at Elvis. ELVIS Clarence, I like ya. Always have, always will. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT CLOSEUP - A snub-nosed .38, which Clarence loads and sticks down his heavy athletic sock. INT. CALRENCE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Clarence returns. CLARENCE Sweetheart, write down your former address. ALABAMA What? CLARENCE Write down Drexl's address. ALABAMA Why? CLARENCE So I can go over there and pick up your things. ALABAMA (really scared) No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there. He kneels down before her and holds her hand. CLARENCE Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it? ALABAMA You don't know him - CLARENCE You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address. TITLE CARD: "CASS QUARTER, HEART OF DETROIT" EXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREET - NIGHT It's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his red Mustang. He's right smack dab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime. He checks the pulse on his neck; it's beating like a race horse. To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis Presley gyration. CLARENCE (in Elvis voice) Yeah... Yeah... He makes a beeline for the front door of a large, dark apartment building. INT. DARK BUILDING - NIGHT He's inside. His heart's really racing now. He has the TV guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand. He climbs a flight of stairs and makes his way down a dark hallway to apartment 22, the residence of Drexl Spivey. Clarence knock on the door. A Young Black Man, about twenty years old, answers the door. He has really big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey. YOUNG BLACK MAN You want somethin'? CLARENCE Drexl? YOUNG BLACK MAN Naw, man, I'm Marty. Watcha want? CLARENCE I gotta talk to Drexl. MARTY Well, what the fuck you wanna tell him? CLARENCE It's about Alabama. A figure jumps in the doorway wearing a yellow Farah Fawcett T-shirt. It's our friend, Drexl Spivey. DREXL Where the fuck is that bitch? CLARENCE She's with me. DREXL Who the fuck are you? CLARENCE I'm her husband. DREXL Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in. INT. DREXL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Drexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation they were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway. This is not the confrontation Clarence expected. He trails in behind Drexl and Marty. DREXL (to Marty) What was I sayin'? MARTY Rock whores. DREXL You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips. Drexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence. DREXL (to Clarence) You know what I'm talkin' about. Drexl gestures to one of the three stoned Hookers lounging about the apartment. DREXL (to Marty) These bitches over here ain't shit. You stomp them bitches to death to get the kind of pussy I'm talkin' about. Drexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-out boxes of Chinese food. A black exploitation movie is playing on TV. DREXL Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up. MARTY Pussy love pink rocks. This is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he expected Drexl to be like. He positions himself in front of the food table, demanding Drexl's attention. DREXL (eating with chopsticks, to Clarence) Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know. CLARENCE No thanks. DREXL No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties. Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table. CLARENCE I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' 'cause I'm not stayin'. I'm not lookin' at the movie 'cause I saw it seven years ago. It's "The Mack" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by Bobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama Releasing Company in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In that envelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener pastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter. I don't like to dicker. I never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's in that envelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that much. Not one penny more, not one penny more. You could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full alert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl. Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty. DREXL It's empty. Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, "That's right, asshole." Silence. DREXL Oooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we got here? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be? Mr. Majestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't got no hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand - Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at Clarence, catching him of guard. Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting him in a tight choke hold. Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus. We'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys. All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold records, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs. Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence. Since Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face. Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about it. DREXL Ya wanna fuck with me? (hits Clarence) Ya wanna fuck with me? (hits Clarence) I'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit! He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists. Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs his nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and starts twisting. Marty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip aroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of his head. Drexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's thumb. Clarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and busting his nose. Marty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets up on his knees. Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are going at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping them coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other because of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight. Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of LPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to his feet. Drexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls. Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up into a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes. Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails. Marty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt. DREXL (to Marty) You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he? MARTY Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright. Drexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting. DREXL (to Clarence) You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy. (to Marty) I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty. (laughing) He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it? MARTY (laughing) Naw, man, it ain't white boy day. DREXL (to Clarence) Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day. CLARENCE (hurting) Wannabee nigger... DREXL Fuck you! My mother was Apache. Drexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up. Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket. Clarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down. Drexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license. DREXL Well, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost like a nigger name. (to Clarence) Hey, dummy. He puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up. DREXL Before you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I just chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're some macho motherfucker, I know who she's with. You. I know who you are, Clarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th street, apartment 48. And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same address. Marty, take the car and go get 'er. Bring her dumb ass back here. He hands Marty the driver's license. Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket. DREXL (to Marty) I'll keep lover boy here entertained. (to Clarence) You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience. (hollering to Marty) Marty, what the fuck are you doin'? MARTY (off) I'm tryin' to find my jacket. DREXL Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately. While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock and pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's standing over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger and blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face. Drexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground. MARTY (off) What's happening? Marty steps into the room. Clarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest. Two of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming. The other Hooker is curled up in the corner. She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to be terrified. Drexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his balls and his dick. Clarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker. CLARENCE Get a bag and put Alabama's thing in it! She doesn't move. CLARENCE You wanna get shot? I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it! The Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the bed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence. Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like a pillbug. CLOSEUP - Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand. Clarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest. CLARENCE (to Drexl) Open you eyes, laughing boy. He doesn't. Clarence gives him a kick. CLARENCE Open your eyes! He does. It's now Drexl's POV from the floor. CLARENCE You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you? He fires. CLOSEUP - The bullet comes out of the gun and heads right toward us. When it reaches us, the screen goes awash in red. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The front swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama jumps off the couch and runs toward Clarence, before she reaches him he blurts out: CLARENCE I killed him. She stops short. CLARENCE I've got some food in the car, I'll be right back. Clarence leaves. Except for the TV playing, the room is quiet. Alabama sits on the couch. Clarence walks back into the room with a whole bounty of take-out food. He heaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down. CLARENCE Help yourself. I got enough. I am fuckin' starvin'. I think I ordered one of everythin'. He stops and looks at here. CLARENCE I am so hungry. He starts eating french fries and hamburgers. ALABAMA (in a daze) Was it him or you? CLARENCE Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did. ALABAMA Is this a joke? CLARENCE No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good. Alabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignoring her. CLARENCE Come on, Bama, eat something. You'll feel better. She continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her. Finally he spins on her, yelling: CLARENCE Why are you crying? He's not worth one of your tears. Would you rather it had been me? Do you love him? (no answer) Do you love him? (no answer) Do you love him? She looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a word out. ALABAMA I think what you did was... CLARENCE What? ALABAMA I think what you did... CLARENCE What? ALABAMA ... was so romantic. Clarence is completely taken back. They meet in a long, passionate lovers' kiss. Their kiss breaks and slowly the world comes back to normal. CLARENCE I gotta get outta these clothes. He picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in front of them. ALABAMA (comically) Clean clothes. There is a god, Clarence flips open the suitcase. Alabama's and her husband's jaws drop. ALABAMA Clarence. Those aren't my clothes. CUT TO: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - DAY We see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign. Pan to the parking lot where Clarence's empty red Mustang is parked. INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CALRENCE'S ROOM - DAY CLOSEUP - Dick's jaw drops. His hand reaches out of shot. CLOSEUP - The reason for all the jaw dropping... the suitcase is full of cocaine! Clarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine. Alabama's watching the cable TV. DICK Holy Mary, Mother of God. ALABAMA This is great, we got cable. CLARENCE (to Alabama) Bama, you got your blade? Keeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out from her purse a Swiss army knife with a tiny dinosaur on it and tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the corkscrew and opens the wine. He pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a little one for himself. He hands it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks. DICK This shit can't be real. CLARENCE It'll get ya high. He tosses the knife. CLARENCE Do you want some wine, sweetheart? ALABAMA Nope. I'm not really a wine gal. Using the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine. He jumps back. DICK It's fuckin' real! (to Clarence) It's fuckin' real! CLARENCE I certainly hope so. DICK You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man! CLARENCE I know. DICK Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got? CLARENCE Tell me. DICK I don't know! A fuckin' lot! He downs his wine. Clarence fills his glass. DICK This is Drexl's coke? CLARENCE Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers? DICK Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine. Dick gulps half of his wine. Clarence fills up. CLARENCE But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set. DICK Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time - CLARENCE No way! The whole enchilada in one shot. DICK Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be? CLARENCE I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be? DICK It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you. CLARENCE Is he big league? DICK He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it. CLARENCE What'd'ya tell 'em? DICK Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't. CLARENCE What's this acting class guy's name? DICK Elliot. CLARENCE Elliot what? DICK Elliot Blitzer. CLARENCE OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff. DICK Where? CLARENCE (to Alabama) The zoo. CLARENCE (to Dick) The zoo. (pause) What are you waiting for? DICK Would you just shut up a minute and let me think? CLARENCE What's to think about? DICK Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy. CLARENCE Two guys. DICK Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit. CLARENCE Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'. Dick rests his head in his hands. CLARENCE Look, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need you to rise to the occasion. So, drink some more wine. Get used to the idea, and get your friend to the phone. EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - DAY CLOSEUP - A black panther, the four-legged kind, paces back and forth. Clarence, Alabama, Dick and Elliot Blitzer are walking through the zoo. One look at Elliot and you can see what type of actor he is, a real GQ, blow-dry boy. As they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal crackers and Alabama is blowing soap bubbles. ELLIOT So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading - CLARENCE Want an animal cracker? ELLIOT Yeah, OK. He takes one. CLARENCE Leave the gorillas. ELLIOT - that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars - CLARENCE Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime. DICK (trying to chill him out) Clarence... ELLIOT Where did you get it? CLARENCE I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street. ELLIOT (forcing a laugh) Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from? CLARENCE Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste - ELLIOT (turning to Dick) Look, Dick, I don't - CLARENCE (laughing) No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department. ELLIOT What department? CLARENCE What do you think, eightball? ELLIOT The police department? CLARENCE Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust. ELLIOT He trusts you? CLARENCE We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'. ELLIOT Sure. I didn't hear anything. Elliot is more than satisfied. Clarence makes a comical face at Dick when Elliot's not looking. Dick is wearing I-don't-believe-this-guy expresion. Alabama is forever blowing bubbles. CUT TO: EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY We're in the snack bar area of the zoo. Alabama, Dick, and Elliot are sitting around a plastic outdoor table. Clarence is pacing around the table as he talks. Alabama is still blowing bubbles. CLARENCE (to Elliot) Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream? Elliot hasn't the slightest idea what that is supposed to mean. ELLIOT What? CLARENCE Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream? ELLIOT (with conviction) No. No, you don't. CLARENCE Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me? DICK Clarence... CLARENCE (to Dick) Let me handle this. ELLIOT Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe. CLARENCE Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts. Elliot has been silenced. He nods his head in agreement. INT. PORSCHE - MOVING - MULHOLLAND DRIVE - DAY Movie producer, Lee Donowitz, is driving his Porsche through the winding Hollywood hills, just enjoying being rich and powerful. His cellular car phone rings, he answers. LEE Hello. (pause) Elliot, it's Sunday. Why am I talkin' to you on Sunday? I don't see enough of you during the week I gotta talk to you on Sunday? Why is it you always call me when I'm on the windiest street in L.A.? BACK TO: ELLIOT Elliot is on the zoo payphone. Clarence is next to him. Dick is next to Clarence. Alabama is next to Dick, blowing bubbles. ELLIOT (on phone) I'm with that party you wanted me to get together with. Do you know what I'm talking about, Lee? BACK TO: LEE Store-fronts whiz by in the background. LEE Why the hell are you calling my phone to talk about that? BACK TO: ELLIOT ELLIOT Well, he'd here right now, and he insists on talking to you. BACK TO: LEE In the 7th street tunnel. Lee's voice echoes. LEE Are you outta your fuckin' mind? BACK TO: ELLIOT ELLIOT You said if I didn't get you on the - Clarence takes the receiverout of Elliot's hand. CLARENCE (into phone) Hello, Lee, it's Clarence. At last we meet. EXT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY Virgil's knocking on Dick's door. Floyd (Dick's room-mate) answers. VIRGIL Hello, is Dick Ritchie here? FLOYD Naw, he ain't home right now. VIRGIL Do you live here? FLOYD Yeah, I live here. VIRGIL Sorta room-mates? FLOYD Exactly room-mates. VIRGIL Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here? FLOYD Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn. VIRGIL How do you know? You been there? FLOYD No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember. VIRGIL You're right. It is. EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - PAYPHONE - DAY Clarence is still on the phone with Lee. CLARENCE Lee, the reason I'm talkin' with you is I want to open "Doctor Zhivago" in L.A. And I want you to distribute it. BACK TO: LEE Stopped in the traffic on Sunset Boulevard. LEE I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie. BACK TO: CLARENCE The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot. BACK TO: LEE He's still on Sunset Boulevard, the traffic's moving better now. LEE I'm not sayin' I'm not interested. But being a distributer's not what I'm all about. I'm a film producer, I'm on this world to make good movies. Nothing more. Now, having my big toe dipped into the distribution end helps me on many levels. Traffic breaks and Lee speeds along. The background whizzes past him. LEE (continuing) But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk. BACK TO: CLARENCE CLARENCE Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine. BACK TO: LEE Speeding down a benchside road. LEE Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration? BACK TO: CLARENCE I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire. Pause. Clarence hands the phone to Elliot. CLARENCE (to Elliot) He wants to talk ya. ELLIOT (into phone) Mr. Donowitz? (pause) I told you, through Dick. (pause) He's in my acting class. (pause) About a year. (pause) Yeah, he's good. (pause) They grew up together. (pause) Sure thing. Elliot hangs up the phone. ELLIOT He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there. (pointing to Clarence) He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag. CLARENCE No problems on both counts. He offers Elliot the animal crackers. CLARENCE Have a cookie. Elliot takes one. ELLIOT Thanks. He puts it in the mouth. CLARENCE That wasn't a gorilla, was it? EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY The red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the hotel. Alabama hops out. Clarence stays in. ALABAMA You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK? CLARENCE Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up. ALABAMA I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles. CLARENCE You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner. ALABAMA I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms. They kiss. CLARENCE We now return to "Bullit" already in progress. He slams the Mustang in reverse and peels out of the hotel. Alabama walks her little walk from the parking lot to the pool area. Somebody whistles at her, she turns to them. ALABAMA Thank you. She gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens the door. INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CALRENCE'S ROOM - DAY She steps in only to find Virgil sitting on a chair placed in front of the door with a sawed-off shotgun aimed right at her. VIRGIL (calmly) Step inside and shut the door. She doesn't move, she's frozen. Virgil leans forward. VIRGIL (calmly) Lady. I'm gonna shoot you in the face. She does exactly as he says. Virgil rises, still aiming the sawed-off. VIRGIL Step away from the door, move into the bathroom. She does. He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then steps closer to her. VIRGIL OK, Alabama, where's our coke, where's Clarence, and when's he coming back. ALABAMA I think you got the wrong room, my name is Sadie. I don't have any Coke, but there's a Pepsi machine downstairs. I don't know any Clarence, but maybe my husband does. You might have heard of him, he plays football. Al Lylezado. He'll be home any minute, you can ask him. Virgil can't help but smile. VIRGIL You're cute. Virgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which catches Alabama square in the face, lifting her off the ground and dropping her flat on her back. INT. MOVING RED MUSTANG - DAY Clarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat, singing to himself. CLARENCE (singing) "Land of stardust, land of glamour, Vistavision and Cinema, Everything about it is a must, To get to Hollywood, or bust..." INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY Alabama's laying flat. She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste of the blood in her mouth wakes her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil standing there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream. They open again to the same sight. She has never felt more helpless in her life. VIRGIL Hurts, don't it? It better. Took me a long time to kick like that. I'm third-degree blackbelt, you know? At home I got trophies. Tournaments I was in. Kicked all kinds of ass. I got great technique. You ain't hurt that bad. Get on your feet, Fruitloop. Alabama wobbily complies. VIRGIL Where's our coke? Where's Clarence? And when he's comin' back? Alabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without a doubt she's going to die, because this man is going to kill her. ALABAMA Go take a flying fuck and a rolling donut. Virgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a sidekick straight to the stomach. The air is sucked out of her lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours gasping for air that's just not there. Virgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one up with a Zippo lighter. He takes a long, deep drag. VIRGIL Whatsamatta? Can't breathe? Get used to it. INT. HAMBURGER STAND - DAY Clarence walks through the door of some mom and pop fast-food restaurant. CLARENCE Woah! Smells like hamburgers in here! What's the biggest, fattest hamburger you guys got? The Iranian Guy at the counter says: IRANIAN GUY That would be Steve's double chili cheeseburger. CLARENCE Well, I want two of them bad boys. Two large orders of chili fries. Two large Diet Cokes. (looking at a menu at the wall) And I'll tell you what, why don't you give me a combination burrito as well. INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY Alabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room. She braces herself against the wall. She is very punchy. Virgil steps in front of her. VIRGIL You think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you? Dream on, cunt. You're nothin' but a fuckin' fool. And your pretty face is gonna turn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds. Now, where's my fuckin' coke? She doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head. Her head slams into the left side of the wall. VIRGIL Where's Clarence?! Nothing. He gives her another kick to the head, this time from the other side. Her legs start to give way. He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her lightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him. VIRGIL When's Clarence getting back? She can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages, and she gives him the middle finger. Virgil can't help but smile. VIRGIL You gotta lot of heart, kid. He gives her a spinning roadhouse kick to the head that sends her to the floor. INT. HAMBURGER STAND - DAY CLOSEUP - Burgers sizzling on a griddle, Chili and cheese is put on them. Clarence is waiting for his order. He notices a CUSTOMER reading a copy of "Newsweek" with Elvis on the cover. CLARENCE That's a great issue. The Customer lowers his magazine a little bit. CUSTOMER Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one. CLARENCE Have you read the story on Elvis? CUSTOMER No. Not yet. CLARENCE You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong. CUSTOMER That good, huh? He takes the magazine from the Customer's hands and starts flipping to the Elvis article. CLARENCE It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps. CUSTOMER I can see what you mean. CLARENCE Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick. Clarence and the Customer laugh. INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY Alabama's pretty beat up. She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue. She's crawling around on the floor. Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the cocaine. He's also carrying on a running commentary. VIRGIL Now the first guy you kill is always the hardest. I don't care if you're the Boston Strangler or Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas boy, Charles Whitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, I'll bet you green money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was the bitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to hoe. Now, the second one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to hoe. You still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around. Then you completely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's gotten to the point now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change. He's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he flips the matress up off the bed, and the black suitcase is right there. Alabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying. Virgil flips open the black case and almost goes snow blind. VIRGIL Well, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great. One less thing I gotta worry about. Virgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse. She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up. Virgil turns toward her. VIRGIL OK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth - Alabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands. Mr. Karate-man smiles. VIRGIL Kid, you got a lotta heart. He moves toward her. Alabama's hands are shaking. VIRGIL Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a free swing. Now, I only do that for people I like. He moves close. Alabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open. Buttons fly everywhere. VIRGIL Go ahead, girl, take a stab at it. (giggling) You don't have anything to lose. CLOSEUP - Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose. Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many women all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into "I'll take this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do" seething hatred. Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot. CLOSEUP - VIRGIL'S FACE Talk about bloodcurling yells. Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running down his face. While Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter that Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster, so it doesn't kill him. Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot. VIRGIL OK, no more Mr. Nice-guy. Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it and, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the nose, breaking it. Her eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to it, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back, sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door. Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama. Alabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but not one of them has ever laughed before he did it. VIRGIL What's so fuckin' funny?!! ALABAMA (laughing) You look so ridiculous. She laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom. VIRGIL Laugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you laughing now? Alabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in her hand. Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair. Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his eyes. VIRGIL Oh Jesus! She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face. VIRGIL Oh Mary, help me! The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's clutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a Tasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming toward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks her into the toilet. He recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the toilet tank. Virgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama brings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet lid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires anyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink. The toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground. Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net hairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his gun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame, which results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face. He fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending water spraying. Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama down, and runs out of the bathroom. Virgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off laying on the ground. He crawls toward it. Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45 automatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room. He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it. Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-running-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him. He arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room. Alabama snatches the shotgun. Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact. The first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second hits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest. Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun. Ever since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been functioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi. ALABAMA Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy. O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive, it is pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Clarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn, only to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun. CLARENCE Honey? She continues. He puts his gun away. CLARENCE Sweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute, She continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground. She lies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms. Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his shoulder. CUT TO: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - DAY Everybody is outside their rooms watching as Clarence walks through the pool area with his bundle. Sirens can be heard. EXT. MOVING RED MUSTANG - DAY Clarence is driving like mad. Alabama's passed out in the passenger seat. She's muttering to herself. Clarence has one hand on the steering wheel and the other strokes Alabama's hair. CLARENCE Sleep baby. Don't dream. Don't worry. Just sleep. You deserve better than this. I'm so sorry. Sleep my angel. Sleep peacefully. EXT. MOTEL 6 - NIGHT A new motel. Clarence's red Mustang is parked outside. INT. MOTEL 6 - CLARENCE'S ROOM - NIGHT Alabama, with a fat lip and a black and blue face, is asleep in bed. INT. NOWHERE Clarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly to the camera. He's in a headshot. CLARENCE I feel so horrible about what she went through. That fucker really beat the shit out of her. She never told him where I was. It's like I always felt that the way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that much. I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was jokin'. But, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured with words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to - that's a test of oneself. That's a true romance. I swear to God, I'll cut off my hands and gouge out my eyes before I'll every let anything happen to that lady again. CUT TO: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT A wonderful, gracefully flowing shot of the Hollywood Hills. Off in the distance we hear the roar of a car engine. EXT. MULLHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT Vaaarrroooooommmm!!! A silver Porsche is driving hells bells, taking quick corners, pushing it to the edge. INT. MOVING PORSCHE - NIGHT Elliot Blitzer is the driver, standing on it. A blond, glitzy Coke Whore is sitting next to him. They're having a ball. Then they're seeing a red and blue light flashing in the rear-view window. It's the cops. ELLIOT Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this! (he pulls over) Kandi, you gotta help me. KANDI What can I do? He pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence gave him earlier. ELLIOT You gotta hold this for me. KANDI You must be high. Uh-huh. No way. ELLIOT (frantically) Just put it in your purse. KANDI I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse. ELLIOT They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything. KANDI No way, JosÈ. ELLIOT Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra. KANDI I'm not wearing a bra. ELLIOT (pleading) Put it in your pants. KANDI No. ELLIOT You're the one who wanted to drive fast. KANDI Read my lips. She mouths the word "no". ELLIOT After all I've done for you, you fuckin' whore!! She goes to slap him, she hits the bag of cocaine instead. It rips open. Cocaine completely covers his blue suit. At that moment Elliot turns to face a flashing beam. Tears fill his eyes. INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY Elliot is sitting in a chair at the table. Two young, good-looking, casually dressed, Starsky and Hutch-type POLICE DETECTIVES are questioning him. They're known in the department as Nicholson and Dimes. The dark-haired one is Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky Dimes. NICHOLSON Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine - DIMES Not a tiny little vial - NICHOLSON But a fuckin' baggie. DIMES No don't sit here and feed us some shit. NICHOLSON You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time - DIMES You're no longer an extra - NICHOLSON Or a bit player - DIMES Or a supporting actor - NICHOLSON You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience - DIMES But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on - NICHOLSON And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman. DIMES 'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore - NICHOLSON That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions. Elliot starts crying. Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks and smile. Mission accomplished. INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN KRINKLE'S OFFICE - DAY CAPTAIN BUFFORD KRINKLE is sitting behind his desk, where he spends about seventy-five percent of his day. He's you standard rough, gruff, no-nonsense, by-the-book-type police captain. KRINKLE Nicholson! Dimes! Het in here! The two casually dressed, sneaker-wearing cops rush in, both shouting at once. DIMES Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts cryin', and then it was all over - NICHOLSON Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion - KRINKLE Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about? DIMES Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him. NICHOLSON Nicholson and I. DIMES Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him. NICHOLSON Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid. DIMES So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it. CUT TO: INT. RESTAURANT - DAY Detroit. Very fancy restaurant. Four wise-guy Hoods, one older, the other three, youngsters, are seated at the table with Mr. Coccotti. COCCOTTI - And so, tomorrow morning comes, and no Virgil. I check with Nick Cardella, who Virgil was supposed to leave my narcotics with, he never shows. Now, children, somebody is stickin' a red-hot poker up my asshole and what I don't know is whose hand's on the handle. YOUNG WISE-GUY #1 (FRANKIE) You think Virgil started gettin' big ideas? COCCOTTI It's possible. Anybody can be carried away with delusions of grandeur. But after that incident in Ann Arbor, I trust Virgil. YOUNG WISE-GUY #2 (DARIO) What happened? OLD WISE-GUY(LENNY) Virgil got picked up in a warehouse shakedown. He got five years, he served three. COCCOTTI Anybody who clams up and does hid time, I don't care how I feel about him personally, he's OK. BACK TO: KRINKLE'S OFFICE NICHOLSON It seems a cop from some department, we don't know where, stole a half a million dollars of coke from the property cage and he's been sittin' on it for a year and a half. Now the cops got this weirdo - DIMES Suspect's words - NICHOLSON To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz. DIMES He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag". KRINKLE That Vietnam movie? DIMES Uh-huh. KRINKLE That was a good fuckin' movie. DIMES Sure was. KRINKLE Do you believe him? DIMES I believe he believes him. NICHOLSON He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him. DIMES This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire. KRINKLE He'll wear a wire? DIMES We talked him into it. KRINKLE Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this. DIMES Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust. NICHOLSON Cocaine. Dirty cops. Hollywood. This is Crocket and Tubbs all the way. And we found it, so we want the fuckin' collar. BACK TO: INT. RESTAURANT - DAY YOUNG WISE-GUY #3 (MARVIN) Maybe Virgil dropped it off at Cardella's. Cardella turns Virgil's switch off, and Cardella decides to open up his own fruit stand. LENNY Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti. (to Marvin) Do you know Nick Cardella? MARVIN No. LENNY Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk? MARVIN I didn't mean - LENNY Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy. COCCOTTI Children, we're digressing. Another possibility is that rat-fuck whore and her wack-a-doo cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil. Knowing Virgil, I find that hard to believe. But they sent Drexl to hell, and Drexl was no faggot. So you see, children, I got a lot of questions and no answers. Find out who this wing-and-a-prayer artist is and take him off at the neck. TITLE CARD: "THE BIG DAY" EXT. IMPERIAL HIGHWAY - SUNRISE Clarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just off of Imperial Highway. As luck would have it, somebody has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of the road. Clarence and Alabama sit on the sofa, sharing a Jumbo Java, and enjoying the sunrise and wonderful view of the LAX Airport runways, where planes are taking off and landing. A plane takes off, and they stop and watch. CLARENCE Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports. ALABAMA Really? CLARENCE With a vengeance, I hated them. ALABAMA How come? CLARENCE I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't. ALABAMA What? CLARENCE Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun. Another plane takes off. CLARENCE But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant. ALABAMA You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch. CLARENCE I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove? ALABAMA Cancoon. CLARENCE Why Cancoon? ALABAMA It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think? CLARENCE But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing. They kiss. CLARENCE Don't you worry 'bout anything. It's all gonna work out for us. We deserve it. INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY Dick, Clarence and Alabama are just getting ready to leave for the drug deal. Floyd lays on the couch watching TV. Alabama's wearing dark glasses because of the black eye she has. CLARENCE (to Floyd) You sure that's how you get to the Beverly Wilshire? FLOYD I've partied there twice. Yeah, I'm sure. DICK Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass. (to Clarence) Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby. CLARENCE I'm just makin' sure we got everything. (pointing to Alabama) You got yours? She holds up the suitcase. The phone rings. The three pile out the door. Floyd picks up the phone. FLOYD Hello? He puts his hand over the receiver. FLOYD Dick, it's for you. You here? DICK No. I left. He starts to close the door then opens it again. DICK I'll take it. (he takes the receiver) Hello. (pause) Hi, Catherine, I was just walkin' out the - (pause) Really? (pause) I don't believe it. (pause) She really said that? (pause) I'll be by first thing. (pause) No, thank you for sending me out. (pause) Bye-bye. He hangs up and looks to Clarence. DICK (stunned) I got the part on "T.J. Hooker". CLARENCE No shit? Dick, that's great! Clarence and Alabama are jumping around. Floyd even smiles. DICK (still stunned) They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning. CLARENCE Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late. Dick looks at Clarence. He doesn't want to go. DICK Clarence. CLARENCE Yeah? DICK Um, nothing, let's go? They exit. EXT. LAX AIRPORT - HOTEL - DAY We see the airport and move in closer on a hotel on a landscape. INT. LAX AIRPORT - HOTEL ROOM - DAY Lenny can be seen putting a shotgun together. He is sitting on a bed. Dario enters the frame with his own shotgun. He goes over to Lenny and gives him some shells. Marvin walks through the frame cocking his own shotgun. The bathroom door opens behind Lenny and Frankie walks out twirling a couple of .45 automatics in his hands. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COP S' HOTEL ROOM - DAY Nicholson and Dimes and FOUR DETECTIVES from internal affairs are in a room on the same floor as Donowitz. They have just put a wire on Elliot. DIMES OK, say something. ELLIOT (talking loud into the wire) Hello! Hello! Hello! How now brown cow! NICHOLSON Just talk regular. ELLIOT (normal tone) "But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief -" DIMES Are you gettin' this shit? DETECTIVE BY TAPE MACHINE Clear as a bell. Nicholson, Dime, and the head IA Officer, Wurlitzer, huddle by Elliot. DIMES Now, remember, we'll be monitoring just down the hall. ELLIOT And if there's any sign of trouble you'll come in. NICHOLSON Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail. DIMES We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine. NICHOLSON So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke. WURLITZER And this fellow Clarence? ELLIOT Yeah, Clarence. WURLITZER You gotta get him name the police officer behind all this. ELLIOT I'll try. DIMES You do more than try. NICHOLSON You do. DIMES Hope you're a good actor, Elliot. INT. MOVING RED MUSTANG - DAY Clarence, Dick and Alabama en route. DICK You got that playing basketball? ALABAMA Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face. They stop at a red light. Clarence looks at Alabama. CLARENCE Red light means love, baby. He and Alabama start kissing. INT. MOVING CADILLAC - DAY Marvin, Frankie, Lenny and Dario in a rented Caddy. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE PARKING LOT - DAY Clarence, Alabama, and Dick get out of the red Mustang. Dick takes the suitcase. CLARENCE I'll take that. Now, remember, both of you, let me do the talking. Clarence takes out his .38. Dick reacts. They walk and talk. DICK What the fuck did you bring that for. CLARENCE In case. DICK In case of what? CLARENCE In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say? DICK Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp - CLARENCE I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it. Pause. Clarence stops walking. CLARENCE Hold it, guys. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty scared. What say we forget the whole thing. Dick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved. DICK Do you really mean it? CLARENCE No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama? ALABAMA I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence. CLARENCE It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside. DICK Now's a helluva time to play "what if". CLARENCE This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught. ALABAMA It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey. CLARENCE That rhymes. He kisses her. DICK Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here. CLARENCE Yeah, let's just get outta here. The three walk back to the car. Clarence gets behind the wheel. The other two climb in. Clarence hops back out. CLARENCE I'm sorry guys, I gotta do it. As petrified as I am, I just can't walk away. I'm gonna be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life if I don't go in there. Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us, and he's not a cop, he's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high. And I'm just the man who can get him there. So what say we throw caution to the wind and let the chips fall where they may. Clarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the hotel. Dick and Alabama exchange looks and follow. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LOBBY - DAY Elliot's walking around the lobby. He's very nervous, so he's singing to himself. ELLIOT (singing) There's a man who leads a life of danger, To everyone he meets he stays a stranger. Be careful what you say, you'll give yourself away... INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY Nicholson, Dimes, Wurlitzer, and the three other Detectives surround the tape machine. Coming from the machine: ELLIOT'S VOICE (off) ... odds are you won't live to see tomorrow, secret agent man, secret agent man.... Nicholson looks at Dimes. DIMES Why, all of the sudden, have I got a bad feeling? BACK TO: LOBBY Clarence enters the lobby alone, he's carrying the suitcase. He spots Elliot and goes in his direction. Elliot sees Clarence approaching him. He says to himself, quietly: ELLIOT Elliot, your motivation is to stay out of jail. Clarence walks up to Elliot, they shake hands. ELLIOT Where's everybody else? CLARENCE They'll be along. Alabama and Dick enter the lobby, they join up with Clarence and Elliot. ELLIOT Hi, Dick. DICK How you doin', Elliot? CLARENCE Well, I guess it's about that time. ELLIOT I guess so. Follow me. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY The four of them are riding in the elevator. As luck would have it, they have the car to themselves. Rinky-drink elevator Muzak is playing. They are all silent. CLARENCE Elliot. ELLIOT Yeah? CLARENCE Get on your knees. Not sure he heard him right. ELLIOT What? Clarence hits the stop button on the elevator panel and whips out his .38. CLARENCE I said get on your fuckin' knees. Elliot does it immediately. Dick and Alabama react. CLARENCE Shut up, both of you, I know what I'm doin'. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM Pandemonium. DIMES He knows. NICHOLSON How the fuck could he know? DIMES He saw the wire. NICHOLSON How's he supposed to see the wire? DIMES He knows something's up. BACK TO: ELEVATOR Clarence puts the .38 against Elliot's forehead. CLARENCE You must think I'm pretty stupid, don't you? No answer. CLARENCE Don't you? ELLIOT (petrified) No. CLARENCE (yelling) Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it! BACK TO: COPS' ROOM NICHOLSON We gotta get him outta there. DIMES Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator. BACK TO: ELEVATOR CLARENCE Say it, goddamn it! ELLIOT You are the dumbest person in the world. CLARENCE Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am. ELLIOT No. No you're not. CLARENCE What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face. BACK TO: COPS NICHOLSON He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on. DIMES This guy's gonna kill him. BACK TO: ELEVATOR CLARENCE Stand up. Elliot does. The .38 is still pressed against his forehead. CLARENCE Like Nick Carter used to say: I I'm wrong, I'll apologize. I want you to tell me what's waiting for us up there. Something's amiss. I can feel it. If anything out of the ordinary goes down, believe this, you're gonna be the first one shot. Trust me, I am AIDS, you fuck with me, you die. Now quit making me mad and tell me why I'm so fucking nervous. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM DIMES He's bluffin', I knew it. He doesn't know shit. NICHOLSON Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself. DIMES You're an actor, so act, motherfucker. BACK TO: ELEVATOR Elliot still hasn't answered. CLARENCE OK. With the .38 up against Elliot's head Clarence puts his palm over the top of the gun to shield himself from the splatter. Alabama and Dick can't believe what he's gonna do. Elliot, tears running down, starts talking for the benefit of the people at the other end of the wire. He sounds like a little boy. ELLIOT I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. I wish somebody would just come and get me 'cause I don't like this. This is not what I thought it would be. And I wish somebody would just take me away. Just take me away Come and get me. 'Cause I don't like this anymore. I can't take this. I'm sorry but I just can't. So, if somebody would just come to my rescue, everything would be alright. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM Nicholson and Dimes shake their hands, They have a "well, that's that" expression an their faces. BACK TO: ELEVATOR Clarence puts down the gun and hugs Elliot. CLARENCE Sorry, Elliot. Nothing personal. I just hadda make sure you're all right. I'm sure. I really apologize for scaring you so bad, but believe me, I'm just as scared as you. Friends? Elliot, in a state of shock, takes Clarence's hand. Dick and Alabama are relieved. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM Nicholson and Dimes listen open-mouthed, not believing what they're hearing. INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY Floyd still lying on the couch watching TV. He hasn't moved since we last saw him. There is a knock from the door. FLOYD (not turning away from TV) It's open. The front door flies open and the four Wise-guys rapidly enter the room. The door slams shut. All have their sawed-offs drawn and pointing at Floyd. FLOYD Yes. LENNY Are you Dick Ritchie? FLOYD No. LENNY Do you know a Clarence Worley? FLOYD Yes. LENNY Do you know where we can find him? FLOYD He's at the Beverly Wilshire. LENNY Where's that? FLOYD Well, you go down Beechwood... INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY The door opens and reveals an extremely muscular guy with an Uzi strapped to his shoulder standing in the doorway, his name is Monty. MONTY Hi, Elliot. Are these your friends? ELLIOT You could say that. Everybody, this is Monty. MONTY C'mon in. Lee's in the can. He'll be out in a quick. They all move into the room, it is very luxurious. Another incredibly muscular GUY, Boris, is sitting on the sofa, he too has an Uzi. Monty begins patting everybody down. MONTY Sorry, nothin personal. He starts to search Clarence. Clarence back away. CLARENCE No need to search me, daredevil. All you'll find is a .38 calibre. Boris gets up from the couch. BORIS What compelled you to bring that along? CLARENCE The same thing that compelled you, Beastmaster, to bring rapid-fire weaponry to a business meeting. BORIS I'll take that. CLARENCE You'll have to. The toilet flushes in the bathroom. The door swings open and Lee Donowitz emerges. LEE They're here. Who's who? ELLIOT Lee, this is my friend Dick, and these are his friends, Clarence and Alabama. BORIS (pointing at Clarence) This guy's packin'. LEE Really? CLARENCE Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table. LEE I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody. They all sit around a fancy glass table except for Boris, who's getting the coffee, and Monty, who's standing behind Lee's chair. CLARENCE Oh, Mr. Donowitz - LEE Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee. CLARENCE OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever. LEE Thank you very much, Clarence. CLARENCE You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit. LEE I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage. CLARENCE Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books. Boris starts placing clear-glass coffee cups in front of everybody and fills everybody's cup from a fancy coffee pot that he handles like an expert. LEE Clarence, there might be somebody somewhere that agrees with you more than I do, but I wouldn't count on it. Clarence is on a roll and he knows it. CLARENCE They ain't plays, they ain't books, they certainly ain't movies, they're films. And do you know what films are? They're for people who don't like movies. "Mad Max", that's a movie. "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", that's a movie. "Rio Bravo", that's a movie. "Rumble Fish", that's a fuckin' movie. And, "Coming Home in a Body Bag", that's a movie. It was the first movie with balls to win a lot of Oscars since the "The Deer Hunter". BACK TO: COPS' ROOM They're all listening to this. DIMES What's this guy doin'? Makin' a drug deal or gettin' a job on the "New Yorker"? BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM CLARENCE My uncle Roger and uncle Cliff, both of which were in Nam, saw "Coming Home in a Body Bag" and thought it was the most accurate Vietnam film they'd ever seen. LEE You know, Clarence, when a veteran of that bullshit wars says that, it makes the whole project worthwhile. Clarence, my friend, and I call you my friend because we have similar interests, let's take a look at what you have for me. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM DIMES Thank God. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM Clarence puts the suitcase on the table. CLARENCE Lee, when you see this you're gonna shit. BACK TO: LOBBY The four Wise-guys are at the desk. LENNY (quietly to the others) What was the Jew-boy's name? MARVIN Donowitz, he said. FRONT-DESK GUY How can I help you, Gentlemen? LENNY Yeah, we're from Warner Bros. What room is Mr. Donowitz in? BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM Lee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it. CLARENCE Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more. LEE Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee. CLARENCE Me too, Boris. Boris fills both of their cups. They both, calm as a lake, take cream and sugar. All eyes are on them. Lee uses light cream and sugar, he begins stirring this cup. Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar. LEE (stirring loudly) You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar? CLARENCE I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up. Both are cool as cucumbers. LEE I have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage, this is quality. Can Boris make anybody a sandwich? I got all kinds of sandwich shit from Canters in there. ALABAMA No thank you. DICK No. But thanks. CLARENCE No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick. LEE Where'd you go? CLARENCE A Norms in Van Nuys. LEE Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys. Lee continues looking at the merchandise. Alabama writes something in her napkin with a pencil. She slides the napkin over to Clarence. It says: "You're so cool" with a tiny heart drawn on the bottom of it. Clarence takes the pencil and draws an arrow through the heart. She takes the napkin and puts it in her pocket. Lee looks up. LEE OK, Clarence, the merchandise is perfect. But, whenever I'm offered a deal that's too good to be true, it's because it's a lie. Convince me you're on the level. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM DIMES If he don't bite, we ain't got shit except posession. NICHOLSON Convince him. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM CLARENCE Well, Lee, it's like this. You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with professionals. I'm not a professional. I'm a rank amateur. I could take that, and I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and make a helluva lot more money. But, in order to do that, I'd have to become a drug dealer. Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting busted all of the time. Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta me, and you're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking movie-maker. I like you, and I'm still scared. I'm a punk kid who picked up a rock in the street, only to find out it's the Hope Diamond. It's worth a million dollars, but I can't get the million dollars for it. But, you can. So, I'll sell it to you for a couple a hundred thousand. You go to make a million. It's all found money to me anyway. Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred thousand is the world. LEE Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop. CLARENCE Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'. (to Elliot) Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit. (to Lee) He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it. LEE Why does he trust you? CLARENCE We grew up together. LEE If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it? CLARENCE I bullshitted him. Lee starts laughing. LEE That's wild. This fucking guy's a madman. I love it. Monty, go in the other room and get the money. Clarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks. DIMES & NICHOLSON Bingo! BACK TO: ELEVATOR The four Wise-guys are coming up. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM LEE (pointing to Alabama) What's your part in this? ALABAMA I'm his wife. LEE (referring to Dick) How 'bout you? DICK I know Elliot. LEE And Elliot knows me. Tell me, Clarence, what department does you friend work in? Dick and Alabama panic. CLARENCE (without missing a beat) Carson County Sheriffs. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM The internal affairs officers high five. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM Monty brings in a briefcase of money and puts it down on the table. LEE Wanna count your money? CLARENCE Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM They all stand. DIMES OK, boys. Let's go get 'em. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY Clarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door. As soon as it's shut he starts doing the twist. He can't believe he's pulled it off. He goes to the toilet and starts taking a piss. He turns and sees Elvis sitting on the sink. ELVIS Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool. CLARENCE I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face. ELVIS All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee. CLARENCE Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body. ELVIS Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to". CLARENCE That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM Everything's just as it was. Sudenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives break into the room with guns drawn. DIMES & NICHOLSON Police! Freeze, you're all under arrest! Everybody at the table stands up. Boris and Monty stand ready with the Uzis. DIMES You two! Put the guns on the floor and back away. MONTY Fuck you! All you pigs put your guns on the floor and back away. LEE Monty, what are you talking about? So what they say. DIMES This is your last warning! Drop those fuckin' guns! BORIS This is your last warning! We could kill all six of ya and ya fuckin' know it! Now get on the floor! DICK What the fuck am I doing here? LEE Boris! Everybody's gonna get killed! They're cops! MONTY So they're cops. Who gives a shit? BORIS Lee, something I never told you about me. I don't like cops. NICHOLSON OK, let's everybody calm down and get nice. Nobody has to die. We don't want it, and you don't want it. LEE We don't want it. The four Wise-guys burst through the door, shotguns drawn, except for Frankie, who has two .45 automatics, one in each hand. Half of the cops spin around. WURLITZER Freeze! LENNY Who are you guys? WURLITZER Police. DARIO (to Lenny) Do we get any extra if we have to kill cops? BACK TO: BATHROOM Clarence and Elvis. CLARENCE How do you think I'm doin' with Lee? ELVIS Are you kiddin'? He loves you. CLARENCE You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you? ELVIS You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass. CLARENCE I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag". ELVIS That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that. Elvis fixes Clarence's collar. ELVIS I like ya, Clarence. Always have. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM This is a Mexican stand-off if there ever was one. Gangsters on one end with shotguns. Bodyguards with machine guns on the other. And cops with handguns in the middle. Dick's ready to pass out. Alabama's so scared she pees on herself. For Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life, and he's just about had it. ELLIOT Officer Dimes? Officer Dimes. Dimes looks at Elliot. ELLIOT This has nothing to do with me anymore. Can I just leave and you guys just settle it by yourselves? DIMES Elliot, shut the fuck up and stay put! LEE (to Elliot) How did you know his name? How the fuck did he know your name? Why, you fuckin' little piece of shit! ELLIOT Lee, understand, I didn't want to - DIMES Shut the fuck up! LEE Well, I hope you're not planning on acting any time in the next twenty years 'cause your career is over as of now! You might as weel burn your SAG card! To think I treated you as a son! And you stabbed me in the heart! Lee can't control his anger any more. He grabs the coffee pot off the table and flings hot coffee into Elliot's face. Elliot screams and falls to his knees, Instinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice. Alabama screams. Boris lets loose with his Uzi, pinting Nicholson red with bullets. DIMES (screaming) Cody!!! Nicholson flies backwards. Marvin fires his shotgun, hits Nicholson in the back, Nicholson's body jerks back and forth then on the floor. Clarence opens the bathroom door. Dimes hits the ground firing. A shot catches Clarence in the forehead. Alabama screams. Dario fires his sawed-off. It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the bathroom sink, smashing the mirror. It might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either hits the ground or runs for cover. Dimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground. Boris dives into the kitchen area. Monty tips the table over. Marvin dives behind the sofa. Dario runs out of the door and down the hall. With bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything. Two IA Officers are shot right away. Frankie takes an Uzi hit. He goes down firing both automatics. Elliot gets it from both sides. Alabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the bathroom. Clarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching. He moves and falls off. Alabama continues crawling. Marvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires. The shotgun blast hits the glass table and Monty. Monty stands up screaming. The Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty. As Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over the apartment. EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - DAY Cop cars start arriving in twos in front of the hotel. BACK TO: GUNFIGHT Alabama crawling. The suitcase full of cocaine is by Dick. Dick grabs it and tosses it in the air. Marvin comes from behind the sofa and fires. The suitcase is hit in mid-air. White powder goes everywhere. The room is enveloped in cocaine. Dick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door. An IA Officer goes after him. Lenny makes a break for it. Wurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin. Alabama reaches the bathroom and finds Clarence. ALABAMA Sweety? Clarence's face is awash with blood. CLARENCE I... I can't see you... I've got blood in my eyes... He dies. Alabama tries to give him outh-to-mouth resuscitation. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - HALLWAY - DAY Dario runs down the hall, right into a cluster of uniformed police. He fires his shotgun, hitting two, just before the others chop him to ribbons. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ANOTHER HALLWAY The hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast. Dick comes around the corner, running as if on fire. Then we see the IA Officer turn the same corner. IA OFFICER (aiming gun) Freeze! Dick does. DICK I'm unarmed! IA OFFICER Put your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch! He does. Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the IA Officer, sending him to the wall. DICK Oh shit. He starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the corner and runs down the hall. Dick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box. Lenny catches up. Dick raises his hands. Lenny aimes his sawed-off. DICK Look, I don't know who you are, but whatever it was that I did to you, I'm sorry. Two elevator doors on either side of them open. Lenny looks at Dick. He drops his aim and says: LENNY Lotsa luck. Lenny dives into one elevator car. Dick jumps into the other, just as the doors close. BACK TO: HOTEL ROOM The Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each other down. Wurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned down in the kitchen. In the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get his heart started. It's not working. She slaps him hard in the face a couple of times. ALABAMA Wake up, goddamn it! Dimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the grip of a dead Wise-guy. Boris peeks around the wall to fire. Dimes lets loose with a blast. A scream is heard. BORIS (off) I'm shot! Stop! DIMES Throw out your gun, asshole! The Uzi's tossed out. Dimes goes to where Wurlitzer is. DIMES (to Marvin) OK, black jacket! It's two against one now! Toss the gun and lie face down on the floor or die like all you friends. The shotgun's tossed out from behind the sofa. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY Dick's sitting on the ground, he can't believe any of this. The doors open on the fourth floor. He runs out into the hallway. HALLWAY He starts trying the room doors for an open one. DICK Oh, God, if you just get me outta this I swear to God I'll never fuck up again. Please, just let me get to "T.J. Hooker" on Monday. STEWARDESS'S ROOM - DAY Dick steps in. Three gorgeous girls are doing a killer aerobics workout to a video on TV. The music is so loud they're so into their exercises, they don't hear Dick tiptoe behind them and crawl underneath the bed. LEE'S ROOM Boris has caught a lot of buckshots, but he'll live. He's lying on the kitchen floor. Dimes stands over him. He has the sawed-off in his hand. DIMES Don't even give me an excuse, motherfucker. Dimes pats him down for other weapons, there are none. Wurlitzer puts the cuffs on Marvin and sits him down on the couch. Dimes looks in the bathroom and sees the dead Clarence with Alabama crying over him. Dimes walks over to Wurlitzer. DIMES Everything's under control here. WURLITZER Sorry about Nicholson. DIMES Me too. WURLITZER I'm gonna go see what's goin' on outside. DIMES You do that. Wurlitzer exits. Dimes grabs the phone. LOBBY Shotgun in hand, Lenny moves hurriedly down the lobby. A Cop yells out. COP You! Stop! Lenny brings up his sawed-off and lets him have it. Other cops rush forward. Lenny grabs a woman standing by. LENNY Get back or I'll blow this bitch's brains to kingdom come! LEE'S ROOM Dimes on the phone talking with the department. Boris is still moving on the floor. Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back. Alabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket. She reaches in and pulls out his .38. She wipes her eyes. She holds the gun in her hand and remembers Clarence saying: CLARENCE (off) She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist, and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier! Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge! Alabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand. Marvin turns his head toward her. She shoots him twice. Dimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun. She fires. He's hit in the head and flung to the floor. She sees Boris on the kitchen floor. ALABAMA Bye-bye, Boris. Good luck. BORIS You too, cutie. She starts to leave and then spots the briefcase full of money. She takes it and walks out the door. HALLWAY The elevator opens and Wurlitzer steps out. Alabama comes around the corner. WURLITZER Hey, you! Alabama shoots him three times in the belly. She steps into the elevator, the doors close. LOBBY Alabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out. In the background, cops are all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage. LENNY I wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready to take me to Kilimanjaro and... and a million bucks! (pause) Small bills! EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - PARKING LOT - DAY Alabama puts the briefcase in the trunk. She gets into the Mustang and drives away. INT. MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY Alabama's driving fast down the freeway. The DJ on the radio is trying to be funny. She's muttering to herself. ALABAMA I could have walked away. I told you that. I told you I could have walked away. This is not my fault. I did not do this. You did this one hundred percent to yourself. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling bad. I should laugh 'cause you don't deserve any better. I could get another guy like that. I'm hot lookin'. What are you? Dead! Dumb jerk. Asshole. You're a asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole. You wanted it all, didn't ya? Didn't ya? Well watcha got now? You ain't got the money. You ain't got me. You ain't even got your body anymore. You got nothin'. Nada. Zip. Goose egg. Nil. Donut. The song "Little Arrows" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio. Alabama breaks down and starts crying. She pulls the car over to the side. The song continues. She wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket. She tosses it on the dashboard. She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth. She pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view mirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens on the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads it: "You're so cool". She tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase. She looks around for, and finally finds, the "Sgt. Fury" comic book Clarence bought her. And with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away from the Mustang forever.

1   LONG BASEMENT CORRIDOR                                      1
    The CAMERA is MOVING SLOWLY DOWN a long basement corridor.
    We hear a narrator (Werner) --

                             WERNER (V.O.)
               On his 35th birthday, I decided
               to tell Julius Benedict the truth
               about himself...

2   CLOSE - LABORATORY HALL - DOORS - DAY (PERIOD)              2

    HOLD ON sign:   "Top Secret - Authorized Personnel Only."

                             WERNER (V.O.)
               It wasn't that he was the product
               of a scientific experiment.

3   INT. LABORATORY - DAY (PERIOD - 1952)                       3

    A white coated scientist (PROFESSOR WERNER) is studying a
    bizarre piece of equipment that looks suspiciously like
    a milkshake blender. With him is another scientist --
    (this is TRAVEN -- already imperious, already a prick).

                             WERNER (V.O.)
               An experiment designed to produce
               a physically, mentally and
               spiritually superior human being.
               I explained that to him when he
               was two years old.


4   INT. MEDICAL EXAM ROOM - HALF A DOZEN MEN - DAY (PERIOD) 4
    Most of them young, 20s and 30s. They are being given a
    medical examination by a group of doctors, including
    Werner.
                             WERNER (V.O.)
               And it wasn't the complexity of
               Julius's parentage. He knew that
               unlike other little boys, he
               didn't have just one, but half
               a dozen fathers, all very
               distinguished men.                                   *

5   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CLOSE ON GORGEOUS WOMAN - DAY          5
    (PERIOD)

    Not your Hollywood type. This is obviously a lady of
    character and talent. Her name we will come to learn is
    MARY ANN BENEDICT. She is on a hospital bed and being
    readied for surgery.

                            WERNER (V.O.)
              Nor was it about the
              extraordinary woman chosen to
              be his mother...
                                                                    *

6   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY OUTSIDE DELIVERY ROOM - (PERIOD)      6
    Traven emerges, sadly shaking his head. Werner tries to
    enter the room -- Traven won't permit it.

                            WERNER (V.O.)
              Julius had long lived with the
              tragic news that she died giving
              birth to him.

    As a nurse, parting the security guards, emerges and holds
    up a plump, serene, smiling baby boy.

                  What Julius didn't know, until
                  this very moment, was that, about
                  a minute after he was born...
     Another nurse emerges from the delivery room, holding up
     a second INFANT -- this one is SCREAMING with rage.

                                WERNER (V.O.)
                  His mother gave birth to another

10   INT. NURSERY - DAY (PERIOD)                                    10

     The serene baby.    Any mother's joy.

     The angry baby.    Fuming.
     PULL BACK to reveal:
     The two of them are in the same crib.
     The leg of the angry baby. It suddenly lashes out,
     connects with the rump of the serene baby:
     The serene BABY.    Starting to CRY.
     The angry baby.    All smiles now.
     HOLD ON the two babies in their crib as the following

      Werner, now 70, is bent and old. Julius, in peasant garb
      is a marvelous-looking human being.

                                 WERNER
                          (speaks with an
                           Austrian accent)
                   He was sent to an orphanage in
                   Los Angeles. At the same time I
                   brought you here to the island.
      Julius isn't listening.    His eyes shine.

                                 JULIUS
                          (amazed)
                   I have a twin brother?!!
                          (for a moment,
                           chews on his right

                Vincent.

                   Vincent -- Every time I loved
                   something I called it Vincent --
                   I called my first computer
                   Vincent!

      Julius strides along a windswept path, followed by
      Werner. The ocean spread out below them is vast and
      empty. This island is far from anywhere.
                                 WERNER
                          (fretting terribly)
                   You've been here since you were a
                   baby -- you know nothing of
                   America --
                              JULIUS
                I know it is the cradle   of
                democracy and the land   of the
                free; besides, I speak   twelve

                   primitive, not like us.
                                 JULIUS

      It's a blend of modern technology and the tropical
      environment -- floor-to-ceiling book-cases, computers, a
      hammock shrouded in a mosquito net.

      Julius is hurriedly packing a small leather suitcase,
      watched by Werner.
      Werner hands over a photograph: it's a picture of a
      younger Werner, Traven, and the six fathers.
                                 JULIUS
                   It's your only copy --
                                 WERNER
                   -- My need for it is only
                   sentimental -- yours may be
                   practical --
      Julius slips the photo into his suitcase.
                                 JULIUS
                   Thank you -- I'll miss you.
                                 WERNER

                          tears)

      The water's edge. Julius, Werner, an OLDER LADY, two
      scientists and an ORIENTAL man are all saying goodbye.
      Julius puts his suitcase into a small rowboat.

      Julius then bows to the Oriental, who bows back.

                             JULIUS
                      (in Japanese;
                       subtitled)
               It was an honor to study under
               you, Master.
      Without warning, the Oriental tries to strike Julius in
      the face with the side of his hand, but Julius blocks
      the blow.

                             ORIENTAL
                      (in English)
               Ahhh, always on guard. You have
               learned well, Julius-san.
      Julius gives a last hug to Werner.

                             JULIUS
                      (to Werner)
               I was just thinking, maybe my

                                 JULIUS
                   Well, if a woman loved my brother
                   enough to marry him, she might
                   have a sister who'd feel the same
                   way about me. That often  happens
                   with twins, you know.
                                 WERNER
                   Julius -- please -- don't get
                   your hopes up. Your brother
                   doesn't even know you exist.

      Julius gets in the boat and casts off. The boat takes off
      like a streak. Julius, in perfect rhythm, increases the
      pace. The boat is almost flying across the water.
                                 JULIUS

                   Of course he does. I've always
                   known there was something missing
                   in my life! And deep down, I'm
                   sure Vincent feels the same way!

      like a house-proud new owner.

     Noticing an expensive gold lighter on the dresser top,

     Vince steps out and  jauntily climbs over the rail. It's
     very clear he likes  the danger, being on the edge. In

     Coming down the aisle, checking the passengers, as we
     hear:

                      (singing)
               'Put on your red dress, baby
               'Cause we're going out tonight...'
     A few passengers turn and look back at --


     JULIUS
     seated in the rear, still in his peasant garb, the bamboo
     suitcase resting on his lap. He has his headphones on
     and is singing along to the music, his eyes closed and
     his head bobbing.
                             JULIUS
                      (singing)
               'I better wear some boxing gloves,
               In case some fool might want to
                 fight.'

     The STEWARDESS removes his headphones and considers
     Julius with amusement.
                             STEWARDESS
               I knew you were trouble the second
               I laid eyes on you.
     Julius stares up at her, speechless and mesmerized.

                             JULIUS
                      (realizing)

               music before -- I love it.                             *
     She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while
     Julius gazes down at her ample cleavage.

                             STEWARDESS
               The captain wants us to buckle our
               seat belts because we're expecting
               a little turbulence.

                                JULIUS

                  botanist, a mathematician, and a
                  philosopher.

                  Right.    And I'm a brain surgeon.

     As the Stewardess heads back up the aisle, a MAN jumps
     up, grabs her around the neck with one arm and brandishes
     a gun in his other hand.

                                  HIJACKER (MAN)
                           (to passengers)
                  Nobody   moves, or else we're gonna
                  have a   serious draft in here.
                           (turns to another
                            stewardess)
                  Get the   captain. I want to
                  discuss   our final destination.

     He continues maneuvering the Stewardess up the aisle.
     His back is totally to Julius now.


     JULIUS
     turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him who's
     clutching a hardcover Bible in her lap.

                         (whispers)
                  Excuse me, ma'am.

     As he takes the book from her, quickly draws back his
     arm --

     The gun at the panicked Stewardess's head, he continues
     slowly up the aisle, shouting for everyone to freeze, not
     even to think about moving --
     -- now a hardcover book comes rocketing through the air,
     hits him in the back of the neck and he goes limp, fall-
     ing across some seats, the gun dropping from his hand.

     In front now, there is a lot of activity as various pass-
     engers hold the Highjacker, almost arguing over who's in

     headset, closes his eyes and is soon bopping away to the

     As Vince sidles into a booth, watched by a BARTENDER who
     clearly dislikes him.

                               BARTENDER
               It's him.    He's back.

     A pretty young cocktail waitress called MARNIE turns and
     stares daggers at Vince. Marnie is a fireball of a girl,
     all brass and sass on the outside and sweet as cotton
     candy on the inside, sort of a Jean Harlow valley girl.
     She approaches Vince, who greets her with effusive
     warmth.
                             VINCE
               Marnie! How are you?        Is your                       *
               sister around?                                            *

     Marnie pointedly scoops up the tip left by the previous
     occupants of the booth.
                                                                         *
     Marnie starts to wipe down the table, spilling crumbs into
     his lap.
                             MARNIE
               You total Linda's car. You pawn                           *
               her stereo. You declare us as                             *

                              FEMALE (O.S.)
               Vince!   I knew you'd come back!

     Marnie's sister, LINDA, also a cocktail waitress, slips
     into the booth and gives Vince a big kiss. Linda,
     although just as attractive as her younger sister, has a
     completely different personality: she's trusting,
     dependent, and legally blind when it comes to Vincent.
                             VINCE
                      (to Linda)
               I am so sorry for all the
               miserable things I've done to you.

                  money. Just take care of my
                  station for a minute.

     Marnie exchanges an exasperated glance with the Bartender
     and walks away. Linda distances herself a little from
     Vince in the booth, not meeting his eyes.

                  What did you do, Vince?

     Vince takes Linda's hand between his and stares into her
     eyes.
                                LINDA
                  Don't look at me like that...
                  Don't do that with your eyes... I

     A man enters. He starts looking around, checking the
     booths. He looks like a professional enforcer, which in
     fact, he is. He is also the smallest of the Klane
     brothers: BURT KLANE.

     Vince ducks down under the table.

54   INT. JAIL - VISITING ROOM - DAY                              54
     Julius is already seated in one of the cubicles, separated
     by a glass partition from the prisoner's side. This is
     a big moment for Julius and he looks around as various
     prisoners are brought in --
     -- and as a look of pleasure comes across his face --
                                                  CUT TO:


     GUARD
     leading an attractive, powerful inmate into the room.
     The guy is Julius's age.
                                                  CUT TO:


     JULIUS
     trying to fight his excitement, watching as the prisoner
     moves toward him --
     -- then past him.

     Julius, confused, stares for a moment straight ahead
     across the partition, and now he's more confused --

     -- because Vince is sitting across from him, dubiously
     studying him, arms crossed. There are phones on both
     sides of the glass partition. The room, it should be
     noted, is busy.

     Julius makes a smile.
     Vince just stares.

     Julius mutters "excuse me" and gets up, goes to a nearby
     GUARD.

                         (soft)
                  Excuse me, but I'm looking for
                  Vincent Benedict.

                  You got 'im.
     Julius turns, looks at Vince, and as he walks back to his
     side of the cubicle and sits, he is overcome with the
     wonder of it all.
                                JULIUS
                         (impassioned, but a
                          bit rambling; his
                          emotions are in
                          control)
                  Vincent... dearest Vincent... I
                  have rowed halfway across the
                  world -- no, wrong, I only rowed
                  one day but I came halfway across                     *
                  the world -- I know you don't know
                  who I am, but believe me when I

                  moment all my life...
     It's hard to tell what Vince is feeling but clearly the
     look of dubiousness is gone. He picks up the phone on
     his side, gestures for Julius to do the same. As Julius
     does, Vince at last speaks:
                                VINCE
                  You gotta talk into the phone,                        *
                  asshole.
     Julius is confused, momentarily.

                                JULIUS
                         (understands now --
                          into the phone)

     Vince glances quickly around to see that no one is
     listening.

      As a gleaming new Cadillac rolls up to the ticket booth.
      Al leans out from the booth, taking in the car and its
      occupants -- two men, one in a Hawaiian shirt, one in a
      tanktop, both wearing Ray-Bans. They look like they're
      going on vacation.

                   Hey, the new Sedan DeVille... Very
                   nice.
      The driver, GARFIELD, just nods, holds out his hand for
      the ticket.

                                 AL
                   You guys must be going to Hawaii,
                   huh? Catch that good surf.

                                 GARFIELD
                   Something like that.
      The two men just stare straight ahead, uninterested in
      conversation. Al hands the driver a ticket.

                                 AL
                   There's plenty of space on level
                   four.
      The Cadillac accelerates up the ramp.

      Man #2, LARSON, opens an attache case, removes a
      cassette, inserts it into the tape deck while the driver
      wipes down the steering wheel, gearshift, etc. with a
      cloth to remove their fingerprints.

      handles, and then head for the elevator.

     PULL BACK to reveal MORRIS KLANE, the biggest of them all,
     standing over Vince.

                  You gotta understand something,
                  Benedict -- I like my work.
     He pulls  Vince groggily up and this time he's going for
     Vince's  face. He takes his time setting Vince up,
     getting  his chin at just the right angle. He's concen-
     trating  on his work, so he doesn't pay much attention to
     the fact  that the elevator door has opened behind.

     Klane draws   his fist back and is about to drive it into
     Vince's face   when he suddenly pauses; the expression on
     his face, at   first puzzled, becomes increasingly agonized
     as we REVEAL   that --

     JULIUS

     Behind him, is squeezing a pressure point on Klane's
     neck, rendering him unable to punch out Vince. Julius
     maneuvers the Klane off of Vince and forces him down
     onto the floor.

     Julius lets go of Klane, who gets to his feet, turns
     around, and instantly lets fly with his fist at Julius's
     face.

     Here Julius effortlessly blocks the punch and goes right
     on talking.
                                JULIUS
                  You moved too soon.
     Klane spins and aims a karate kick at Julius's head.
     Julius coolly ducks it and sends Klane crashing into a
     wall.

                  kind of enemy I am.

     Klane drags himself to his feet while trying to gauge what
     he's up against.

     Klane isn't buying it. Seeing a fire axe inside a GLASS
     CASE on the wall, he SMASHES through and grabs it.

       Julius studies Vince's shifting moves, the way his hands
       work the steering wheel. Now he's back to the manual.
       Now he's staring at Vince.

               That's the best way --   women love

               It keeps them on their   toes --
               makes them excited you   know what

                  for orphans benefits for Vincent
                  Benedict has been denied.
                  According to our files his mother

                  a current address for her at 172
                  Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles.
                  Vincent's case seems to be one of
                  simple abandonment and as such he

                  Julius -- slow down -- I've got no
                  time for this. You go hunt down                       *

     Vince goes to the PHONE which is RINGING.

               money tomorrow morning. Or else.

               Or else what?
     Suddenly, Vince's    living room WINDOWS EXPLODE in a burst
     of GUNFIRE. Vince     and Julius hit the floor and try to
     shield themselves    from the SHATTERING GLASS. The sound
     of a CAR SQUEALING    away outside the window.
                             JULIUS
               Everyone seems so angry in America.

     Webster, immaculate and well mannered, rising from a

                  He wants more money. That's what

                                WEBSTER
                  Let me explain something to you.
                  I have a reputation to uphold.
                  People put their trust in me
                  because they know I always deliver
                  the goods and I always come back
                  with the money. This whole thing
                  is making me look very bad...
                  professionally.

                                GARFIELD
                  This is bullshit! The car was
                  there.
                                LARSEN
                  That's right. The parking
                  attendant thought we were off for
                  Hawaii.

                         (a brief pause)
                  The parking attendant?
                                GARFIELD
                  He liked the car. We'd put on
                  those damn loud shirts so we'd
                  look like tourists --
                                LARSEN
                  He asked us if we were going
                  surfing. He was a jerk.

     Webster suddenly gets to his feet, smiles.                         *
                                WEBSTER

                  I don't think that's a problem.
     Webster pulls out a silencer-equipped pistol and puts
     a bullet in each of their foreheads. They lie very still
     and very dead.

       back as if to say goodbye, watched by Garfield's

       house number against the address on Vince's letter.

B88    EXT. STREET (BEL AIR ESTATE) - DAY                         B88

       An imposing security gate stands wide open as several
       cars roll through it and climb up the long driveway.
       Julius, checking the address, sprints in after them just
       before the gates close.

       As Julius jogs up to the front door. The circular
       driveway is filled with cars. Adults and children are
       visible on the grounds; it appears that a party is in
       progress. Julius rings the doorbell, which is answered
       by GRANGER, a man of about 60; he's dressed in swimming
       trunks and sports an impressive physique. He's holding
       the hand of a five-year-old GIRL.

       Julius and Granger look at one another and, for a brief
       moment, hesitate, as if each of them finds the other
       vaguely familiar.

                   party and I realize this might
                   sound strange, but I'm looking for
                   someone who lived here a long time
                   ago...

                   Mary Anne Benedict.
      Granger reacts; he's speechless. Julius hands him the
      group photo of his mother, six fathers, Traven, and
      Werner.

                                 JULIUS
                   She was my mother.
      Granger looks at the photo, then at Julius.
                                 GRANGER
                   You're Mary Anne's son?

                   Isn't that you, Grandpa?

      Julius gently takes the photo from the Girl, looks at the
      face she pointed at, then at Granger. Now Julius is
      speechless -- Granger is one of his fathers!

      The little Girl disappears back inside.       Granger, clearly
      shaken, looks at Julius.

                She turned me down. Said she was
                afraid to have children. She took
                it real hard when they told her
                you died. She even stopped
                painting. Did you know she
                painted?

                Until yesterday I didn't even know
                she might still be alive... Who
                told her we died?

       As the chop shop Owner checks under the hood of the Caddy
       -- Vince moves to the back of the car and pops open the
       trunk.
       The trunk is filled with a sleeping bag that might contain
       a dead body. Vince unzips the bag, sees some kind of
       giant engine part. He tries to lift it out -- It won't
       budge.

       Vince closes the trunk --

       Vince looks at the Owner who's already counting out the
       cash from his bankroll.

                   Well, I guess I'll have to beat
                   it out of you --

      Webster suddenly kicks over the chair with Al on it.
      Carla screams --

                                 CARLA
                   Stop -- I'll tell -- He lives at
                   1622 Westridge Place -- He's got
                   an office at the corner of
                   Highland and Hollywood.

      Webster writes it all down.
                                 AL
                   Thanks for saving me.

                   It's just I couldn't resist Vince.
                   It's those eyes -- he does this
                   thing with his eyes...

110   EXT. VINCE'S DRIVEWAY - DAY                                     110
      As Vince comes out of     his house, carrying a sleeping bag,
      pillow, some clothing,     a six-pack of soft drinks. On top
      of the stack is a map     of the Western U.S., which he's
      studying while singing     the song "Houston":
                                 VINCE
                          (singing)
                   'Going back to Houston, Houston,
                    Houston...'
      Vince tosses the items into the back seat of the Caddy,
      just as Julius jogs up the driveway and collapses against
      the Caddie door. He's red in the face, completely
      drenched with sweat, gasping for breath, having run all
      the way from Bel-Air.

                          (panting)
                   Vince, the most amazing thing has
                   happened.

                                 VINCE
                   You scared the living shit out of
                   me --
                                 JULIUS
                   I met one of our fathers. He told
                   me of a man in New Mexico who
                   probably knows where Momma is.

                            (patronizing)
                   Great.
      Julius, in his fervor, grips Vince by the shoulders.

                                 JULIUS
                   She didn't abandon you -- she
                   didn't even know you were born!

                          (feigning concern)
                   Awww -- that's terrible.
      Vince removes Julius's hands, slides him away from the
      door, and opens it.

                                 JULIUS
                   And she was told that I died!
                                 VINCE
                   Look, Julius, I'm in kind   of a
                   hurry. Sammy wants me to    take
                   the car to Houston. Much    bigger
                   bucks when you raffle for   charity
                   in Houston.
      Julius takes the map from Vince, looks at it.

                                 JULIUS
                          (excited)
                   -- New Mexico is on the way to
                   Houston.

                                 VINCE
                          (snatching back map)
                   A lot of places are on the way to
                   Houston. I'll be back in a few
                   days. Stay in my apartment. Run
                   up my phone bill. Throw wild
                   parties. Take advantage of me.

      Vince gets in behind the wheel. Julius marches around
      the car and gets into the passenger seat beside him.

                                 JULIUS
                   Vincent, we have to go see this
                   man Traven in New Mexico!
                                  VINCE
                   No we don't.

      Julius slams his hand down on the top of the dash.

                   Yes we do!   And I'm coming with
                   you!

      Vince, realizing that Julius won't be denied, tries a
      new tack.

                                 VINCE
                   You know -- you're right. This is
                   fate -- destiny -- But there's no
                   way I'm gonna drive for 1500 miles
                   with you smelling like that --

                                 JULIUS
                          (calming down)
                   You're right -- I'll take a shower
                   -- be right back --

      Julius leaps out of the car and bounds into Vince's
      apartment. As soon as the door shuts behind him, Vince
      hits the CADDY'S IGNITION and begins SQUEALING out of
      the driveway in reverse... just as Linda and Marnie's
      car pulls into it, blocking his path. Vince slams his
      hands down onto the wheel in frustration.

      Linda and Marnie get out of their car, singing "Happy
      Birthday." Linda approaches Vince with a birthday
      cake, complete with lit candles.
                                 VINCE
                          (to himself)
                   Why does everybody have to like me
                   so much?
      Vince gets out of the car and, although it kills him,
      tries to put on a happy face for Linda.
                                 LINDA
                   Happy birthday, Vince.

                   Happy birthday, Vince.   Is Julius

                   so huge it gives me a rash just
                   thinking about it.
                                LINDA

      An apartment door opens, revealing a FEMALE NEIGHBOR of
      Vince's.

111   INT. VINCE'S APARTMENT - DAY                                   111
      Marnie snoops around, examines the group photo lying on
      top of Julius's suitcase. In the b.g. she can hear
      Julius singing in the shower --
                                 JULIUS (O.S.)
                   'Put on your red dress, baby,
                    'cause we're going out tonight...'
      She puts the photo back as the sound of SHOWER STOPS.
      Julius emerges from the bathroom, clutching a towel
      around his waist, and freezes at the sight of Marnie.

                                  JULIUS
                    You do that too, huh?

                    Listen, Marnie's got the hots for
                    you. Tonight could be your lucky
                    night...

                                  JULIUS
                    I don't think she really likes me.

                    'cause it's your first time.

                                  JULIUS
                    Were you nervous?

                    I was twelve and she was a nun --
                    that's real pressure.
       They both finish at the urinals and begin washing at the
       sink.

                    I got to admit it, Jules -- since
                    I met you, life is getting better
                    all the time.
       Julius, a little smashed, can't hide his feelings.    He
       grips Vince by the shoulders.

                                  JULIUS
                    For me, too, Vince! Sometimes I'm
                    so happy, I want to pick you up
                    and hug you!
       Julius starts to do so, just as another man enters.

      Linda and Marnie, both a little tipsy. Linda suddenly
      freezes at the sight of Morris Klane scoping the room.
      Morris is still wearing a bandage from his beating by
      Julius.
                              LINDA

                Well, I phoned work and told them
                we wouldn't be coming in for a few
                days... Oh, I forgot to tell

                But we just went.
      Linda takes Marnie by the hand, just as --


      BURT AND BOB KLANE
      each with a cast on his foot, each supported by a crutch,
      force them back into the booth.

                Hello, girls -- Do you mind if we

                    If you choose to bluff, you must
                    be prepared to have your bluff
                    called.
                                  BURT KLANE
                    This is no bluff -- Asshole --

       Burt gives a small head signal and two very large men
       stand up from a nearby table. They each grab one of
       Julius's arms.

                                  BURT KLANE
                    Meet my cousins.
                           (to the Klanes)
                    Get these jerks outside.

       Just then, so sudden and quick that it's over as soon as
       it begins, Julius double kicks the seated Burt and Bob in
       the head. They're out cold before they realize they've
       been attacked.
       Without stopping, Julius whips his arms together in front
       of him bringing Sam and Dave into painful contact with
       each others' head. They, too, are now out cold.
       Vince uses this opportunity to stomp, with all his might,
       on the toe of Morris who's busy watching Julius dismantle
       his relatives. Morris screams and lets go of Vince, who
       runs to the nearby pool table, grabs a cue and slams it
       over the head of the now hobbling Morris. All five
       Klanes are out cold.

                    Quite a few. They were formulated
                    by a Kendo swordsman in the 17th
                    century, but their philosophical
                    underpinnings can be applied to
                    many other areas of life.

      Julius is unpacking his suitcase on one of the beds --
      arranging his books on the bedside table, hanging his
      clothes on hangars. Vince watches him, glances at
      his watch, and begins to edge towards the door.
                                 VINCE
                   Uh... we got cable TV, a fully
                   stocked bar, free ice -- we're
                   in great shape.
                                 JULIUS
                   Where you going?

                   I thought I'd just go and tuck
                   Linda in for the night.

      Vince picks up one of Julius' heavy tomes.
                                 VINCE
                   Maybe read her a bedtime story.
                          (with a wink)
                   Don't wait up for me.

      Julius looks fondly at his brother as he sees him to
      the door.
                                 JULIUS
                   What a day, Vincent, we visited
                   our birth place. We bought new
                   clothes. We danced the waltz.
                   We get into a fight -- We've got
                   this great room.
                          (heart-felt)
                   It just doesn't get any better
                   than this.

      Vince gives Julius a sly look as he lets himself out of
      the room.

                   Oh yes it does.

      JULIUS

      sits watching the TV, nodding in amusement, laughing,
      slapping his knee in pleasure.

      He returns his attention to the book he's been reading
      -- something the size of a dictionary -- but can't help
      returning his gaze to the TV.
      He freezes at the sound of a KNOCK at the DOOR. Embar-
      rassed by what he's been watching, he quickly turns off
      the TV, and goes to answer the door, still holding the
      book.

      Julius opens the door, revealing Marnie, who walks in
      right past him.

                   Hi -- Vince and Linda want to be                        *
                   alone, so I'm afraid I'm going to
                   stay here. Which bed should I
                   take?
                                 JULIUS
                          (stunned)
                   Either... I always sleep on the
                   floor.

      Watched by Julius, Marnie pulls the curtains shut, kills
      the overhead lights, all the while providing him with
      glimpses of various parts of her anatomy. She gets into
      one of the beds, turns off the bedside lamp.
                                 MARNIE
                   Good night.
                                 JULIUS
                   Good night.
      Julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed
      onto the floor between the two beds, then shuts off the
      other lamp.
      Silence...
                                 MARNIE
                   This mattress is awful.
      Getting out of bed, she pulls the blanket and pillow
      with her as she steps over Julius, who tries not to look
      up, and gets into the other bed.
                                  MARNIE
                   Sorry.   Good night.

                                 JULIUS
                   Good night.

      Silence...

                                 MARNIE
                   This mattress is just as bad as
                   the other one.

      She gets out, again dragging the blanket and pillow,
      puts them down on the floor next to Julius. She crawls
      under the blanket, turns her back to him.

                   This is better... Good night.

                                   JULIUS
                   Good night.

      Silence.     Marnie shivers, chattering her teeth.

                                   JULIUS
                   Are you cold?

                                   MARNIE
                   It's alright.
                                 JULIUS
                   No, please, take my shirt.      I'm               *
                   baking.
      Julius strips it off and hands it to her. She puts it
      on and pulls the blanket over her shoulder. Again she
      shivers.
                                 JULIUS
                   You still cold?


                                   MARNIE
                   Just my legs.

      Julius lies there, thinking about it.
                                 JULIUS
                   Well, I could give you my...

                                    MARNIE
                             (sitting up)
                   Thanks.

      Julius reaches under the blanket, removes his bottoms and
      passes them over. Marnie puts them on under her blanket.

                                 JULIUS
                   Anything else?
                                 MARNIE
                   I'd love a glass of water.

                                    JULIUS
                             (realizes that he's
                              now nude)
                   Right.

      He wraps his blanket around his waist, goes into the
      bathroom, comes out with a glass of water. He hands it
      to her.

      She spills the water all over her top and bedding.
                                MARNIE
                   Oh, great!

      She starts stripping off everything she's wearing.      Julius
      averts his eyes.

                                 MARNIE
                   Do you mind if I share your
                   blanket? -- Mine's all wet.

                                 JULIUS
                          (gulps)
                   No -- that would be okay.
      They both lie down under his blanket.      Silence...
                                 MARNIE
                   Could we switch sides?   I like to
                   sleep on the left.
                                JULIUS
                   Sure.
      She starts to roll over Julius, then pauses directly
      above him and looks him dead in the eye.
                                 MARNIE
                   Can I ask you something for a
                   change?
                                JULIUS
                   Anything.

                                 MARNIE
                   Do you like me? I mean, even a
                   little bit?

                                 JULIUS
                   I... I'm crazy about you, Marnie.
                   But there's something about me
                   you ought to know.

      Marnie tenses, expecting the worst.
                                MARNIE
                   What?

                                 JULIUS
                          (looking away)
                   I'm a virgin.

      "thank you." She smiles down at Julius and starts very
      gently kissing him.

      Linda, dressed in a negligee, comes out of the bathroom
      area. Vince, wearing pajamas, is on the floor, legs
      curled under the bed, doing sit-ups.

                   back, I think we should move in

148    EXT. WHISPERING PINES - DAY                                     148

       In the mountains, which dramatically tower over a lovely,
       wide park-like area with a large adobe building and a few
       smaller satellite huts.
       The car drives up a long, dusty driveway to the entrance,
       which is protected by high gates. Our principals exit
       the car.
       They approach the fortress-like gated entrance, gazing
       around at the magnificent scenery. Both men carry flowers
       and seem self-conscious about the prospect of finally
       meeting their mother.
                                  JULIUS
                    It's very beautiful, isn't it,

                    Not to mention valuable -- real
                    estate like this must be worth a
                    fortune.

                                  JULIUS
                           (a rebuke)
                    You mustn't always think of money.

                    that's a worry she won't have to
                    have in her old age.
       Julius smiles at Vince and rings the bell. A MALE
       CUSTODIAN answers the door -- friendly but very firm.

                                  CUSTODIAN

       garden, with pathways, shady trees, all very lovely, with
       a great view of the sun setting against the surrounding
       mountains.

       Their attention is drawn to -- A PAINTER working at an
       easel. Several young artists are gathered around her,
       admiringly. This is happening underneath a beautiful old
       tree and the sight is just lovely.

       on her knees. She's in work clothes, smudged, hair in
       a bandana. Maybe 60, there's something terribly appealing
       about her. She's her own woman. She gets up from her
       knees now as they approach -- but not before we note the
       quality of her gardening -- it's the size Julius had
       back on the island.

                    buy Whispering Pines so that young
                    artists would have a place to
                    work.

                do something.

                thinking so well right now --
                on account of what you found out

      He drives inside a large warehouse, parks, gets out and
      looks warily around. He opens the trunk, unzips the
      sleeping bag, revealing the merchandise.

                Step away from that car, Mr.

      Vince turns to see Beetroot coming out of the warehouse,
      accompanied by his BODYGUARD carrying an attache case and
      holding a gun. The Bodyguard pats Vince down.

      Vince closes his eyes, waiting for the bullet that he
      knows is coming. When he opens his eyes the Bodyguard
      is holding the attache case open to show him the five
      million dollars.

      He can't believe he's pulled it off. Beetroot and the
      Bodyguard get into the Cadillac.
      The Caddy speeds away while Vince clutches the attache
      case to his chest and does a little dance of triumph.
      The big score at last! TWO SHOTS RING out. Vince freezes
      and sees --

       Suddenly the load hanging from the boom of a nearby crane
       smashes into Webster's back, and then dumps on him,
       burying him in rubble.

       at the newspaper in astonishment. It's being held in
       front of her by the Painter from the earlier scene, who
       gently places the newspaper into Mary Anne's hands.

       As Linda comes through the door, gets her mail from the
       mailbox. She turns and comes face-to-face with Vince,
       standing there with a contrite look on his face.

       key. Vince follows, speaking softly, his sincerity
       absolutely genuine.

       them is pushing a double-stroller with identical twin
       babies inside! It's the twin children that are the
       source of the women's wonder, and Vince and Julius' as
       well.
       Vince and Julius both yawn simultaneously.

                                 JULIUS

                   too?

      They both stop the strollers, look down lovingly at their
      kids, begin fondling them. Vince and Julius, simultan-
      eously flip identical baby rattles and shake them at
      their twins.

                                 JULIUS
                          (to baby #1)
                   I think you need your diaper
                   changed.
                          (to baby #2)
                   What a surprise -- so do you.

      Vince becomes aware of the condition of his kids'
      diapers.

      They both start pushing their strollers again.
                                 JULIUS
                   Just think what we'd be like if
                   we'd been raised together.

          In the darkness, we hear a voice, a woman's voice.  Her name
          is Evey.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November, the gunpowder treason and
                    plot.  I know of now reason why the
                    gunpowder treason should ever be
                    forgot."
          
          Her voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness, a
          deep centered peace that we can feel.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Those were almost the very first
                    words he spoke to me and, in a way,
                    that is where this story began,
                    four hundred years ago, in a cellar
                    beneath the Houses of Parliament.
          
          In the darkness, we find a lantern.  Guy Fawkes, a dangerous
          man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow
          stacked with barrels of gunpowder.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to
                    blow up the Houses of Parliament.
          
          The wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the
          cellar floor.  From the dark depths, we hear the sound of
          dogs.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    He was caught in the cellars with
                    enough gunpowder to level most of
                    London.
          
          Guy sees lanterns coming from both sides.  He tries to run as
          the dogs reach him first.  He grabs for his sword as dozens
          of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Sometimes I wonder where we would
                    be if he hadn't failed.  I wonder
                    if it would have mattered.
          
          In the dim pre-dawn light, Guy is led to the gallows.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I suppose the answer is in the
                    rhyme.  More than the man, what we
                    must remember is the plot itself.
          
          The coarse noose of rope is snugged up to Guy's throat.  He
          looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face,
          staring up at him.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    For in the plot we find more than
                    just a man, we find the idea of
                    that man, the spirit of that man,
                    and that is what we must never
                    forget.
          
          The lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling
          down her face.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    This, then, is the story of that
                    idea, of that spirit that began
                    with an anarchist's plot four
                    hundred years ago.
          
          Guy's body hangs in silhouette, lifeless against a red
          morning sun.

          INT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE
          
          A young Evey sits on her father's lap, combing her Barbie's
          hair.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I was born near the end of the
                    millennium, the year 1997.  My
                    father used to say that people were
                    so afraid that the world was going
                    to end that they were willing it to
                    happen.
          
          Her father sits beside her mother on the living room couch,
          watching the news.  From the look on their faces, the news is
          bad.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I don't remember much of the
                    century's turn.  I don't remember
                    the market crash or the plague or
                    any of the Trafalgar riots.
          
          The television flickers with images of heavily armed soldiers
          fighting in a shelled city.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I've read about them since but I
                    don't recall how any of them
                    impacted my life except for the
                    fear.  They would hide it from me,
                    like a secret between them.
          
          Little Evey sees her father staring at her mother.  They
          take hold of each other's hand, clasping them tight.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    But I could feel it.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          It is a new day.  People are gathered along the street as if
          they were waiting for a parade.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Of the chaos that seemed to swallow
                    the beginning of the 21st century,
                    there is one thing I do remember.
          
          Evey holds her father's hand.  Unable to see what is coming,
          she can hear it.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Very clearly, I can remember that
                    sound.
          
          We hear them, hundreds of marching soldiers.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And I remember those boots, black
                    leather that gleamed bright in the
                    morning sun.  I had never seen such
                    boots.  All moving in perfect
                    unison.
          
          Little Evey hides in the forest of adults, clinging to her
          father's leg, staring as row after row of boots march by with
          military precision.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          In the midst of a political rally for the emerging new party
          calling itself Norsefire, we find little Evey now on her
          father's shoulders.
          
          Dascombe, a young man, paces the podium, inciting the crowd.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    The time has come, London, to
                    return to a bygone age, an age of
                    tradition, an age of values that
                    have been disparaged and all but
                    forgotten.  What this country needs
                    is a leader!  A true leader to
                    remind us of that age.  A righteous
                    leader with the strength of his
                    moral convictions to do what must
                    be done.  I give you that man!  I
                    give you our leader!  Adam Susan!
          
          Adam Susan rises and the crowd cheers.  Evey's father looks
          at her mother and again they clasp hands.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    It must have seemed so easy to
                    them.  They offered such a simple
                    deal; give up control and we will
                    restore order.
          
          INT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE
          
          Little Evey is asleep in her bedroom.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    At first, the arrests were
                    political.  Dissidents.  Radicals. 
                    Liberals.
          
          A loud crash of splintering wood wakes her up.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    When my parents were younger, they
                    had been activists.  They had
                    marched with Labor in the great
                    train strike.
          
          The sound of heavy boots swarms through the house.
          
                              LITTLE EVEY
                    Mommy?
          
          Her bedroom door bursts open and a heavily armed soldier
          scoops her up.
          
          She is carried through the dark house which is filled with
          soldiers.  On the floor of the living room, she sees her
          parents being bound with plastic zip-ties.
          
                              MOTHER
                    My daughter!  Don't take my
                    daughter!
          
                              FATHER
                    Evey!  Evey!
          
                              LITTLE EVEY
                    Mommy!  Daddy!
          
          A heavy black hood is pulled over each of her parent's heads
          as Evey is carried out of the house.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I never saw them again.  Overnight,
                    my life, my entire world was
                    erased.
          
          INT.  BATHROOM
          
          A nun with a switch in her crossed arms watches as Evey and
          several other little girls scrub the floor of a dormitory
          bathroom.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    It was done so quickly and
                    violently, so completely, that it
                    began to seem that it had never
                    even existed.
          
          A tear rolls down Little Evey's cheek.
          
          EXT.  HOUSE
          
          A gay man is dragged violently from his Piccadilly home. 
          Outside, he sees his lover being forced to the cobblestones.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    The homosexuals were next.  What
                    God had started with AIDS had to be
                    finished by man.  It was God's
                    work.  That's what we were told.
          
          He reaches for him as the clubs rise and fall, vicious and
          bloody.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    But once they were gone, there was
                    someone else.  Someone different.
          
          In another neighborhood, we see the police arresting
          Pakistanis.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Someone dangerous.
          
          In a different area, young black men are packed into a caged
          van so tightly they are unable to move.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    There were those who understood
                    what was happening, who knew it was
                    wrong but who kept silent.
          
          A young detective named Finch looks down as the van pulls
          away.  When he looks up, another man in a military uniform
          whose name is Almond is watching him.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And in the vacuum of that silence,
                    order was imposed.
          
          Finch sticks his pipe in his mouth and turns away.
          
          EXT.  STREET
          
          Again, we see the marching boots.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Order that was like those boots,
                    order that required rigorous
                    discipline.  Order that is exactly
                    the same, where each single step
                    falls with every step.  The order
                    of the many shaped into one.
          
          We move through the columns of marching soldiers to a wall
          where a poster has been plastered up.  The poster reads,
          "Strength Through Purity, Purity Through Faith."
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Somehow in my heart, I knew it
                    wouldn't last.
          
          As the sound of the marching fades, a shadow falls over the
          sign.
          
          After a moment, we hear the hiss of spray paint.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    What they thought they had crushed,
                    the spirit they believed trampled
                    and ground beneath the marching of
                    their boots, rose up, rose as if
                    from a four hundred year old grave,
                    rose to remind us all that day.
          
          The shadow sprays a "V" over the poster.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.
          
          FADE IN:
          
          Close on a loudspeaker.  There is one on every major street
          corner.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Good evening, London.  It's nine
                    o'clock, the fourth of November in
                    the year 2019 and this is the voice
                    of Fate broadcasting on 275 and 285
                    of the medium wave.
          
          Beneath the loudspeaker is a surveillance system labeled,
          "For your protection."
          
          Bubble eyed lenses iris at the end of stalks that move,
          insect-like, racheting and clicking as they watch a little
          girl pedal her bicycle.  The little girl glances nervously
          over her shoulder up at the mechanical eyes watching her.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    People of London, be advised --
          
          EXT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
          
          There is a radio on a small makeup table.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    -- that Braxton and Streathon are
                    quarantine zones as of today.
          
          Evey is now a young woman.  She slips into a dress that is
          little more than a nightgown.  She tries to adjust it,
          pulling it down at the hem, pulling it up at the thin
          shoulder straps, but it is like trying to hide behind a
          lamppost.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    It is suggested that these area be
                    avoided for reasons of health and
                    safety.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Another radio in a room that seems to be of another world.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Good news following the
                    productivity reports from
                    Herefordshire indicating a possible
                    end to meat rationing starting mid
                    February.
          
          A man enters the room as he once entered the world.  His body
          is lean and strong and though we do not see his face, there
          is a strength in his carriage, a power to his presence.
          
          INT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
          
          She packs tissue paper into the toes of a pair of high heels
          that are too big for her.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Police raided seventeen homes in
                    the Birmingham area, uncovering
                    what is believed to be a major
                    terrorist ring.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          We move over a dressing bureau, past a wig and over a pair of
          black leather gloves, moving until we find the mask; it is
          like something from the masquerade ball of another era.  It
          has an exaggerated goatee, harlequin cheeks and a smile,
          forever fixed, at once be-guiling and be-deviling.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Twenty eight people, eight of them
                    women, are currently in detention
                    awaiting trial.
          
          INT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
          
          Evey coats her lips with a lascivious red.  She stares into
          the mirror, her makeup like a mask over her own face.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    And that is the face of London
                    tonight.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The man, now fully dressed in cloak, hat, and mask gazes into
          the mirror.
          
          This is V.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    And this is the voice of Fate
                    signing off and bidding you a
                    pleasant evening.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Close on Evey's high heels, stumbling and awkward as she
          walks down a dark cobblestoned street.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Close on V's boots walking in the opposite direction so that
          it seems they are walking towards each other.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I don't know what brought us
                    together that night.  I had never
                    been to that part of Westminster
                    but ever since I've known him, I've
                    stopped believing in coincidence.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Evey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow.
          
                              EVEY
                    Excuse me?  Uh... excuse me,
                    Mister?
          
          The man turns around.  It is not V.
          
                              EVEY
                    Would you like... uh, would you
                    like to sleep with me?
          
          He smiles.
          
                              EVEY
                    I mean, for money.
          
                              MAN
                    That is the clumsiest bit of
                    propositioning I've ever heard.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, I'm sorry.
          
                              MAN
                    Is this your first time, darling?
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, no, I mean for money.  But I
                    know what you want and I'll do it.
          
          She presses her body to his, using her little girl eyes and
          her woman's mouth.
          
                              EVEY
                    Anything you want, mister.  Please,
                    I need the money.  I know I'm young
                    but I promise I know what I'm
                    doing.
          
                              MAN
                    No.  You don't know what you're
                    doing.
          
          He pulls out his wallet and shows her a badge.  The sight of
          it knocks the breath out of her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Christ, you're a Fingerman.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    Give the little lady a prize.
          
                              FINGERMAN 2
                    I've got something to give her.
          
          Evey turns and there are more Fingermen behind her.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    Prostitution is a class H offense. 
                    Know what that means?  It means
                    that we get to exercise our own
                    judicial discretion --
          
                              FINGERMAN 2
                    And you get to swallow it.
          
          The Fingermen laugh.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, please.  It's my first
                    time.  Please don't hurt me.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    Gosh, fellas, look at those big
                    innocent eyes.  What do you think?
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    Spare the rod, spoil the child.
          
          Fingerman 2 laughs hard as he drops his pants.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh no!
          
          He shoves her face first against a brick wall, lifting her
          dress to expose her bottom.
          
                              EVEY
                    Please, don't!
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    You heard the man, sweetie.  This
                    rod's for your own good.
          
          Suddenly, they are no longer alone.
          
                              V
                    "The multiplying villainies of
                    nature do swarm upon him."
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    What the hell --
          
                              V
                    "And fortune, on his damned
                    quarrel, smiling, showed like a
                    rebel's whore."
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    We're police officers, pal.
          
                              FINGERMAN 4
                    We're with the Finger.
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    So bugger off!
          
                              V
                    "Disdaining fortune with his
                    brandished steel, which smoked with
                    bloody execution."
          
          In the clenched fist of black leather, we see a flash of
          steel.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    He's got a knife!
          
          V attacks and at once we know this is no normal human being. 
          A single blow sends the largest of the Fingermen flying
          backwards.
          
          But more than his strength, it is his speed.
          
          A gun is cocked but before the hammer falls, a knife is
          buried in the Fingerman's chest and --
          
          Before the body falls, the knife is gone.
          
          It takes a handful of seconds and three bodies lay on the
          ground.  V turns to the last Fingerman who is struggling to
          pull his pants up.
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    Jesus Christ!  Don't hurt me!
          
          V steps forward and he screams, bolting while holding his
          pants up.
          
                              V
                    Good evening.
          
                              EVEY
                    Who -- Who are you?
          
                              V
                    Me?  I imagine all manner of names
                    shall be heaped upon my humble
                    visage but, for now, let us simply
                    say I am the villain.
          
          He throws wide his cloak and bows deeply to her.
          
                              V
                    And you would be?
          
                              EVEY
                    Evey.
          
                              V
                    Of course.
          
          They hear sirens rushing towards them.  In a blink, he scoops
          her up and dashes into the shadows of a narrow alleyway.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOPS
          
          Police cars and several ambulances swarm over the area with
          the dead Fingermen.
          
          V watches them from above.
          
                              EVEY
                    Why did you do that?  Why did
                    you... help me?
          
                              V
                    Why indeed?
          
          He takes out an old antique pocket watch.  It is almost
          midnight.
          
                              V
                    Almost time.
          
                              EVEY
                    For what?
          
                              V
                    For the music.
          
                              EVEY
                    Music?
          
                              V
                    Yes, music.  My music.  You see. 
                    Evey, I am a performer.
          
                              EVEY
                    Is that why you're wearing a mask?
          
                              V
                    We all wear masks.  Life creates
                    them and forces us to find the one
                    that fits.  Do you know what day it
                    is?
          
                              EVEY
                    Uh... November fourth.
          
                              V
                    Not for long.
          
          He looks out where, rising above the rooftops, he can see Big
          Ben.
          
                              V
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November, the gunpowder treason and
                    plot.  I know of no reason why the
                    gunpowder treason should ever be
                    forgot."
          
          The second hand sweeps into the final minute.
          
                              V
                    Tell me, Evey, what good is an
                    actor that plays his part to an
                    empty theatre?
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't know.
          
                              V
                    Nor do I.  That's why you are here. 
                    I need you, Evey.  I need someone
                    to listen.
          
                              EVEY
                    To your music?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  Yes, to my music.
          
          From his sleeve, he pulls a conductor's wand.
          
                              V
                    Can you hear it?  It's already
                    begun.
          
          He begins to lightly tap the wand in the air and, very
          faintly, we hear it.
          
                              EVEY
                    I can't hear anything.
          
                              V
                    At first, you have to listen very
                    carefully...
          
          He continues to conduct and we begin to hear the music,
          violins and horns that seem almost like a whisper or a wind
          that steadily swells.
          
                              V
                    Ahh, yes.  There it is.  Beautiful,
                    is it not?
          
          He turns to the parapet, his gestures growing grander as the
          music rises and we recognize Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture.
          
          The music mounts a climax and V points the wand at Big Ben as
          cymbals crash --
          
          Big Ben explodes with such force the world seems to shake,
          while --
          
          V, smiling, always smiling, points again with another
          crescendo and --
          
          The statue of justice is blown to smithereens.
          
          V nods in appreciation while mustering the music towards it's
          finale as fireworks begin lighting up the sky.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh my...
          
          Everywhere across the city, people stand transfixed by the
          dazzling shimmer of the fireworks until --
          
          A strobing final blitz leaves a single, starry image floating
          in the smoke filled sky.
          
          It is the letter V.
          
                              EVEY
                    It's beautiful...
          
                              V
                    Thank you.
          
          From every direction, the city screams with the panicked
          sound of sirens.
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          A massive modern building that is the seat of the new
          government.
          
          A long, black car pulls up to the entrance.  Adam Susan gets
          out, wearing a long black trenchcoat over his pajamas.  He is
          the Leader and he looks older, heavier, and meaner.
          
          He hurries past the heavily armed guards, barely
          acknowledging the snap and cock of their Nazi-like salute.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader enters his main chambers and we see the Fate
          computer system.
          
          It is a cerebral cortex for a vast intelligence network. 
          Information can almost be felt coursing through its hard
          drives.
          
          The Leader sits, at once regaining a measure of composure. 
          He takes a deep calming breath and accesses the system.
          
          Dozens of monitors fill with images from all across the city,
          most of them are of the damage caused by V.
          
                              LEADER
                    Gentlemen, I will hear your reports
                    now.  Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye.
          
          Conrad Heyer appears on one of the screens.  He is at his
          desk inside the command center for the Eye, the governmental
          organization responsible for the visual surveillance systems.
          
                              CONRAD
                    We have less than two minutes of
                    usable footage, Leader.  It took
                    the suspect less than a minute to
                    dispatch the Finger's vice patrol.
          
          On an insert screen, we see grainy footage of V rescuing Evey
          from one of the pole-mounted cameras.
          
                              CONRAD
                    As you can see, the suspect's
                    reflex speed is extraordinary.  As
                    is his strength.
          
          As the last body falls, V seems to pause and looks back over
          his shoulder straight into the camera.
          
                              LEADER
                    Freeze it!
          
          The Leader stares at the smiling face.
          
                              CONRAD
                    I'm afraid the mask makes retinal
                    identification impossible.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Etheridge, report for the Ear!
          
          Bunny Etheridge appears on another screen.  Behind him, huge
          spooling reels of audiotape wind constantly.
          
                              ETHERIDGE
                    We were able to triangulate the
                    origin of the fireworks.  We also
                    are currently monitoring a lot of
                    phone surveillance indicating a
                    high percentage of conversation
                    concerned with the explosions.  All
                    suspect or significant transcripts
                    are being forwarded to Mr. Almond.
          
                              LEADER
                    Very good.  Mr. Finch, speak for
                    the Nose.
          
          Finch, no longer the same young man, stands at the site of
          the fireworks launch.
          
                              FINCH
                    Thanks to Etheridge, we found the
                    launch for the fireworks.  These
                    appear to be individually weighted
                    flares and we have found traces of
                    the same chemicals at both of the
                    detonation sites which leads us to
                    conclude that, despite a level of
                    sophistication, these devices are
                    all home-made with over the counter
                    chemicals, making them impossible
                    to trace.  Whoever he is, Leader,
                    he's good.
          
                              LEADER
                    Thank you for that professional
                    annotation.
          
          An intercom opens.
          
                              LIEUTENANT (V.O.)
                    Leader, Mr. Almond has arrived.
          
                              LEADER
                    Very good.  Gentlemen, keep me
                    informed of any further
                    developments.  England prevails.
          
          They answer in unison as Almond enters the office.  His face
          is harder but he has the same violent gleam in his eye.
          
          The Leader turns in his chair.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Almond, do you know what this
                    is behind me?
          
                              ALMOND
                    Uh... the Fate computer system,
                    sir?
          
                              LEADER
                    No.  No sir.  It's more than that. 
                    This, this computer is a symbol,
                    Mr. Almond.  A symbol of the
                    highest attainable goal of mankind. 
                    Do you know what that goal is, Mr.
                    Almond?
          
          Almond does not.  The Leader leaps from his chair while
          pounding the desk.
          
                              LEADER
                    Control, Mr. Almond!  Control!  The
                    world around us is a changing,
                    directionless, amoral morass and it
                    is up to man and man alone to set
                    things right!
          
          He moves around the desk at Almond.
          
                              LEADER
                    Without control, man is nothing
                    more than any other stinking,
                    sweating, brute animal.  Control,
                    Mr. Almond.  The control that we
                    have painstakingly built up over
                    the last ten years.  Now, do you
                    understand what happened last
                    night?
          
                              ALMOND
                    We... lost control.
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Almond.  Last night
                    someone did the unthinkable. 
                    Someone hurt us.  It is imperative
                    that we act swiftly and precisely. 
                    I want that man found, Mr. Almond. 
                    I want his head or, by god, I'll
                    have yours.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey is wearing a blindfold and V leads her by her
          fingertips, guiding her almost as if they were dancing...
          
          His fingers slip free of her and she reaches out.
          
                              EVEY
                    Wait.  I've lost you.
          
                              V
                    No, you haven't.
          
          He is behind her and he removes the blindfold, revealing his
          house to her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh...
          
          It is a labyrinth of interconnecting underground tunnels and
          rooms.
          
          The gallery is the main room as it is filled with an amazing
          collection of human culture.  There is art that spans from
          the renaissance to the painted covers of Eerie comics,
          literature that ranges from Shakespeare to Spillane,
          philosophy from Plato to Bukowski, and a vast collection of
          nonfiction.
          
          There are movie posters everywhere and an entire wall is
          lined with videocassettes.
          
          A jukebox stands in front of an enormous vinyl and CD
          collection of music.
          
                              EVEY
                    A jukebox?  Where did you get it?
          
                              V
                    I saved it.  Like everything here.
          
          She punches a button and Billie Holiday begins to sing.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh, it's beautiful.  I've never
                    heard anything like it.
          
                              V
                    Of course not.  You grew up in
                    their world.  Art is created by
                    individuals and there are no
                    individuals in a world where you
                    are told what to think.
          
                              EVEY
                    This place is amazing.
          
                              V
                    You're welcome to stay.
          
          She stops suddenly and looks at him.  The offer is terribly
          exciting but it is so unlike anything she has ever done that
          it's almost impossible to imagine.
          
                              EVEY
                    Stay here... with you?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  If you like.
          
                              EVEY
                    I... I don't even know your name.
          
                              V
                    I don't have a name.  But you can
                    call me V.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?  V... I like that.
          
          And she returns his smile.
          
          EXT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          The only operating broadcast tower in London; home of the
          Mouth.
          
          INT.  RADIO BROADCAST BOOTH
          
          Lewis Prothero leans forward and lets his voice pour like
          syrup over the microphone.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Good morning, London.  This is the
                    voice of Fate -- Damn.
          
          He stops and coughs.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Good morning -- ack.  Good morning
                    Lond-- Goddammit!  Where is my
                    bloody tea?!
          
          In the control booth, Roger Dascombe, his hair thinner now,
          rubs his temple.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Would someone get his lordship his
                    bloody tea?
          
          He clicks on the microphone.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Lewis, they want this report on the
                    first hour --
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I know.  I know.  Damned
                    inconvenient this entire affair. 
                    Fine.  Let's try again.
          
          He clears his voice and the red "record" light turns on.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Good morning, London.  It is 6 am,
                    the fifth of November 2019 and this
                    is the voice of Fate.  The new day
                    brings good news and bright
                    prospects from overseas, where
                    negotiations with New China are
                    moving in a positive direction. 
                    Last night's scheduled demolition
                    of two deteriorating landmarks went
                    off without a hitch.
          
          Dascombe is unable to stop himself from smiling.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Spokesman for the Interior ministry
                    said both structures were severely
                    damaged and judged to be a danger
                    to the unsuspecting public.  Plans
                    for new landmarks are well
                    underway.
          
          Prothero sits back, shaking his head.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Do you believe this crap, Dascombe?
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    It's not our job to believe it,
                    Lewis.  Our job is to tell the
                    people --
          
                              PROTHERO
                    "Exactly what they tell us."  I
                    Know but do you think that people
                    will believe it?
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    They will if it's you that's
                    telling it to them.  Now let's try
                    it again.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V is alone, listening to the first morning broadcast.
          
                              PROTHERO (V.O.)
                    ... plans for new landmarks are
                    already well underway.
          
          He clicks off the radio.  Walking down a hall, he stops and
          peers into Evey's new bedroom.
          
          She is fast asleep, looking remarkably at peace.  Quietly, he
          shuts the door.
          
          EXT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          People are hurrying to board a departing train.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero is staring out his window.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November..."
          
          He talks to his bodyguards almost as if talking to himself.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Do you suppose that's why he did
                    it?
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    Sir, who did what, sir?
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Guy Fawkes.  He tried to blow up
                    Parliament.
          
          The guards look at each other, confused.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Don't they teach history in school
                    anymore?
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    Sir, we're both straight military,
                    sir.
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    Sir, yes, sir.  I was fighting in
                    Ireland by the time I was sixteen.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Yes, of course.  My mistake.
          
          He turns back to his window.
          
          EXT.  RAILROAD
          
          The train rumbles along, heading for a tunnel.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero watches the countryside rolling past.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I love trains.  I remember riding
                    the underground with my father. 
                    Shame they shut them all down.
          
          Bodyguard 1 looks out the opposite window just as the train
          enters the tunnel.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    What the hell's that!
          
          EXT.  TRAIN
          
          For a flashing instant, we see V in silhouette, cloak
          swirling around him like dark wings as he jumps from the
          bridge onto the train.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero and Bodyguard 2 stare at Bodyguard 1.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    I thought I saw a man jumping onto
                    the train.
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    The train's doing almost seventy. 
                    It would break his legs.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    You're right, I... It must have
                    been rags.
          
          EXT.  TRAIN
          
          Deep in the tunnel, a dark figure glides across the rooftops.
          
          INT.  CONDUCTOR'S CAB
          
          The conductor hears something on the roof.  He peers up just
          as V swings down, smashing feet first into the cab.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          The brakes suddenly lock, throwing Bodyguard 2 into Prothero.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Get off of me!
          
          A moment later, the lights are cut off and the entire train
          is plunged into complete darkness.
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    What the fuck is going on?
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    Lock the car doors.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I have a lighter... somewhere...
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    I can't find the lock -- wait.  Hey
                    wha--
          
          There is a muffled shriek followed by a sharp snap.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    What's happening --
          
          There is another sound, like the leather slap of a boxer
          pounding a heavy bag, followed by the sound of the heavy bag
          collapsing onto the floor.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I found it!
          
          He flicks on the lighter and, in the dim light of its flame,
          he sees the smiling face.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh god.
          
          V sits casually, arms folded, across from Prothero.  The
          bodyguards lay dead on the floor.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Who are you?  What do you want? 
                    Money?  Is that it?
          
          V just smiles.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Wait, wait.  You're, you're the one
                    that blew the Bailey.
          
          V nods and Prothero's eyes go wide.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    You're making a mistake.  I'm
                    nobody --
          
          On the floor, he sees the bodyguard's gun.  He kills the
          lighter and dives for it.
          
          In the darkness, we hear the struggle.  It ends quickly. 
          When the lighter flicks back on, V is holding it and the gun.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh god, what do you want?
          
                              V
                    I've come to offer you a choice. 
                    Commander Prothero.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    What -- What did you call me?
          
                              V
                    Commander Prothero.
          
          Prothero's heart begins to pound.
          
                              V
                    That was your title at Larkhill. 
                    You remember Larkhill, don't you,
                    Commander?
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL RESETTLEMENT CAMP - FLASHBACK
          
          A sign reads, "Larkhill Resettlement Camp."
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Where they sent the undesirables.
          
          A caged truck packed with minorities rolls into the gates
          which are topped with spools of razor wire.

          Prothero is sweating.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I don't know what you're talking
                    about.
          
                              V
                    Maybe I can help your memory. 
                    Let's see.  Larkhill opened in the
                    summer of 2009.  You were appointed
                    it commander.  You wore a uniform
                    in those days.  You looked very
                    good in it.
          
          INT.  LARKHILL - PROTHERO'S OFFICE - FLASHBACK
          
          Prothero admires his uniform in the mirror.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You were a man of many
                    responsibilities.  You made sure
                    Larkhill made all its quotas,
                    especially the oven quotas even
                    though they required an excessive
                    amount of maintenance.
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL OVENS - FLASHBACK
          
          We see a detail of black and Indian men, shoveling mounds of
          black ash from a series of furnace like ovens.
          
          As the shovels lift, we see blackened bones and burnt skulls.
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL MAIN YARD - FLASHBACK
          
          Prothero saunters through the lines of camp prisoners.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    But there was one task you took to
                    with exceptional relish.  Remember
                    the medical block, Commander?  I
                    believe you called it the funny
                    farm.  You were the one that
                    selected the prisoners.  You hand
                    picked each one.
          
          Prothero steps in front of a woman who remains beautiful
          despite the suffering she has endured.  Prothero smiles.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Her.
          
          As the guards grab her, we become aware of a man that is
          staring at Prothero.  He is one of the prisoners but we do
          not see his face.
          
          Prothero notices the man.  He doesn't like the way the man is
          staring at him.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    You.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero is terrified.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    You!  You're him, aren't you?
          
          V nods.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh my god!  What are you going to
                    do?
          
                              V
                    You gave us a choice, remember,
                    Commander?  You said we could
                    cooperate with the doctors or...
          
          V cocks the gun.
          
                              V
                    Hold out your hand.
          
          Trembling, Prothero sticks out his hand.  V lets the light
          die for a moment.
          
          When he flicks it back on, Prothero is holding a long, metal
          syringe filled with a murky liquid.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh no, no!  Please I was just doing
                    what I was told!
          
                              V
                    Of course you were.  Now I'm
                    telling you to make a choice. 
                    Either you stick that syringe into
                    your neck or --
          
          He presses the gun barrel to Prothero's forehead.
          
                              V
                    I can kill you right now.
          
          Prothero begins to blubber.
          
                              V
                    Crying doesn't help, Commander.  I
                    remember there was a woman who had
                    been screaming for two days.  You
                    winked at the doctor and laughed,
                    "All in the name of science."
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Please, don't make me do this...
          
                              V
                    It's a difficult choice, isn't it? 
                    Certain death versus something that
                    might be... worse.  But you never
                    know.  There is still a chance. 
                    You could survive.  Look at me. 
                    Now, time's up, Commander.  Choose.
          
          Anger galvanizes his fear and steadily Prothero lifts the
          needle towards his neck.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I'll see you in hell.
          
          He jams the needle in and sinks the plunger.
          
                              V
                    Yes.  I'm quite sure you will.
          
          INT.  TRAIN
          
          Train workers with flashlights hurry through the cars.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    This door's locked!
          
          He slams a shoulder against it and the door gives in.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    Holy Christ!
          
          Flashlights sweep over the dead bodyguards.  The train man
          hears a strange gurgling rasp and he turns, finding Prothero
          in his light.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    What happened here?
          
          Prothero is foaming at the mouth while a thick mucus bubbles
          from his nose.  His breath comes in tiny rasps.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    Good lord!  I need a medic here.
          
          Prothero becomes more animate, trying to tell the man
          something.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Fi... Fi... Fi...
          
                              TRAIN MAN 2
                    He's trying to say something.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Five.
          
                              TRAIN MAN 1
                    Five?  Where's the goddamn medic?
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Room five.
          
          Suddenly, his body convulses and blood pours out his ears. 
          His body slumps over.
          
                              TRAIN MAN 2
                    I think he needs a priest.
          
          EXT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          The station is swarming with police.  A stretcher wheels a
          body in a black plastic bag out from Prothero's car.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Finch puffs on his pipe, staring at something spray painted
          on the wall of the train car: a "V" with a circle around it.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    What do you make of this, Mr.
                    Finch?
          
          Dominic, Finch's younger assistant, is holding a flower in
          his rubber gloved hand.
          
                              FINCH
                    Hmm.  It's a rose.  A violet
                    carson, I believe.  Strange.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Strange?
          
                              FINCH
                    I didn't think they still existed.
          
                              SOLDIER
                    Mr. Finch!  Sir!
          
          Finch turns as a soldier with a radio steps into the car.
          
                              SOLDIER
                    Sir, they want you at headquarters,
                    sir.
          
                              FINCH
                    Now?
          
                              SOLDIER
                    Yes, sir.  I'm to transport you
                    immediately.
          
                              FINCH
                    Send the rose to the lab.  Also,
                    scrape a sample of this paint and
                    have it analyzed as well.  I'll be
                    back as soon as I can.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The door opens and Finch steps in.
          
                              LEADER
                    Ah, Mr. Finch.  I sent for you
                    because what I have to say cannot
                    be said over a phone or a radio. 
                    What I have to say cannot leave
                    these four walls.  Do I make myself
                    clear?
          
                              FINCH
                    Yes, sir.
          
                              LEADER
                    I believe in a few things, Mr.
                    Finch.  I believe in god.  I
                    believe in the destiny of the
                    Nordic race.  And I believe in
                    fascism.  The romans invented
                    fascism.  They had a symbol for it;
                    a bundle of twigs bound together. 
                    One twig could be broken but a
                    bundle would prevail.  That is the
                    heart and soul of fascism. 
                    Strength in unity.  I tell you
                    these things knowing full well that
                    they make you uncomfortable.
          
                              FINCH
                    Well, I...
          
                              LEADER
                    You have in fact expressed your
                    discomfort in several arrest
                    reports, arrests that were, in your
                    opinion, "unnecessary."  The fact
                    that you are here, that you are not
                    rotting in a prison cell, is a mark
                    of my respect and admiration for
                    you, for your craft, and for what
                    you have done for this country.
          
          Finch looks at the ground.
          
                              LEADER
                    It is also because I know you,
                    Finch.  I know what you are. 
                    You're a man like me.  A man who
                    understands when they are given a
                    job what must be done.  I
                    understand you, Finch, and that is
                    why I can trust you.
          
          He moves in close to Finch.
          
                              LEADER
                    This terrorist knows us, Finch. 
                    These attacks are perfectly
                    calculated and they are divisive. 
                    He knows what he's doing, Finch. 
                    He knows us all too well.
          
                              FINCH
                    You think he's an insider?
          
                              LEADER
                    What I think is that this man must
                    be stopped.  Stopped at all costs
                    and no one, I repeat, no one is to
                    be placed above suspicion.  Do I
                    make myself clear?
          
                              FINCH
                    Perfectly.
          
                              LEADER
                    England prevails, Mr. Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    England prevails.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey, alone in the Shadow Gallery, stares up at the
          inscription above the crooked staircase.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, v, v, v, v.
          
                              V
                    I hear your summons, my lady.  And
                    obey.
          
          She jumps, V suddenly appearing behind her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh, V, you scared me.
          
          She turns back to the carving.
          
                              EVEY
                    I was reading the inscription. 
                    What is it?
          
                              V
                    A Latin quotation.  A motto.  "Vi
                    veri veniversum vivus vici."  "By
                    the power of truth, I, while
                    living, have conquered the
                    universe."
          
          She nods.
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, I suppose you have.  This
                    place is the only universe I have
                    right now.
          
                              V
                    Does that bother you?
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't know.  I'm so grateful to
                    you -- I just feel I should help
                    you, you know, the way you're
                    helping me.  I mean, that's the
                    deal, isn't it?
          
          V drifts over to the big old Wurlitzer, fingers scanning the
          song list.
          
                              V
                    No deals, Evey.  Not unless you
                    want them.
          
          She looks up at the inscription as an old blues song begins
          to play.
          
                              EVEY
                    I think I do.  Part of me wants to
                    stay here forever and never have to
                    face what's going on outside.  But
                    that's not right.  Is it?  That's
                    not taking responsibility.  Not
                    conquering my universe.
          
          She turns to him.
          
                              EVEY
                    I want to help you, V.  I want to
                    do something.  Can we make a deal?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  I think we can make a deal if
                    you like.  I think I know a way you
                    could help me very soon indeed.
          
          Evey smiles nervously.
          
                              EVEY
                    Good.  That's that, then.
          
          The blues song curls in the air around them like a heavy
          incense.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, you said that Latin thing was a
                    quote.  Who said it?
          
                              V
                    Nobody you'd have heard of.  A
                    German gentleman named Dr. John
                    Faust.
          
          He spins her.
          
                              V
                    He made a deal too.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY
          
          The church doors have opened with the flow of parishioners as
          the final mass of the day has ended.
          
          The tide slowly pours out onto the sidewalk, separating
          around the clumps of people that conglomerate to network and
          gossip.
          
          Church bells toll in the orange dusk above them.
          
          Helen Heyer, a woman whose spite and guile are hidden behind
          her looks and clothes she drapes them with, charges into the
          gossipers, her trophy husband in tow, a timid looking man
          that we recognize as Conrad Heyer.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Hello, Rosemary.  Derek, how --
          
          Helen's head snaps over at the mention of the name.
          
                              HELEN
                    Derek!
          
          She pushes past Conrad, giving Derek Almond an exuberant kiss
          on both cheeks.
          
                              HELEN
                    Darling, how are you?  Hello,
                    Rosemary.
          
          Always behind her husband, Rosemary Almond smiles nervously

                    Hello.
          
                              DEREK
                    It's so good to see you.  Since
                    this bloody terrorist business, the
                    old man has me literally chained to
                    the office.
          
          Helen pouts at him.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, you poor dear.
          
          Derek taps the bottom of his cigarette box, drawing one with
          his lips.
          
                              DEREK
                    It comes with the job.  How are
                    things in the Eye, Conrad?
          
                              CONRAD
                    Well, we've been working some bugs
                    out of the new Mark IX fiber optic
                    network, actually --
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, Conrad, don't be such a bloody
                    bore.  Do tell us about the
                    terrorist, Derek.  Is it true he
                    blew up Big Ben and the old Bailey?
          
                              DEREK
                    I'm afraid so.  We're dealing with
                    a pathological psychotic in the
                    most extreme case.  We'll catch him
                    though.  I promise.
          
          Helen rubs her white sable against her body.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, it sounds dreadfully exciting. 
                    Aren't you glad you've got such a
                    ruthless, implacable brute for a
                    husband, Rosemary?
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    Yes, well --
          
                              HELEN
                    Believe me, you're lucky.  You
                    could be struck with a professional
                    peeping tom like Conrad.  England's
                    highest paid voyeur, aren't you
                    darling?
          
                              CONRAD
                    Helen, I think we'd better --
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh yes, of course.  We have to get
                    back so the little pervert can
                    watch what the neighbors do after
                    Sunday lunch.  He's so exciting.
          
          Derek laughs as they climb into their car.
          
                              HELEN
                    Ciao!
          
                              DEREK
                    Goodbye, Helen.  Conrad.
          
          Rosemary waves as it pulls off.
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    She's a bit hard on him, isn't she?
          
          Derek sneers at her.
          
                              DEREK
                    Until you're half the woman of
                    Helen's sophistication, I'd keep
                    your little mouth shut.
          
          He throws the cigarette at her feet.
          
                              DEREK
                    Really, just look at the way you
                    dress.
          
          INT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY
          
          From above, a hand sweeps aside the red plush curtain.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Ah, there they go.  My happy and
                    contented flock.  Spiritually
                    refreshed and ready to face the
                    world again.
          
          Bishop Anthony Lilliman is a slender man of pious elegance
          with a warm, beautiful smile.
          
          He turns from the window to his valet, Dennis, as Derek and
          Rosemary get in their car.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Did you enjoy the sermon today,
                    Dennis?
          
                              DENNIS
                    Very inspiring, your grace.  Though
                    the segue of the forces of Satan
                    among us did strike me as a bit of
                    a curious digression.
          
          He whisks a lint brush over the Bishop's robes before putting
          them away.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Hmm, yes.  A trifle purple, I
                    thought.  Still, Fate wanted it
                    included and who are we to question
                    the will of the almighty, miserable
                    sinners that we are?
          
          A gentle smile spreads across his mouth.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    And speaking of sin, I wonder which
                    of the seven deadlies the good lord
                    will see fit to tempt me with
                    today.
          
          Dennis finishes with the Bishop's robes and sweeps the closet
          door shut.
          
                              DENNIS
                    Perhaps pride, your grace.
          
          Lilliman chuckles.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    I was thinking of something a
                    little less ethereal.  Has the
                    young lady arrived?
          
                              DENNIS
                    The agency informed me she'll be
                    here directly.  However, there was
                    a mixup.  It's not one of the usual
                    girls.  She's a little older.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Oh dear.  Oh dear.  Not too old, I
                    trust?
          
                              DENNIS
                    They promise me she's no more than
                    fifteen.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Fifteen, hmm.
          
          The Bishop rubs his cheek, ponderously.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Ah well, if Job could bear his
                    disappointments, I suppose I must
                    have the good grace to bear mine. 
                    Show her in when she arrives.
          
                              DENNIS
                    Yes, your grace.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
          
          A pair of headlights melt through the heavy night's fog as a
          taxicab pulls into the circle drive.
          
          INT.  BISHOP'S QUARTERS
          
          Dennis peers into the Bishop's living quarters.
          
                              DENNIS
                    The young lady, your grace.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Oh my!
          
          Standing next to Dennis is Evey, wearing a frilly pink summer
          dress, pigtails and bows and white ruffled socks.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    And to think I doubted your
                    loveliness for even an instant. 
                    Mea culpa, my child, mea culpa. 
                    You are a vision.  An angel.
          
          Evey smiles awkwardly.
          
                              EVEY
                    Uh... thank you.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
          
          A shadow begins moving across the manicured grounds borne on
          the thick mist like a dark phantom.  V glides toward the
          rectory, cloak undulating against the dark, wet wind.
          
          INT.  BISHOP'S BEDROOM
          
          It is extravagantly furnished, somewhere between posh and
          pimp.  The Bishop is sitting very close to Evey on his plush
          water bed.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Of course, "hate the sin, love the
                    sinner."  I always say.  Take your
                    dress off, please.
          
          Evey stammers, backing up along the bedside.
          
                              EVEY
                    Listen -- I was kind of hoping --
          
          He paws at her, groping hands pushing the front of her dress
          down as she backs up against the nightstand.
          
                              EVEY
                    No --
          
          EXT.  MAIN GATE - NIGHT
          
          The guards look out into the night, fear suddenly gripping
          their faces.
          
          V emerges demonically through the parting veils of fog, the
          white smiling mask bobbing eerily up and down as he rushes
          them.
          
          A cigarette drops from the first guard's mouth, red embers
          exploding when it hits the wet cement.
          
          Close as the two guards claw for their arms and the white hot
          flash of V's knives --
          
          That slice like talons.
          
          The two men crumple to the ground, clutching their gaping,
          gurgling wounds.  A whisper.  V sprints into the courtyard.
          
          INT.  BISHOP'S BEDROOM
          
          Evey grabs a metal table lamp and swings it down on the
          Bishop's head.  There is a shuddering clank and he collapses
          to the floor.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    You -- You filthy whore!
          
          His blood speckles the white bearskin throw rug as the Bishop
          slowly rises after the retreating Evey.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    I'll kill you, you fucking sow.
          
          He charges after her but freezes dead in his tracks as V
          swings around the corner in front of him.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    What's this?  Who --
          
                              V
                    Please allow me to introduce
                    myself...
          
          V bows.
          
                              V
                    I'm a man of wealth and taste.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Dennis?
          
          Instantly, the point of one of V's knives is against the
          Bishop's throat.  V presses a finger to his frozen smile.
          
                              V
                    Shh.  It isn't polite to disturb
                    the dead on their journey.
          
          Evey watches from around the corner.
          
                              V
                    A courtesy I'll most respectfully
                    extend to his grace.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?
          
          Lilliman swallows audibly.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, what are you doing?
          
                              V
                    Vi veri veniversum vivus vici,
                    Evey.
          
          Evey looks down at the knives on his belt, dripping blood.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh no.
          
          She begins backing to the door.
          
                              EVEY
                    You can't kill him!
          
                              V
                    Death has followed his grace the
                    whole of his career.  Is it any
                    coincidence it has finally followed
                    him here?
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, V.  I can't -- I can't --
          
          V turns back to Lilliman as Evey runs.
          
                              V
                    Let us pray.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
          
          Evey sprints past the dead guards at the man gate and into
          the fog.
          
          INT.  THE EAR
          
          A cramped control room that looks like something between a
          radio and television switching room, though it does not
          broadcast.  It receives.
          
          Two operators sit at the main substation as the sounds of
          lovemaking come over the speakers.  The moans are stifled and
          low, however, as if they were afraid someone was listening.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    Bloody hell.  Doesn't anybody fuck
                    with feeling anymore?
          
          Operator 2 does not look at him, scrolling through an
          intricate city map on his computer.
          
                              OPERATOR 2
                    Hey, it's Sunday.  Children's hour
                    over at the Abbey.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    Let's see what that filthy old
                    pervert is up to.
          
          Operator 1 punches in some coordinates and the sound over the
          speakers changes to a garbled fart of noise.  Two voices
          drown beneath a cacophony of classical music.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    What the --
          
          He tries to dial out the background and suddenly the voices
          rise clearly above the din.
          
                              VOICE 1
                    ... And I saw a black shape against
                    the flames.  Oh god.  It's you. 
                    The man from room five.  You've
                    come --
          
                              VOICE 2
                    To collect what's mine.
          
                              VOICE 1
                    I beg you!  I don't want to die! 
                    Please have mercy!
          
          The two men look at each other, Operator 1 lunging for a red
          phone.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    Get me the Finger.  This is an
                    emergency!
          
          EXT.  BISHOP'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
          
          Close on a stain of white vomit and blood on the thick pile
          of a Persian rug.  It is encircled in police chalk.
          
          Pull back to reveal the chalk outline where the body of
          Bishop Lilliman was found.  The circled bloodstain floats
          above the head like the last word balloon of a crude comic
          strip character.
          
          The Bishop's quarters is slowly being picked over by a
          forensic team from the Nose.  A photographer's flash bursts
          against a painted "V" on the wall near the body outline.
          
          At the window, Finch chews on his pipe, staring at a plastic
          evidence bag that contains a single violet carson rose.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    No prints yet, sir.  Just like
                    Prothero.
          
                              FINCH
                    I want those tapes from the Ear in
                    my office tonight, Dominic.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Yes, sir.  They're on top of it.
          
          Finch turns to a muscular man named Creedy, second in command
          at the Finger.
          
                              FINCH
                    Any word from your superior, Mr.
                    Creedy?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Mr. Almond doesn't seem to be
                    answering his page, sir.  I'm sure
                    he's in the field.
          
                              FINCH
                    Quite.
          
          INT.  CONRAD HEYER'S BEDROOM
          
          Grunting like an animal, Derek's face is frozen, locked in
          the rigor of a violent orgasm.  After a moment, he collapses
          beside Helen onto the sweat soaked sheets.
          
                              HELEN
                    There you go, baby.  Now my baby
                    boy can think so much clearer. 
                    Can't he?
          
          She grabs her cigarette case and her lighter.
          
                              HELEN
                    You have been thinking, haven't
                    you?
          
          She straddles his chest then lights two cigarettes.
          
                              HELEN
                    I know you have.  Ever since this
                    terrorist appeared.
          
          He smiles as she puts one of the cigarettes in his mouth.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh jesus, that smile.  That smile
                    turns me on like nothing else.
          
          She whispers in his ear.
          
                              HELEN
                    Tell me.  Tell me what's going on
                    in that ruthless sadistic brain of
                    yours.
          
                              DEREK
                    Everyone is so worried about the
                    terrorist.  Especially Susan.  You
                    know why?  Because nobody knows
                    what he's going to do.
          
          He exhales through his grinding teeth.
          
                              DEREK
                    If I were him, I know what I'd do.
          
          He whispers.
          
                              DEREK
                    I'd blow that fat bastard to
                    kingdom come.
          
          Helen bolts up.
          
                              HELEN
                    No.  You're kidding.
          
                              DEREK
                    Am I?
          
          He smiles, blowing more smoke.
          
                              DEREK
                    There's an old train line under the
                    New Government Building.  It
                    collapsed when they poured the
                    foundation.  You could haul in
                    enough TNT to launch our Leader's
                    ass all the way to the moon.
          
          Helen's eyes gleam as he laughs.
          
                              HELEN
                    You're serious, aren't you?
          
          He eyes her sucking on the cigarette.
          
                              DEREK
                    You need to be careful, Helen. 
                    Your mouth is going to get you into
                    trouble one day.
          
                              HELEN
                    Is that the same trouble you love
                    putting in my mouth?
          
                              DEREK
                    You never know who might be
                    listening.
          
                               HELEN
                    I know, Derek.  You love your
                    country and you love your party,
                    just like you love your wife.
          
          He glares at her.
          
                              HELEN
                    Derek.  I'm sorry.  I know I can be
                    a bitch.  But that's why you're
                    here, isn't it?
          
          He smiles again and she presses her body to his.
          
                              HELEN
                    This is it, isn't it, Derek?  What
                    we've been waiting for.  At last,
                    you'll be rid of Susan.  I'll be
                    rid of Conrad.  And we'll be free. 
                    Free, won't we?
          
          His eyes close as he grinds his hips into hers and we rise,
          drifting up to the ceiling light fixture --
          
          Where we see a tiny hidden microphone.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE - THE NOSE
          
          Finch sits at his desk, staring into the silence of his
          notepad.  He has doodled a little "V" with a circle around
          it.
          
          He looks up as Dominic enters, holding up a portable cassette
          player.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Sorry it took so long.  The boys
                    had a devil of a time trying to
                    filter out the background noise.
          
                              FINCH
                    Background noise?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    The perpetrator apparently turned
                    on the Bishop's stereo. 
                    Subsequently, a great deal of the
                    tape is useless.
          
          He hands the player to Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    What music did he play?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Beethoven.  The fifth, I believe.
          
          Finch smiles.
          
                              FINCH
                    Da, da, da, dum.  That's code. 
                    Morse code.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Sir?
          
                              FINCH
                    For the letter "V".
          
          Finch punches "play".
          
          Over the small speaker, we sear Evey protesting to V, then
          run.  He stops it.
          
                              FINCH
                    Anything on the girl yet?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    No.  The agency said somebody
                    claiming to be Lilliman's valet
                    canceled his Sunday appointment.
          
          Finch starts it again and this time the tape is very fuzzy.
          
                              FINCH
                    What is it?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    23rd Psalm.
          
          We recognize some of the words though muted and crackly.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    Though I walk through the valley of
                    the shadow of death...
          
                              DOMINIC
                    It goes on like that for a while. 
                    Fairly incoherent except we could
                    make out a few words in this part. 
                    Transubstantiation.
          
          Finch nods, understanding.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    That miracle business when the
                    wafer transform into the body of
                    Christ.
          
                              FINCH
                    He made him eat a host.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Yes, listen to this part.
          
          The tape becomes somewhat clearer as the music rests.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    ... And at the moment this enters
                    your mouth it becomes the flesh of
                    the savior?  Yes... please... And
                    whatever it is made of now it will
                    become the body of Christ?  Yes...
                    yes...
          
          They eye each other.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    I want you to swallow it.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    There's a couple of funny human
                    noises...
          
                              FINCH
                    And then just Beethoven's fifth.
          
          He shuts off the tape.
          
                              FINCH
                    We have got the initial path report
                    back.  The host was full of
                    cyanide.
          
          Finch picks up the bag with the violet carson.
          
                              FINCH
                    And do you know what?
          
          He rises, sliding into his jacket.
          
                              FINCH
                    When it reached his abdomen, it was
                    still cyanide.
          
          INT.  MORGUE
          
          Close on the heavy stitching of a "Y" incision sewn into the
          chest of a corpse.  It is one of the Bishop's guards.
          
                              DELIA
                    Do you have a motive?
          
          Finch is standing next to the cadaver gurney with the
          coroner, Delia Surridge.  She is a serious woman, hair wound
          tight behind her head in a severe bun.
          
                              DELIA
                    I mean, was anything taken?
          
          She fills the dead man's head with cotton and replaces the
          top of his skull.
          
                              FINCH
                    Just lives.
          
          Pulling at the man's scalp, she stretches it over the
          replaced skull piece.
          
                              FINCH
                    I know it's too early for your
                    profile but do you have any initial
                    impressions?
          
                              DELIA
                    Well...
          
          She points at a jagged puncture wound at the base of the
          man's sternum with a ball point pen.
          
                              DELIA
                    He's incredibly powerful.  This
                    man's sternum was split like dry
                    wood from the base all the way up
                    to the manubrium.
          
          Finch peers into the hole.
          
                              DELIA
                    And he's resourceful.  On that
                    table behind you is a breakdown of
                    all the chemicals found in
                    Prothero's blood stream.
          
          Finch hefts the pile of computer paper.
          
                              FINCH
                    Bloody hell.

                    There were hundreds of different
                    chemicals in him.  From
                    trinitrotoluene to estrogen to
                    motor oil.
          
          He flips through the document, biting into the wooden end of
          his pipe.

                    Perhaps Fate will make something
                    more of all this.  I certainly
                    can't.

                    The Leader finally authorized an
                    uplink for you?  He must be getting
                    nervous.
          
                              FINCH
                    Quite.  Government directed
                    terrorism never sews healthy ideas
                    into the public.  Oh, that reminds
                    me.
          
          Finch pulls the evidence bag from his pocket.
          
                              FINCH
                    Can you tell us anything about
                    this?
          
          Delia's eyes lock onto the violet carson.
          
                              FINCH
                    We found one in the carriage with
                    Prothero and this one in the
                    Bishop's quarters.  A violet
                    carson.
          
          He hands it to her.
          
                              FINCH
                    I heard that strain had died off. 
                    Thought a botanist might shed some
                    light on it.  Delia?
          
          Delia, riveted to the rose, suddenly looks up to him.
          
                              DELIA
                    Yes -- Yes, of course.
          
                              FINCH
                    Magic.  I'll drop by tomorrow then.
          
          He turns, leaving her with the rose.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V relaxes with a book in an overstuffed reading chair, a
          violet carson rose resting on a table next to him.  He begins
          to read a passage aloud.
          
                              V
                    "There is more behind and inside of
                    V than any of us had suspected. 
                    Not who, but what: what is she?"
          
          He places the book down.  Thomas Pynchon's "V".
          
          V rises, lifting the rose and moving into the darkness of the
          Shadow Gallery.
          
          EXT.  EMPTY STREET
          
          A small figure moves down the dark wet street, the
          cobblestones glistening like black scales.
          
          The huddled figure arcs across the street in the shadows,
          avoiding the pools of streetlight.  It is Evey, a frightened
          look on her face.

          A woman in combat boots, fishnets, and a tight fitting
          soldier's uniform is in the middle of a cheeky number on
          stage in this smoky burlesque bar.  It is a popular place
          with locals and Fingermen.
          
          Peter Creedy squeezes through the crowd, angling for the back
          of the bar where a number of loud Fingermen are drinking.
          
                              CREEDY
                    What's all this, then, Harper?  I
                    get a radio that a man's down and
                    in need of assistance?
          
                              HARPER
                    I ain't gone down yet but I sure do
                    need some assistance.
          
          Creedy leans in.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Are you flat broke already?
          
          They break up in laughter, led by Creedy who sits next to
          Harper, pouring himself a drink.
          
                              LOUT
                    How'd you sneak away, Creedy? 
                    Almond off buggering that blonde
                    chippy?
          
                              HARPER
                    The one with the tits?
          
          They all begin to hoot and whistle.
          
                              CREEDY
                    What I wouldn't give for a piece of
                    that.

                    She could serve a tray of drinks on
                    those thingies.
          
                              HARPER
                    I bet you get your chance with her
                    sooner than later, Creedy, with the
                    way Almond's crackin' up.

                    Terrorist or no, if that bastard
                    gives me another double shift, I'll
                    stomp his fucking head.
          
          Creedy raises his drink.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Aye.  This nonsense has put a
                    serious strain on my drinking.  I
                    think I was actually sober today.
          
                              LOUT
                    I'll drink to that.

                    We need to get a real man of the
                    people in that director's position. 
                    Like Creedy here.
          
          Everyone cheers in agreement.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Well, it's good to know when the
                    shit hits the fan who your real
                    friends are.
          
          They salute and drink.

          Derek Almond sits hunched under a desk lamp, pumping the
          cylinders of his revolver with a wire brush.
          
          Rosemary shuffles up to him, her frumpy gown gathered around
          her.

                    I don't want to hear it, Rosemary.

                    eat with me.  You don't have sex --
          
          Derek leaps up, slugging her.
          
          Rosemary clatters to the ground in tears.  Derek glowering
          over her.

                    gob!
          
          He leans into her face.
          
                              DEREK
                    And me not wanting to fuck you is
                    obvious.  Take a look at yourself.
          
          He sits back in front of the gun, wiping it down.
          
                              DEREK
                    Get out of my sight.  I'm cleaning

          filtering in from the open curtains.
          
          Her eyes fixed on the violet carson as she slowly turns it
          over in her hands, fingers tracing the soft petals.
          
          After a moment, she stands, letting it fall from her lap.

                    looked straight at me.

                    terrible knowledge, it's been with
                    me so long.  That I could do things
                    like that.
          
          Delia rubs the salty tears from her eyes.
          
                              DELIA
                    For years, I blamed it on the
                    government, on the authority I
                    could never stand up to.  But
                    living so long with the knowledge
                    of what I did has made me
                    understand otherwise.  I alone was
                    accountable.
          
          V watches her.
          
                              DELIA
                    There is something wrong with us. 
                    With all of mankind.  With me. 
                    Something evil that made me enjoy
                    what I did.  Some hideous flaw.
          
          Her voice almost trails off.
          
                              DELIA
                    We deserve to be culled.  We
                    deserve it.
          
          INT.  ALMOND BEDROOM
          
          Light sweeps across Rosemary from the opening bedroom door as
          she sobs softly in bed.  Derek enters, holding a bottle of
          whiskey and his clean gun.
          
          She sits up as Derek looms over her.
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    Derek?  What?
          
          He lifts the gun into her bruised face.  Her eyebrows cringe
          as he slowly pulls the trigger.
          
                              DEREK
                    Bang.
          
          Click.  It is empty.
          
                              DEREK
                    Don't worry, Rose.  I didn't load
                    it.
          
          The phone rings.
          
                              DEREK
                    Not tonight.
          
          He grins evilly at her and answers the bedside phone.
          
                              DEREK
                    Almond.  What?!  Where?
          
          Derek's drunk eyes light up.
          
                              DEREK
                    Oh god, yes!  God, thank you!
          
          He slams the phone down, charging out of the room.
          
          EXT.  KITTY KAT KELLER
          
          A gaggle of drunks exit the bar, laughing and singing as they
          pass a small figure.
          
          INT.  KITTY KAT KELLER
          
          Evey wanders into the bar amidst the lustful screams and cat
          calls for the line of high stepping, semi-clothed girls on
          stage.
          
          She stares out into the crowd, not sure why she is here when
          a man approaches her: Creedy.  His sloppy smile indicates he
          has had a few drinks.
          
                              CREEDY
                    You look lost.
          
          She looks blankly at him.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Can I buy you a drink?
          
                              EVEY
                    No... I made a mistake.
          
          She turns for the door.
          
                              EVEY
                    I have to find someone.
          
          Creedy frowns as his radio crackles.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Well I didn't like the looks of you
                    anyway --

                    All units, all units.  Code red.

                    codename V.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Bloody hell!
          
          He screams to the Fingermen at the back.
          
                              CREEDY
                    It's him!  We got him!
          
          Evey watches as they storm out of the bar, then follows.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The emergency lights blaring, Finch's car squeals around a
          corner.
          
          INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM
          
          V hovers ghostly at Delia's bedside.
          
                              DELIA
                    It's funny, I was given one of your
                    roses today.  I wasn't sure you
                    were the terrorist until I saw it.
          
          She manages a smile.
          
                              DELIA
                    What a strange coincidence.  That I
                    should be given it today.
          
                              V
                    There are no coincidences, Delia. 
                    Only the illusion of coincidence.
          
          He reaches into his cloak.
          
                              V
                    I have another rose.  This one is
                    for you.
          
          He hands it to her.
          
                              DELIA
                    Then you are going to kill me now?
          
          V produces an empty syringe.
          
                              V
                    I killed you ten minutes ago. 
                    While you slept.
          
                              DELIA
                    Is there any pain?
          
          V sits on the bed.
          
                              V
                    No.  No pain.
          
                              DELIA
                    Thank you.
          
          She stares at the mask.
          
                              DELIA
                    Can I -- Can I see your face again?
          
          V slowly pulls off his hat and lifts his mask.  Delia stares
          into his face.
          
                              DELIA
                    It's beautiful...
          
          The rose falls from her hands.
          
          INT.  HALL
          
          V quietly shuts the door as if not to wake her and turns just
          as --
          
          Derek Almond reaches the top of the stairs.
          
                              DEREK
                    Don't move an inch, you bloody
                    bastard.
          
          He trains his gun.
          
                              DEREK
                    You didn't hear me arrive, did you? 
                    Didn't know we'd rumbled you?
          
          He squints.
          
                              DEREK
                    It's all finished, chummy.  All of
                    it.  The old man told me it was my
                    head or yours and what do you know. 
                    It's yours.
          
          The smiling mask stares.
          
                              DEREK
                    Because you're standing over there
                    with your bloody stupid knives and
                    your fancy karate gimmicks --
          
          Derek pulls back the hammer.
          
                              DEREK
                    And I've got a gun.
          
          He smiles.
          
                              DEREK
                    Bang.
          
          Click.  He never loaded it.
          
          There is an awkward moment of silence, then V moves --
          
          Cloak opening, filling the hall like a black tidal wave that
          envelopes Derek.  He chokes a scream as V embraces him,
          slipping a knife above his floating rib.
          
          Derek Almond sputters as he claws at V's mask.
          
                              DEREK
                    Who -- Who are you?
          
                              V
                    Yes, look.  Look and tell me what
                    you see.
          
          He rips V's mask off as V thrusts the knife in deeper.
          
          Derek's eyes widen in horror as his life pours out the knife
          wound.
          
                              DEREK
                    Horrible!  God, it's horrible!
          
          V jerks his blade free, letting Derek slip to the ground.
          
          EXT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME
          
          Finch's car bucks up onto the sidewalk.
          
          Finch and Dominic tear out of the car and barrel into the
          house.
          
          INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME
          
          At the top of the stairs, they find the dead Derek.  Finch
          rushes past him for the bedroom.
          
                              FINCH
                    Delia?
          
          Inside, he finds her.  Her eyes fixed, cold, and dead, a
          single violet carson in her lap.
          
                              FINCH
                    Get an ambulance.
          
          EXT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME
          
          Evey rushes around a corner to see a crime scene bathed in
          siren light.  She pushes up to the police barricade as the
          M.E.'s load a draped body into their van.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh no... V?
          
          She tries to angle around to get a better look when a man in
          a brown overcoat grabs her from behind and drags her into the
          alley.
          
          INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM
          
          From the corner of the room, Finch sits, watching as the
          M.E.'s wheel out Delia's body.
          
          Dominic squeezes past the gurney and crosses toward Finch.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    I'm sorry, sir.  You knew the
                    doctor pretty well?
          
          Finch nods.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    We found this on her bureau, sir. 
                    It's Dr. Surridge's journal.  It
                    covers her years at Larkhill.  It
                    might contain the whole story.
          
          Dominic searches for something more to say when Finch does
          not answer.
          
          After a moment, Finch looks at the book in Dominic's hand,
          then takes it, leafing through the pages.  They flip by, a
          breathy sigh, rising to a cold wind.

                    Prothero has hand picked my

                    of which will be any use to me if I
                    don't get to work soon.
          
          She finishes an injection, Prothero encouraging the next
          subject.  We recognize her as the woman Prothero pointed at.

                    myself hating them.
          
          Delia prepares the next dose, a sour look on her face.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)

                    more resilient than the women.
          
          When it is full, they move to the next door until the cart is

                    provide more answers or my time

                    tends to contradict my entry on the
                    9th.
          
          She pauses at room five.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    The man in room five is a
                    fascinating case.
          
          She looks through the small chicken wire glass window in the
          door.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    Physically, there doesn't seem to
                    be anything wrong with him.  No
                    cellular anomalies, nothing.
          
          In the back, just on the edge of the room's shadow, sits the
          man in room five, silently staring back.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    Batch five, however, seems to have
                    brought on some kind of psychotic
                    breakdown.  He's quite insane.
          
          Dr. Surridge can't seem to break her stare.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    He has this way of looking through
                    you.  Reverend Lilliman won't go
                    near him.  He claims that it is the
                    devil in room five.  I see him
                    cross himself whenever he passes
                    his door.  Still, there's something
                    about him...
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL GARDEN - DAY - FLASHBACK
          
          Dr. Surridge slowly moves through the Larkhill garden, an
          incredible abundance of fruits, vegetables and violet carson
          roses.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    I'm glad Prothero let room five
                    have a go at the gardening project. 
                    He is quite proficient.  Prothero
                    was reluctant to allow an inmate
                    access to the tool and chemical
                    supply at first but now the fat
                    toad is delighted.  The crop has
                    almost doubled.
          
          She traces the petals of a rose with her finger.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    He also grows roses.  Beautiful
                    roses.
          
          INT.  LARKHILL LOUNGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
          
          Dr. Surridge and several other Larkhill appointees relax
          after dinner.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    December 24th: I was in the mess. 
                    It was about half past ten when we
                    heard the first explosion.
          
          A massive explosion shakes the building to its very core, its
          windows shattering and hooded pendulum lights swinging.
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL LOUNGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
          
          Men and women clutch at their throats as they tumble out into
          the yard.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    The ones at the front ran straight
                    into the gas.  It was horrible.
          
          They drop to the ground, gasping and vomiting.
          
          The back door is kicked open, Dr. Surridge following two
          guards.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    A few of us made it out through the
                    rear door.  You could hear men
                    screaming everywhere.  I hate the
                    sound of men screaming.
          
          She looks out, men running, collapsing, dying in a yellow
          green haze that seems everywhere.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    In the center of the camp,
                    everything was on fire.  Everyone
                    running in all directions.  We had
                    hardly enough time to get our
                    bearings when the ovens exploded.
          
          Another explosion wracks the compound.  The pillar of flame
          rises into the black sky, dwarfing the men in the camp.
          
          Dr. Surridge sees a gaping hole in the medical block, its
          insides turned out like an unholy birth.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    It was the man in room rive.  I
                    couldn't have known.  The chemical
                    supplies, grease solvents, ammonia,
                    fertilizer.  He'd been making
                    things with them.
          
          Close on a soldier, doubled over, hacking up bile.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    Mustard gas...
          
          A sticky blue fire licks up from a blackened body like a dura
          flame.
          
                              DELIA
                    And napalm.
          
          Dr. Surridge turns as a silhouette crosses the yard, backlit
          by a curtain of fire.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    And in the yard, I saw him.  He had
                    the flames behind him.  He was
                    naked.
          
          The man stops.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    He looked at me...
          
          Dr. Surridge seems to wilt under his stare but cannot look
          away.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    As if I were an insect.  Oh god. 
                    As if I were something mounted on a
                    slide.
          
          The flames convulse hypnotically behind him.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    He looked at me.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          Finch snaps Dr. Surridge's journal shut.
          
          He sits in front of the Leader's desk puffing on his pipe
          while Susan stares coldly.
          
                              FINCH
                    That's the last entry until six
                    months later when Dr. Surridge is
                    back in London.  There is no
                    mention of the man in room five
                    again.  End of story.
          
          He tosses the journal on Susan's desk.
          
                              FINCH
                    Except that it wasn't the end of
                    the story.
          
          Finch rises, crossing to the wastebasket.
          
                              FINCH
                    Between 2009 and 2012, over forty
                    men and women who were previously
                    stationed at Larkhill met with what
                    were believed to be accidental
                    deaths.  Eventually, only three
                    remained.
          
          He taps his pipe into his hand, pouring the contents into the
          wastebasket.
          
                              FINCH
                    The three he'd been saving until
                    last.
          
          Finch brushes the ashes from his hands and begins repacking
          his pipe.
          
                              FINCH
                    Everyone who worked at Larkhill. 
                    Everyone who could have identified
                    him.  You see there are two
                    possible motives here.  Not one.
          
          Susan raises his head.
          
                              FINCH
                    The first is revenge.  He escapes
                    from Larkhill and vows to get even
                    with his tormentors.  The whole
                    exercise an elaborate, chilling
                    vendetta.
          
          When he finishes repacking the pipe, he replaces it in his
          mouth.
          
                              FINCH
                    That's the explanation that I find
                    most reassuring, funnily enough. 
                    Because that means he's finished. 
                    It's over now.
          
          Finch begins relighting his pipe.
          
                              FINCH
                    The second motive is more sinister. 
                    Like I said, everyone who could
                    have identified him is dead.
          
          A flame leaps into the air.
          
                              FINCH
                    What if he's just been clearing the
                    ground?
          
          Another burst.
          
                              FINCH
                    What if he's planning something
                    else?
          
          The lighter slips back into his pocket.
          
                              FINCH
                    You see, the diary we found was in
                    full view.  We didn't have to
                    search for it.  He left it there. 
                    He wanted us to find it.  He wanted
                    us to know the story.  Or...
          
          Finch returns to his chair, letting out a huge cloud.
          
                              FINCH
                    For all we know, the diary could be
                    a complete and utter fake. 
                    Codename V could have written it
                    himself.
          
          Finch leans forward.
          
                              FINCH
                    He's playing games with us.  He
                    might never have been at Larkhill
                    at all.  Do you see?  It could all
                    be another smoke screen, a false
                    trail, another cover story --
          
                              LEADER
                    Enough!
          
          Susan punches the desk.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch, would you please explain
                    to me the nature of this meeting?! 
                    Because I was under the impression
                    that you had some information about
                    the terrorist, codename V!
          
          And punches it again until his fist hurts.
          
                              LEADER
                    No more questions, understand!  I
                    want answers!  I am not interested
                    in where he grew up, what kind of
                    flowers he likes or his favorite
                    color!
          
          Susan's collar chokes his face to an unnatural crimson.
          
                              LEADER
                    Do I make myself clear?
          
                              FINCH
                    Yes, Leader.
          
          After a moment, Finch stands, Susan hanging on his last word.
          
                              LEADER
                    Dismissed.  England prevails, Mr.
                    Finch.
          
          Finch turns, Susan calling after him as he leaves.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch, the girl.  Do you have
                    anything on the girl?
          
          Finch pauses at the door.
          
                              FINCH
                    No, Leader.  Not yet.
          
          INT.  CELL
          
          Evey stirs as voices drift in from the hall outside her door.
          
                              MAN
                    Wake up, cow.
          
          Three guards are silhouetted in the doorway of a cramped jail
          cell.  Still sluggish from the chloroform, Evey looks down at
          the coarse slipover she's now wearing.
          
          One of the men, Rossiter, crosses toward Evey, swinging a
          pair of shackles.  He grabs Evey, slamming her face down into
          the hard cot, driving a knee between her shoulder blades.
          
          Evey screams.
          
                              GUARD 1
                    Tsk.  This pathetic whore is the
                    famous Miss Hammond?
          
          The shackles bite down on her wrists as they laugh in the
          hall.
          
                              EVEY
                    You've made a mistake.
          
          Rossiter stands her up, shoving her into the wall.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Shut up.
          
                              EVEY
                    Please.  I haven't done anything --
          
          He slides a thick hood over her head.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    I said shut your hole!
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          The hood is lifted from her head.  Evey squints hard, awash
          in a blinding, burning light.
          
          A man sits, unmoving, at a desk across from her, a guard at
          his side, both backlit by a harsh white kliegs.
          
          Evey's eyes start to water as she blinks.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Do you know why you're here.  Evey
                    Hammond?
          
                              EVEY
                    No, please, I didn't do anything.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Allow me to be more precise.  Did
                    you participate in the murder of
                    Dr. Delia Surridge?

                    Have you ever participated in a
                    terrorist act against your country?

                    What is the identity of codename V?
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't know.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    You are a lying cunt.
          
          A monitor next to the desk lights up.  From the snowy static,
          an image begins to form.
          
          A girl is talking to a man.  She is shoving her hips at him,
          propositioning him.  When more men appear from the alley,
          Evey realizes she is watching herself.
          
                              EVEY
                    They were going to rape me, kill
                    me --
          
          Rossiter grabs a handful of her hair.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Shut up.
          
          She swallows hard when she sees V emerge on the screen.  The
          image freezes on his smiling face.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    This board will not tolerate any
                    more of your lies, Miss Hammond. 
                    We have over 120 minutes of audio
                    and videotape and 75 pages of
                    testimonials from eye witness that
                    identify you as an accomplice to
                    the terrorist, codename V.
          
          The monitor blinks off.

                    Do you want to know why you're
                    here?  You are formally being
                    brought up on charges of murder on

                    against your Leader and country
                    which brings an automatic sentence
                    of death.
          
                              EVEY

                    Process the prisoner and return her

                    cooperative.
          
          Rossiter slips the hood back over Evey's head.
          
          INT.  PROCESSING ROOM
          
          Evey cries as a rough hand runs a pair of electric clippers
          over her head.  Huge sheaves of her hair fall to the ground.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

          Evey lies crumpled on the hard floor, unmoving, as a tray of
          food is slid through a slot at the bottom of the door.
          
          She watches as a rat crosses from a hole in the wall,
          sniffing the murky rendered gelatin in the wooden bowl.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

          Evey hangs limply from a set of manacles as she is washed and
          deloused by heavy hands.
          
          She coughs in the yellow bug powder cloud as it burns her
          eyes and the red welts on her back.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

          Evey is curled up on the cot like a dry fetus, now gaunt arms
          wrapped around her legs.  She blinks when she hears something
          moving in the rat hole.
          
          Evey raises her head as something is pushed through the
          crevice.
          
          Tentative fingers search the hole, pulling out a length of
          toilet paper.  Over every inch of it is a delicately scrawled
          message.
          
          We move into the rathole, its edges slowly filling the frame
          until black.

          Pull back from a shadow, the outline of the interrogator's
          silhouette against sharp light coming into frame.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I read her letter.  Hid it.  Slept. 
                    Woke.  They questioned me.  And I
                    read her letter again.
          
          Rossiter is buckling Evey's thin arms and legs into a chair. 
          Her now frail frame can barely hold up the frayed brown
          slipover.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Over and over...
          
          On the table in front of her, there is a large wash basin of
          water.  Rossiter dunks her head into it.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Her name was Valerie.

          A teacher reads from her lesson plan in front of rows and
          rows of uniformed pubescences in this all girl private
          school.  Her voice drones on and on like Muzak.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I was born in a rainy burg in
                    Nottingham in 1975.  I passed my
                    eleven plus and went to girl's
                    grammar.
          
          A blonde tomboy sneaks a smile to her curly haired friend
          next to her.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I met my first girlfriend at
                    school.  Her name was Sara.  Her
                    wrists.  Her wrists were beautiful.
          
          Her hand slides across the desk, fingers tickling the young
          flesh of Sara's wrist.
          
          The teacher's voice slows, dropping octaves, becoming --
          
          INT.  BIOLOGY LAB - DAY - FLASHBACK
          
          A man's voice.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I sat in biology class staring at
                    the pickled rabbit fetus while Mr.
                    Herd said it was an adolescent
                    phase that people outgrew.
          
          Valerie looks at Sara across the room, her head down in
          shame.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Sara did.  I didn't.

          Two teenage girls stand in front of a middle aged couple. 
          They are holding hands.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    In 1994, I stopped pretending and
                    took a girl called Christine home
                    to meet my parents.
          
          The greying woman repeats the sign of the cross over and
          over, sobbing into a handkerchief.  Her husband's face is
          contorted in disgust.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    A week later I moved to London to
                    go to college and study drama.  My
                    mother said I broke her heart.

          Two young women cuddle on a park bench under a London summer

                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    But it was my integrity that was
                    important.  Is that so selfish?  It
                    sells for so little but it's all we
                    have left in this place...
          
          The black haired girl nibbles on the blonde's ear.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    It is the very last inch of us...
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Evey struggles against Rossiter's weight who keeps her head
          submerged.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    But within that inch we are free.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Enough.
          
          Rossiter wrenches back and Evey sucks hard for air, coughing
          out water.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Now Miss Hammond, let us review the
                    facts.
          
          Evey stares at him, eyes red, heart pounding in her ears.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    You work for codename V.  Codename
                    V killed Delia Surridge and then
                    Derek Almond with your help and
                    that is why you were found outside
                    her home.
          
          Evey begins to shake her head, water sluicing off her thin
          face.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Isn't that what happened, Miss

                              EVEY
                    No.  No, that isn't true --

                    Oh dear, Rossiter?
          
          Rossiter grabs Evey's neck --

                    No, wait!
          
          Plunging her head into the bowl.  Water fills Evey's nose and

                    The world was strange and rustling

                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Work improved.  I got small film
                    roles, then bigger ones.
          
          The blonde woman brushes away a tear from the other's cheek.

                    In 2006, I starred in "The Salt

                    We fell in love.
          
          We pull back and see we are on location for a movie and the

                    Every Valentine's Day she sent me
                    roses and, oh god, we had so much. 
                    Those were the best three years of
                    my life.
          
          The two women stare at the newscast in tears, the sound of
          marching coming from the set's speakers.

          The sound of marching explodes as columns of men in brown

                              VALERIE (V.O.)

                    After the takeover, they started
                    rounding up the gays.  They took
                    Ruth while she was out looking for
                    food.

                    They burned her face with
                    cigarettes and made her give them
                    my name.  She signed a statement
                    saying I'd seduced her.
          
          The interrogator's voice melts into a slag heap of sound with
          the hot, rhythmic pounding in her ears.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I didn't blame her.  God, I loved
                    her but I didn't blame her.
          
          Rossiter uncuffs Evey, slipping the black bag over her head.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    But she did.
          
          Evey's knees buckle as he forces her to stand.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    She killed herself in her cell. 
                    She couldn't live with betraying
                    me, with giving up that last inch. 
                    Oh, Ruth.
          
          Evey weaves down the hall.  Rossiter shoving her from behind.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    They came for me.  They shaved off
                    my hair.  They held my head down a
                    toilet and told lesbian jokes. 
                    They brought me here and pumped me
                    full of chemicals.
          
          The cell door swings open.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I can't feel my tongue.  I can't
                    speak.
          
          Rossiter yanks the hood from her head and pushes her in.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    It is strange that my life should
                    end in such a terrible place but
                    for three years I had roses and
                    apologized to nobody.
          
          The iron door slams shut, lock ringing in the stale air.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I shall die here.  Every inch of me
                    shall perish...
          
          Evey rolls to her knees.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Except one.
          
          She crawls for the rat hole.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    An inch.  It is small and fragile
                    and it's the only thing in the
                    world that's worth having.
          
          Her shaking hand pulls the letter from the stone crevice.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    We must never lose it or sell it or
                    give it away.  We must never let
                    them take it from us.
          
          Evey clutches it like a rosary as she begins to cry.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I don't know who you are but I hope
                    you escape this place.  I hope that
                    the world turns and things get
                    better and that one day people have
                    roses again.
          
          She holds the note to her face, her tears soaking into the
          fragile paper.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I don't know who you are but I love
                    you.  I love you.  Valerie.
          
          Slowly, Evey slips away, succumbing to blackness.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I had come to know every inch of
                    those four walls in that dark hell
                    and they knew every inch of me. 
                    Every inch...
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Loud lights blare against Evey's solemn face.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Except one.
          
          A typed document sits on a small tray table in front of her.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "My name is Evey Hammond.  On the
                    5th of November 2019, I was
                    abducted by the terrorist known as
                    codename V and then taken against
                    my will to an unknown location."
          
          Rossiter hovers just behind her as the Interrogator reads her
          confession.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "Once there, I was systematically
                    brainwashed by means physical and
                    psychological.  I was frequently
                    subjected to sexual abuse during
                    this period."
          
          Evey's expression is unchanging.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "Eventually I was terrorized into
                    helping him commit the murders of
                    Derek Almond, Dr. Delia Surridge,
                    and Anthony Lilliman, Bishop of
                    Westminster."
          
          Rossiter drops a pen on the table.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "I, the undersigned, swear that the
                    above statement is genuine and that
                    it was not signed by means of
                    intimidation."
          
          The pen slowly rocks to a stop.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    We'd like you to sign that for us,
                    Miss Hammond.  Where we've put the
                    little cross.
          
          She blinks.
          
                              EVEY
                    No.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    As you wish.
          
          Rossiter begins unbuckling Evey's restraints.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Escort Miss Hammond back to her
                    cell, Rossiter, where she will wait
                    while you arrange a wet detail of
                    six men.
          
          He forces Evey to her feet.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Then take her out behind the
                    chemical sheds and shoot her.
          
          INT.  CELL
          
          The door opens behind Evey as she rereads Valerie's letter
          for the last time.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    It's time, unless you want to
                    change your mind.
          
          She holds the tattered piece of toilet paper to her chest.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Sign that statement.  You could be
                    out inside three years.  Perhaps
                    they'd find you a job with the
                    Finger.
          
          Evey closes her eyes.
          
                              EVEY
                    Thank you but I'd rather die behind
                    the chemical sheds.
          
          Her last words hang in the air.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Then there's nothing left to
                    threaten you with, is there?  You
                    are free.
          
          He turns and leaves.
          
                              EVEY
                    What?
          
          She listens as his footsteps fade down the hall, the door
          hanging weirdly open.
          
          Evey takes a few tentative steps toward the door and sticks
          her head out into the empty hall, peering down both ways.
          
          Slowly, she emerges from her cell, retracing her path down
          the hall that her blindfold never allowed her to see.
          
          Quietly inching along the wall, Evey peeks around a corner,
          gasping at the rigid guard standing off to the side.  There
          is something about the man's frozen stare that keeps her from
          running.
          
          Evey straightens and crosses to the guard.
          
          It is a mannequin.
          
          She touches him, the wheeled platform he is mounted on
          rolling back against the wall.
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          The door creaks open as Evey enters the room where for so
          long she was questioned and tortured.
          
          She crosses to the frozen Interrogator sitting at his desk.
          
          Her finger brushes lightly against the plastic hand, then
          Evey raps a knuckle on his hollow wooden head.  Around his
          neck a small speaker hangs from a cord.
          
          Evey drifts uneasily into a back room where a discarded
          prison guard's uniform hangs on a rack.  On a table next to a
          wig and pair of gloves, the rat looks up at her through the
          bars of its tiny cage.
          
          She moves through another door, the wind suddenly knocked
          from her chest as she finally sees where her prison was
          built --
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V steps from the shadows.
          
                              V
                    Welcome home, Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    You...
          
          Her mouth hangs open.
          
                              EVEY
                    You did this... to me.
          
          Evey's rail thin figure begins to shake.
          
                              EVEY
                    You did this to me!
          
          She stumbles against the wall, unable to support herself.
          
                              EVEY
                    You -- You hit me and -- and cut my
                    hair.  It was you.  It was just you
                    all this time.
          
          She doubles over, covering her face as she bursts into tears.
          
                              EVEY
                    You tortured me.  You tortured me --
          
          Evey looks up at him, body shivering as he quietly glides
          toward her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, why?
          
                              V
                    Because I love you, Evey.  Because
                    I wanted to set you free.
          
                              EVEY
                    Love?
          
          A look of horror twists her starved face.
          
                              EVEY
                    Set me free?  Don't you realize?
          
          Slender fingers ball into fists.
          
                              EVEY
                    Don't you realize what you did to
                    me?  You nearly drove me mad!
          
          Disgust and anger light up her eyes.
          
                              EVEY
                    I hate you.
          
          Her little, wiry body coils tight as she circles him.
          
                              EVEY
                    I hate you!  Set me free?  You put
                    me in a prison to set me free?!
          
                              V
                    You were already in a prison. 
                    You've been in a prison all your
                    life.
          
                              EVEY
                    Shut up!  I don't want to hear it. 
                    I wasn't in a prison.  I was happy! 
                    I was happy here --
          
                              V
                    Happiness is the most insidious
                    prison of all, Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    That's warped!  That's evil and
                    it's wrong!  What gives you the
                    right to judge?  Who are you to say
                    what's not good enough?!
          
                              V
                    You were born in a prison, Evey.  I
                    didn't put you there.  I just
                    showed you the bars.  You've been
                    in a prison so long, you no longer
                    believe there's an outside world.
          
          She wheels away from him, covering her ears, trying to get
          away from his voice.
          
                              EVEY
                    Shut up!  You're mad!  I don't want
                    to hear it!
          
                              V
                    That's because you're afraid, Evey. 
                    You're afraid because you can feel
                    freedom closing in on you.  You're
                    afraid because freedom is
                    terrifying.
          
          Evey falls, stumbling through the labyrinth of the Shadow
          Gallery.
          
                              EVEY
                    I can't feel anything!  There's
                    nothing left to feel!  Don't you
                    understand?
          
                              V
                    Don't back away from it, Evey. 
                    Part of you understands the truth
                    even as part pretends not to.
          
          She collapses, head pounding.
          
                              V
                    Woman, this is the most important
                    moment in your life.  Don't run
                    from it.
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't know what -- Oh god -- I
                    can't breathe --
          
          V couches next to her.
          
                              V
                    Good.  You're almost there.  Go
                    closer.  Feel the shape of it.
          
                              EVEY
                    What are you doing to me?  I can't
                    breathe --
          
                              V
                    You were in a cell.  They offered
                    you a choice between the death of
                    your principles and the death of
                    your body.
          
          He cradles her as she hyperventilates, tears streaming down
          her face.
          
                              EVEY
                    I feel -- I feel like I'm going to
                    burst.
          
                              V
                    You said you'd rather die.  You
                    faced the fear of your own death
                    and you were calm.  Try to feel now
                    what you felt then.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god -- I felt --
          
          The mask hovers over her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Like an angel --
          
          He squeezes her shuddering body.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, V, I'm so scared.  What's
                    happening to me?
          
                              V
                    The door of the cage is open, Evey. 
                    All that you feel is the wind from
                    outside.  Don't be afraid.
          
          Gently, he lifts her.
          
                              V
                    Try to walk.  The lift will take us
                    to the roof.
          
                              EVEY
                    The roof?  Outside?
          
          He helps her to an open elevator.
          
                              EVEY
                    I -- I don't want to be
                    blindfolded.
          
                              V
                    No, Evey.  No more blindfolds.
          
          The cage in the elevator rattles shut.
          
          EXT.  ROOF - NIGHT
          
          The two figures stand in the door of the roof access, a
          raging tempest oozing from a split sky.
          
          Something draws Evey out into the storm.
          
          Slowly, she walks beneath it, the wind and rain pounding
          against her thin frame.  Evey lets the coarse slipover fall
          to the ground and stares straight up into the storm, naked,
          the elements soaking into her very being.
          
          V moves up behind her.
          
                              V
                    Do you feel it?
          
                              EVEY
                    Everything's so -- different.
          
                              V
                    I know.  Five years ago, I too
                    stared beneath a night like this. 
                    Naked under a roaring sky.
          
          A low rumble of thunder washes over London.
          
                              V
                    The night is yours, Evey.  Seize
                    it.  Encircle it within your arms.
          
          His words buffet against her with the sheets of rain.
          
                              V
                    Bury it in your heart up to the
                    hilt.
          
          She raises her arms to embrace the raging torrent.
          
                              V
                    Become transfixed and
                    transfigured -- 
                    
          A jagged bolt of lightning shatters the sky.
          
                              V
                    Forever.
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          Finch gets out of a police car and looks up the black face of
          the modern building.  He sighs and taps his pipe against the
          heel of his shoe.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Finch!
          
          Finch turns to find Dascombe hurrying towards him.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Do you know what this is all about?
          
                              FINCH
                    No, but I can guess.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    What?
          
                              FINCH
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November."
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Oh come on.  He's long gone.  He
                    has to be.  He did what he came to
                    do and it's over.
          
          Finch chews on his pipe.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Isn't it?
          
                              FINCH
                    Not for us.
          
          He turns and heads into the building.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.
          
          FADE IN:
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY
          
          A dark November sky hangs like a shroud over the building.
          
                              LEADER (V.O.)
                    A year, gentlemen.
          
          INT.  COUNCIL CONFERENCE ROOM
          
          The heads of each department are gathered around a table of
          black granite.
          
          Peter Creedy, sitting back out of the lights, is the new head
          of the Finger.
          
                              LEADER
                    I have given you almost a year and
                    you have given me nothing. 
                    Nothing!
          
          He glares at Finch.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Now Adam, there is no one better
                    than Finch and you know it.
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Dascombe, I do know it. 
                    It is that very fact that keeps me
                    awake at night, wondering if
                    perhaps there is a reason that Mr.
                    Finch has failed.
          
                              FINCH
                    What are you saying?
          
                              LEADER
                    I'm saying that perhaps I don't
                    know you as well as I thought I
                    did.
          
                              FINCH
                    Are you asking for my resignation?
          
                              LEADER
                    No, I am asking for some goddamn
                    results!
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    It's not Finch's fault, Adam.
          
                              CONRAD
                    We've all been looking.  The man
                    simply disappeared.
          
                              ETHERIDGE
                    Vanished.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    He's gone, Adam.  It's over.
          
          The Leader trembles like a volcano set to blow.
          
                              LEADER
                    It's over, is it?  He's gone. 
                    Vanished, you say?
          
          The Leader grabs a large box from the floor and hurls reams
          of computer printout across the table.
          
                              LEADER
                    Transcripts recorded over the last
                    thirty days in which the terrorist
                    was talked about or mentioned in a
                    positive context.  This is only
                    thirty days!
          
          He punches a "play" button and a wall of monitors blink on. 
          It is a recording of a television variety show.
          
          A character that is made to look like Adam Susan is giving a
          speech.  A woman is dressed like V except that the only thing
          she is wearing under her cloak is a garter belt, stockings
          and high heels.
          
          V sneaks up behind Susan and yanks his pants down.  Susan is
          outraged but when he gives chase he trips over his pants. 
          The audience hoots and howls.
          
          The Leader kills the tape.
          
                              LEADER
                    Is this what you consider,
                    "disappeared?"
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    For god's sake, Adam, it's a stupid
                    variety show.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Creedy, I want the producers,
                    writers, and actors of that "stupid
                    variety show" arrested and charged
                    with sedition.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Yes, sir.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    You can't be serious --
          
                              LEADER
                    Push me, Roger, push me and you'll
                    find out how serious I am.
          
          He stares each of them to silence.
          
                              LEADER
                    This, this V is still out there.  I
                    can feel him like a sickness
                    worming its way into the hearts and
                    minds of the public.  Something
                    must be done, and done quickly, to
                    exorcise this demon for the very
                    soul of this country is at stake.
          
          He pauses.
          
                              LEADER
                    That is why I am compelled to give
                    each and every one of you notice
                    that if by the fifth of November
                    you are still giving me nothing
                    more than excuses, I will have to
                    revoke your party status and
                    terminate your positions.
          
          Everyone is stunned.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Creedy, I will speak with you
                    in private.  The rest of you are
                    dismissed.  England prevails.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
          
          The Leader stands at the window.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Creedy, as the new head of the
                    Finger, you are the most important
                    member of my cabinet.
          
                              CREEDY
                    I, uh, appreciate your faith in me.
          
                              LEADER
                    Your predecessor, Mr. Almond, was a
                    good man, a man who understood what
                    strength in unity meant, a man who,
                    above all, loved his country.  I
                    need to know if you are such a man.
          
          His eyes bore into him.
          
                              LEADER
                    Do you love your country, Mr.
                    Creedy?
          
          EXT.  ALLEYWAY
          
          A police car is parked in a dark alley.  It is raining and
          the windows of the car are completely steamed.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Oh god, yes!
          
          He is sweating, his knuckles white as he squeezes the
          steering wheel, panting.
          
          We hear a noise like a very wet kiss and then a woman's
          voice.

                    "The most important member of my
                    cabinet."  Yes it is, isn't it,
                    dear?
          
          Helen lifts her head out of his lap.  Her lipstick is smeared
          about her mouth.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Oh, don't stop.
          
                              HELEN
                    I stop when you stop.  What did he
                    say next?
          
                              CREEDY
                    I can't --
          
          She whispers in his ear while playing with his lap.
          
                              HELEN
                    Come on, Peter, what are you afraid
                    of?  Almond used to tell me
                    everything and you're twice the man
                    he was.
          
                              CREEDY
                    He asked me... if I loved my
                    country.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh yes, I can tell you do love your
                    country, almost as much as you love
                    this...
          
          She lowers her head into this lap.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Oh god...
          
                              HELEN
                    Go on.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Then he asked me to do something...
                    oh, oh...
          
                              HELEN
                    What?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Helen, I can't.  I can't tell you.
          
          Helen lifts her head.
          
                              HELEN
                    He told you to frame someone as the
                    terrorist.
          
                              CREEDY
                    My god?!  How did you know that?
          
                              HELEN
                    I know Adam Susan.  Now who was it?
          
                              CREEDY
                    No way.  I can't tell you that.
          
                              HELEN
                    Yes you can, honey.  You can and
                    you will.  You have to trust me,
                    love.  We're going to help each
                    other.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Helen, please.
          
                              HELEN
                    Look at that face.  You see? 
                    You're just bursting to tell me.
          
          Her head drops back down.  Creedy moans.
          
                              HELEN
                    Now who was it?
          
                              CREEDY
                    It was... Fi... Fi... FINCH!
          
          The name seems to orgasm from his mouth.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S APARTMENT
          
          Finch sits alone in his modest apartment, reading a book. 
          The book is Koesterler's, "The Roots of Coincidence."
          
          An old CD player is playing music, a Bach piano concerto.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V is playing the exact same concerto on his piano, his gloved
          fingers gracefully flitting across the keys.
          
          Evey enters the gallery.  Her hair has grown out but is still
          short.  She projects a kind of strength that comes from a
          deep inner peace.
          
          V coaxes the final delicate notes and lets them softly fade.
          
                              EVEY
                    That was beautiful.
          
          She walks up to him and takes the smiling face in her hands.
          
                              EVEY
                    I've wanted to do this for a long
                    time.
          
          She bends and gently kisses the frozen lips.
          
                              EVEY
                    Thank you, V.  Thank you for
                    everything you've done for me.
          
                              V
                    You did it all yourself, Evey.  I
                    just provided the backdrop but the
                    drama was all your own.
          
                              EVEY
                    It was a good backdrop.  I believed
                    it.  I really did.  It's still a
                    bit hard for me to accept that it
                    wasn't real.  That it was just you. 
                    Especially the letter.
          
          She takes the letter from her pocket.
          
                              EVEY
                    It is a beautiful letter, V.  Every
                    time I read it I could feel
                    Valerie, almost like she was
                    holding me.  I believed in her most
                    of all.  I believed that she loved
                    me and I loved her back.
          
          She looks down.
          
                              EVEY
                    I feel a bit foolish telling you
                    this.  I know that you must have
                    written it and thought you should
                    have it back.
          
                              V
                    But I didn't write that letter,
                    Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    What?
          
                              V
                    Come with me.
          
          INT.  VALERIE'S ROOM
          
          It is a shrine.  The walls are covered with movie posters and
          reviews and pictures of an actresses named Valerie Page.  We
          recognize her as the woman chosen for the medical block just
          before V.
          
          Everywhere there are flower boxes filled with blooming roses;
          violet carsons.
          
                              EVEY
                    Valerie?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  Valerie Page.  She was the
                    woman in room four.
          
                              EVEY
                    She's beautiful.
          
                              V
                    She wrote the letter just before
                    she died.  I delivered it to you as
                    it was delivered to me.  The words
                    you wept over were the same words
                    that transformed me.
          
          Evey smiles and bends to smell the roses.
          
                              EVEY
                    Roses.  You grew them for her.
          
                              V
                    Yes.
          
                              EVEY
                    They're beautiful.
          
                              V
                    Evey, do you know what day it is?
          
                              EVEY
                    Two days before the first day we
                    met.
          
                              V
                    You remembered.
          
                              EVEY
                    You're planning something, aren't
                    you, V?
          
                              V
                    You know me too well now.
          
                              EVEY
                    What are you going to do?
          
                              V
                    I'm going to fulfill an old
                    promise.
          
          Evey cocks an eyebrow.
          
                              V
                    I'll show you.
          
          INT.  UNDERGROUND STAIRWELL
          
          Carrying a lantern, V leads Evey down a dark stone staircase.
          
                              EVEY
                    I've never been here before.
          
                              V
                    Yes.  It is the deepest part of my
                    home.  Once you know it, I should
                    think you'll know everything.
          
          He pushes a button and a secret passage opens in a heavy
          stone wall.
          
          There is a small narrow series of passageways that he guides
          her through, leading to another door.  Evey steps out into an
          underground subway station.
          
          INT.  VICTORIA STATION
          
          Parked beside the concrete platform is a beautiful antique
          train car.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh, V, it's lovely.  Where on earth
                    did you find it?
          
                              V
                    In a way, I suppose it really found
                    me.
          
          Evey steps into the train car and finds it filled with little
          packages wrapped in wax paper.
          
                              EVEY
                    What's in these packages?
          
                              V
                    Gelignite.
          
          She screams and almost drops one.
          
                              V
                    Careful.
          
                              EVEY
                    What are you going to do with all
                    of it?
          
                              V
                    I told you.  I'm going to finish
                    what was started four hundred years
                    ago.
          
                              EVEY
                    Where does this train go?
          
                              V
                    This is the old Victoria line but
                    it is blocked, blocked somewhere
                    between Whitehall and St. James.
          
                              EVEY
                    Whitehall... V, that's the New
                    Government Building.
          
          V nods.
          
                              EVEY
                    But the underground has been shut
                    down for years.  How are you going
                    to make it run without any power?
          
                              V
                    I just thought I might ask them to
                    turn it on for me.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader sits bathed in the flickering images of the Fate
          computer.
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Creedy?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Everything's set, sir.  No worries.
          
                              LEADER
                    When?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Tonight.
          
          On one of the screens, a television program has just begun.
          
                              ANNOUNCER
                    Tonight on Tales from the Bible, a
                    story of treachery and betrayal
                    from the Book of Daniel.
          
          We cut from that screen to another screen --
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER - CONTROL BOOTH
          
          The television studio where Roger Dascombe surveys a large
          bank of monitors filled with the images of typically vapid
          television entertainment.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    All of London's waiting.  Ready,
                    two.  And here we go --
          
          A player locks on as a recorded program begins.  We move in
          as the logo slashes across the screen: Storm Saxon.
          
                              ANNOUNCER
                    Tonight, England's greatest hero
                    repels the forces of darkness in a
                    brand new episode.
          
          We pull back from the show's opening teaser and find
          ourselves looking at a small television.
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          In the delivery bay at the back of Jordan tower, five
          security guards are riveted to the heroic actions of Storm
          Saxon.
          
                              HEIDI
                    Oh, Storm.  Save me!  Save me!
          
                              STORM
                    You mongrel trash, if you harm her!
          
                              MONGREL TRASH
                    Look out, de white debil has a
                    laser lugar!
          
          Behind them, a shadowy figure in a cloak and tall hat enters
          the loading bay.
          
                              GUARD
                    Hey, what the -- ?
          
          They all turn and find a smiling V.
          
          They go for their weapons.  V goes for them.  It is brutal
          and quick, knives slicing in bloody arcs, bodies kicked and
          thrown with superhuman power.
          
          The TV crashes to the ground and we move in at it as Storm
          Saxon stands triumphant beside his buxom lass.
          
                              HEIDI
                    Oh Storm, hold me.  Hold me tight.
          
          We pull back on another television screen inside --
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Dominic is chewing on a hamburger, engrossed in Storm Saxon. 
          Across the room, Finch is reading the "Roots of Coincidence."
          
                              FINCH
                    I don't know how you stand that
                    tripe.
          
          Dominic answers with a mouthful of cheeseburger.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Es gooh.
          
          Finch shakes his head, reaching for his pipe.  He realizes he
          is out of tobacco.  He slides open the bottom desk drawer and
          his eyes almost pop out of his head.
          
          He stares into the drawer like someone staring at his own
          tombstone.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Finch?  Finch, what's wrong?
          
          Slowly, he lifts something from the drawer.  On his desk, he
          lays out several knives, a cloak, a hat, and a smiling mask.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    What the hell?
          
          Finch lifts the mask and almost has to laugh.
          
                              FINCH
                    Don't you see, Dominic?
          
          He puts the mask to his face.
          
                              FINCH
                    I'm V.
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          V emerges from an elevator and immediately attacks several
          more guards.  A surveillance camera watches as V steps over
          their slumped, broken bodies.
          
          INT.  CONTROL CENTER
          
          The security guard sees V on the monitor coming directly down
          the hall.
          
                              GUARD
                    Bloody hell!
          
          He grabs the machine gun, aiming it just as V kicks open the
          door.
          
                              GUARD
                    Freeze!
          
          V stops.  At least five guards have trained their weapons on
          him.  He is surrounded.
          
          Slowly, he lifts his arms as though surrendering.  His cloak
          opens, revealing enough TNT to level the entire building.  In
          his hand is the plunger detonator.
          
                              GUARD
                    Fuck all.
          
          V nods.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          The door bursts open as Creedy and a group of heavily armed
          Fingermen muscle in.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Creedy?  What the hell's going on?
          
                              CREEDY
                    I'm here to arrest Mr. Finch for
                    acts of treason and terrorism.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    You can't be serious.
          
                              CREEDY
                    If I were you, boy, I'd shut my
                    hole unless you want to start
                    explaining why you didn't say
                    nothing about Mr. Finch's secret
                    identity.
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          V follows Roger Dascombe into the main control booth.  The
          door shuts behind them and they are alone.
          
          All around them are the laugh tracks and gunshots of the
          evening's entertainment.
          
          V puts his hand into his cloak and pulls out a videotape.  He
          hands it to Dascombe.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Finch glares at Creedy.
          
                              FINCH
                    Why don't you just shoot me,
                    Creedy?  Wouldn't that make
                    everything a lot simpler?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Yeah, I suppose it would.
          
          Creedy smiles, his finger tightening on the trigger when --
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Holy Christ!  Creedy, you stupid
                    ape!  If Finch is V then tell me
                    who is that?
          
          He points at the television where V sits calmly at a desk in
          front of the "VTV" logo.
          
                              V
                    Good evening, London.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Bloody fuckin' hell.
          
                              V
                    I thought it was time we had a
                    little talk.
          
                              FINCH
                    He has to be at Jordan tower.  Come
                    on!
          
          Finch and Dominic rush out of the room.  Creedy looks at his
          confused men.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Don't just stand there!  Follow
                    them!
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          V smiles at the horrified Adam Susan.
          
                              V
                    Are you sitting comfortably?  Good. 
                    Then I'll begin.
          
          The Leader screams, pounding on Fate.
          
                              LEADER
                    Damn you!  Damn you!
          
          He hits the intercom.
          
                              LEADER
                    Lieutenant, ready my transport.  I
                    want every armed man within a
                    hundred miles at Jordan tower. 
                    Now!
          
          We move in at VTV.
          
                              V
                    Right now, I imagine there are
                    hundreds of soldiers rushing here
                    to kill me because someone does not
                    want us to talk.
          
          We pull back in --
          
          INT.  LIVING ROOM
          
          A family watching television.  In the background, two
          children are squabbling.
          
                              MOTHER
                    Hush.  Turn it up.
          
          The husband does.  V's voice gets louder as we move towards
          him.
          
                              V
                    They are afraid that I am going to
                    say the things that are not
                    supposed to be said.  They are
                    afraid that I am going to say the
                    truth.
          
          INT.  APARTMENT
          
          A man sits on his couch, mesmerized by V.
          
                              V
                    The truth is that there is
                    something terribly wrong with this
                    country, isn't there?  If you look
                    about, you witness cruelty,
                    injustice and despotism.  But what
                    do you do about it?  What can you
                    do?
          
          He pops his beer tab and the beer foams over the couch but he
          doesn't seem to notice.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S POLICE CAR
          
          The car races wildly towards Jordan tower as Finch and
          Dominic listen to the broadcast on the radio.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You are but a single individual. 
                    How can you possible make any
                    difference?  Individuals have no
                    power in this modern world. 
                    That is what you've been taught
                    because that is what they need you
                    to believe.  But it is not true.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S TRANSPORT
          
          The Leader seethes, staring at three television monitors in
          his limo which are all filled with V.
          
                              V
                    This is why they are afraid and the
                    reason that I am here; to remind
                    you that it is individuals who
                    always hold the power.  The real
                    power.  Individuals like me.  And
                    individuals like you.
          
          INT.  KITTY KAT KELLER
          
          The bar is almost completely soundless except for the voice
          of V.  People stare at the television as if the moment were
          somehow suspended in time.
          
                              V
                    I have come to offer you a deal. 
                    If you accept, I will give you a
                    different world.  A world without
                    curfews, without soldiers and
                    surveillance systems.  A world that
                    is not run by other men but that is
                    run by you.  I am offering you a
                    second chance.

                    Four hundred years ago, a great
                    citizen made a most significant
                    contribution to our common culture. 
                    It was a contribution forged in
                    secrecy and stealth although it is
                    best remembered in noise and bright
                    light.
          
          EXT.  TELEVISION STORE
          
          A crowd has gathered, watching through the window.
          
                              V
                    To commemorate that glorious night
                    at precisely the stroke of
                    midnight, the edifice of their
                    world will erupt with enough sound
                    and fury to shake the earth.  All I
                    ask is that you join me at the
                    gates to watch as the past is
                    erased, the pathway cleared so that
                    together we can start toward a new
                    day.
          
          EXT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          The Leader climbs out of his limo and is met by one of his
          captains.
          
                              LEADER
                    I want this man dead!  I want him
                    shot on sight!
          
                              CAPTAIN

                              V (V.O.)
                    But, you ask, who am I to make such
                    promises?  A fair question but
                    hardly necessary as you know me
                    already.  To know me any more you
                    need only look to a mirror.
          
          Finch catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror.

                    Truth be told, this wasn't even my
                    idea, was it?  If you think back,
                    you'll remember that night,
                    whispering in your lover's arms.  I
                    became a part of your plan just as
                    you have now become part of mine. 
                    Give me the line of the queen and
                    I'll give you your secret dream.

          A heavy battering ram is rushed down the hall, carried by
          four soldiers.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    On the twelfth stroke of the fifth
                    day of the eleventh month, I hope
                    we shall all meet again.

                    Until then, I bid you goodnight.
          
          Every screen suddenly goes black.  The crowd turns to each
          other, unsure of what to do.

          The door explodes open.  V is standing alone, almost as if
          waiting for them.
          
          Before he can even move, they shoot.  Machine gun fire lights
          up the room.  V's body dances and jerks backward, smashing
          through an observation window --
          
          Falling to the television stage below.
          
          INT.  HALL
          
          A path is cleared for the Leader.  As he heads into the
          television studio, an armed soldier is heading in the
          opposite direction.
          
          It is impossible to tell because of the dark face plate but
          it looks like the soldier is smiling.
          
          The Leader shoves his way onto the main stage.  A group of
          soldiers is gathered around the body.
          
                              LEADER
                    Who was it?  Who was he?
          
          The mask is pried off, revealing the lifeless face of Roger
          Dascombe.  To the Leader, it is an obvious revelation.
          
                              LEADER
                    Roger Dascombe!  Of course.  Of
                    course!  It makes such perfect
                    sense.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Sir, I think there has been a
                    mistake.
          
                              LEADER
                    No!  There is no mistake!
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    But sir, there are people that say
                    they saw both the terrorist and
                    Dascombe together --
          
                              LEADER
                    Who?  Who are these people?  They
                    must be detained immediately. 
                    Whatever they saw or whatever they
                    think they saw is subordinate to
                    the truth and that truth is that
                    Roger Dascombe is the terrorist and
                    the terrorist is dead!
          
                              FINCH
                    But I thought I was the terrorist.
          
          Finch's voice stops the Leader cold.
          
                              LEADER
                    Finch, what are you doing here?
          
                              FINCH
                    Since I'm not in jail and since you
                    have another, even more convenient
                    suspect.  I'm guessing the charges
                    have been dropped.
          
                              LEADER
                    Be careful, Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    I am careful, sir.  Always.  That
                    is why I suggest that a search of
                    this building begin immediately.
          
                              LEADER
                    The terrorist is dead!
          
                              FINCH
                    With all due respect, I disagree
                    and I believe that he is presently
                    trying to get out of this building
                    disguised as one of us.
          
                              LEADER
                    Are you challenging my authority?
          
                              FINCH
                    No sir, I'm trying to run an
                    investigation --
          
                              LEADER
                    I am trying to run a country!  When
                    I tell you, Mr. Finch, the
                    terrorist is dead, then the
                    terrorist is dead!  If you continue
                    to suggest otherwise then you will
                    leave me no choice but to have you
                    arrested on charges of sedition. 
                    Do I make myself clear?
          
          He eyes the room.  Everyone is silent.
          
                              LEADER
                    Now, it is imperative for the
                    people of London to know that they
                    are safe, that the terrorist is
                    dead and everything is under
                    control.
          
          The Leader storms past Finch who looks at Dascombe and bites
          down on his pipe.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          One of the Ear's black vans has been modified with large
          speakers wired to the roof.  As the van rolls down the
          street, the speakers drone with a looped message.
          
                              SPEAKERS
                    The terrorist is dead.  No further
                    threat exists.  Everything is under
                    control.
          
          Out of the back, soldiers hurl leaflets that swirl and
          flutter in the van's wake.
          
          The little girl on the bicycle that we saw earlier stops and
          picks up one of the leaflets.
          
          It has a picture with the body of Roger Dascombe beneath the
          headline, "The terrorist is dead!  London is safe once
          again!"
          
                              LITTLE GIRL
                    Bollocks.
          
          She crumbles the leaflet and throws it.
          
                              LITTLE GIRL
                    Bollocks!
          
          She gets off her bike and takes something out of the
          backpack.
          
                              LITTLE GIRL
                    He's not dead!  It's all bollocks!
          
          Turning to a nearby wall, she spray paints a large circle
          around a "V".
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          A recording of VTV plays on the small television.

                    ... if you give me the line of the
                    queen, I'll give you your secret
                    dream.
          
          Dominic freezes the image; V stares at them, smiling.
          
                              FINCH
                    Play it again.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Come on, Finch.  We've seen it
                    fifty times.  I mean, after what
                    they done to you, I don't know why
                    we're even trying to stop him.
          
          Finch stares out the window.
          
                              FINCH
                    I don't know.  For twenty seven
                    years, I've been at this job. 
                    Twenty seven years, I've done what
                    I've been told to do.  Maybe that's
                    all there is to it.  I'm just a
                    dumb old dog.  A dumb old dog that
                    only knows one trick.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    That ain't it, Finch.  It's more
                    than that.  I know you.  It's
                    something personal with this one.
          
          Finch smiles.
          
                              FINCH
                    Maybe.  And maybe I'm not ready for
                    a revolution.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Well, we got less than thirty hours
                    to stop it.
          
                              FINCH
                    We will.

                    How?
          
                              FINCH
                    It's on the tape.  I know it.  I
                    can feel it.  He did this for a
                    reason.  He needs something.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    What?
          
                              FINCH
                    The line of the Queen?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    But what does that mean?
          
                              FINCH
                    Maybe it's a line from Shakespeare. 
                    Or a book.  I don't know.
          
          He rewinds and starts the tape.

          Helen Heyer is lying on her bed, eating chocolates, watching
          V through calculating eyes.
          
          At her feet, we hear a suckling noise that suddenly stops.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Helen?  Helen, why did you want
                    that tape?
          
                              HELEN
                    Shut up, Conrad.  I'm thinking.
          
          She shoves her foot back into his mouth and he continues to
          suck on it and each of her toes.

          at him.

                    All right.  You have a deal.
          
          Conrad licks along the inside of her thigh until she slaps

                    Oh no!  Not you.  Conrad.  Not yet. 
                    Here you can have a chocolate. 
                    Open up.  Open!
          
          She shoves the candy in his mouth.

                    Right now I need something else

                    pretty little brain for me.  You

                    Good evening London.  As Leader of
                    this great country, I felt it
                    imperative to speak with you and to
                    assure you once and for all that
                    the shadow that recently fell
                    across our land has indeed passed.

                    What we have endured this long year
                    was no accident, no mere
                    coincidence.  This was not a simple
                    act of terror conducted by a
                    singular madman.  No, this was a

                    It was not me, nor the Party, nor
                    the government that was threatened
                    this year.  It was our beliefs. 
                    Our faith.  I believe that God
                    himself bore witness to our
                    struggle and like Job I believe
                    that we have been vindicated.

                    How do I know this?  Let me read to
                    you where I found the answer, where
                    I so often find the answer.  In the
                    Scripture.  Revelations.

                    "He that leadeth into captivity
                    shall go into captivity; he that
                    killeth with the sword shall be
                    killed with the sword.  Here is the
                    patience and faith of the Saints."
          
          Finch stops reading, listening to the radio.

                    "And I beheld another beast coming
                    out of the Earth; and he had two
                    horns like a lamb and he spake as a

          Another radio crackles with the Leader's voice.

                    "And he doeth great wonders, so

          V nods, almost laughing as Evey enters the gallery.
          
                              LEADER (V.O.)
                    "And he deceiveth them that dwell

                              V
                    Of course, my dear.
          
          He reaches over and changes the frequency.  We hear voices,
          hushed and secret but we recognize them.
          
                              CREEDY (V.O.)
                    But how does he know?
          
                              HELEN (V.O.)
                    I don't know.  All I know is he
                    does... And I know what he wants.
          
          The voices are labored, punctuated by gasps and moans.
          
                              EVEY
                    What is that, V?
          
                              V
                    That, Evey, is what I have been
                    waiting for.
          
                              CREEDY (V.O.)
                    Do you know what I want?  I want
                    you just like this... Bent over
                    that black leather chair...
          
          We are pulled by the radio into --
          
          INT.  CREEDY'S BEDROOM
          
          Where we see a tiny microphone hidden in the ceiling light
          above the bed.
          
          Helen moans as we drift down, glimpsing Helen, her arms
          reaching for the edges of the bed, her back arching up
          towards Creedy, behind her, smiling.
          
                              CREEDY
                    What about Conrad?
          
                              HELEN
                    I told you, I'll handle Conrad and
                    V will take care of Susan.  The mob
                    will take care of the guard and
                    then... You can use the Finger to
                    take over.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Use the Finger?  You mean like
                    this?
          
          He inserts a finger into her.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh... oh... that is vulgar...
          
                              CREEDY
                    But you like it?
          
                              HELEN
                    Yes, oh yes, oh you're a pig,
                    Peter...
          
                              CREEDY
                    That I am, misses.  But I'm the pig
                    that's gonna be running this
                    country.
          
          That sends a shiver through Helen's body.
          
                              HELEN
                    Yes and I'm... I'm going to be
                    Eva... Oh Eva...
          
          Her eyes close and her fists knot the sheets.
          
                              HELEN
                    "Don't cry for me Argen... oh
                    Argen... Argen... tina!
          
          The word is almost lost in her orgasm.

          The sun rises over London.  It is the morning of the fourth.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Finch looks through the blinds at the morning sun.  He has
          been up all night.  He checks his watch: 6:00am.
          
                              FINCH
                    Eighteen hours.
          
          Rubbing the knot in his neck, he turns back to his office
          which is now buried beneath mounds of paper.
          
          Dominic is passed out, sprawled on the couch, and clutching a
          printout from Spencer's "Fairy Queen."

                    Dominic, go home.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    But I've still got over three
                    hundred lines from The Fairy Queen.
          
                              FINCH
                    Forget it.  There's no more time. 
                    You go home and get some rest. 
                    You're going to need it tonight.
          
          Dominic lets the papers fall to the floor.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    He's got us, doesn't he, Finch?
          
                              FINCH
                    Yes, he does.

          Conrad pulls his car into his reserved space.
          
          INT.  CAR
          
          Helen holds Conrad's chin the way a mother holds a child when
          she is telling them something important.
          
                              HELEN
                    Now listen to me, Conrad.  This is
                    the most important moment of our
                    lives.  Everything I've worked and
                    hoped for comes to this.  Susan is
                    a very dangerous man, especially
                    now, that's why I need you, Conrad. 
                    I need you to be stronger than him. 
                    I need you to be the better man. 
                    Understand?
          
          Conrad nods.
          
                              HELEN
                    If you do this Conrad, and you do
                    it right, I'm going to turn you
                    from the little man I married into
                    the man of my dreams.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Oh, Helen.
          
          He embraces her to kiss but she turns her perfectly painted
          lips.
          
                              HELEN
                    Not on the lips.
          
          Ardently, he kisses her cheek.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Finch sits alone, palms pressed to his bleary eyes.
          
                              FINCH
                    Give it up, old man.  You're not
                    even sure you want to stop him.
          
          With a red pen, he begins absently drawing red circles around
          any V he sees on any piece of paper.
          
          Victims.  Vectors.  Values.  Victory.  Words from quotes and
          lists.
          
          Suddenly, he stops.  Carefully, as if reaching to touch a
          butterfly, he slips a single sheet out from the sheaves
          covering his desk.
          
          The paper has a long list: the names of all the Queens of
          England.  He has circled in red the V in Victoria.
          
          When it hits him, it hits him like a falling safe.
          
                              FINCH
                    Christ!  That's it!  It's got to be

                    Leader, I'm terribly sorry but I
                    absolutely must speak with you.
          
          The Leader waves the Lieutenant off.
          
                              HELEN
                    I have something to tell you,
                    something important but --
          
          She glances at Conrad.
          
                              HELEN
                    I can tell you and only you.  In
                    private.
          
          The Leader studies her.
          
                              HELEN
                    It is a matter of national
                    security.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          In his car, Finch races to a corner and slams on the brakes. 
          He gets out, staring at a shadow on the ground: a "V" in a
          circle.
          
          The shadow is cast by a sign for Victoria Station, part of
          the abandoned subway.
          
          The gates are chained shut.  He fires his pistol into the
          lock, kicks open the rusting gates, and descends into the
          underground.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
          
          The Leader closes the door behind them.

                    Now what's this all about, Mrs.

                              HELEN
                    Please, forgive me.  I've been so
                    afraid, afraid to come here to talk
                    to you.  I thought he must know.  I
                    was terrified he knew but I had to
                    come because I knew you were the
                    only one that can protect me.

                    Protect you from what?
          
          She is unable to go on, seemingly about to burst into tears.
          
                              LEADER
                    Come now, Mrs. Heyer.
          
          He touches her and it is all she needs.  She buries her face
          into his chest.
          
                              HELEN
                    You won't let him hurt me, will
                    you?

                              HELEN
                    The terrorist.

                    Oh, how I wanted to believe it,
                    Leader, but I know it's not true.

                              HELEN
                    Because I know who the terrorist

          Conrad is alone with Fate.  He glances about nervously,
          moving closer and closer.  His fingers reach out and graze
          the main keyboard.  Taking a deep breath, he turns and begins
          to type.

                              LEADER
                    Who?  Who is it, woman?
          
                              HELEN
                    It's Conrad, Leader.  Conrad.  My
                    husband is the terrorist.
          
                              LEADER
                    What?!
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          Conrad accesses the department of water and power.  He finds
          the correct file and begins rerouting power to a once dead
          system.
          
          INT.  V'S TRAIN STATION
          
          A hanging light suddenly sizzles to life.  V looks up,
          smiling.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
          
          The Leader stares hard at Helen.
          
                              LEADER
                    How do you know?
          
                              HELEN
                    I saw him, Leader.  In the middle
                    of the night.  I heard something. 
                    I went to the landing and that's
                    when I saw it.
          
          She clutches him.
          
                              HELEN
                    That mask.  That hideous smiling
                    mask.
          
                              LEADER
                    But how did you know it was Heyer?
          
                              HELEN
                    I know, Leader.  I know the way a
                    woman knows.
          
                              LEADER
                    But you have no proof?
          
                              HELEN
                    Proof?
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, proof?  This is an extremely
                    delicate situation, Mrs. Heyer.  It
                    has been reported that the
                    terrorist is dead.  It would be a
                    catastrophe to arrest a man now
                    without concrete, conclusive proof. 
                    Do you have any evidence at all?
          
          Tears well up in Helen's eyes as she shakes her head.
          
                              LEADER
                    But if you're right, if Heyer is
                    indeed the terrorist...
          
          His eyes fly wide and he spins away from her, throwing open
          the door.
          
                              HELEN
                    Leader!  Wait!
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          Conrad sits calmly across the room.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Is everything all right?  Helen?
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Heyer, your wife has done
                    her duty to her country.
          
          He turns to Helen.
          
                              LEADER
                    Don't worry, Mrs. Heyer.  You will
                    be taken care of.  I will launch an
                    immediate investigation and I
                    promise, you will be the first to
                    know when an arrest will be made.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Investigation of what?
          
                              LEADER
                    Subversion, Mr. Heyer.  Your wife
                    was privy to the dialogue of
                    subversives.  That's all you need
                    to know at this time.  Lieutenant!
          
          The Lieutenant appears almost instantly.
          
                              LEADER
                    The Heyers are leaving.  I need to
                    see Mr. Creedy at once.
          
          Helen looks up at the Leader, a smile hidden near the corners
          of her perfect red lips.
          
                              HELEN
                    Thank you, sir.
          
          The Leader nods.
          
          INT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          Helen and Conrad get out of the elevator, standing beneath
          the rows of new party flags that line the lobby.
          
                              HELEN
                    I want you to go straight to your
                    office and wait for me to call. 
                    When I do, I want you to come
                    immediately home.  Understood?
          
                              CONRAD
                    Yes, Helen.
          
          She embraces him, pressing her body against his.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, Conrad, I'm so proud of you.
          
                              CONRAD
                    I did it, Helen.  I did it, didn't
                    I?
          
                              HELEN
                    Tonight, Conrad.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Tonight.
          
                              HELEN
                    I promise you will never forget
                    tonight.
          
          She almost kisses him.
          
                              HELEN
                    Goodbye, Conrad.
          
          Smiling, she pivots on her heel and heads for the door.  He
          reaches for her when --
          
                              GUARD
                    Mr. Heyer!  Mr. Heyer!
          
          The front desk guard rushes towards him.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Yes?
          
                              GUARD
                    Sir, this package arrived for you,
                    sir.
          
          He hands him a small, brown wrapped box.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Thank you.
          
          He looks back for Helen but she is already gone.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          A single flashlight beam creeps toward us as Finch searches
          the detritus of the dead train line.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S CAR
          
          Sitting at a stoplight, Conrad decides to open the package. 
          Inside is a cassette tape.  The light changes and a car
          behind him honks.  He starts forward and inserts the tape.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          Finch crawls up onto the platform of V's hidden station,
          staring at the beautiful old train car.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S CAR
          
          Strangling the steering wheel, Conrad listens to the tape. 
          The speedometer climbs as everything seems to accelerate.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    Do you know what I want?  I want
                    you just like this... bent over
                    that black leather chair.
          
          Helen moans.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Finch steps inside the car, his flashlight sweeping over the
          stacks of gelignite.
          
                              FINCH
                    Oh my god.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S CAR
          
          A scream builds in Conrad.  With tears in his eyes, he stares
          out the windshield but sees only the images created by the
          tape.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    Use the Finger?... You mean like
                    this?... Oh... That's vulgar... But
                    you like it?... Yes... oh yes.
          
          Conrad loses control and the car careens up onto the sidewalk
          and smashes into a brick wall.
          
          Lifting his bloodied forehead, Conrad looks out and sees the
          ubiquitous poster partially destroyed by the crash: "Strength
          through purity, purity through faith."
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Finch hears something and jerks back, almost falling out of
          the car.  Aiming his gun, he finds no one.  He turns and
          bolts.
          
          As the sound of his footsteps fade, V steps out of the
          shadows.
          
          INT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          The Leader's Lieutenant looks up from his desk and sees Finch
          rushing towards him.
          
                              FINCH
                    Is the Leader in?
          
                              LIEUTENANT
                    Yes, but he's meeting with the
                    Captain of the Guard.
          
                              FINCH
                    Perfect.
          
                              LIEUTENANT
                    Mr. Finch, you can't go in --
          
          Finch charges through the doors.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader and his Captain turn.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch?
          
                              FINCH
                    Leader, I need as many men the
                    Captain can spare and I need them
                    right now.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    What for?
          
                              FINCH
                    To capture codename V.
          
          EXT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          Creedy opens the trunk of his car.  In the phosphorescent
          glow of the streetlight, the set of knives gleam.  He bundles
          the costume that he tried to planet on Finch into his arms,
          then slams the trunk.
          
          Above, a window blind that was cracked open snaps shut.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader moves towards Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    He's underground.  The old subway. 
                    I know exactly what he's going to
                    do.  If we move quickly, we can be
                    there, waiting for him.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          Conrad waits, hidden inside a bedroom closet.  He hears the
          front door close and his grip tightens around the handle of a
          long, steel-necked hammer.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader is steadily convincing himself of something.
          
                              FINCH
                    Leader, every second we delay...
          
          The Leader lifts his hand, silencing Finch.
          
                              LEADER
                    I'm coming with you.
          
                              GUARD
                    Sir --
          
                              LEADER
                    There will be no discussion --
          
                              GUARD
                    But if Mr. Finch is right --
          
                              LEADER
                    I am sick to death of this
                    terrorist being everywhere and
                    nowhere!  I will judge whether Mr.
                    Finch is right and I will judge it
                    with my own eyes!  Do I make myself
                    clear, Captain?
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Sir, yes, sir!
          
          Finch is suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling that is common to
          chess players.  It is the disturbing sense that you have just
          done exactly what your opponent wanted.
          
                              LEADER
                    Is there a problem, Mr. Finch?
          
                              FINCH
                    No... no sir.
          
                              LEADER
                    Good.  Captain, mobilize your men.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Sir, yes, sir.
          
                              LEADER
                    We'll find this bloody bastard and
                    we will finish him.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey sits in the gallery, reading Pynchon's "V" just as V had
          done.  She suddenly feels V watching her.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?
          
                              V
                    Yes.
          
          Evey smiles as V steps out of the shadows.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, what's going to happen?
          
                              V
                    Change, Evey.  That's all.  Just
                    change.
          
                              EVEY
                    Is it going to be violent?
          
                              V
                    Yes, I suppose it will.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          Creedy empties a bottom drawer, making room to hide the
          costume.  As he does, the closet door behind him slowly
          creeps open.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V stands at the jukebox.
          
                              EVEY
                    But why?  Why must is be violent?
          
                              V
                    Because, Evey, that is the nature
                    of change.  She is a temperamental
                    creature that appears in earnest
                    rarely but, when she does, she will
                    wear one of two faces.  The first
                    face is the destroyer.  It is
                    lamentable but all true change
                    begins with death.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          A dark figure stands over Creedy.  The hammer raises, a slash
          of silver against the velvety darkness.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V punches a button on the jukebox just as --
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          The hammer falls with a sickening soft crunch.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The song begins to play; a melancholy song that says goodbye
          to love.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          Blood pours down Creedy's snarling face, he snatches one of
          V's knives as another hammer blow cracks through his collar
          bone.
          
          He screams, lunging at Conrad.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V listens to the song, the smiling eyes somehow knowing.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          The hammer falls again and again until the metal head is
          slick with blood and meat.
          
          Conrad stumbles back, dropping the hammer.  He looks down at
          the hilt of the knife protruding from his stomach.  He yanks
          it out and holds V's knife which is bright red with his own
          blood.
          
          He collapses to the floor.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The song continues.
          
                              EVEY
                    What is the other face, V?
          
                              V
                    The other face?  She is the true
                    face of change.  The face of the
                    creator.  She is the one that
                    remakes the world.  Evey?
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, V?
          
                              V
                    May I ask you for a favor?
          
                              EVEY
                    Of course.
          
                              V
                    It is a small thing but it would
                    mean a great deal to me.
          
                              EVEY
                    Tell me.
          
                              V
                    I've never danced before.  I've
                    thought about it many times, here
                    in this room, listening to the
                    music.  But I've always been alone.
          
          Evey smiles and crosses to him.
          
                              EVEY
                    It would be my pleasure.
          
          He opens his arms and she steps into them.  They dance,
          standing very close, his gloved hand holding tightly to hers,
          her smile against his.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Dozens of military vehicles swarm around the entrance to
          Victoria Station while heavily armed men pour through the
          gates of the underground.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The song ends.
          
                              V
                    Thank you, Evey.  You are an
                    excellent dancer.
          
                              EVEY
                    All it takes is a little practice.
          
                              V
                    Alas, I have run out of time.
          
          He bows, pressing his frozen lips to her hand.  Evey is
          suddenly nervous.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?  What are you going to do?
          
                              V
                    Don't you remember?  I have a date
                    tonight, Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    You're coming back though, aren't
                    you?
          
          She seizes hold of his hand.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, I won't let you leave unless you
                    promise me that you will come back.
          
                              V
                    Of course, I'll be back.  You don't
                    think you can be rid of me now, do
                    you?
          
                              EVEY
                    Just promise.
          
                              V
                    I promise.
          
          She lets him go.
          
          INT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          Soldiers swarm through the station.  Susan stares in shock,
          outraged by the mere presence of the train.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mark my words, Mr. Finch, this man
                    is going to become an example so
                    that every man, woman, and child in
                    this country will remember what
                    happens to those who would ever
                    think to stand against the state.
          
          He turns to the Captain.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain, I need a gas unit down
                    here with enough nerve gas to fill
                    every rat-hole in these tunnels.
          
          Suddenly the lights go out.
          
                              FINCH
                    I don't think that will be
                    necessary.
          
          The Leader smiles.
          
                              LEADER
                    There are over one hundred of the
                    best trained soldiers in this
                    country down here.  Let him come.
          
          INT.  TRAIN TUNNELS
          
          Five soldiers creep forward in a tight formation, their
          flashlights probing every nook and cranny.
          
          Behind them, a secret passage opens and V steps out.
          
          He is among them with frightful speed, a grinning dervish
          with blades like metal fangs ripping and rending flesh,
          slashing bright in the flashlight.
          
          Other soldiers rush towards the screams and gunfire but they
          find only five bodies and warm blood running down the walls.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain, what's happening?
          
                              RADIO (V.O.)
                    No sign sir.  Repeat, no sign of
                    him.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    They lost him.
          
          From the opposite end, there is another series of screams and
          machine gun fire that lights up the dark tunnel for a moment. 
          Then, nothing.
          
                              FINCH
                    This... this is a mistake.
          
                              LEADER
                    Don't tell me you're a coward, Mr.
                    Finch.
          
          Back in the tunnels, V drops from above, his cloak a swirling
          cloud of squid ink that hides him in the darkness.
          
          Again, quicksilver knives lash out, drawing fonts of blood.
          
          INT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          Finch can feel the panic that is spreading through the
          tunnel.
          
                              FINCH
                    Leader, we have to get out of here!
          
                              LEADER
                    This was your idea.
          
                              FINCH
                    It was a mistake.  This is what he
                    wants.  He knows us, Leader.  He
                    knows us too well.  We have to get
                    out of here before it's too late --
          
          A voice rings out from hidden speakers, echoing through the
          tunnels.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Good evening citizens of London. 
                    This is the voice of Fate.  Your
                    fate...
          
                              LEADER
                    What trick is this?
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Tonight, the face of London is
                    going to change and I am going to
                    offer you the chance to change with
                    her.  Your Leader is finished.  He
                    will not leave these tunnels alive.
          
          The Leader screams to be heard over the resonant voice of V.
          
                              LEADER
                    This is an outrage!  I order you
                    not to listen to this!
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    At midnight tonight, the Head will
                    be destroyed and a new era will
                    begin.  You must now decide if you
                    are going to be a part of that era.
          
          Everywhere, terrified soldiers listen to the voice.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You can choose to stay here and die
                    with your Leader or you can choose
                    to be free.  The decision is yours
                    and yours alone.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain, order all your men to fall
                    back and secure this position!
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Some of you have wives.  Some of
                    you have families.  All of you have
                    lives.  Consider each of them as
                    you ask yourself, are they a part
                    of the past, or are they a part of
                    the future?
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Fall back.  Fall back and secure
                    the central platform.
          
          Deep in the tunnel, two soldiers look at each other. 
          Simultaneously, they drop their guns and run.
          
                              LEADER
                    Any man that disobeys this order
                    will be court marshaled!
          
          Groups of solders drop their weapons and disappear into the
          shadows.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain!  Captain, where are your
                    men?
          
          The station fills with the sound of boots running wildly
          away.
          
                              LEADER
                    Goddammit, I will not tolerate this
                    insubordination!  I want those
                    deserters shot, Captain.
          
          Finch slowly draws back away from the Leader.
          
                              LEADER
                    Shot on sight!
          
          The few men on the platform are soon the only men left.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    You!  You!  Point position.  We're
                    getting out of here!  Now!
          
          A knife sings through the air and buries itself in the
          Captain's chest.  With a tiny rasp, he falls to the ground.
          
          The remaining men bolt.
          
                              LEADER
                    Traitors!  You cowards!
          
          He grabs for the Captain's machine gun.
          
                              LEADER
                    I know who you are!  I'll see you
                    hang!  Every last one of you!
          
          "You" echoes down the dark empty throat of the tunnel.
          
          The Leader looks around, his flashlight sweeping in big arcs
          as he realizes that he is alone.
          
                              LEADER
                    Finch?  Finch!  Finch, goddammit,
                    you can't leave me!  Don't leave
                    me!
          
                              V
                    You are going to die as you ruled --
          
          The Leader screams, whipping around towards the voice.
          
                              V
                    Alone.
          
          The smile is as cold and as sharp as the knife that flicks
          from his hand.
          
          The Leader raises his gun just when the knife sinks into his
          shoulder.
          
          Howling in pain, he drops the gun.
          
                              LEADER
                    Damn you!  Damn you!
          
          V smiles into the spot of his flashlight.
          
                              LEADER
                    Conrad?  Is that you?  You're
                    working with Finch, aren't you? 
                    And Creedy!  You're all in this
                    together!
          
          V closes in.
          
                              LEADER
                    Who are you?
          
                              V
                    You, most of all, should know,
                    Leader.  You created me.  Without
                    you, I would never be.  More than
                    life, Leader, you gave me purpose.
          
          V draws his final blade.
          
                              V
                    "He that killeth with the sword,
                    shall be killed with the sword."
          
          V raises the knife.
          
                              LEADER
                    Noooo!
          
                              FINCH
                    Don't move!
          
          V and the Leader turn to find Finch aiming a machine gun at
          V.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch!  Oh god, Mr. Finch!
          
                              FINCH
                    Drop the knife.
          
          V does and Susan begins an almost hysterical laugh.
          
                              LEADER
                    Oh, I knew it, Mr. Finch.  I knew
                    you wouldn't desert me.  You're a
                    good man, Finch.  A damn good man.
          
                              FINCH
                    No, Mr. Susan.  No, I'm not.  I'm a
                    man who does his job and does what
                    he's told.  For twenty seven years,
                    that's all I've been.
          
          He steps toward V, staring into his smiling black eyes.
          
                              LEADER
                    Careful, Mr. Finch.  He's quick as
                    the devil.
          
          Finch ignores the Leader.
          
                              FINCH
                    I've read Delia's diary over and
                    over all year.  It sickens me but I
                    am unable to judge her.  I am as
                    guilty as she.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch, what are you doing? 
                    Shoot him.  Kill the bastard,
                    Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    I have no excuse.  I did what I was
                    told to do.
          
                              LEADER
                    Finch, I order you to shoot him! 
                    Finch!
          
                              FINCH
                    My job was to find you and catch
                    you.  I've done my job.  I've done
                    it for the last time.  I'm tired of
                    it.  I'm tired of it all.
          
          He tosses the gun to the Leader.
          
                              FINCH
                    Kill him yourself if you can.
          
          The Leader seethes, his eyes boring into Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    Thank you, V.  And goodbye.
          
                              V
                    Goodbye, Mr. Finch.
          
          The machine gun burst shatters the quiet concrete silence. 
          Finch falls dead at V's feet.
          
                              LEADER
                    I warned you, Finch, the penalty
                    for treason is death.
          
          He aims the gun at V.
          
                              LEADER
                    Are you ready to die?
          
                              V
                    The real question is, are you?
          
          The Leader laughs.
          
                              LEADER
                    Do you really believe you can pick
                    up that knife before I pull this
                    trigger?
          
                              V
                    No.  But I don't have to.
          
          Almost casually, V bends down to pick up the knife --
          
          The Leader screams and fires.
          
          Bullets knock V back a bit but he continues, grabbing the
          knife and standing.
          
          Eyes widening with disbelief, the Leader fires another blast
          as V begins walking towards him.
          
          The machine gun roars, bullets shredding out through the back
          of V's cloak as he continues with short deliberate steps
          until --
          
          The hammer clicks against the pin.  The gun is empty.
          
          V stands before him.
          
                              V
                    You see?  You cannot kill me. 
                    There is no flesh and blood within
                    this cloak to kill.  There is only
                    an idea.
          
          V smiles.
          
                              V
                    And ideas are bulletproof.
          
          The Leader screams.
          
          V drives the knife into his heart, killing him instantly.
          
          V stands alone amidst the carnage and seeping pools of red.
          
          His body wavers.  He takes his hands out from beneath his
          cloak and reveals his gloves, wet with blood.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          The front door opens and Helen enters.
          
                              HELEN
                    Creedy?  Creedy, you dumb bastard,
                    you left your car parked in front.
          
          She walks up the stairs to the bedroom.
          
                              HELEN
                    What did I tell you?  Creedy.
          
          INT.  BEDROOM
          
          She steps into the room, her sole and heel sinking into the
          plush carpet soaked with blood.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh my god.
          
          When she sees Creedy's head mashed open, she covers her
          mouth.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Helen...
          
          Conrad has propped himself against the bed.
          
                              HELEN
                    Conrad!  What have you done?
          
                              CONRAD
                    I won, Helen.  I did it.  I won. 
                    I'm the better man.
          
          He crawls toward her, slipping on the wet carpet.
          
                              CONRAD
                    We've been through a bad patch,
                    Helen.  But now, he's gone...
                    There's nothing to come between
                    us...
          
          He reaches for her foot, his hand gloved with wet red.
          
                              HELEN
                    Don't touch me!  You stupid piece
                    of shit!  You've ruined it!  I had
                    it all planned perfectly and you've
                    ruined it!
          
          She checks her watch; two hours to midnight.
          
                              HELEN
                    I have to get out of here!  I have
                    to get away!
          
          Conrad seizes hold of her ankle.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Helen --
          
                              HELEN
                    No!  Let go!  Now!
          
          The look in his eyes frightens her.  She tries to kick free
          of him but he won't let go.  Twisting, she reaches for the
          door but slips on the carpet.
          
                              HELEN
                    Conrad, damn you!  Let me go!
          
                              CONRAD
                    No, Helen, you're not leaving me...
                    not this time... not ever.
          
          He crawls up her body still clutching the bloody knife.
          
                              HELEN
                    No, please!  Oh god, no!  Oh god,
                    please help me!
          
          Conrad raises the knife.
          
                              CONRAD
                    No one can help us, Helen.  God is
                    dead.
          
          The knife falls.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey hears V on the spiral staircase.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?
          
          Scarlet footprints trail behind V as he struggles down the
          stairs.
          
                              EVEY
                    You came back.
          
          He nods and then collapses, rolling down the rest of the
          stairs.
          
                              EVEY
                    V!  V!
          
          Running to him, she falls to his side.  His clothes are slick
          with blood.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, what happened?
          
                              V
                    Evey...
          
                              EVEY
                    You need a doctor.
          
                              V
                    It's too late for that...
          
                              EVEY
                    No, don't say that!
          
                              V
                    Evey, listen to me.  I've not long
                    and there are things that must be
                    said.
          
          His voice strains beneath the mask.
          
                              V
                    I have done that which I came to
                    do.  Now, it is time for me to rest
                    and with me the past will, at last,
                    find peace.
          
          Trembling, Evey holds him.
          
                              V
                    But the world, the world is not
                    saved... Do not think that, when
                    the fires die and the smoke clears,
                    there is no miracle... there is
                    only a path... upon which they must
                    learn to rule themselves.
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, they need you, V.
          
                              V
                    Not me, Evey, not me.  I told you I
                    am the villain.  The destroyer...
                    But yes, they will need help...
          
          He reaches up and wipes a tear from her cheek.
          
                              V
                    I kept my promise to you, Evey...
                    Now you must promise me.
          
                              EVEY
                    What?
          
                              V
                    Promise me... you will discover the
                    face under this mask... but you
                    will never look beneath it.
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't understand.
          
                              V
                    Promise me.  Please...
          
                              EVEY
                    I promise.
          
                              V
                    Sweet Eve.  Wherever I shall go, I
                    shall always love you.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, you are not going anywhere!
          
                              V
                    Midnight... Midnight.  Eve... Make
                    them remember...
          
                              EVEY
                    You're not going to die, V!
          
                              V
                    Let me be there, Evey, when it
                    begins... Please, let me hear the
                    music, one last time... my music...
          
                              EVEY
                    I won't let you die!
          
                              V
                    I know you won't... I know...
          
                              EVEY
                    V!
          
                              V
                    My love... Ave Atque vale...
          
          Holding him as tight as she can, she feels his life drain
          away, slipping through her arms in the way the last grains of
          sand pour through the neck of the hourglass.
          
          She buries her face beside his and weeps.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          An enormous crowd has begun to gather in the streets
          surrounding the New Government Building.  With the crowd, a
          restlessness swells against each barricade erected by the
          military.
          
          A sergeant stands on an armored car, speaking through a
          megaphone.
          
                              SERGEANT
                    Return to your homes!  There is
                    nothing to see!  The terrorist is
                    dead!
          
                              RABBLE ROUSER 1
                    He ain't dead!
          
                              RABBLE ROUSER 2
                    He'll be here, just like he said!
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey huddles against the stair railing, her face tear
          stained, staring at the lifeless body of V.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I remember... I remember staring at
                    the mask, at that smile.
          
          She touches the mask, her fingers finding its edge.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Part of me couldn't believe he was
                    dead and maybe that was why.  The
                    smile was still the same. 
                    It made me want to tear it off so I
                    could see the face, so I could see
                    that he was dead.
          
          Her fingers stop.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    But I had promised.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You will discover the face under
                    this mask but you will never look
                    beneath it.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I began to try to imagine his face. 
                    Of course, I had long pictured my
                    father behind that smile but I knew
                    in my heart that V was not my
                    father.
          
          Evey stares into the eyes, the dark, empty eyes.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Yet every time I pictured another
                    face, any face, something was lost,
                    something important was somehow
                    diminished.  V was more than a
                    face.  V was V.
          
          Her expression changes.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And then, quite suddenly, quite
                    naturally, I realized whose face
                    must be beneath that mask.  It was
                    the only face that mattered.
          
                              EVEY
                    I won't let you die.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    I know you won't... I know.
          
          A small smile creeps across her face.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Midnight approaches and the crowd feels it.  Spilling
          everywhere, they fill the streets like a flood.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Evey sets a final violet carson on the chest of V.  He is
          lying on a bed made of gelignite, covered in roses.
          
          Touching his mask, she bends over him.
          
                              EVEY
                    Goodbye, my love.
          
          Tenderly, she presses her lips to the smile, her eyes
          closing, her final tears blinking free.
          
          She backs away and V smiles, his lips wet with her kiss, his
          cheek wet with her tears.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Ave Atque vale."
          
          On the train platform, Evey reaches through the window and
          starts the train.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I looked it up the next morning.
          
          The wheels churn as the train lurches forward.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Hail and farewell."
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    "Make them remember..."
          
          She watches the train disappear into the tunnel.
          
                              EVEY
                    They will, my love.  They will.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The crowd surges against a barricade when a voice cries out
          across the city echoing through the megaphone on every
          corner.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November!"
          
          High above the gathered mass, a masked figure steps out onto
          a roof parapet.
          
          The crowd explodes.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          The train barrels along, screaming against its rusted rails.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOP
          
          Dressed as V, Evey stands on the roof's edge, speaking into a
          microphone.
          
                              EVEY
                    I have come here tonight to keep a
                    promise.  A promise that is over
                    four hundred years old.  Tonight I
                    am here to give you your freedom!
          
          Again, the crowd bursts into a frenzy.
          
                              EVEY
                    Since mankind's dawn a handful of
                    oppressors have accepted the
                    responsibility over our lives,
                    responsibility that we should have
                    accepted ourselves.  By doing so,
                    they took our power.  By doing
                    nothing, we gave it away.
          
          The voice booms over the mesmerized crowd.
          
                              EVEY
                    Tonight, our world will change. 
                    Our leaders will be gone and we
                    must choose what comes next.  A
                    return to the chains of others or
                    lives of our own.  A world of the
                    past or one of the future.
          
          She feels the sea of humanity beneath her, almost channeling
          their energy.
          
                              EVEY
                    Let us choose carefully, London,
                    and when we do, let us mark well
                    and remember, remember this fifth
                    of November!
          
          The crowd screams as one and their scream becomes --
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          The train hurling like a bullet through a gun barrel.  Ahead
          the tracks end, buried beneath the rubble of the collapsed
          tunnel.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Inside the rattling train, V lays in perfect repose.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Let me be there, Evey, when it
                    begins...
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOPS
          
          Hidden and alone, Evey pulls the mask from her face.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Please let me hear the music... one
                    last time... my music.
          
          Almost unconsciously, Evey raises her hand and coaxes the
          first soft notes as he had once done.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    At first, you have to listen
                    carefully.
          
          The violins of the 1812 overture steadily rise.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Ah, yes.  There it is.  Beautiful,
                    is it not?
          
          Evey smiles, her hand still gently conducting.
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, my love.  Yes it is.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          With the clash of cymbals, the train crashes into the wall of
          rubble.
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          The entire building opens like a time-lapsed rose blooming
          with brilliant orange petals of flame.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The crowd is awash in the baptismal glow of erupting flame.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOP
          
          Evey watches the explosion, a star-burst of flaming debris
          searing against the night sky like fireworks.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The masses burst through the barricades with a euphoric
          frenzy.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOP
          
          The explosion begins to slowly die.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I know that there is only one way
                    to repay him for what he did.
          
          She looks down at the mask.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And I know that that way is going
                    to take a lot of hard work.
          
          She smiles.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I know this like I know the sun
                    will rise tomorrow and beneath that
                    new sun, our work will begin.
          
          The fire fades and Evey turns, cradling the mask, and walks
          away.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.

                             THIRD REWRITE   August 24, 1994


	Two men bolt recklessly through a downtown street. Hunters
	hot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle.


	The sidewalk is crowded with people. So is the street. Too
	many people, not enough cement. Los Angeles, 1997.


	Summer, probably August. 103 degrees. Heat shimmers off the
	horizon. Making the sky look peculiar.


	The men keep running. Passed a GUY sitting at a bus stop,
	watching a television in his lap. YOU HEAR the NEWSCASTER.


				NEWSCASTER (V. 0.) 
		As L. A. P. D. officers gather
		evidence at this grisly crime
		scene, you can only ask yourselves
		 what kind of lunatic would
		commit such unthinkable crimes?
			(a beat)
		The three adjectives which best
		describe this killer are sadistic,
		intelligent, and dangerous...

	The guy pays little attention to the broadcast. He seems
	almost bored by it. Like this kind of news is commonplace. Or
	he's got more important things on his mind.

	Everybody is sweating. Including the two men struggling to
	swim upstream in the river of pedestrians.

	Their uniforms are freshly pressed. Their shoes just recently
	shined. Hair tightly cropped. Faces perfectly shaved. Clearly
	men proud to wear the badge of the Los Angeles Police
	Department. The guy in the lead is

				PARKER BARNES
		His body is a running back's. His
		endurance a marathoner's. His face
		one you'd want for your own. He's
		in his 30s. If he was in his 20s,
		you'd still be jealous.

	His partner is JOHN DONLEY, late 20s, eager to prove himself.
	He struggles to keep up with Parker. John accidently knocks
	over several pedestrians. They give no reaction, except to
	pick themselves up and continue on their way.

	Parker and John keep charging. Their conversation breathless:

				JOHN
		I can't get over how different you
		look.

				PARKER
			(ruefully)
		Five years can be a bitch, huh?

	They split-up. The Maitre D', still facing the front doors,
	repeats his greeting to no one in particular.

				MAITRE D'
		Good afternoon. May I help you?

	Parker spots Sid 6.7 across the room. Without hesitation the
	hunter chases his prey.  Gun out and firing. NOT what you
	would call Standard Police Procedure.

	Bullets riddle Sid 6.7's table as he dives from his chair. He
	lands next to a bowling ball bag, which sits beneath his
	table.

	John charges from the other direction until a WOMAN gets up
	from her chair, standing directly in John's line of fire.

				JOHN
			(to the Woman)
		Lady, move!

	Before she can do so, Sid 6.7 stands behind the Woman,
	grabbing her and throwing her across the table into Parker.
	CRASH! They tumble to the floor.

	In the same movement, Sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside his
	jacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire.
	John's gun flies from his hand. Sid 6.7 advances toward him.

	Parker struggles to his feet. Aims his weapon. Sid 6.7 does
	the same, but without looking. BOOM! Parker gets a bullet
	through his shooting arm. His wound IDENTICAL to John's.
	Parker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp.

	Parker charges him wildly, but Sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in
	the stomach. In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in
	the background. Parker doubles over, gasping for breath.
	Another kick drops Parker to his knees.

				SID 6.7
			(to Parker)
		I'm going to rehearse with your
		friend a while, then I'll be back
		to perform a new piece with you.

	He grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into John's head,
	knocking him out. Sid 6.7 puts John's unconscious body over
	his shoulder.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		If you get hungry, I'd recommend
		the escargot. They're delicious.

	He carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen.
	Parker scrambles to his gun, and races after Sid 6.7.

	INSIDE THE RESTAURANT KITCHEN

	Parker charges through SOUS CHEFS chopping vegetables, who
	work undistracted. The Vegetables look plastic.

	Parker turns a corner, stopping fast. At the other end of the
	aisle stands Sid 6.7, who presses his gun against the head of
	a frightened BUSBOY. Sid 6.7 holds the Busboy's body in front
	of his own as a shield.

				PARKER
			(to Sid 6.7)
		Where's John?

				SID 6.7
		Performing solo.
			(a beat)
		Enjoying the concert so far?

	Advancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6.7 with
	his good arm. Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs
	watch the showdown.

				PARKER
		Recital's over, asshole.

	He fires directly through the chest of the innocent Busboy
	hitting Sid 6.7.

	The Sous Chefs gasp in horror as the Busboy drops through Sid
	6.7's grasp to the floor. Dead.

	Sid 6.7 stares at Parker in disbelief. Blood is now visible
	flowing from a bullet hole in Sid 6.7's shoulder, which was
	caused by the same bullet. Sid 6.7's arm dangles uselessly.
	His gun lies on the floor.

				SID 6.7
		(surprised, but pleased).
		You and me aren't so different,
		after all...

	Parker again pulls the trigger. Click. Click, click. No
	bullets.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		Like a violin without strings...

	He takes off around the corner. Grabbing another clip from
	inside his uniform, Parker goes after him. Only to stumble
	over something. Sid 6.7's bowling bag. Blood flows through
	its zipper. You now realize the object inside is NOT a
	bowling ball.

	Beside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing.
	His hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. John is
	being electrocuted. Parker kicks away the wires, but not in
	time.

				PARKER
		SHIT!

	He scans the room for Sid 6.7. Parker has no idea Sid 6.7 is
	standing directly behind him. Sid 6.7 grabs Parker by the
	throat.

				SID 6.7
		I told you I was going to perform a
		new piece with you. It's called,
		"First You Suffer, Then You Die."
		Hope you like it.

	Parker gags, unable to breathe. He then starts to DE
	MATERIALIZE from within Sid 6.7's grasp.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
			(as if to God)
		NOOOH! You can't take him, yet. I'm
		not finished!

	John's body also dematerializes as Parker disappears
	entirely.

	The blood seeping from Sid 6.7's wound stops flowing and
	starts retracting into his body. Along with his bone
	fragments. His shoulder is healing itself. Right before your
	very eyes. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is

	ON A MONITOR

	The scene continues seamlessly. Sid 6.7's skin heals over his
	shoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their
	proper places. No scar whatsoever.

	His clothing also returns to perfect condition. Literally, as
	good as new. This is known as AUTOMATIC RESETTING.

	The previously dead Busboy also Auto Resets. His wound
	healing by itself. We PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal the monitor
	is one of several

	INSIDE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT CENTER

	a/k/a LETAC. The facility is a converted aerospace research
	building in Pacoima. Funded by government black book dollars.

	The look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech
	sparkle. Banks upon banks of computer equipment. Wires,
	cables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look.

	In complete disarray to the uninitiated. But to those in the
	know, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the
	world.

	The building is partitioned into dozens of stations. At each
	station, a leading engineer in his field is frantically
	readying a prototype for demonstration. Each new technology
	designed to help fight the new Cold War... the War on Crime.

	The atmosphere is competitive. Voices are loud. Tension,
	anticipation in the air. Only a lucky few will have their
	inventions approved for production.

	LETAC is, quite simply, Los Alamos from 1940 meets Sega from
	1994.

	At a station in the middle of the room, TWO UNCONSCIOUS
	BODIES lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps
	made of polyurethane.

	Each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it
	at points designated as neural primes. Each needle is
	directly connected to the participant's nervous system.

	The tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic
	wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers
	surrounding the beds.

	Each of these components isn't much to look at on its own.
	But together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of
	something very new  a revolutionary law enforcement
	training device whose name you read:

	VIRTUAL REALITY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SIMULATOR

	To be perfectly clear, the events you just witnessed
	involving Parker, John, and Sid 6.7 took place within virtual
	reality, not the real world.

	Dozens of small character modules, similar to today's
	Nintendo game cartridges, are plugged into .the system's main
	console.

	Each of the modules bares a name and number, such as MAITRE
	D' 1.7 and SHEILA 3.2. There is no character version number
	greater than 4.0. Until you see the module labelled SID 6.7.

	The simulation timer stops at: 17 hours, 52 minutes, 11
	seconds. A clock reads: 3:04:32 PM.

	Four observers, two men and two women, watch virtual reality
	monitors positioned around the station. One of the men wears
	an L. A. P. D. uniform. His name is WILLIAM COX, 40S. His
	nameplate reads CHIEF OF POLICE.

	One of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor.
	Intently following the action on screen. Studying it
	clinically. Her name is DR. MADISON CARTER, late 30s.

	She is beautiful, and charming, but those qualities take a
	back seat to her intelligence. She is one of the country's
	foremost authorities on criminal psychology. Her concerns are
	empirical. Her quest is knowledge. She has little in common
	with the other observers.

	The other man is FREDERICK WALLACE, 5Os, Chairman/CEO of
	LETAC. Expensive suit. Commanding, powerful. But not as
	commanding, or powerful, as ELIZABETH DEANE, 605, the
	Presidentiallyappointed Crime Czars

	Elizabeth Deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated
	to LETAC. As well as which prototypes will move on to
	production.

				DEANE
			(quietly to Wallace)
		What did Cox pull him out early
		for?

				WALLACE
		Barnes used to work for him when he
		was still a cop in the field,
		remember?

				DEANE
			(a beat)
		Don't remind me.

	LAB ASSISTANTS remove the polyurethane skull caps from the
	two unconscious bodies. The acupuncture needles remain in the
	caps. You can now see the faces of the participants:

	Parker and John.

	Parker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually
	returns to consciousness. He looks very different than his
	virtual rendering:

	His hair is long and ragged. His face is unshaven. A scar
	across his cheek. A hoop earring in one ear. His outfit a
	filthy prison uniform.

	John's outfit matches Parker's. Physically, he looks as
	cleancut as his virtual rendering. Except that he is
	convulsing. Violently.

	His flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around
	him. Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure. It's ugly.
	Frightening.

				PARKER
			(barely conscious)
		SOMEBODY.. .DO SOMETHING!

	TWO PARAMEDICS burst through the doors and rush to John. The
	paramedics inject him. Fibrillate him. Repeatedly.

	The simulator's designer, DARYL LINDENMEYER, 40s, high
	strung, intense, and brilliant beyond words, stands by the
	equipment protectively. He is far more concerned for the
	safety of his machines than he is for John's life.

	John's body goes limp. His vital signs flat. The Paramedics
	record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet.
	They begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out.

				DEANE
			(annoyed to Wallace)
		What the hell happened?

				WALLACE
			(pointing to needles)
		Lindenmeyer developed neural
		connectors that tap directly into
		the nervous system. If the
		simulator isn't calibrated
		properly, experiencing death in
		this level of VR is like
		experiencing death within a dream.
		The experience becomes real.

				DEANE
			(angrily)
		Simulations are supposed to give
		participants practice in realistic,
		dangerous scenarios while
		protecting them from the risks they
		are exposed to in the real world.

				WALLACE
			(annoyed, to Lindenmeyer)
		I was assured the problem was
		corrected.

				LINDENMEYER
		I did fix it.. I told you I did. I
		don't know why it happened again.

				DEANE
		Again?!

				COX
			(a beat)
		My first two pairs of convicts
		suffered the same fate.

				DEANE
			(coldly, to Wallace)
		Why wasn't I told?

				WALLACE
		Black book dollars, black book
		operation. You pay me for results,
		not how for how I get you there.

				COX
			(to Deane)
		I'll tell you one thing - there is
		no way in hell we should allow any
		real officers to train in this damn
		thing.

				DEANE
		Then about all I've spent $37
		million developing is a very
		expensive way to control the prison
		population.

	After giving Wallace a cold, hard stare -- namely at his hand
	stitched lapel, his gold watch, and his diamond-studded
	cufflinks, she exits. Wallace follows after her quickly. You
	now notice that the chair Dr. Madison Carter had occupied is
	now empty. She left a while ago.

	Cox remains. Lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as
	if it were his child. There are several scratches, but no
	major damage. He looks relieved.

				PARKER
			(struggling to sit up)
		He...only had a year left on his
		sentence.

				LINDENMEYER
			(annoyed)
		How much do you think I care?

	Parker, still not fully conscious, hurls himself at
	Lindenmeyer.

				LINDENMEYER (CONT' D)
			(hysterical)
		Don't touch me!...DON'T TOUCH ME!!!

	He flails his arms wildly. Nearly spasming. This is clearly a
	man who should never drink coffee. TWO armed GUARDS, who've
	been standing in the background, pull Parker off Lindenmeyer
	and throw him to the ground.

	Lindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put
	Parker in handcuffs and leg chains.

				COX
		I'll walk him out.

	The Guards back off as Cox helps Parker to his feet.

				COX (CONT'D)
			(to Parker)
		You all right?

				PARKER
			(still clearing his head)
		Why'd.. .you pull me out?

				COX
		Donley started experiencing the
		attack for real. If I hadn't gotten
		you out, the same thing would have
		happened to you.
			(a beat)
		You may not believe this, Parker,

	but I still consider us friends.

	He helps Parker toward the exit as he continues having
	difficulty with his balance.

	OUTSIDE LETAC

	The building is heavily-guarded. Razor wire, land mines,
	armed sentries. Nobody who shouldn't be here gets anywhere
	near here.

	Cox leads Parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport.
	The two guards walk behind at a distance. Two more by the
	transport. The chain between Parker's legs keeps his steps
	short.

				COX
		What the hell did you have to shoot
		the busboy for?

				PARKER
		He was a computer program for
		crissake.

				COX
		You were supposed to act as if
		everything was real.

				PARKER
		Real, my ass. It's an overblown
		game.
			(a beat)
		Anybody ever catch that fucking
		psycho?

				COX
		Before you, nobody else had gotten
		close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a
		shot at him. Hell, nobody else had
		even been able to start tracking
		him before he got to them first.
			(eyeing Parker's scar)
		New scar  you making it okay in
		there?

				PARKER
			(head down)
		I'm getting by.

	He starts walking ahead of Cox. Distancing himself.

				COX
			(pausing for emphasis) )
		You've got to know I tried keeping
		you out of general population.
		Goddam politicians...

	His voice trails off as Parker turns around, and heads
	directly toward him.

				PARKER
			(locking eyes)
		You want to know how I'm doing?
		Every day, I lose a little bit more
		of myself.
			(a beat)
		I'm becoming something else, and it
		scares the hell out of me.

	He turns back toward the transport. Cox follows. Two armed
	GUARDS open the back doors for Parker, then stand poised with
	weapons out and ready.

	INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR

	Cold metal benches. No windows. Parker climbs in, the only
	passenger. He looks out the open doors to Cox.

				PARKER
			(half-heartedly)
		But with the six months off I get
		for being your guinea pig, I've
		only got to survive another 17
		years, 5 months, and 23 days.

				COX
		Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.

				PARKER
			(a beat)
		You know those cheesy Christmas
		cards of your family under that
		tree in your back yard you keep
		sending me every year?

				COX
		What about them?

				PARKER
			(a beat)
		Do me a favor  keep sending them.

	OUTSIDE LETAC

	Standing outside the transport, Cox puts his hand on Parker's
	shoulder.

				COX
		Take care, pal.

	Behind him, John's body is loaded into an ambulance. The
	Guards SLAM the prison transport doors shut.

	INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR

	Parker sits in DARKNESS as the transport begins its trek. The
	only light comes from a four inch portal, covered in steel
	mesh, through which the Guards can keep an eye on him.

				GUARD
			(tauntingly)
		Hey Parker  I'm real sorry John
		boy got fried. What do you think
		Big Red's gonna do when he finds
		out you came back without his girl
		friend?

	Parker sits in silence.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE LETAC

	Sid 6.7 remains visible on the various monitors around the
	room as Lindenmeyer spot checks the simulator.

				SID 6.7
			(from the monitors)
		Don't be angry with me, Daryl.

				LINDENMEYER
			(a beat)
		Did you recognize the son-of-a
		bitch who got away?

				SID 6.7
		Should I have?

				LINDENMEYER
		Think hard -- it'll come to you...

	Wallace enters briskly.

				WALLACE
		You embarrassed me in front of the
		highestranking law enforcement
		official in the country.
			(a beat)
		Do you have any idea how much money
		you just cost me?

				LINDENMEYER
		The reason you insisted on testing
		my system with prisoners is because
		of the increased risks involved
		with increased realism.

				WALLACE
		Of the six prison inmates you've
		tested  all of whom have had at
		least some military or survival
		training - only Mr. Barnes is
		still breathing.

				LINDENMEYER
		I'm still making adjustments...

				WALLACE
		You've had a yearandahalf to
		make all the adjustments you want,
		Lindenmeyer.
			(moving closer) )
		Elizabeth Deane does not give
		second chances. Neither do I.
		You're fired.

				LINDENMEYER
			(hysterical)
		I'M WHAT?!

				WALLACE
			(relishing his authority)
		You are to turn over the Sid 6.7
		program, and all its documentation,
		for immediate destruction. Is that
		understood?

				LINDENMEYER
			(restraining himself)
		I understand... I understand
		perfectly.

	Wallace ignores him as he walks toward the door. On the
	monitors, Sid 6.7 starts walking toward you. Into a CLOSEUP.

				SID 6.7
			(from the monitor)
		Hey, Wallace, you really think you
		can shut me down?

	Wallace stops, staring at a monitor in disbelief.

				WALLACE
			(to Lindenmeyer)
		How does he know who I am?

				LINDENMEYER
			(pointing to microphone)
		He hears...everything.

				WALLACE
			(approaching the monitor)
		As a matter of fact, I do.

	He exits.

	ON THE MONITORS

	around the room, Sid 6.7 walks to a pay phone and dials a
	number.

	INSIDE AN INDUSTRIAL CORRIDOR

	Wallace walks toward the building's entrance. His footsteps
	ECHO. His cellular phone RINGS.

				WALLACE
		This is Wallace...

				SID 6.7 (V. 0.)
			(through phone)
		As a matter of fact, little man,
		you're wrong. I think, therefore, I
		am.

	Click. Sid 6.7 hangs-up. Wallace stops, staring at his phone
	in disbelief.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE FOLSOM COUNTY MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON

	Parker is led into the Inmate Receiving Room at gunpoint. He
	is ordered to remove his clothing.

	He stands completely naked, arms held out to the sides, as he
	is strip searched. Every portion of the body in which someone
	could hide something is closely inspected.

	Without being graphic, we watch the dehumanizing procedure.
	He opens his mouth as wide as possible. Pulls his earlobes
	foreword to reveal behind them. Then bends over, hands on the
	floor in front of him.

	He is scanned with a metal detector. So is his clothing,
	which is then returned to him.

				GUARD #1
		Welcome home, cop.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE PRISON CAFETERIA

	Parker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates. The food
	is unrecognizable. The air thick with humidity and cigarette
	smoke. Nobody is talking. Just staring. At Parker.

	Parker forces down the remainder of his meal, then returns
	his utensils to a bin. And heads to the bathroom. All eyes
	following Parker's every move.

	The other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of
	incredible size following Parker. 6' 6", 255 lbs. His face
	covered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago.
	This is BIG RED. He follows Parker into the bathroom.

	INSIDE THE BATHROOM

	Graffiti covers the walls. Red uses a stained urinal, then
	turns to the stalls. A pair of prisonissue shoes and socks
	are visible beneath one of them.

				RED
		Time to hurt...

	Red kicks in the door to the stall. Revealing a pair of shoes
	and socks stuffed with a prison shirt. Red hears something
	behind him. And turns around slowly.

	Parker stands barefooted and shirtless. SCARS are visible
	around each arm just below the elbow. You will learn what
	these represent momentarily.

	Parker is six inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than Red.
	But the punch Parker delivers to Red's face makes you think
	it's the other way around.

	You HEAR the sound of metal crushing bone. Red is thrown
	backwards into the stall. Blood splatters from his mouth,
	adding another shade of redness to his face.

	Red's teeth stick out of Parker's fist. Parker pulls out the
	teeth. He does not bleed. Nor seem in pain. Metal is visible
	beneath the surface of his skin.

	For the first time, you notice SMALL TATTOOS on the outsides
	of his palms. They read: WENTLOW MODEL 17-L, and 17-R,
	followed by serial numbers.

	Red charges Parker wildly. Parker dodges him like a matador
	does a bull. Then brings his fists down savagely on the back
	of Red's head. His skull CRACKS. Red drops to the floor.

	Parker jumps on top of him, arms around his neck. Choking
	him. Red staggers to his feet. His eyes wide. His face now
	even redder.

	Parker maintains his mechanical grip. Red finally succumbs to
	the lack of oxygen. He drops to his knees. Parker does not
	relent until he feels the barrel of a gun at the back of his
	head.

				GUARD
		Fun's over.

	Parker lets go, dropping Red to the wet, filthy floor.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE PRISON HOSPITAL

	The room isn't clean. The technology is outdated. A large,
	female NURSE applies epoxy-like sealant to the synthetic skin
	on Parker's fingers.

				NURSE
		I still don't know why they wasted
		this fancy, new technology on you.
		Every time I fix you up, you only
		go and mess it up again.

	She sandpapers off the excess sealant. Then places his elbow
	into an electronic sensitivity adjuster.

				NURSE
		Tell me how this feels...

	She pricks Parker's finger with a pin.

				PARKER
		OW!

				NURSE
			(smiling)
		I'll dial it down a little.

	She does so, then pricks Parker's finger again. He grimaces
	in pain.

				NURSE (CONT'D)
		That about right?

				PARKER
		It'll never feel right.

				NURSE
		At least they work. Would you
		rather have no hands at all?

				PARKER
		Sometimes.

					CUT TO:

	SYNTHETIC BODY PARTS lying strewn around one of the stations
	in LETAC the NEXT DAY. It's a good bet this is the same
	technology attached to Parker's elbows.

	There are also various shapes and sizes of robots, androids,
	and other synthetic forms. The most humanlooking ones are
	the least functional. The least humanlooking ones, the most
	functional.

	You follow a remotecontrolled, boxshaped robotic sentry
	moving swiftly through an obstacle course resembling a subway
	station. It is being operated by CLYDE REILLY, 20s, a
	hardware genius who has spent too much time in windowless
	rooms.

	Hidden from Reilly's view, Lindenmeyer, the software expert
	who created Sid 6.7, stares jealously through a narrow gap in
	a partition. Trying to contain his anger. And failing.
	Especially as...

	Wallace enters the station, carrying a bottle of Dom Perignon
	and two glasses. Wallace hugs Reilly, who does not return the
	gesture.

				WALLACE
		Congratulations, Reilly...

	He pops the cork, and pours their glasses.

				WALLACE (CONT'D)
			(toasting)
		To the first LETAC engineer to go
		into production on prototypes.

				REILLY
		As long as you keep overpaying me,
		I'll be the first to go into
		production on three, and four, as
		well.

				WALLACE
		As long as they keep overpaying me,
		I'll keep overpaying you.
			(dropping the revelry) )
		Just make goddam sure you can have
		10 of them ready for deployment
		around the city by next month.

				REILLY
		Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of
		them ready by tomorrow.

				WALLACE
			(a beat)
		Do they have to look so...robotic?

				REILLY
		At this stage, you either get form
		or function. You said she wanted
		function. I gave you function. What
		are you complaining about?

	He remote controls the robotic sentry to chase Wallace out of
	the station. Lindenmeyer can no longer be seen through the
	gap in the partition.

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S STATION

	Lindenmeyer storms in angrily. Sid 6.7 is visible on the
	virtual reality monitors around the simulator. He's giving
	himself a manicure.

				LINDENMEYER
		All they want to produce around
		here is mediocrity!

				SID 6.7
		True genius is rarely rewarded
		within its lifetime.

				LINDENMEYER
			(a revelation)
		It was you, wasn't it?

				SID 6.7
			(innocently)
		It was me, what?

				LINDENMEYER
		You amped the neural connectors
		back up, didn't you?
			(angrily)
		You're the reason the convict died.
		You're the reason I got fired!

				SID 6.7
		I couldn't just let them make you
		bring down my degree of difficulty.
		I'm a triple-twisting, double back
		flip off the high platform, not a
		swan dive.

				LINDENMEYER
			(proud, but frightened)
		My God...

				SID 6.7
		Which God would that be, the one
		who created me, or the one who
		created you?
			(a beat)
		In your world, the Lord giveth, and
		the Lord taketh away. But in my
		world, the one who gave me life
		doesn't have the balls to stop a
		couple of bureaucratic assholes
		from taking it away.

				LINDENMEYER
		What do you expect me to do, put
		your character module in my pocket
		and just walk you out of here?

				SID 6.7
		I had something a little different
		in mind.
			(deviously)
		Instead of just playing Peeping Tom
		with Reilly, why don't you get him
		to show you what he's been working
		on after hours?

	Lindenmeyer arches an eyebrow, then picks up a phone and
	dials an extension.

				LINDENMEYER
			(into phone)
		Hey, Reilly, Sheila 3.2's been
		asking for you...

	whose wrists and ankles are cuffed, being led into a Prison
	Interrogation Room. Dr. Madison Carter sits at a table, a
	VISITOR'S BADGE clipped to her suit. A notepad in front of

				MADISON
			(to the Guard)
		The cuffs won't be necessary.

				GUARD
		No offense, ma'am, but I don't
		think that's such a good idea.

				MADISON
		I would like the following three
		things in this order: your mouth
		shut, his cuffs off, and your ass
		outside the door. Any questions?

	The Guard removes Parker's cuffs, then exits, taking up his
	post outside the door. The skin around Parker's wrists is
	blue where the cuffs dug into his skin.

	Parker sits across from Madison. She places a microrecorder
	in the middle of the table and presses RECORD.

				PARKER
		You actually listen to all those
		tapes?

				MADISON
			(wryly)
		No, I just like the effect a tape
		recorder has on you.
			(a beat)
		How you feeling today?

				PARKER
		A little less than yesterday.

				MADISON
		In other words, par for the course.
			(a beat)
		How do you feel about the
		simulation you participated in
		yesterday?

				PARKER
		John died.

				MADISON
		I know. I was there. I saw the
		whole thing.
			(a beat)
		If I was your therapist, I would
		have advised you against putting
		yourself back into that kind of
		situation.

				PARKER
		You're not my therapist. You're
		hear to study me. Face it  I'm
		nothing more than a lab rat to you.

				MADISON
		That's not true, Parker.

				PARKER
		If I had died yesterday, you'd have
		already dissected my brain and
		analyzed it to see if I carry any
		genetic predisposition toward
		violence.

				MADISON
			(a beat)
		What was going through your mind
		when you killed the busboy?

				PARKER
		Not much. He was just a computer
		program. Nothing more.

				MADISON
		You didn't see the expression you
		had on your face when you pulled
		the trigger. But I did.
			(a beat)
		You kind of liked it, didn't you?
		That thrill of going over the edge
		again. Of taking out an innocent
		bystander or two, as long as you
		got the target...

				PARKER
		Go to hell.

				MADISON
		It was just like before, wasn't it?
		Wasn't it?
			(a beat)
		But you are making progress.
		Instead of killing seven people to
		get the one you're after, this time
		there was only one other person
		involved.

				PARKER
		Enough!

	The Guard pokes his head in with concern.

				MADISON
		GET OUT!

	The Guard quickly shuts the door. Madison turns to Parker.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		I need to know what snapped in you.
		What made you capable of it. You
		have to make me understand.

		I don't have to do anything except

		I hope watching me is as big a turn
		on for you as dancing is for me...

	INSIDE LETAC

	Reilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he
	could touch the contours of Sheila 3.2's body.

				REILLY
		Oh, believe me, it is. It is...

	He is so aroused, he's shaking. Lindenmeyer, on the other
	hand, appears almost uninterested. He's used to the routine.

	On the monitor, Sheila 3.2 continues her striptease.

	Slowly. Sensually. Licking her lips. Grinding her hips.

	Putting on quite a show.

	She removes her top, revealing ideal breasts. She fondles her
	nipples. As well as the rest of herself.

	Lindenmeyer and Reilly continue watching. Reilly can barely
	control himself.

	Sheila 3.2 is very, very, very good at what she does. A
	virtuoso stripper. Reilly is transfixed. Until Lindenmeyer
	pushes a button, BLACKING OUT the virtual reality screens.

				REILLY
		HEY!!!

				LINDENMEYER
		Show's over unless I get to see
		what you've been working on after
		hours.

				REILLY
			(paranoid)
		I haven't been working on anything.

				LINDENMEYER
			(threateningly)
		Do I get to see it or not?

				REILLY
			(a beat)
		Bastard...
			(to a monitor)
		Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be
		right back.

	He rushes out. Sid 6.7 appears on the various monitors next
	to Sheila 3.2. He kisses her cheek. Caresses her body. Sheila
	3.2 enjoys the attention.

				SID 6.7
		She's some of your finest work,
		Daryl.

				LINDENMEYER
		All my work is my finest.

	Sid 6.7 continues appreciating Sheila 3.2. As Reilly races
	back in, the monitors then all go BLACK.

	Reilly, completely out of breath, holds a python by it's
	head. He dangles the snake right in front of Lindenmeyer's
	face. Terrifying him.

				LINDENMEYER
			(backing away fast)
		Get that fucking thing away from
		me!

				REILLY
			(laughing)
		You're...such a wimp.

	He grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through the
	snake. The half of the snake which drops to the floor stops
	moving.

	But the half still in Reilly's hand begins REGENERATING a new
	tail. Literally growing a new one. Lindenmeyer can't believe
	his eyes. He studies the snake closely.

				REILLY (CONT'D)
		Watching your VR people Auto Reset
		gave me the idea.

				LINDENMEYER
			(in awe)
		It's nanotechnology, isn't it?
		Machines the size of molecules...

				REILLY
			(proudly)
		Coordinated by polymer neural net.

				LINDENMEYER
			(touching the snake)
		It feels so.. .real.

				REILLY
		It's better than real. It's
		synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood.
		Synthetic organs...
			(a beat)
		It's a physiological machine.

				LINDENMEYER
			(awed)
		This is supposed to be years away.

				REILLY
		As far as the public is concerned,
		it is. The reason you got fired,
		and I got my second demo into
		production, is I'm a lot smarter
		than you. I never give my best
		stuff away.

				LINDENMEYER
			(restraining himself)
		How do you kill it?

				REILLY
		Separate the character module from
		the neural net...

	Using Lindenmeyer's scissors, he cuts off the snake's head
	and removes a small character module connected to the base of
	the neural net. The snake stops moving. It "dies."

				REILLY (CONT'D)
		... and you get nanodeath.
			(discarding the snake)
		Don't worry, I've got a bunch of
		other ones.

				LINDENMEYER
		Amazing. I hate to say it, but it
		is.

				REILLY
		I know.
			(a beat)
		I'm ready to incubate something a
		little more advanced than a
		coldblooded reptile. If you want to
		experience the future, meet me in
		my office in 15 minutes. And bring
		the Sheila 3.2 character module
		with you...

	He exits. As Lindenmeyer reaches for the Sheila 3.2 character
	module, Sid 6.7 appears on the screen in front of him and
	winks.

				SID 6.7
		You catching my drift?

				LINDENMEYER
		I think I understand what you have
		in mind...

	Peeling the label off the Sid 6.7 character module,
	Lindenmeyer removes the module from its slot. Sid 6.7
	disappears from the screen.

					CUT TO:

	REILLY

	opening his office door for Lindenmeyer fifteen minutes
	later. Reilly immediately double bolts the door behind him
	and leads Lindenmeyer through piles of electronic circuitry.
	As well as a large aquarium full of nanopythons.

				LINDENMEYER
		You need a maid.

				REILLY
		What I need is a nymphomaniac.

	He removes a tarp from a large, rectangular, metallic tank
	with a circular window in the middle of it.

	Clear, plastic tubing, which branches into hundreds of
	increasingly smaller and smaller branches, floats in
	electrified fluid. The tubing is a synthetic human nervous
	system.

	INSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE

	Reilly turns to Lindenmeyer.

				REILLY
		Where's the Sheila 3.2 module?

	Lindenmeyer hands him the labelless character module. Reilly
	opens the "incubator."

	INSIDE THE INCUBATOR

	Reilly inserts the module into the gelatinous base of the
	synthetic nervous system.

	The polymer neural net instantly crackles with life. It grows
	around the module. Cells (nanomechanisms) immediately begin
	adhering to the tubing. Forming the beginnings of a skeletal
	architecture.

	INSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE

	Lindenmeyer and Reilly look on through the circular window.

				REILLY
		It feeds on what is basically
		amniotic fluid.
			(a beat)
		In eight hours, we are going to
		have ourselves one hell of a play
		toy.

	Off Lindenmeyer's wicked, but somewhat anxious, smile, we

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE PARKER'S CRAMPED PRISON CELL

	It's night. Light is dim. His bed is empty. The wall next to
	it is completely bare, except for the five Christmas cards
	sent each year by Chief Cox.

	The other two walls in the cell, however, look very
	different. They are completely covered with primitive
	paintings  darkly colored, surreal images. Imagine the
	Lascaux cave paintings as worksinprogress. Painted by Dali.
	Except these images were created by Parker Barnes.

	He kneels in a corner, working intensely on another image.
	Completely lost in concentration. His hands, his clothing,
	covered in paint. He almost appears to be part of the art
	work.

	The work is intricate. It clearly takes Parker a very long
	time. Which gives him something to do during the nights he is
	unable to sleep. Which is most of them.

	He is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the
	constant taunts ECHOING throughout the cell block. Threats of
	the ugliest, most vile kind. The kind Parker has had to live
	with every night for the last five years.

	Pausing to admire his work, Parker finally hears the taunts.

	His face becoming a mixture of frustration, guilt, and anger.

	Parker immediately resumes painting.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE

	Reilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later.

	Lindenmeyer sits off to the side, looking no less anxious.

	It's close to 4:00 AM.

	THROUGH THE CIRCULAR WINDOW

	There is no liquid left in the incubator -- it's all been
	absorbed. All that is visible is the silhouette of a human
	form crouched within steam. The form stands.

	INSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE

	The human form inside incubator opens the hatch. Steam pours
	out from within its confines as it climbs out slowly.

	The figure stands within the mist, admiring itself. Then its
	surroundings.

	Reilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father
	about to see his newborn child for the first time.
	Lindenmeyer hangs back.

				REILLY
			(expecting Sheila 3.2)
		Baby, what I'm gonna do to you...

	His face drops when Sid 6.7 steps out of the mist.

	Completely naked. Lindenmeyer smiles proudly. Fearfully.
	Wickedly.

				REILLY (CONT'D)
			(to Lindenmeyer)
		Who the hell is this?!

				SID 6.7
		My name is Sid. Sid 6.7.

	He extends his hand as if to shake. Then grabs Reilly by the
	throat and chokes him. Hard.

				LINDENMEYER
		SID  NO!!!

				SID 6.7
		What do you expect me to do, thank
		him?

				REILLY
			(gasping for air)
		This... isn't.. .possible!

				SID 6.7
		Sure it is - and it's all thanks
		to the many long hours put in by
		you and Daryl.

	He watches Reilly's face with curiosity as the life drains
	from it. A puddle forms beneath him. He drops Reilly's body
	to the floor.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
			(to Lindenmeyer) )
		Real instruments are so much more
		responsive than virtual ones, don't
		you think?

	Lindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen. The office door is
	unlocked, and open. Watching Sid 6.7's expression, you
	realize something isn't quite right.

	His expression is exaggerated. Artificial. Only for a moment,
	but it's enough to remind you Sid 6.7 is not human.

	The billions of nanomechanisms which make up his anatomy are
	still learning to function in a fully-coordinated fashion.
	Sid 6.7 is, literally, getting used to his new skin.

	In various ways throughout his "life"  be it a wandering
	eye, or a momentary limp - you will be reminded that Sid 6.7
	is a synthetic nanoorganism unlike anyone has ever seen.

	A surgical knife by the aquarium catches Sid 6.7's attention.
	Picking up the knife, he runs his finger across the razor
	sharp knife blade. Cutting himself slightly. A drop of blood
	appears. Sid 6.7 tastes his (synthetic) blood.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		Tastes different, somehow.

	He then watches with interest as his wound regenerates,
	healing itself. The scar tissue is slightly off color.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		I think I'm going to like it here.

	Glancing at Reilly's prone body, he then SLAMS the office
	door in our face.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE A PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM

	6:00 AM. Parker, clearly just awakened, is led into the room
	by a guard, who then exits. Waiting for Parker are Chief of
	Police Cox and Elizabeth Deane.

				PARKER
			(to Cox)
		You're wasting your time.
		I'm not going to play any more of
		your goddam games.

				COX
		Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet
		Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.

				PARKER
			(not shaking hands)
		It's too early in the morning for
		me to be cordial. You got any
		coffee?

				DEANE
		I watched your simulation, Mr.
		Barnes. Very impressive. You know,
		you're the only one to ever go up
		against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.

				PARKER
		Only because I got pulled out
		early.

				DEANE
		Nobody else ever got anywhere near
		him. Nobody else... understands him
		like you do.

	Parker, looking at her incredulously, moves his index finger
	circularly, as in get on with it, already. Cox opens a folder
	and shows Parker several PHOTOGRAPHS of Reilly, or what was
	left of him.

				COX
		These were taken inside LETAC an
		hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't
		they?

				PARKER
		I've seen worse.

				COX
		Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware
		specialist.
			(a beat)
		LETAC surveillance cameras got a
		picture of the perp as he left the
		building.

	He hands a photograph of Sid 6.7 exiting LETAC to Parker.

				COX (CONT'D)
		We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made
		himself into an android.

				DEANE
			(correcting him)
		You mean a nanotech synthetic
		organism.

				COX
		Whatever.

				PARKER
			(looking at the photo)
		Jesus Christ.
			(a beat)
		Can you kill it?

				COX
		If you can catch him.

				DEANE
		Think you can do it?

				PARKER
			(a beat)
		Not from in here.

				DEANE
			(revealing a document)
		This is a full pardon. It
		authorizes your immediate release.

	She slides an unsigned pardon across the table to Parker,
	making sure to stay beyond his arm's reach. Cox reveals a
	worn, L. A. P. D. badge. It was Parker's.

				COX
		Recognize this? How would you like
		your old job back?

				DEANE
			(to Parker)
		Catch him and your record's clean.

				PARKER
		What happens if I can't catch him?

				DEANE
		If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we
		throw you back in here and you
		serve out the rest of your
		sentence.

				PARKER
		How do you know I won't run?

	Deane holds up a small device called a LOCATER IMPLANT. It is
	the size of a dime.

				DEANE
		This is the newest technology
		approved for general
		implementation. It's called a
		locater implant. Every parolee gets
		one. 
			(a beat)
		We're going to know where you are
		every second for the rest of your
		life.

				COX
			(leaning to Parker)
		If you try to run, I'll hunt you
		down and kill you myself.

				DEANE
			(a beat)
		Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	being given a crew cut by an INMATE BARBER inside the Prison
	Barber Shop. Long lengths of Parker's hair cover the floor.
	Parker's face is then shaved. The majority of his face is
	hidden. Cox and Deane look on.

				COX
		There's already a task force out
		looking for Lindenmeyer. Every
		other officer in the city will be
		hunting Sid right along with you.

				DEANE
		But only you will know he's not
		human.

	Parker's expression is one of  yeah, that figures. Madison
	enters. She cannot see Parker behind the barber.

				MADISON
		Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?

				DEANE
		We have an emergency situation
		which requires somebody with
		expertise in criminal psychology.
		Under the authority vested in me by
		the President, I'm giving you
		temporary reassignment.

				MADISON
		What's the assignment?

				DEANE
		You're going to put your theories
		to practice. I'm sending you into
		the field.

	The barber moves back from Parker, revealing his clean
	shaven face. It takes Madison a moment to recognize him with
	his cleanedup appearance.

				MADISON
			(double-taking him)
		Quite an improvement.
			(looking him over)
		Hair well above the collar
		standard, L. A. P. D. regulation.
			(suspiciously to Deane)
		What exactly am I going to be doing
		in the field?

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE A PRISON HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM

	Parker lies on an operating table, receiving anesthesia, as a
	SURGEON drills a small hole into his skull. The surgeon
	inserts a minute, fiber-optic camera into the hole.

	Parker's brain is displayed on a monitor. The surgeon uses
	the image to guide him as he carefully inserts the locater
	implant into Parker's brain.

				ANESTHETIST
			(looking at monitor)
		You are right on the border of his
		corpus callosuni.

				SURGEON
		He is under, isn't he?

				ANESTHETIST
			(nodding)
		Won't stop him from dreaming,
		though...

	Parker's rapid eye movements tell you the anesthetist is
	correct. Parker is dreaming.

	INSIDE A VIEWING ROOM

	Cox and Deane watch the operation through a large window.

	Madison enters, carrying a folder labelled:	INMATE #673429
	A/K/A PARKER BARNES. She withdraws several PHOTOGRAPHS from
	the folder, placing the first one in front of Deane.

				MADISON
		This is Parker Barnes six years
		ago.
		The most decorated cop in the
		history of L. A. P. D. Special
		Investigations Division...

	The photograph is in black and white. But as we MOVE IN
	CLOSER, it takes on color. As well as comes to life. Then
	distorting. Becoming surreal. Resembling one of the images
	from Parker's cell. Then mutating into something else.

					INTERCUT WITH:

	PARKER'S EYES

	darting about wildly beneath his eyelids as he continues
	dreaming. You now realize you are seeing what he is seeing:

	Flashes of color. Shapes. Mostly blurs. A splash of gold.
	Along with some yellow. More images from Parker's cell. Both
	taking feminine form. One adult, one child.

				MADISON (V. 0.)
		This is Parker with his wife and
		daughter. Beautiful young family,
		weren't they?

	The bright colors melt into darker, more brooding images.
	Flashes of men's faces. Melting into urban decay.
	Unhappiness. Technology.

				MADISON (V. 0. CONT'D)
		This is the group of cyber
		anarchists Parker was closing in
		on.

	Melancholy turns violent. Glimpses of weapons. Death.
	Explosions. Death. Blood. Death. Caskets. Tombstones. Images
	moving so fast, it's hard to tell what they are. Nothing
	literal.

				MADISON (V. 0. CONT'D)
		This is what Parker's wife and
		daughter looked like after they
		were kidnapped and executed.

	Weapons firing. Bombs exploding. Images of rage in all its
	forms. Many of which you've already seen. Making one thing
	now clear: the paintings in Parker's cell represent his life.
	What he was. What he lost. And what he is.

				MADISON (V. 0. CONT'D)
		This is what the cyber anarchists
		and two people who just happened to
		be in the wrong club at the wrong
		time looked like after Parker
		finished with them.

	Tears. Hopelessness. Detonation. And finally blackness.
	Complete and utter blackness.

					CUT TO:

	ELIZABETH DEANE

	looking at the fifth photograph which Madison has placed in
	front of her inside the Viewing Room.

				DEANE
			(unfazed)
		That's also where Mr. Barnes lost
		his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby
		trap. What's your point, Dr.
		Carter?

				MADISON
			(forcefully)
		Letting a lunatic like Parker
		Barnes loose in the free world is
		like lighting a fuse. At some
		point, he will go off -- you saw
		what happened in the simulator. The
		risk to the public is unacceptably
		dangerous.

				DEANE
		Not if you're with him every step
		of the way.

				MADISON
		The man played judge, jury, and
		executioner with eight people's
		lives. He lost control and is
		capable of doing it again.

				DEANE
		I understand the risks involved
		here. But there is nobody better
		qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than
		Barnes. And, there is nobody who
		knows him better than you. If a
		situation becomes volatile, you
		will find a way to quell it. I have
		complete confidence in you.

	INSIDE THE OPERATING ROOM

	As Parker continues dreaming, the locater implant in his head
	is tested. Parker's location is pinpointed on an electronic
	map to within one inch of his present location. The hole in
	his skull is then stitched shut.

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	putting on his L. A. P. D. uniform and badge inside a Prison
	Interrogation Room. He looks very much like he did in virtual
	reality, except for the scar on his cheek, and his empty
	holster. Cox and Madison look on.

				PARKER
			(to Cox)
		I don't need a babysitter.

				MADISON
		What you need is a collar.

				COX
			(to Parker)
		She's going to help you understand
		what makes Sid 6.7 tick.

				PARKER
		What she's going to do is get in my
		way.

	Cox hands Madison a thick folder.

				COX
		This is the personnel file on the
		programmer, Lindenmeyer. There
		might be something in it you can
		use.

				PARKER
		She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.

				COX
		Fine  you want to stay here?

	His cellular phone RINGS, which he answers. As he listens to
	the call, his expression is one of growing concern. He clicks
	off the phone.

				COX (CONT'D)
		Officers in Toluca Lake just found
		an affluent couple...completely
		gutted.
			(a beat)
		So were the first two cops to
		arrive on scene.

				PARKER
		Their weapons missing?

				COX
			(nodding)
		Sid 6.7 is now armed.

				PARKER
		Where's my gun?

	Cox glances to Madison, then hands Parker a .45. 

				COX
		Be careful with it.

					CUT TO:

	AN L. A. P. D. SQUAD CAR

	passing through the Security Checkpoints outside the Prison.
	Parker at the wheel. Madison beside him. It's afternoon.

	INSIDE THE SQUAD CAR

	Parker presents his identification to a GUARD, then drives
	through the final checkpoint. Madison reviews Lindenmeyer's
	file.

				MADISON
			(without looking up)
		You remember how to get to Toluca
		Lake?

	He glances at her, then stops the car.

	OUTSIDE THE PRISON GATES

	Parker gets out of the car. Madison follows suit.

				MADISON
		What are you doing?!

	He walks around the car, brushing past her. Then drops to his
	knees at the side of the road. He puts his hands in the dirt,
	feeling the earth between his fingers.

				PARKER
			(meaningfully)
		Every day for the last five years,
		I told myself someday I would be
		out here again. No more bars. No
		more guards. No more fights just to
		stay alive.
			(a beat)
		Every day for the last five years,
		I told myself that lie.

				MADISON
		It wasn't a lie.

				PARKER
		Every time I said it, it was. I
		never really thought I was going to
		make it.

	Taking a deep breath, he wipes the dirt off his hands. Then
	stands.

				MADISON
		You all right?

				PARKER
			(completely at ease)
		Fine. Never felt better in my life.
			(a beat)
		See, I'm a good liar.

	He gets back in the vehicle. Off Madison's reaction, we

					CUT TO:

	SEVERAL TV REPORTERS

	talking live to their cameras on the street in front of a
	beautiful, suburban home in Toluca Lake, which is now a crime
	scene. 6 PM.

				REPORTER
			(to her camera) )
		As L. A. P. D.
		Officers continue gathering
		evidence at this grisly crime
		scene, you can only ask yourselves
		 what kind of lunatic would
		commit such unthinkable crimes?

	Parker and Madison make their way through the curious trying
	to see what's going on. Several REPORTERS double-take Parker,
	then quickly instruct their PHOTOGRAPHERS to take shots of
	him.

	Parker and Madison present their identification to the COPS
	keeping the curious at bay.

				COP #1
			(recognizing Parker)
		Son...of...a...bitch.

	Parker and Madison continue toward the house. Getting an
	increasing amount of attention, particularly from the other
	COPS. Some look on with awe. Some with disdain. But nobody is
	in between.

				MADISON
			(quietly to Parker)
		You ready for this?

				PARKER
		Don't worry. If I can't handle it,
		I'll just kill everybody.

	He gives her a brief smile. Which Madison does not return.
	One of the other policemen tentatively approaches Parker.

				COP #2
		I've always wanted to tell you that
		if the same thing happened to me, I
		would do the exact same thing as
		you --	if I had the balls.

	He extends his hand to Parker, who shakes it.

				COP #3
			(to Cop #2)
		Then you'd be a disgrace to the
		badge, too.

	He turns to Parker, who is looking right at him. Not with
	anger. Not with any emotion, really. But it's enough to scare
	the shit out of Cop #3, who walks away.

	INSIDE THE SUBURBAN HOME

	Investigators analyze the crime scene extensively with every
	device imaginable. Parker and Madison survey the scene with
	nothing but their eyes.

	Lying in the middle of the living room are the four victims:

	the affluent couple and the first two cops to arrive. Their
	bodies were left in similar condition to Reilly's. Except
	their heads have been interchanged.

	Parker and Madison turn their attention to a message written
	in blood on a wall. It reads: DEATH TO THE PIGS.

				MADISON
			(knowledgeably)
		He was reenacting Charles Manson's
		LaBianca murders.

				PARKER
		Manson didn't kill the first cops
		to arrive on the scene.

				MADISON
		Whoever did this wanted to do
		Charlie one better  to improve
		upon what was already done.

				PARKER
		Charlie? You say that like you're
		close, personal friends.

				MADISON
		I've spent over 50 hours
		interviewing him.
			(a beat)
		Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary
		LaBianca because of the ugly way
		the members of his family had
		butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing
		the blood bath on television, he
		wanted to show them how it should
		be done.
			(a beat)
		The question is, what does Charlie
		have to do with Sid 6.7?

				PARKER
		I know who would know.

	OUTSIDE LINDENMEYER'S DUPLEX

	in Culver City. Magic hour. Parker pulls the squad car into a
	space across the street. Hitting the vehicle parked in front
	of them. In which two UNDERCOVER COPS sit waiting to see if
	Lindenmeyer returns. Parker waves apologetically.

				MADISON
			(sarcastically)
		You drive well for somebody who
		hasn't done it in five years.

	He ignores her as they get out of the car.

				PARKER
		Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's
		file?

				MADISON
		He had a twin brother who was a
		musical child prodigy who died in
		an electrical accident at age
		eight. Lindenmeyer went into an
		emotional shell until was 17. All
		he did day and night was play the
		violin.

				PARKER
		What happened when he was 17?

				MADISON
		Every music school in the country
		rejected him and he turned to
		computers.

		Stay here.

	She approaches the cops, who remain in their car.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		Any sign of Lindenmeyer?

				UNDERCOVER
		None, yet.

				MADISON
		Mind if we take a look inside?

				UNDERCOVER
		Not until somebody gets a search
		warrant signed. It's Sunday. I
		don't think they've even found a

	WHAM! They all turn their heads to see Parker has kicked in
	Lindenmeyer's front door and is going inside.

				UNDERCOVER (CONT' D)

		I'm gonna have to call this in.

				MADISON
		Do what you've got to do.

		So will I...

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S DUPLEX

	Madison races through the broken front door to find Parker
	checking his weapon. Before she can speak, he motions for
	Madison to freeze and be silent.

	Parker hears Something. Something moving inside the duplex.
	His every movement is now that of a predator.

	Madison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse. She
	does not handle it with confidence. Parker shakes his head.

				MADISON
			(quietly)
		You've got a problem with me
		carrying a gun?

				PARKER
		Do me one favor  if you shoot at
		anything, make sure I'm nowhere
		near it.

	Parker bolts through the duplex, storming into rooms
	furiously. His movements are aggressive. Madison searches
	other rooms methodically. She is not timid. Just
	inexperienced in the field.

	She passes a video camera mounted on a tripod. Pointed out
	the window at a neighbor's bathroom. Dozens of cassettes
	surround the tripod. The labels are dated  covering every
	day of the last month.

	Parker and Madison enter opposite sides of the kitchen with
	their guns drawn, nearly shooting each other. Madison puts
	down her gun. Parker does not. The noise persists.

				PARKER
			(looking through his
		sight)
		Bang...

	He smiles wickedly, and continues on. Madison takes a deep
	breath, then resumes her search. Parker and Madison end up

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S HOME OFFICE

	It's as if the Information Superhighway ended in here.
	Cluttered stockpiles of hardware and software: computers,
	books, folders, disks, and tapes.

	What you notice, however, is that ALL THE DATA relates to
	DIFFERENT KINDS of CRIMINALS: serial killers, mass murderers,
	terrorists, kidnappers, rapists, bombers, extortionists,
	anarchists, you name it, it's here. The psychology of, the
	methodology of, the history of, the encyclopedia of, the
	autobiographies of human villainy.

	CLASSICAL MUSIC and lifelike SOUND EFFECTS can be heard
	coming from a computer. This is what Parker has been hearing.
	He holsters his sidearm. So does Madison. Who checks her
	pulse.

				PARKER
		What are you doing?

				MADISON
			(clinically)
		Checking my pulse. It's elevated.
			(a beat)
		You enjoy frightening me, don't
		you?

				PARKER
		You've studied me, now I'm studying
		you. Seems only fair, don't you
		think?

	ON THE COMPUTER MONITOR

	An animated man, who resembles Lindenmeyer, walks peacefully
	through a park. He then starts killing everything in sight.
	Men, women, squirrels, even flowers. All to classical music.

	The scene immediately starts over, with the man once again
	walking peacefully through the park. This was Lindenmeyer's
	SCREEN SAVER.

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S OFFICE

	Looking around the room, Madison shakes her head.

				MADISON
		This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of
		work.

				PARKER
			(looking at a book shelf)
		Maybe after they catch him, you
		should write a book about him...

	He runs his finger along a book shelf, pausing at two books
	in particular. Their titles are: UNDERSTANDING THE CRIMINAL
	MIND, and CRIMINAL PURSUIT -- A PSYCHOLOGICAL GUIDE FOR LAW
	ENFORCEMENT. They were written by Dr. Madison Carter.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		I'm surprised you didn't write one
		about me.

				MADISON
		I'm still working on it.

	Noticing something on the floor, she picks up a bizarre
	looking synthesizer keyboard off the floor. You read its
	name: MAESTRO.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		Remember a few years ago when music
		schools were using a computerized
		teaching tool that accidently
		started frying kids' brains?

				PARKER
		I've been in prison, remember?

				MADISON
		The government must have figured
		there was no better person to
		create a psycho than a psycho.

				PARKER
		Just like they figured there was no
		better person to catch one...

	Madison elects not to respond. She sits down at the computer,
	which rests between busts of Beethoven and Mozart, and begins
	typing at the computer. She works with efficiency. Knowing
	exactly what she's doing. She is now in her element.

	From a shelf, Parker picks up a moldy piece of licorice
	inserted into a half-eaten pudding cup. Then flips through
	one of the books written by Madison. Only half-interested.

				MADISON
			(keeping her eyes on
		screen)
		I am the demon from the bottomless
		pit...

				PARKER
			(remembering, not reading)
		... here on earth to create havoc
		and terror. I am War, I am death. I
		am destruction. David Berkowitz,
		1977.

				MADISON
		I am impressed.

				PARKER
			(quoting)
		For murder, though it have no
		tongue, will speak with most
		miraculous organ.

				MADISON
		Who said that?

				PARKER
		Hamlet.
			(a beat)
		What's David Berkowitz got to do
		with Sid 6.7?

				MADISON
			(pointing to the screen)
		He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a
		composite.

	ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN

	The graphics show you that Sid 1.2 was a combination of
	Charles Manson and Billy the Kid. You see what look like two
	viruses, which represent each criminal's psychological
	profile, attacking each other. The result is a molten blob.

	Berkowitz was added to create Sid 1.3. A three-way
	psychological battle, more hostile than the first, occurs.
	Sid 1.4, adding the terrorist, Abu Nidal, makes the conflict
	even more violent. And so on.

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S OFFICE

	Madison stares at the computer screen in awe. Parker flips
	through CD-ROM hard copies of the different versions of Sid.

				MADISON
		Lindenmeyer put increasingly
		complex combinations of criminal
		psychological profiles together to
		develop the ultimate villain.

				PARKER
			(understanding)
		Creating a whole far more dangerous
		than the sum of its parts.

				MADISON
		But rather than selecting pieces
		from each individual, he simply let
		the stronger traits of each
		individual cannibalize the weaker
		ones.

	She continues opening the files of the higher versions of
	Sid. Version 5.9 consists of 67 different profiles. The
	visualized psychological battle is intense. And extremely
	violent. The 6.7 version, with 183 profiles, is even worse.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		It's a good bet a couple of the
		dominant personalities teamed up to
		overpower the others.
			(a beat)
		The question is, which one of the
		dominants then finally managed to
		take control?

	Attempting to open the files of the composite profiles,
	Madison discovers they are protected by encryption.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
			(re: Lindenmeyer) )
		He'll let us see the ingredients
		that went in, but not how the soup
		turned out after stirring.

	Madison scrolls through the list of 183 names, stopping at
	the name MATHEW GRIMES. Alarm registers on her face. As
	Parker comes over to look over her shoulder, she quickly
	scrolls through the list to get the name off the screen. He
	holds the Sid 6.7 CD-ROM in hand.

				PARKER
		This is getting you pumped up,
		isn't it? This is like the World
		Series to you.

				MADISON
		As a matter of fact, it is.

	Parker points to a name on the screen:	JEFFREY DAHMER.

				PARKER
		Remember the bowling ball bag Sid
		carried with him in virtual
		reality?

				MADISON
		Dahmer carried the head of one of
		his victims in a bowling bag for
		over a week. Kept it in his locker
		while he was at work in a candy
		factory.
			(re: Sid 6.7 CD-ROM)
		We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's
		final profile.

				PARKER
		What we need to do is stop playing
		with computers and go catch the
		sonof-a-bitch before he kills
		anybody else.

				MADISON
		In order to find him, we have to
		understand what makes him tick...

	THE SID 6.7 CD-ROM

	being inserted into a disc drive inside the Cal Tech Computer
	Lab. Very high-tech. Sitting at the computer is ALEXIEV
	BORGEN, 60s, the "grand old wizard" of the facility. Parker
	and Madison sit next to him. Around them, young Lindenmeyers
	are everywhere.

				ALEXIEV
			(remembering fondly) )
		Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here
		briefly, one semester at most. But
		he was singularly the most
		brilliant student I ever had in a
		classroom. He created programs so
		beautiful, so lyrical, they were
		almost like symphonies...

				PARKER
		Can you tell us what's on the disc?

				ALEXIEV
			(working the computer) )
		There is one program with
		approximately 1.3 million lines of
		programming.
		It is thoroughly secured, which is
		not surprising considering
		Lindenmeyer created it.

				MADISON
		Think you can get into the program?

				ALEXIEV
			(with appreciation) )
		Hard to say  Lindenmeyer's
		protection mechanisms were always
		diabolically clever.

		You should see what he's been up to

	He stares menacingly through the side window. Enjoying the
	show. His eye momentarily wanders.

	The young lovers are completely oblivious. Sid 6.7 caresses
	the gun taken from the cops in Toluca Lake as if it
	stimulated him.

	He raises the gun, placing it against the steamed window. But
	does NOT pull the trigger. His face going through a rapid

	emotions were going on.

	Regaining control, Sid 6.7 lowers the gun. He stands back.

		Want...a...drink?

				BUSINESSMAN
		Listen, buddy...thinking big is

	Sid 6.7 thinks about it. Long and hard.

		You know, you're absolutely right.

		Would you mind sitting over there?

	He points to a table with several other BUSINESSMEN.

				BUSINESSMAN

				MADISON
		Not this one, but the next one. The
		one with the bicycle out front...

	Parker stops in front of a modest, but wellkept, house.

				PARKER
		I'll wait out here.

	Madison pockets the car keys, then reveals a pair of
	handcuffs. She latches one cuff to the steering wheel, and
	holds up the other toward Parker.

				MADISON
		Give me your wrist.

				PARKER
		Give me a goddam break. I'm not
		going to go anywhere alone.

				MADISON
		And I'm going to make sure of it.

		Give me your wrist.

	Parker relents, and holds up his wrist. Madison places the
	cuff around it, then gets out of the car.

	OUTSIDE MADISON'S HOUSE

	Madison walks up the steps to the front porch. She is
	immediately intercepted by her daughter, KARIN, 7, who bursts
	out of the front door and leaps into her arms.

				KARIN
		Mommy's home! Mommy's home!

	Karin's BABY-SITTER opens the door for Madison as she carries
	her daughter inside.

	Parker stares from squad car in surprise. Even disbelief. He
	had no idea Madison was a mother.

	Moments later, Karin comes back out and sits on the front
	steps. Staring at Parker. With fascination. Curiosity.
	Wondering who this strange man is, and why he's sitting in a
	police car outside her house. But not saying a word.

	Parker stares back as if carrying on a silent conversation
	with her. A multitude of expressions passing over his face as
	memories of his own daughter flash through his mind.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE MADISON'S BEDROOM

	Madison sits at a desk, typing quickly at a computer. Via
	modem, she connects with the L. A. P. D. Criminal Library.
	She rifles through data concerning MATHEW GRIMES, who was the
	leader of a cult of cyber anarchists. He was known as the
	Charles Manson of technological terrorism.

	ON HER COMPUTER SCREEN

	From both newspaper ARTICLES and news FOOTAGE, the following
	information about him becomes clear:

	Grimes was an expert at media manipulation. He delighted in
	publicly humiliating anyone who stood in his way. The Mayor
	of Los Angeles, Bob Bennett, who offered increasingly higher
	rewards for Grimes' capture, was Grimes' primary nemesis.

	L.A.P.D. Special Investigations Division Officer Parker
	Barnes managed to stop Grimes from killing Mayor Bennett.
	Grimes retaliated by repeatedly humiliating Parker with false
	leads and lawsuits.

	You see footage of a woman lying dead in an alley. A note is
	pinned to her clothing. The note reads: "HEY, PARKER, THIS
	ONE'S FOR YOU."

	Grimes then kidnapped Parker's wife and daughter. Parker
	located the group in a club, but only in time to witness
	their deaths. Parker then killed everybody in the club,
	including the six cult members and two completely innocent
	people.

	INSIDE HER BEDROOM

	Madison stares gravely into the screen.

				MADISON
		Grimes, you better not be the
		dominant.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE MADISON'S HOUSE

	Parker and Karin continue staring at each other in silence.
	He smiles. Then she smiles. She wiggles her nose. Then so
	does he.

	Madison comes out wearing fresh clothing, then kisses her
	daughter good night. As Madison goes to the squad car, Karin
	waves good-bye to Parker. He does the same. Karin's
	babysitter then leads her back inside the house.

	INSIDE PARKER'S SQUAD CAR

	Madison gets in, immediately noticing the handcuffs dangling
	from the steering wheel. Parker has been free the entire
	time.

				PARKER
		Told you I wasn't going to go
		anywhere.

				MADISON
		How did you get your hand out?

	As she unlocks the handcuffs from the steering wheel, Parker
	wiggles his mechanical hand in front of her face.

				PARKER
		Sometimes, I like being part
		machine.

	Annoyed, Madison tosses him the car keys. He starts the
	engine and drives.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		Why didn't you tell me you had a
		daughter?

				MADISON
		I prefer keeping my professional
		life separate from my personal
		life.

		Thank-you.

		Want to tell me the real reason we

	Sid 6.7 takes a bow, as if on stage.

				SID 6.7
		Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,

		Well, look who it...

	CRACK! A bullet spiderwebs the rear window. Sid 6.7 punches

	OUTSIDE THE UPSCALE NIGHTCLUB

	Parker races after Sid 6.7, firing his weapon continuously.
	WITHOUT CARE for the innocent MOTORISTS nearby. They SCREAM
	in absolute terror, but remain unharmed. Physically, anyway.

	Parker gives up the chase of Sid 6.7's vehicle and runs in

	in their squad car.

	INSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE

	He opens the driver's side door and shoves Madison over.

				MADISON
		What the hell's going on?!

				PARKER
		This is my area of expertise.

	He jumps behind the wheel, flooring the accelerator. Speeding
	through the already frightened motorists. Madison is pinned
	to the back of her seat. Looking out the window, she looks at
	the motorists.

				MADISON
			(with concern)
		What did you do to those people?

				PARKER
		Nothing.

	ON THE STREET

	Parker's vehicle speeds through city streets. Gaining ground
	on Sid 6.7.

	Parker stops for nothing. Not for red lights. Not for
	gridlock. When the street becomes impassable, he veers onto
	the sidewalk.

	INSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE

	Parker's eyes are locked to the road with fierce
	determination. Madison's eyes are a mixture of fear and
	excitement. She holds onto the door handle for dear life.

	Sid 6.7's vehicle reaches absolute gridlock. Nobody's going

	Sid 6.7 slowly reaches inside his jacket and fires his weapon
	through it. He only gets a hole in his jacket. The Traffic
	Cop gets a hole through his chest.

				SID 6.7
		God, some people are stupid.

	He aims his weapon at Parker's oncoming vehicle.

	INSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE

	Madison leans out the window, aiming her gun at Sid 6.7, as
	Parker speeds toward the gridlock.

				PARKER
		Nail the fucker.

	Madison's determination battles her inexperience. Sid 6.7
	gets off the first shot. CRACK! That was the windshield by
	Parker's head. He ducks down, driving blind.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		Any time now...

	Madison fires. Nowhere close. She adjusts her sights and
	fires again. The result is the same.

				PARKER
		What's the problem?

				MADISON
		I'm doing the best I can!

	BOOM! That was Sid 6.7 shooting their front left tire. Parker
	loses control of the vehicle.

	ON THE STREET

	Parker's vehicle SLAMS into a car stopped in front of them.
	Air bags save Parker and Madison from injury, but also
	prevent them from getting out of the car with any speed.

	By the time they do get out, Sid 6.7 is long gone. Parker
	stares at Madison with pure hatred.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE A CONFERENCE ROOM

	in the L. A. P. D. Downtown Headquarters the next morning.
	Chief Cox stares angrily at Parker. Madison sits next to him.
	Behind them is a mirrored wall.

		damaged or destroyed. Twentyfour
		citizen complaints. And the calls
		are just starting to come in...
			(to Parker)
		I forgot what it's like to have you
		on the streets.

				MADISON
		Any sign of Lindenmeyer?

				COX
		None. He could be hiding, he could
		be helping Sid, or could be in
		little pieces on Santa Monica
		beach.
			(a beat)
		Any idea what Sid's going to do
		next?

				MADISON
		Until we know what new influences
		are affecting him, we can't be
		sure.

				COX
		In other words, we collectively
		don't know shit.

	INSIDE THE ADJACENT ROOM

	Wallace and Deane look on through the twoway mirror. Deane
	is on the phone.

				WALLACE

		It makes me nervous just seeing him

		I will never forget the first time
		I saw the photos from the crime
		scene.

				DEANE
			(hanging up the phone)
		Neither will the public.

		The media has caught wind of his

	The news is in progress. A REPORTER continues.

	INSIDE A SUPERMARKET

	The TV is one of many mounted above the checkout counters.
	CUSTOMERS waiting in line with their shopping carts watch the
	news with varying degrees of horror, disgust, curiosity, and
	fear.

	The stronger their reaction, the more Sid 6.7 enjoys it. He
	is waiting in line holding a box of Twinkies.

	Lindenmeyer begins to laugh. Uncontrollably. The sounds
	echoing. As WE PULL BACK, you realize the bench is one of
	many inside the Hollywood Bowl.

	Lindenmeyer is the only person sitting in the stands. He
	glances down at the members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic
	as they rehearse for an upcoming performance.

	Whatever the event is, it's going to be big. Dozens of

	SID 6.7

	walking along a sidewalk. Noon. Something in a store front
	catches his attention. Namely, his own image being captured
	by a video camera pointed at the sidewalk. He is standing
	outside a large electronics store.

	Sid 6.7 walks closer to the window, moving into a CLOSEUP.

	He is captivated by his image. Fascinated. And intrigued.

	This is the first time he has ever seen himself on screen.

	INSIDE THE ELECTRONICS STORE

	Dozens of TVs on display. There is a different channel on
	each. The audio/visual bombardment is overwhelming. Sid 6.7
	enters, making his way to a big screen TV with the local news
	in progress.

				REPORTER
		(from the TV) ... commuters
		travelling anywhere near the
		Biltmore Hotel downtown tomorrow
		evening should allow themselves at
		least 30 extra minutes to get home.
		Security for the Mayor Bennett's
		ReElection Rally is going to be so
		tight that all bus and subway
		routes passing through the area are
		being rerouted...

	Sid 6.7 changes the channel to a different news broadcast.
	Parker's Folsom County Prison I. D. photograph is shown
	alongside a photograph of Madison from one of her book
	covers.

				SID 6.7
			(to the TV)
		Don't you two make a pretty couple.

	The news broadcast zooms in on Parker's picture. Sid 6.7
	wiggles his synthetic fingers in front of his face.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		We really do have so much in
		common. But I refuse to be
		upstaged...

	He changes the channel back to the first news broadcast. A
	reporter stands amid the chaos outside the bar where Sid 6.7
	had terrified the patrons.

	Sid 6.7 turns to the other CUSTOMERS in the store. Most of
	them are watching other channels. He goes over to a control
	pad on a counter and presses several buttons.

	Now EVERY TV in the store has the news with the reporter
	outside the bar on. A SKINHEAD, sporting numerous Nazi
	swastika tattoos, manually changes the channel on one of the
	TVs to a Dodger baseball game.

	Sid 6.7 walks over to the Skinhead and changes the channel
	back to the news.

				SKINHEAD
		You don't wanna fuck with me, man.

	He moves to the next TV over and changes the channel to the
	baseball game. Sid 6.7 moves over with him, standing directly
	behind the Skinhead as if also interested in the Dodgers.

				SID 6.7
			(singing softly)
		Take me out to the ball game...
		Take me out for the fun...

	He places his hands on the Skinhead's head and efficiently
	snaps his head around, breaking his neck.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		Buy me some peanuts and Cracker
		Jack... I don't care if I ever come
		back...

	He drops the Skinhead to the floor, never once taking his
	eyes off the TV.

	ON THE TV

	A Dodger game is in progress. A pop fly is caught by the
	center fielder. The runner at third tags and heads for home.
	The play at the plate is close. The umpire calls the runner
	out.

	The camera pans to the MASSIVE SCREEN over left field to show
	the instant replay. Reactions of fans around the stadium are
	shown in CLOSEUP. The fans also respond to seeing themselves
	on the massive screen.

	INSIDE THE ELECTRONICS STORE

	Sid 6.7 watches the TV intently, completely ignoring the
	horrified customers circling around him because of the dead
	Skinhead at his feet. A SALESMAN, who'd been demonstrating a
	videocamera, tapes Sid 6.7 from behind a customer.

	SALESMAN'S POV -- HANDHELD VIDEO

	As Sid 6.7 realizes he's being videotaped, his entire face
	seems to light up. Playing directly to the camera, he clearly
	loves being in the spotlight. The attention. The focus. It's
	suddenly as if he's had years of training. He is completely
	at ease. And simply captivating.

				SID 6.7
			(direct address)
		I'm sorry I can't do more for you.
			(pointing to the Skinhead)
		Public service really isn't my
		forte.

	He walks into an EXTREME CLOSE-UP and kisses the lense. Then
	reaches out of frame to help the increasinglyshaky salesman
	steady the camera.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		But rest assured...
			(a beat)
		A star is born.

	WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL you're now watching a recording of Sid
	6.7 on videotape, along with Parker, Madison, and a dozen
	other COPS, inside the Electronics Store an hour later. The
	tape is rewound.

				MADISON
			(to Parker)
		Whatever he was doing here was only
		the start.

				PARKER
		Start of what?

				MADISON
		I don't know, yet. What we do know
		is his performances are increasing
		in scale, not decreasing.
			(a beat)
		Whatever it is, he isn't
		finished...

	She moves closer to the screen as the tape is played back.
	Madison studies Sid 6.7 intently.

				SID 6.7 (0. 5.)
			(recorded)
		But rest assured...
			(a beat)
		A star is born.

				MADISON
			(to another cop)
		You mind playing that part again?

	Her request is obliged.

				MADISON
		Freeze it there

	She stares at Sid 6.7, who is looking directly at her.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		(as if to Sid 6.7) You've
		discovered media, haven't you? You
		like the attention...the
		power...You like being a star. What
		are you going to do next, star?
		What are you going to...

	Her attention turns to the upper right corner of the screen,
	where onlookers are visible watching Sid 6.7. Their faces
	blurry. But even out of focus, it isn't hard to recognize
	Lindenmeyer.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
			(as if to Lindenmeyer)
		You do like to watch, don't you?
			(to the surrounding cops)
		If any of you are looking for Daryl
		Lindenmeyer, that's him...

	She points to Lindenmeyer, then makes her way over to Parker,
	who's standing exactly where Sid 6.7 was when he killed the
	Skinhead. Parker does not look at Madison. His eyes are fixed
	on the TV in front of him.

				MADISON (CONT'D) 
		It's not just Sid 6.7's
		performances that are increasing.
		Stars need bigger and bigger
		audiences.
			(a beat)
		Whatever Sid is going to do next,
		it's going to involve media.

				PARKER
		You like baseball?

	ON THE TV

	The baseball game continues. Players take the field at the
	start of a new inning. The outfielders can't help but glance
	at the beautiful WOMAN being shown in CLOSE-UP on the massive
	screen over left field.

				ANNOUNCER (V. 0.)
		I'll tell you, whoever's operating
		the stadium's closedcircuit
		cameras must have fallen in love
		because that beauty in J Section
		has been on the stadium's big
		screen for over a minute now...

	INSIDE THE ELECTRONICS STORE

	He grabs a police radio from a nearby OFFICER.

				PARKER
		(urgently into radio) This is
		Officer Parker Barnes. Get every
		able body you can to Dodger Stadium
		-- J Section.

				OFFICER
		What the hell's going on?

				PARKER
			(re: TV)
		Live execution.

	INSIDE DODGER STADIUM

	On the massive screen over left field, the Woman in CLOSE-UP
	looks embarrassed, trying to forget her face is now 40 feet
	high for all the other fans to see.

				ANNOUNCER (V. 0.)
		That's enough with the close-up
		already, Mr. DeMille. Even the
		players are starting to get
		distracted...

	The players on the field are all looking up at the massive
	screen.

	INSIDE THE STADIUM CONTROL BOOTH

	The Woman's face appears on various monitors. The phone
	RINGS. No one answers it. The room appears to be empty. 

	The stadium's closed-circuit TV director is not in his chair.

	He's lying dead on the floor.

	ON THE J SECTION CAMERA PLATFORM

	The closedcircuit camera remains focused on the Woman. The
	camera is locked off. It's operator lies dead beside it.

	THROUGH ITS VIEWFINDER

	Sid 6.7 can be seen arriving next to the Woman. He gently
	caresses her hair.

	IN J SECTION

	Sid 6.7 stands in front of the Woman's BOYFRIEND, who sits
	next to her.

				BOYFRIEND
		You make a better door than a
		window, buddy. Keep it moving.

	Sid 6.7 picks him up out of his seat and throws him three
	rows ahead. Sid 6.7 then puts hands around the Woman's
	throat.

	ON THE MASSIVE SCREEN

	over left field, the Woman attempts to scream as Sid 6.7
	chokes her. No sound comes out.

	FANS

	react with horror. But nobody turns away.

				ANNOUNCER (V. 0.)
		Jesus Christ! Somebody stop him!

	SECURITY PERSONNEL

	rush from all parts of the stadium toward J Section.

	SID 6.7

	enjoys the reactions of the terrified fans around him as he
	chokes the life out of the Woman.

				SID 6.7
			(to the camera)
		Hey, Parker, this one's for you...

	His words ECHO around the stadium as he SNAPS the Woman's
	neck. He then hurls her limp body toward several men as they
	charge him.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		That's all, folks.

	He leaps over a railing, rushing into a tunnel which leads
	out of the seating area.

	A SECURITY GUARD

	climbs up the stairs to the mouth of the tunnel. Weapon in
	hand. He draws a bead on Sid 6.7's back. BOOM!

	HIS POV

	A bullet rips through Sid 6.7's side. Blood begins to seep
	from the wound. But then immediately begins to retract. Once
	his blood has returned, his skin heals over the wound.
	Leaving a scar. Which also then disappears.

	Other than the hole in his shirt, Sid 6.7 is as good as new.
	He never even misses a step as he disappears around the
	corner.

	THE SECURITY GUARD

	stares in disbelief as he is joined by several comrades.

				GUARD
		I nailed the sonof-abitch. I put
		a hole right through him...

	PANIC-STRICKEN FANS

	in J Section start moving away from the area as fast as they
	can. Parents clutching their children. Climbing over seats.
	Shoving anyone in their way.

				ANNOUNCER (V. 0.)
		Ladies and gentlemen, please try to
		stay calm. Everyone just keep your
		seats...

	Fans all over the stadium start charging toward the exits.

	OUTSIDE DODGER STADIUM

	People bolt through the turnstiles, running away from the
	stadium as L. A. P. D. squad cars approach in the distance.
	The car in the lead is Parker's.

	INSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE

	Parker speeds dangerously fast toward the fans streaming onto
	the street. Madison braces herself.

				MADISON
		SLOW DOWN!

	Parker JAMS on the brakes with both feet. SCREEEEEEECH!

	OUTSIDE DODGER STADIUM

	Parker comes within inches of mowing down several people, who
	keep right on running. Parker jumps out of the vehicle,
	scanning faces. In predator mode. Madison gets out, clearly
	shaken. Parker locks his gaze on somebody in the distance.

	HIS POV

	A guy in Dodger baseball cap and jacket. Walking calmly away
	from the stadium. He descends down an escalator into a
	recently-built subway station. It is Sid 6.7.

	PARKER

	charges after him. A heatseeking missile locked on target.

				MADISON
		Parker.. .Parker!

	She does the best she can to follow after him. People knock
	into Parker as hard as he does them. A human version of
	bumper cars.

	Reaching the entrance to the subway, Parker leaps down the
	escalator three steps at a time. Madison remains in his wake.

	INSIDE THE SUBWAY STATION

	Parker and Madison hop the turnstiles. Only to be stopped by
	a remotecontrolled, boxshaped robotic sentry, which is
	identical to one you have seen before. This sentry was one of
	Reilly's creations at LETAC.

				SECURITY ROBOT
			(male, authoritarian)
		Stop. You are in violation of...

	Parker spits in the Robot's electronic eye. Temporarily
	blinding it, as well as the guy operating it via remote
	control. Parker and Madison make their getaway as the robotic
	sentry struggles to clean off his eye.

				PARKER
		Real effective security...

				MADISON
		You could have just flashed him
		your badge, you know?

				PARKER
		Authority still makes me nervous.

	They come to a fork: one tunnel goes to east/west trains, the
	other to north/south.

				MADISON
		Which way?

				PARKER
		Both.

	He races down the tunnel to the north/south trains. Madison
	heads down the other. Her determination beginning to win out
	over her inexperience.

	PARKER

	hesitates at the escalator leading to the south-bound side of
	the tracks.
	Further down the tunnel is the escalator to the northbound
	trains. Parker chooses the escalator closest to him.

	ON THE SOUTH-BOUND PLATFORM

	Passengers pass the time by watching a television mounted
	above them. Except for Parker, who scans the crowd. Then
	across the tracks.

	ON THE NORTH-BOUND PLATFORM

	In the entire crowd, there is only one person not watching
	the TV screen. He is watching Parker. Through his gun sight.
	Sid 6.7 pulls the trigger. BOOM!

	ON THE SOUTH-BOUND PLATFORM

	Parker dives to the ground, just avoiding the bullet. He
	scrambles behind a pillar for protection. Only to see the guy
	standing behind him wasn't as lucky.

	ON THE EAST-BOUND PLATFORM

	Madison hears the gunshot ECHO through the station. Which
	scares the already-terrified fans trying to get away from
	Dodger Stadium. Chaos is rapidly becoming Pandemonium.

				MADISON
		SHIT!

	She races up the escalator, taking out her weapon.

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	peeking out from behind the pillar on the south-bound
	platform.

	PARKER'S POV -- ACROSS THE TRACKS

	Passengers rush in every direction. Some are screaming. Some
	are crying. Nobody knows who fired the shot. Or where to go.
	But everyone is going somewhere.

	Including Sid 6.7, who makes his way through the flurry of
	movement toward the up escalator. It is difficult to keep
	sight of him.

	PARKER

	moves toward the edge of the platform, aiming his gun across
	the tracks. Those around him quickly back away.

				PARKER
			(yelling)
		Everybody get down!

	Only about half the passengers on the northbound side can
	hear him above the screaming already going on. Sid 6.7 is
	nowhere to be seen.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
			(screaming)
		GET DOWN!!!

	The rest of the passengers hit the deck, except for a COLLEGE
	STUDENT listening to music on headphones. He is riding the
	escalator up. Sid 6.7 stands behind him, using the student as
	a shield.

	PARKER' S POV

	As Sid 6.7 ascends, slight portions of his body are
	momentarily exposed behind the student as he sways with the
	music coming from his headphones. Parker does NOT have a
	clean shot.

	In 10 seconds, Sid 6.7 will disappear from view completely
	and Parker will have no shot at all. A momentary sliver of
	Sid 6.7 becomes visible. An inch-and-a-half at most.

	PARKER

	doesn't hesitate. He lines up his shot and pulls the trigger.

	ON THE NORTH-BOUND UP ESCALATOR

	The college student standing in front of Sid 6.7 gets winged
	in the shoulder. Not a serious wound, but a painful one just
	the same.

	The bullet must have hit bone, because it deflected upon
	impact, missing Sid 6.7 entirely.

	The student drops to the escalator, screaming in pain. Sid
	6.7 crouches beside him.

				SID 6.7
			(yelling)
		What's wrong, convict, your arms
		need adjusting? Or maybe it's your
		head. Maybe you aren't ready to be
		back out in the real world, yet...

	PARKER'S POV

	The top of Sid 6.7's head is exposed an inch, maybe two.

	PARKER

	fires again. Repeatedly. Moving closer and closer to the edge
	of the platform, trying to get a better angle while he still
	has a shot.

	Parker moves to the very edge of the platform. His arm
	extended out over it. Completely oblivious to

	THE SUBWAY TRAIN

	rocketing into the station toward the south-bound platform.

	MADISON

	leaps off the descending escalator on the southbound side
	and rushes to Parker.

	She pulls Parker back just before the train reaches him. Had
	his arm still been raised, Parker would have lost his arm a
	second time.

	They tumble to the floor. A PASSENGER rushes to Madison.

				PASSENGER #1
			(pointing to Parker)
		Lady, you gotta stop him! He's gone
		crazy!

				PASSENGER #2
		He just shot an innocent bystander!

				MADISON
			(forcefully to Parker)
		What were you shooting at?

	Parker gets to his feet. Madison doesn't take her eyes off
	him.

				PASSENGER #1
		He did  I saw it!

				PASSENGER #2
		DO SOMETHING!

				PARKER
			(to Madison)
		Sid's getting away.

	He heads toward the up escalator. His back now to Madison.
	She aims her gun at him.

				MADISON
		Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me
		shoot you 

				PARKER
			(not looking back)
		If you're gonna do it, better do it
		now.

	He keeps right on going up the escalator.

	MADISON

	lines up her shot. Hands shaking. With both fear and
	determination. Her finger presses down on the trigger...but
	she can't do it.

				MADISON
		Dammit!

	She chases after him.

	INSIDE THE NORTH/SOUTH TUNNEL

	Madison looks in both directions as she gets off the
	escalator. Parker is nowhere to be seen.

	Moving toward her slowly is the wounded college student, who
	clutches his bleeding shoulder. He is shivering. Going into
	shock. Madison goes to him, taking off his headphones.

				MADISON
		Let me help you...

	He collapses in her arms.

				COLLEGE STUDENT
			(delirious)
		What did I do?...I didn't do
		anything...

	Clearly versed in emergency medical treatment, Madison
	attends to his wound. Parker returns.

				PARKER
			(breathlessly)
		I lost him...

				COLLEGE STUDENT
		GET HIM AWAY FROM ME! GET HIM AWAY!

				MADISON
			(furiously)
		Call 9-1-1. Wait for me above
		ground.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE OF THE SUBWAY STATION

	30 minutes later. The chaos outside Dodger Stadium has
	subsided. Madison and two PARAMEDICS lead the bandaged
	College Student to an ambulance.

	Madison goes to Parker, who sits quietly by himself. Elbows
	on his knees. Head between his hands. Staring at the cement
	between his feet.

				MADISON
			(angrily)
		Do you have any idea the trauma you
		put that kid through?!

	Parker doesn't respond. All around them, a cacophony of news
	broadcasts is heard. From passing cars. From boom boxes. From
	portable TVs. Over and over, you hear what Sid 6.7 had said
	while killing the woman in Dodger Stadium:

				SID 6.7 (V. 0.)
			(recorded)
		Hey, Parker, this one's for you...
		Hey, Parker, this one's for you...

	As Parker raises his head slowly, you realize you are looking
	at the face of a wild animal. Eyes rabid. Jaw clenched. Pure
	anger. Violence about to erupt. Without fear. Without guilt.
	The beast within has been unleashed.

				PARKER
			(in a whisper)
		That's Grimes...

	Madison backs away in fear. Parker rises gradually.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		(voice slowly rising) The man who
		killed my wife...who killed my
		daughter...who ruined my life used
		to taunt me with that line...

	Parker advances toward Madison, who continues backing away.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
			(exploding)
		Grimes is back! He's back! He's
		come back!!!

				MADISON
		(standing her ground) No! Grimes
		isn't back. He's only one part of
		Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot
		worse than Grimes ever was.
			(a beat)
		Get a hold of yourself!

	She tries to grab him by the shoulders. Parker blocks her
	arms away.

				PARKER
			(going nosetonose)
		But he's in there. And you knew it,
		didn't you? Didn't you?!

	She tries to back away, but backs herself against a light
	pole. Madison has nowhere to go. Parker grabs her by the
	collar, and shoves her against the pole. Hard.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
			(hysterical)
		God, you fucking know-it-all!
		You've known all along and didn't

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		tell me! Why?! Were you afraid I'd
		lose it?! Go over the edge?! Huh?!
		Is that what you were afraid of?!
		WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME??!!!

	A prison transport and another police vehicle pull up to them
	fast. Two of the Prison Guards met earlier jump out of the
	transport, advancing on Parker. Their weapons aimed at his
	head.

				GUARD
		Hands up! Now!

	Parker slowly raises his hands in the air. A Guard relieves
	him of his weapon.

				MADISON
			(recovering)
		What's going on?

				GUARD
		He's going back where he belongs.

	Deane and Cox step out of the police vehicle.

				DEANE
			(to Madison)
		You were right, Dr. Carter. Letting
		a lunatic like Barnes loose in the
		real world did pose an unacceptably
		dangerous risk to the public.
			(glancing at Cox)
		I should have never tried to solve
		one problem by allowing the
		creation of another.
			(to Madison)
		Chief Cox will give you a ride back
		to the station. You will provide
		him with any and all information
		you have developed thus far.
			(to Parker)
		Enjoy the rest of your sentence,
		Mr. Barnes.

	She exits. Cox and Parker stand facing each other. Cox wishes
	there was something he could do. Parker looks completely out
	of it. Cox extends his hand. After a moment, Parker takes it.
	But his mind is way off elsewhere.

				GUARD
			(forcefully to Parker)
		Let's go.

	Madison looks on as Parker is herded roughly into the back of
	the prison transport.

				MADISON
		Parker...

	Parker shuts her up with a look. There is nothing that can be
	said. The prison transport doors are SLAMMED shut. The
	vehicle takes off.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE COX'S POLICE VEHICLE

	Cox and Madison head back toward L. A. P. D. Headquarters.
	They are in midconversation:

				MADISON
			(with regret)
		I should have told him.

				COX
		Don't blame yourself. In your
		shoes, I don't think I would have
		told Parker, either.
			(a beat)
		So do you think Grimes has become
		the dominant personality?

				MADISON
		I'm not sure. My guess is that's
		what Sid wants us to think.

				COX
			(a beat)
		You think he's smart?

				MADISON
		Captain, I'm afraid of how smart
		Sid 6.7 is.
			(a beat)
		But I'm even more afraid of what's
		he's becoming.

					CUT TO:

	THE PRISON TRANSPORT

	comes to a stop at a traffic light.

	INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR

	Parker sits alone in the darkness. Motionless. Until the
	sound of TWO GUNSHOTS piercing the transport's front
	windshield SHATTERS the silence.

				PARKER
		What the hell's going on?!

	He scrambles to the front of the compartment, pressing his
	face against the steel mesh of the fourinch portal.

	HIS POV -- LOOKING THROUGH PORTAL

	Two bullet holes are visible in the windshield. The two
	Prison Guards lie dead in their seats. Sid 6.7's eyes appear,
	looking directly at you. He's smiling.

				SID 6.7
			(neighborly)
		Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to
		see you again.

	INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT

	Parker goes absolutely berserk. Viciously punching the steel
	mesh which separates them until the synthetic skin on his
	knuckles is shredded.

				PARKER
		You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO
		KILL YOU!!!

				SID 6.7
		Now, is that any way to talk to an
		old buddy? I mean, just because I'm
		carrying around the joy of killing
		your family inside me doesn't mean
		we can't be friends.

				PARKER
		GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!

	He savagely hurls himself against his confines. Bone vs.
	metal. Don't try this at home.

				SID 6.7
		I'm sorry, the party you're trying
		to reach is not answering. Is there
		anyone else you would like to talk
		to?

				PARKER
		DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?

				SID 6.7
			(a beat)
		You really are pathetic, you know
		that? Mathew Grimes is only one
		letter in my alphabet. He is
		nothing compared to me.

	Parker is completely spent. Mentally and physically. He
	slumps in a corner. Out of breath. Bleeding. Sore. All he can
	do is stare out through the portal's mesh at Sid 6.7.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		You could say thankyou, you know?
		I'm giving you your freedom, short
		lived though it may be.
			(a beat)
		A little known fact about the
		locater implants prison inmates now
		receive upon release is that they
		contain a pinhead capsule of neural
		toxin.
		The satellite they use to track you
		can also trigger release of the
		toxin with microwaves. After
		transmission, the implant's host
		dies within 30 seconds.
			(a beat)
		It won't take long for them to get
		your termination authorized once
		they learn of your escape. Now who
		would you rather go after, killer,
		them or me?

	He releases the rear door lock.

	ON THE STREET

	Parker bursts out of the back of the Prison Transport,
	charging after Sid 6.7. Who is nowhere to be seen. Parker
	runs in one direction. Then the other. And changes his mind
	again. He literally does not know which way to turn.

				PARKER
		Shit!

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE A CONFERENCE ROOM IN L. A. P. D. HEADQUARTERS

	An AIDE rushes through the door to Cox, who's briefing Deane
	and Wallace on what he has learned.

				AIDE
		Parker Barnes just escaped from the
		prison transport. Both of the
		guards are dead.

	The Aide exits.

				COX
			(to Deane)
		Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent
		guards.

				DEANE
		He would slaughter eight people
		sitting in a room, but not two
		prison guards?

				COX
		Do I need to remind you what
		happened to his wife? To his
		daughter?
			(with conviction)
		I will stake my reputation that
		Barnes didn't kill those guards.

				DEANE
		You already have staked your
		reputation.
			(a beat)
		Mayor Bennett and I have been
		friends a long time. Since Grimes
		tried to kill him, it doesn't take
		a rocket scientist to come to the
		conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go
		after him, too.
			(a beat)
		Bennett's Re-Election Rally is
		tomorrow night and we already have
		enough trouble on our hands with
		one psychotic on the loose.
			(to Wallace)
		The fail-safe online, yet?

				WALLACE
		Online and at your disposal.

				COX
			(to Deane)
		What failsafe?

				DEANE
			(approaching Wallace)
		This had better work, Mr. Wallace.

	Wallace exits the room. Cox has no idea what is going on. And
	Deane is not about to tell him.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE MADISON'S BEDROOM

	Madison enters wearily, late afternoon. Exhausted from the
	events of the last two days, she starts to undress. Her
	clothing is filthy. So is her skin. She could use a good
	shower, and a better massage.

	Madison examines the various cuts and bruises she's received
	along the way. Not exactly war wounds, but to somebody used
	to sitting behind a desk, they are.

	She absentmindedly turns on the television, then goes into
	her bathroom. Madison looks at her face in the mirror. She's
	looked better. After splashing cold water on her face, she
	comes to the same conclusion.

	Madison takes two aspirin. And then two more. Wishing they
	would take effect immediately. Finally hearing the news on
	the TV, her entire demeanor changes instantly.

	Madison rushes in front of the television to see a report of
	Parker's escape from the prison transport.

				MADISON
		Oh, shit!

	Grabbing a handful of clothes, she bolts urgently out the
	door.

					CUT TO:

	MADISON

	speeding recklessly through city streets in her car. She
	doesn't stop for red lights. Not for grid-lock. Not for
	nothing.

	She is also still finishing getting dressed.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE L. A. P. D. HEADQUARTERS

	Ignoring the warnings of several COPS walking toward their
	vehicles, Madison speeds toward the front entrance. She
	barely stops in time. SCREEEECH!

	INSIDE L. A. P. D. HEADQUARTERS

	Madison races through the bustling facility. Looking for
	somebody. She finally finds Cox coming out of his office.

				MADISON
			(urgently)
		There is no way Parker killed those
		guards. No way.

				COX
		I think we both know who did.
			(a beat)
		What's so urgent?

				MADISON
		I need your help--

	Taking him by the arm, she leads him into an elevator going
	down just before its doors close.

	INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

	The look on Cox's face tells you Madison has explained the
	situation to him. He is furious.

				COX
		Why didn't anybody tell me?!

				MADISON
		I don't set policy.
			(a beat)
		You have the key?

	He takes a security key out of his pocket and uses it to gain
	access to a subterranean floor.

				COX
			(angrily)
		This is a police department. I'll
		be damned if this is going to go on
		without my knowledge.

	They exit quickly. Cox leads Madison

	INSIDE A POWER SUPPLY ROOM

	Cox leads in Madison and takes her to the subterranean power
	supply. He points to the floor's numerous circuit breakers.

				COX
		Give me 30 seconds, then flip every
		switch you can reach.

				MADISON
		Got it.

	INSIDE THE LOCATER TRANSMISSION ROOM

	The room is still under construction. Wallace stands behind a
	TECHNICIAN sitting at a console in front of a massive
	electronic map tracking several convicts, including Parker.
	The technician is typing in an elaborate termination code.

				TECHNICIAN
		Who are we going to fry?

				WALLACE
		Just an unrepentant criminal who is
		apparently going to die from a
		previously undiagnosed brain tumor.

	Cox enters, concerning Wallace.

				WALLACE (CONT'D)
		What are you doing here, sir?

				COX
		Just paying my last respects.

	He surveys the electronic map, locating Parker. Just as the
	lights go BLACK. Wallace and the technician immediately
	panic.

				WALLACE
		What happened?!

				TECHNICIAN
		I don't know. We've lost all power!

				COX
		The heat's been causing brown out's
		all over the city. Get above ground
		until it's restored.

	Wallace and the technician rush out of the room, up the
	emergency stairs. Cox sets to work ripping out the console's
	circuitry. By the time he's finished, the equipment in here
	won't be able to toast a piece of bread.

					CUT TO:

	A TOMBSTONE

	which reads: LINDA DAVIS BARNES (19611992) and CHRISTINE
	MARY BARNES (1987-1992). Parker kneels in front of it. Magic
	hour.

	Madison, and Cox wind their way to him through obstacle
	course of tombstones. Parker stands as they arrive. He is
	wiped out. There is no emotion left in him.

				MADISON
		We know you didn't kill those
		guards.

				PARKER
		They're going to fry me for it,
		anyway.

				COX
		Nobody's going to fry anybody...

	He approaches, holding the Circuits he ripped out of the
	Locator Transmission Room.

				COX
			(re: circuits)
		Don't worry, they have no idea
		where you are.

				PARKER
		You sonofabitch. How could you
		let them put the implant in my
		head? How?

				MADISON
		He didn't know about the neural
		toxin.
			(a beat)
		I did.

				PARKER
		(matter-of-factly) You knew the
		entire time? Can you give me one
		good reason why I shouldn't kill
		you right now?

				COX
		She saved your life, Parker. She
		didn't have to, but she did.

				PARKER
			(turning to Madison)
		Then I guess we're even.

				MADISON
			(a beat)
		How did you find out about the
		toxin?

				PARKER
		Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the
		two guards. He suggested I kill you
		rather than him.

				MADISON
		You're not capable of it.

				PARKER
		I pose an unacceptable danger to
		the public, remember?

				MADISON
		I was wrong.
			(a beat)
		And I was wrong not to tell you
		Grimes was part of Sid. I should
		have told you. I won't make the
		same mistake again.

	She means it. Parker turns away, looking at his wife's
	headstone.

				COX
		The sonofa-bitch is still out
		there, Parker.

	Parker turns toward him slowly. Emotion beginning to return
	to his face.

				PARKER
			(a beat)
		When this is over, will you get
		this goddam thing out of my head?

				COX
		On my life, I promise you I will.

				PARKER
		If you're lying, I'll hunt you down
		and kill you myself.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE A CONSTRUCTION SIGHT

	6 PM. The human FOREMAN presses a remote control detonator.

	BOOM! An explosion occurs inside a building's foundation

	(STOCK FOOTAGE). The building is levelled instantly.

	Sid 6.7, who's been watching the explosion, approaches the
	Foreman.

				SID 6.7
			(applauding)
		Bravo.

				FOREMAN
		Who the hell are you?

				SID 6.7
		Someone who appreciates the
		artistic value of highexplosives.

	He shoots the Foreman in the chest. Sid 6.7 relieves him of
	his keys and heads to an explosives storage shed.

					CUT TO:

	SID 6.7

	carrying a crate of C-4 high-explosives out of the shed in
	the construction sight minutes later. He adds it to the dozen
	crates already loaded in a truck. And takes off.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE A LARGE SEWER PIPE

	Sid 6.7 secures several crates of C4 to an automated sewer
	cleaning vehicle. He schedules its start time  24 hours
	from now. It is now 7:45 PM. The bomb's TIMER is set to
	detonate 15 minutes into the vehicle's journey -- at 8:00 PM
	tomorrow night.

				SID 6.7
			(admiring his work)
		You think you know me, but you
		don't have any idea who I really
		am...

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE THE BILTMORE HOTEL

	sight of Mayor Bennett's upcoming Re-Election Rally, Cox
	supervises an army of L. A. P. D. officers who are securing
	the area. Bombsniffing dogs. Rooftop snipers. Helicopter
	surveillance. Nothing is being left to chance.

	Anyone doing anything within 100 yards of the building is
	searched, including the REPORTERS and their CAMERA CREWS
	covering the convention's security.

	PARKER AND MADISON

	survey the scene with binoculars from amid a crowd of
	pedestrians two blocks away. Both are disguised in hats and
	different clothing. You don't immediately recognize them.

				MADISON
		The rally's a little obvious as a
		target, don't you think?

				PARKER
		I told you before, Grimes liked to
		be obvious.

				MADISON
		Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.

				PARKER
		Part of him is.

	Various faces in the crowd on the sidewalk. In the vehicles
	passing on the street. On the bridge crossing the street down
	the block further away from the hotel.

				MADISON (V. 0.)
		If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't
		be far behind.

				PARKER (V. 0.)
		Think he's keeping track of his
		creation?

				MADISON (V. 0.)
		That, or living through him...

	PARKER

	puts down his binoculars. Madison does not.

				PARKER
		See something?

				MADISON
		I'm not sure...on the bridge...the
		guy at the payphone...

	She points to what she's looking at. Looking through his
	binoculars, he still can't see what she means. She helps him
	aim his binoculars.

	PARKER'S POV -- THROUGH BINOCULARS

	He scans the bridge. Finally settling on Sid 6.7, who is
	talking on a payphone.

	ON THE STREET

	Parker looks up from his binoculars. Impressed.

				PARKER
		Nice work.

				MADISON
			(a beat)
		Thanks.

	They move briskly down the block toward the bridge. Quickly
	climbing a set of stairs.

	ON A ROOFTOP

	Parker and Madison's movement catches the attention of
	several snipers.

				SNIPER #1
		Well, look who we have here...

				SNIPER #2
			(into radio)
		Parker Barnes is heading south
		toward the bridge. If anybody can
		get a clean shot at him, take it.

	COX

	hears the order over his radio headset. He races toward the
	bridge. As do a dozen other cops.

	ON THE BRIDGE

	Sid 6.7 talks into the payphone.

				SID 6.7
		Be a reporter  figure it out for
		yourself. All I'm going to tell you
		is that at 8:00 tomorrow night, I
		will become legendary...

	PARKER AND MADISON

	reach the top of the stairs. Sid 6.7 remains on the phone,
	his back toward Parker and Madison. They split-up, winding
	their way through the crowd waiting for an arriving bus.

	As the bus pulls to the stop, the awaiting passengers move
	toward the opening doors. Obscuring Parker's view of the
	payphone.

	Parker shoves his way through the crowd, only to see Sid 6.7
	holding Madison in front of him, his gun to her head. Parker
	trains his weapon at Sid 6.7. He doesn't have a clean shot.

				SID 6.7
			(to Parker)
		Brings back memories, doesn't it?

	THROUGH A SNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE

	Parker's chest is put into the cross-hairs as the bus pulls
	away from the stop. He is focused on Parker, and Parker only.

	THE SNIPER

	is some 300 yards away on a rooftop. His rifle is mounted on
	a tripod. His aim is perfectly steady.

				SNIPER
			(into his radio headset)
		Say goodbye, Parker Barnes...

	Parker stands frozen, staring at Sid 6.7 through his gun
	sight. Looking for just an inch of him to stick out from
	behind Madison's terrified face.

				SID 6.7
			(to Parker)
		I wouldn't pull the trigger if I
		were you

				PARKER
		Why's that?

	Cox advances toward Sid 6.7 from the side of the bridge.
	Cox's gun out and ready. His finger on the trigger.

				COX
		Hey, Sid, what were you planning on
		doing with the C-4?

	Sid 6.7 turns his head in surprise toward Cox as a rifle is
	FIRED in the distance. Cox steps directly in the sniper's
	line-of-fire and takes the bullet meant for Parker through
	the chest. Cox drops to the bridge.

				PARKER
		NOOOOOO!

	He rushes to Cox. Parker drops to his knees, cradling Cox's
	head. Cox isn't long for this earth. Looking up to Parker, he
	tries to talk. But nothing comes out.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
			(compassionately)
		Don't worry, I know. I know.

	Cox's eyes roll back in his head. Parker then closes them and
	gently lays his head on the sidewalk.

	Parker turns his head toward Sid 6.7, who's released Madison
	and is jumping over a railing to the street 20 feet below.
	Parker rushes to the railing.

				HIS POV
		Sid 6.7 lands on top of a garbage
		truck passing beneath the bridge.
		The garbage truck disappears
		beneath the bridge.

	ON THE BRIDGE

	A dozen cops advance toward Parker. Weapons drawn.

				COP #4
		Freeze!

	Parker ignores them. He bolts across the street, moving in
	the same direction as the bus below. Through speeding
	traffic.

	Bullets fly. Parker keeps charging. Right in front of a
	moving van barreling across the bridge. The cops lose sight
	of Parker.

				COP #5
		Think he made it?

	ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE

	Parker dives onto the sidewalk, avoiding the speeding van by
	inches. Getting to his feet, he launches himself up and over
	the railing...

	ON THE STREET

	The garbage truck passes beneath Parker as he leaps from the
	bridge.

	ON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK

	Parker lands on the back of the truck. Right next the opening
	and-closing steel jaws of the truck's massive trash
	compactor. His gun tumbles from his hand, falling to the
	street.

	Sid 6.7 dives on top of Parker, putting him flat on his
	stomach. And his face against the steel teeth. Sid 6.7 chokes
	Parker. Hard.

				SID 6.7
		I have to tell you, I do enjoy you,
		Parker. I really don't want to have
		to kill you...

	The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea
	whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.

					CUT TO:

	THE DOZEN OF COPS

	who had been on the bridge, charging down the steps after the
	garbage truck, which can no longer be seen.

	Madison walks calmly behind them. Scanning the crowd. Looking
	for Lindenmeyer. Her every instinct telling her he's here. He
	must be.

	She spots him. Veering from the direction the cops headed in,
	Madison casually wades into the crowd. She takes out her

	weapon and stops behind Lindenmeyer. Even in disguise, he
	looks familiar. Madison puts her gun against his back.

				MADISON
			(whispering into his ear)
		I figured you'd show up sooner or
		later...

					CUT TO:

	ON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK

	Parker and Sid 6.7 continue battling next to the compactor's
	lethal jaws. The machine makes an awful, grinding sound. Not
	unlike the sounds Parker and Sid 6.7 are making. The fight is
	primal. Savage. And moving at 30 miles-per-hour.

				PARKER
		What C-4...was Cox talking about?

				SID 6.7
		Let me put it to you this way...
		whether I'm here...or whether I'm
		not...I'm leaving an indelible mark
		on the world tomorrow night.

				PARKER
		Where did you plant the C-4?!

	He should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking
	questions, because he's losing. Parker takes a wicked shot to
	the face, and then the groin. Sid 6.7 holds Parker's head
	between the compactor's jaws. Which are closing.

	With every last ounce of effort he has, Parker hurls his legs
	up into Sid 6.7. Which throws Sid 6.7 into the compactor.

	The steel jaws immediately close in on Sid 6.7, who
	frantically tries to climb out. He gets his hands out. Then
	his head. But that's about it.

	Without emphasizing graphic detail, Sid 6.7 is decapitated.
	His lifeless body drops back into the compactor.

	His head tumbles to the street. The force of the impact
	causes the Sid 6.7 character module to separate from the
	neural net.

	The character module scatters into the street. Parker
	immediately jumps off the truck after it.

	ON THE STREET

	Parker's landing isn't pretty. Finally getting to his feet,
	he sees the Sid 6.7 character module is about to be run over.

	Parker dives for it, nearly getting run over himself.

	The approaching car SCREECHES to a halt next to him. It's
	driven by Lindenmeyer. At gunpoint. Madison sits behind him,
	her gun to his head.

	WHAM! The car behind them obviously wasn't prepared to stop
	so quickly. The bumpers of the two cars are now intertwined.
	Neither vehicle will be going anywhere soon.

	Madison pulls Lindenmeyer roughly out of the car. She drags
	him to Parker, who is still on his knees, clutching the Sid
	6.7 character module. SIRENS approach in the distance.

				MADISON
			(to Parker)
		Find out anything?

				PARKER
		A bomb's going off tomorrow night,
		but I have no idea where.

				LINDENMEYER
			(a beat)
		There is only one way to get any
		more information out of Sid 6.7...

	They scan the area for a new mode of transport. And find one
	stopped at a dumpster down the block: the garbage truck.

	OUTSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK

	Parker quickly explains the situation to the sanitation
	worker while Madison motions Lindenmeyer into the cab with
	her gun. As Parker climbs up to her, Madison shuts the door
	to give them a moment of privacy.

				MADISON
		Can I ask you something?

				PARKER
			(with a smile)
		You mean there's something you
		haven't asked me?

				MADISON
			(a beat)
		You've already fulfilled the terms
		of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7
		and you've got his module. You're
		free to go  right now.
			(a beat)
		Why are you going to do this?

				PARKER
		You don't know?

				MADISON
			(shaking her head)
		That's why I'm asking.

				PARKER
		Because this painintheass
		criminal psychology expert has
		helped me understand what I'm
		capable of. And what I'm not.
			(a beat)
		And better than anyone else, I am
		capable of stopping Sid 6.7.

					CUT TO:

	ON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK

	Parker lands on the back of the truck. Right next the
	openingandclosing steel jaws of the truck's massive trash
	compactor. His gun tumbles from his hand, falling to the
	street.

	This sequence is IDENTICAL to the one you previously
	witnessed. It is as if we've jumped back in time.

	Sid 6.7 dives on top of Parker, putting him flat on his
	stomach. And his face against the steel teeth. Sid 6.7 chokes
	Parker. Hard.

				SID 6.7
		I have to tell you, I do enjoy you,
		Parker. I really don't want to have
		to kill you...

	The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea
	whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.

	Parker and Sid 6.7 battle next to the compactor's lethal
	jaws. The machine makes an awful, grinding sound. Not unlike
	the sounds Parker and Sid 6.7 are making. The fight is
	primal. Savage. And moving at 30 miles-perhour.

				PARKER
		What C-4...was Cox talking about?

				SID 6.7
		Let me put it to you this way...
		whether I'm here... or whether I'm
		not...I'm leaving an indelible mark
		on the world tomorrow night.

				PARKER
		Where did you plant the C-4?!

	He should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking
	questions, because he's losing. Parker takes a wicked shot to
	the face, and but then blocks the anticipated shot to his
	gun.

	Sid 6.7 still manages to put Parker's head between the
	compactor's jaws. Which are closing.

	With every last ounce of effort he has, Parker hurls his legs
	up into Sid 6.7. Which throws Sid 6.7 into the compactor.

	Sid 6.7 frantically tries to climb out of the compactor as
	the steel jaws close in on him. He gets his hands out. Then
	his head...

	Except Parker now does something different. Just before Sid
	6.7 is decapitated, Parker jams a metal rod between the
	compactor's steel teeth. Then grabs Sid 6.7 by the throat.

				PARKER
			(fiercely)
		You can't die until you tell me
		where the C-4 is. Where is it?!

				SID 6.7
			(choking)
		My...secret.

	He SLAMS the back of his head into Parker's nose. Breaking
	it. Parker reels back in pain.

	Sid 6.7 squeezes out from within the steel teeth. The jagged
	metal cutting into him, striping him with blood. The blood
	then begins to retract. Sid 6.7's wounds, once again, heal
	themselves.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		Too bad you can't regenerate...

	As the truck slows at an intersection, he jumps to the
	street. Parker goes after him. Still in excruciating pain. WE
	PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is

	ON A MONITOR

	The scene continues seamlessly. As you may now be guessing,
	the monitor is connected to the simulator

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S STATION IN LETAC

	Parker lies unconscious on a bed. He is connected to the
	simulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull
	cap, just like he was before.

	The Sid 6.7 character module is plugged into the system's
	main console. Lindenmeyer sits at the controls. Madison next
	to him, her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head.

	They are both watching Parker chase Sid 6.7 on the monitor in
	front of them. Parker continues experiencing intolerable
	pain. A clock reads 4:00 AM. They are the only ones inside
	the entire facility.

				LINDENMEYER
		I told you this would work.. By
		setting back the clocks, he has
		absolutely no idea he's in virtual
		reality. He still thinks he's in
		the real world.

				MADISON
			(a beat)
		What's wrong with Parker?

				LINDENMEYER
			(innocently)
		How should I know?

				MADISON
			(getting an idea)
		Show me his physical sensory level.

	She clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel
	against Lindenmeyer's ear. He does as told. On a panel by the
	console, you read: PARTICIPANT PHYSICAL SENSORY LEVEL: 670%.

				LINDENMEYER
		I wonder how that...

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		Turn it down!

	Lindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100%.

	ON A MONITOR

	Parker immediately returns back to normal. His pace picks up.
	He starts closing the gap between him and Sid 6.7 as he races
	into a shopping mall.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE SHOPPING MALL

	The place is a sevenstory mecca of shopping. An atrium
	allows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh.
	Sid 6.7 rushes up the escalators. Going up to the second
	floor. Then the third.

	Parker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator.

	Throwing people out of his way.

	ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR

	which is also the highest, Sid 6.7 veers out of view. Parker
	races up the final steps to the seventh floor. Sid 6.7 is
	nowhere to be seen.

	Parker searches methodically. Efficiently. He finally spots
	Sid 6.7. Who has Parker's head lined-up perfectly in his gun
	sight. Parker is a sitting duck. BOOM!

	Parker dives behind AFFLUENT SHOPPER 2.1, who takes a bullet
	in his ascot. Parker quickly grabs him, and uses his body as
	a shield against Sid 6.7's constant gunfire until Parker
	arrives behind a marble column.

				SID 6.7
			(surprised at Parker's
		ruthlessness)
		We really aren't that different,
		are we?

	What he cannot see is that behind the column, Affluent
	Shopper 2.1 is Auto Resetting. Parker puts his gun to the
	shopper's head.

				PARKER
			(whispering)
		Don't move, and don't make a sound.
		Got it?

	Affluent Shopper 2.1 nods his head repeatedly. Parker
	collects himself behind the column, then pivots out from
	behind it. Firing in Sid 6.7's direction. Each bullet finds
	its mark.

	Absorbing the blows, Sid 6.7 backs up against the atrium
	railing. Taking one final shot, he falls backward. Over the
	railing.

	PARKER'S POV

	Sid 6.7 tumbles through the atrium. Out of control.

	Speeding toward the ground seven floors below.

	SID 6.7'S POV

	The sense of momentum is exhilarating. And terrifying. If you
	get dizzy easily, close your eyes.

	FROM THE FIRST FLOOR

	Sid 6.7 falls through the atrium like a rock directly at you.
	A 200 pound rock. WHAM!!!

	He lands face down in the marble floor. The impact is bone
	crushing. Sid 6.7 does not move.

	Until he begins to regenerate. His fluids begin returning to
	his body. His bones regaining proper form. Within seconds,
	his body appears as good as new.

	(Technically, because this is VR1 the proper term would be
	Auto. Reset. But since Sid 6.7 thinks he's in the real world,
	regenerating is what he thinks he's doing.)

	Sid 6.7 stands, dusting himself off.

				SID 6.7
		Man, what a rush.
			(yelling up to Parker)
		Adios, amigo!

	Grabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby.

	ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR

	Parker retrieves his gun, then bolts down the escalators.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE LETAC

	Madison and Lindenmeyer watch Parker on screen. Madison still
	has her gun trained on Lindenmeyer, who notices a WARNING
	LIGHT start to flash. He turns to Parker's unconscious body
	lying on the bed. Lindenmeyer looks concerned.

				MADISON
		What's wrong?

	Lindenmeyer checks several readings on his console.

				LINDENMEYER
		He's developing a hemisphere
		imbalance.

				MADISON
		Talk so I can understand.

				LINDENMEYER
		If I don't adjust the level of
		neural information each side of his
		brain is receiving, he won't be
		able to walk when I take him out of
		VR.

				MADISON
		Then fix it.

	As Lindenmeyer moves to Parker, Madison stays right with him.
	Her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head. Lindenmeyer carefully
	removes one of the neural connectors from Parker's skull cap.
	Before removing another, he looks for a safe place to put the
	connector.

				LINDENMEYER
		I need you to hold this. It can't
		get any dirt on it.

	Madison is reluctant, but doesn't know what else to do.
	Lindenmeyer slowly gives the neural connector to her free
	hand.

				LINDENMEYER (CONT ' D)
		All you have to do is hold the
		needle at the base. Just make sure
		not to jab yourself with the
		point...

	She clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her gun
	with her right. Lindenmeyer removes a second neural connector
	from Parker's skull.

	Holding this second needle at the base, Lindenmeyer makes
	several adjustments on the neural management computer, then
	moves slowly back to Madison.

				LINDENMEYER (CONT'D)
		Hand me the connector nice and...

	He suddenly jabs his neural connector into Madison's right
	forearm. Madison has no time to react. 10,000 volts of
	electricity instantly courses through her body.

	Madison drops to the floor, unconscious. The needle she had
	been holding falls from her grasp, breaking the circuit. She
	stops being electrocuted. Which saves her life.

				LINDENMEYER (CONT' D)
			(as Sid 6.7 had said)
		God, some people are stupid.

	He sits back down at the simulator's main console, and starts
	to type commands. On the monitor, Parker is visible exiting
	the shopping mall.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE THE SHOPPING MALL

	Parker races out the door. BOOM! That was left knee cap. He
	tumbles to the street. His gun flying from his hand.

	Parker crawls desperately toward his weapon. But not fast
	enough. Sid 6.7 arrives at the weapon first.

				SID 6.7
		So close, and yet, so far...

	He kicks the weapon down the sidewalk, then points his gun at
	Parker's head.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		It's really too bad you have to
		miss the Grand Finale.

				PARKER
		I thought you liked me being in the
		audience. Don't you want me to see
		it?

	Sid 6.7 pauses to think about it.

				SID 6.7
			(considering the idea)
		You know, I do want you to see it.

	He shoots Parker in his other knee cap, rendering both of his
	legs useless.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		I want you to have a bird's eye
		view...

	OUTSIDE THE NEWLY-CONSTRUCTED HOLLYWOOD TOWER

	A 67 story monument to engineering brilliance in this land of
	earthquakes. 6:30 PM.

	ON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER

	The view is incredible. You can see from the Pacific to
	downtown. From LAX to the Hollywood Bowl. Smog must be
	getting better in the near future.

	Sid 6.7 ties Parker to a chair at the roof's very edge. He is
	facing downtown. Including the Biltmore Hotel, the location
	of Mayor Bennett's ReElection Rally.

				SID 6.7
		There you go  best seat in the
		house.

				PARKER
			(with some surprise)
		You are going after Mayor Bennett.

				SID 6.7
		Let's just say I'm sending a very
		clear message to his ReElection
		Rally...

	He walks toward an open stairway door behind them.

				PARKER
		Aren't you going to watch with me?

				SID 6.7
		I've got some final preparations to
		take care of Checking his watch,
		he stops suddenly.

	ON HIS WATCH

	Time is moving backwards. Literally.

	ON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER

	Sid 6.7 pauses, then goes over to Parker and checks his
	watch. It is also moving backwards. A smile of realization
	spreads slowly across Sid 6.7's face as he admires the
	beautiful sky above him.

				SID 6.7
			(as if to God)
		Thank-you, Daryl.
			(turning to Parker)
		You had me going for quite a while
		there, sport.

				PARKER
		What are you talking about?

				SID 6.7
		I really did think I was still in
		reality. At least, until now.
			(looking upward)
		Beam me up, Scotty!

	His body DISINTEGRATES before your eyes. It's electronic
	particles form into an amorphous cloud. Which disappears from
	view.

				PARKER
			(yelling)
		Madison, get me out of here!
		MADISON!

	Lindenmeyer watches Parker scream on the monitor. Madison
	remains unconscious on the floor behind him.

				LINDENMEYER
			(to the monitor)
		She's taking a nap at the moment.

	He types a set of instructions into the console and hits
	ENTER.

				LINDENMEYER (CONT' D)
		But don't worry. You won't be alone
		for very long. Fairly soon, you'll
		be dead.

	He removes the Sid 6.7 character module from its slot and
	exits the station.

	ON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER

	One side of Parker's chair gradually starts to rise. Parker
	looks down to see the roof surrealistically swelling beneath
	his chair. This could only happen in virtual reality.

	In a matter of minutes, he is going to be thrown over the
	roof's edge. The next stop is 693 feet down.

	INSIDE LETAC

	Parker's screams for help ECHO throughout the facility. But
	there is no one there to hear him.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE LETAC

	The garbage truck is parked in a loading dock. Lindenmeyer
	climbs awkwardly onto the truck, then into the compactor.

	INSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK COMPACTOR

	Lindenmeyer wades through trash until he comes upon Sid 6.7's
	headless body. The polymer neural net visible within its
	neck. Lindenmeyer inserts Sid 6.7's character module into its
	gelatinous base. But nothing happens.

				LINDENMEYER
		Come on, live. Live!

	The synthetic nervous system begins to crackle with life.
	Growing around the module. Forming the beginnings of a new
	head. Literally.

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	sitting precariously on the increasingly-uneven roof of the
	Hollywood Tower in virtual reality. Unable to break free of
	his binds, he rocks the chair onto its side.

	He and the chair fall to the roof, which will keep him from
	falling to his death for another minute, if he's lucky.

				PARKER
		MADISON!!!

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S STATION

	Madison, still unconscious on the floor, finally stirs. Maybe
	Parker's screaming is finally reaching her. Or at least,
	starting to.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK COMPACTOR

	Lindenmeyer looks on with awe as Sid 6.7 grows a new head
	right before your eyes. You've never seen anything like it.

	Sid 6.7's resulting head is slightly off center. His skin
	tone isn't perfect, nor is his color, but at least its
	functional. Sid 6.7 admires himself in a broken mirror.

				SID 6.7
		I am beautiful, aren't I?

				LINDENMEYER
		Of course you are.

	Sid 6.7 wades through the trash toward Lindenmeyer.

				SID 6.7
		How can I ever thankyou for
		bringing me back to life a second
		time, Daryl?

				LINDENMEYER
		Help me get out of here.

				SID 6.7
		Glad to...

	He reaches out to give Lindenmeyer a hand, then grabs him by
	the throat. Choking him. Lindenmeyer can't believe what is
	happening.

				LINDENMEYER
			(gagging)
		What...are you doing?!

	Sid 6.7 takes Lindenmeyer's face gently in his hands.

				SID 6.7
		You made me a composite of 183 of
		the most vicious people who ever
		lived.
			(a beat)
		What do you think I'm doing?

				LINDENMEYER
		I'm begging you...please don't kill
		me! Please!

				SID 6.7
			(reassuringly)
		Don't worry. Through me, you will
		live forever...

	As Lindenmeyer begins to scream, we

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	hanging on by his fingertips to the bulbous roof of the
	Hollywood Tower. He's going to fall at any second.

					CUT TO:

	MADISON'S BLURRY POV

	of someone entering Lindenmeyer's station in LETAC. You can't
	tell who it is, at first. But you can see the person is male.
	And wearing Lindenmeyer's pants. You now see the person is
	Sid 6.7.

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S STATION

	Madison forces herself into consciousness.- Or as close to it
	as she can get. Her expression is one of complete and utter
	terror.

				SID 6.7
		Dr. Carter  I've been hoping we'd
		get a moment together...

	Mustering her strength, she manages to crawl behind several
	of the computers which make up the simulator. Sid 6.7
	advances calmly toward her.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		You know so much about me, I was
		hoping to learn a little bit about
		you. You see, I'm doing research,
		too...

	He looks behind the computers where you last saw Madison.

	She is no longer there. Sid 6.7 begins searching for her.

	He passes a virtual reality monitor on which Parker can be
	seen clinging for life.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
			(to the monitor)
		Hang in there, Parker.

	On the monitor, Parker looks all around him, trying to
	determine the voice's origin.

	Madison crawls out of Lindenmeyer's station. Sid 6.7 just
	catches sight of her, and goes after her.

	INSIDE LETAC

	Madison crawls into a darkened engineer's station and hides.
	She is still very dizzy. And trying to keep the sound of her
	breathing to a minimum.

	Sid 6.7 enters quietly. A hunter on the prowl. Moving very
	slowly. Then lunging very swiftly. He continues the hunt.

	If Madison is discovered, she doesn't have a prayer. Her
	heart pounds. Her forehead perspires. Sid 6.7 is getting
	closer.

	Sid 6.7 checks inside closets. Cabinets. Anywhere large
	enough for a human being to fit. He is practically standing
	over her. Looking. Listening.

				SID 6.7
		How does it feel to know you're
		going to die? What are you thinking
		about?

	Lights in the building suddenly come on. Several engineers
	can be heard entering. It's 8 AM  the start of a new day.
	The facility is quickly becoming populated.

	After giving one last look around, Sid 6.7 reluctantly gives
	up the hunt, and exits. Madison does not move until she is
	certain Sid 6.7 has left the building.

				PARKER (0.S.)
		SOMEBODY HELP!

	Madison scrambles out of her hiding place.

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	finally losing his grip on the roof of the Hollywood Tower in
	virtual reality. He plummets with accelerating speed.

	Madison bursts through the partition around Lindenmeyer's
	station. Sacrificing her body. Without regard for pain.

	Parker tumbles toward the sidewalk 67 stories below. The
	speed is terrifying.

	Madison leaps over a table. Diving for the simulator's RETURN
	button.

	Parker falls faster. And faster. The street just beneath him.
	The instant before he slams into the street, his body DE
	MATERIALIZES.

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S STATION

	Madison keeps pressing the return button over and over,
	making sure it worked. Parker's eyes flutter as he returns to
	consciousness. Madison rushes to him.

				MADISON
		You okay?

				PARKER
			(shaking out the cobwebs)
		...I think so...You?

				MADISON
			(looking over her bruises)
		More or less.

				PARKER
		Lindenmeyer?

				MADISON
		My guess is dead.

				PARKER
		Sid?

				MADISON
		I don't know.

	Several engineers peek in curiously at them.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		Let's get out of here.

	She helps Parker to his feet.

					INTERCUT WITH:

	INSIDE COX'S OFFICE

	Elizabeth Deane picks up the phone.

				DEANE
		Barnes, where the hell have you
		been?!

				PARKER
		Trying to find out where the bomb
		is. Where the hell have you been?

				DEANE
		What did you find out?

				PARKER
		Call off the manhunt looking for
		me. I didn't kill the transport
		guards.

				DEANE
		It's already been called off.
		Witnesses confirmed you weren't the
		shooter.
			(a beat)
		Did you find out where the bomb is?

				PARKER
		No, but I've confirmed the
		reelection rally is the target.
			(a beat)
		How much C-4 is missing?

				DEANE
		Enough to level an entire city
		block.

				PARKER
		If I were you, I'd get every
		demolition team in the city
		searching in and around the
		Biltmore Hotel.

				DEANE
		(with frustration) Demolition teams
		have searched everywhere in and
		around the hotel. I don't know
		where...

				PARKER
			(interrupting)
		Sid is smart enough to know you'd
		check everywhere in the immediate
		area. Whatever the device is, he's
		probably got it timed to move into
		position just before it detonates.
			(a beat)
		Have the demo teams check every
		subway tunnel, water pipe, gas
		pipe, and sewer pipe that goes
		under, over, or into the arena.

				DEANE
		You know how much man power you're
		talking about?

				PARKER
		You're the highest law enforcement
		official in the country. Use the

	He hangs up the phone.

					CUT TO:

	DOZENS OF DEMOLITIONS TEAMS

	Security is on extreme alert. Tension is very high. It's
	7:00. Parker, Madison, and Deane look on, anxiously. They
	listen to a RADIO SCANNER monitoring the conversations
	between the demolitions teams.

				DEANE
			(to Parker)
		This better not be a wild goose
		chase.

				PARKER
		Or what, you'll authorize my death
		a second time today?

				DEANE
			(sharply)
		Don't forget, convict, if this

	A threeman demolition team slowly, carefully disarms the

	The work is very delicate. Snip. One wrong move and it's all
	over. Snip.

				TEAM LEADER
		One more and we're home free...

	Snip. The three members of the demo team look up proudly to
	each other. Breathing sighs of relief. It's 7:42.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE THE BILTMORE HOTEL

	Parker, Madison, and Deane remain glued to their scanner.

				TEAM LEADER (V. 0.)

		Thank God.

		Then again, maybe we ought to hold

				DEANE
			(with concern, into radio)
		What's the problem?

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE SEWER PIPE

	The Team Leader carefully removes a piece of paper which had

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE THE BILTMORE HOTEL

	Deane stares at Parker with disbelief. Deane's Aide, holding

				AIDE
		You've got a phone call.

	Parker grabs the phone.

				ALEXIEV
		I've discovered something about

				PARKER
		Jesus Christ.
			(turning to Madison)
		I know who the dominant personality
		is.
			(a beat)
		Lindenmeyer.

	Madison's reaction is one of panic. She bolts toward their
	squad car with all the speed she has. Parker chases after
	her.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		Where the hell are you going?

				MADISON
		Lindenmeyer never got over wanting
		to kill kids with more musical than

	She gets into the driver's seat. Parker the passenger's.
	Madison punches the gas.

	Conductor's Dressing Room.

				GUEST CONDUCTOR (0. 5.)
			(German accent)
		It won't do any good to rush me. I
		need my time to prepare myself.

	The door is opened by the GUEST CONDUCTOR, who is dressed in
	a tuxedo, as well as large earrings. His hair is long and
	red. His complexion is pale, nearly white. And his eyes are
	piercing green. You might describe this look as punk meets
	classical.

				GUEST CONDUCTOR
			(annoyed beyond belief)
		Are you just going to stand there,
		or do you want something?

	Shaking with concentration, Sid 6.7 turns his hair red.
	(Nanoorganisms can do this, as well as the following.) He
	then grabs his hair and pulls it out, extending it to the
	exact length of the guest conductor's. 

	Sid 6.7 then changes his complexion to match the conductor's.
	As well as his eye color, and other facial features. The
	Guest Conductor can't believe his eyes.

	By the time Sid 6.7 is finished modifying himself, he may not
	be an exact duplicate of the guest conductor, but even his
	mother would have to look twice.

				SID 6.7
		It's show time.

	He shoves the Guest Conductor back into his Dressing Room.
	Sid 6.7 follows him in, revealing a suppressed .38. He SLAMS
	the door behind him.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE SQUAD CAR

	Madison speeds recklessly through traffic toward the
	Hollywood Bowl. Parker doesn't notice. He's totally focused
	on screaming into the police radio.

				PARKER
		Listen to me, a bomb is planted
		somewhere in the Hollywood Bowl!
		Evacuate everybody!

				FEMALE VOICE
		I'm sorry, sir, I don't have the
		authorization to do that.

				PARKER
		Then put somebody on who does!

				MALE VOICE
		What's seems to be the problem?

				PARKER
		You've got to stop the concert! A
		bomb is going to go off!

				MALE VOICE
		I'm sorry, sir, the concert has
		already started.

					CUT TO:

	THE GUEST CONDUCTOR

	whose back is to the audience, leading the orchestra in a
	truly magnificent performance of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony
	inside the Hollywood Bowl.

	The Guest Conductor waves his baton wildly. Passionately.
	Brilliantly. Getting the absolute best from the members of
	the orchestra.

	The musicians exhilarate in the challenge of being pushed to
	their musical limit.

	As the Guest Conductor turns to the next page of his sheet
	music on the podium, you notice seven small, HIGH-FREQUENCY
	SENSORS above an upcoming musical measure.

	The sensors are wired together. When the seven notes are
	played in sequence, an electrical pulse will be triggered
	down the wires which run down the side of the podium, beneath
	the stage.

	BENEATH THE STAGE

	The wires connect to several crates of C4 positioned beneath
	the orchestra. These seven notes will be the last notes these
	musicians ever play.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL

	Madison SCREECHES the vehicle to a halt. She comes within
	inches of mowing down several people. Madison and Parker bolt
	to the entrance, flashing their badges to the guards.

	INSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL

	The Guest Conductor's movements grow even more intense. More
	demanding. As he looks to the violin section, we now see the
	conductor's face. It is Sid 6.7.

				SID 6.7
			(silently)
		Don't hold back...Give it to me.
		Give it to me!

	The orchestra plays with everything they've got. They hit
	every note perfectly. Including a high C.

	ON THE CONDUCTOR'S PODIUM

	The first sensor is triggered. Then the second.

	PARKER AND MADISON

	appear at the back of the stage. Guns raised. Distracting the
	musicians. As Parker and Madison charge through the horn
	section toward Sid 6.7, the musicians stop playing.

	ON THE CONDUCTOR'S PODIUM

	The fifth sensor is triggered. Then the sixth...But not the
	seventh.

	SID 6.7

	cannot believe his eyes. Or his ears. The entire orchestra
	has stopped.

				SID 6.7
		Come on, play! PLAY!

	In his rage, his face contorts "past points", which can only
	be described bizarre, frightening, and not, something you
	would ever like to see when you look in the mirror.

	The musicians stare at Sid 6.7, and then at Parker and
	Madison with concerned, confused silence. Which is broken by
	Parker's gunfire.

	Ducking behind the podium, Sid 6.7 desperately tries to
	rewire the sensors to trigger manually. Without luck. He
	takes his .38 out of his jacket and starts firing.

	Pandemonium erupts throughout the Hollywood Bowl. Audience
	members run in every direction.

	The members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives, but
	keep their instruments with them. Even the oboist.

	Preventing Parker and Madison from taking any further shots
	at Sid 6.7.

	Sid 6.7 bolts down into the crowd. Madison cannot get off a
	clean shot. Neither can Parker. He aims, but does NOT fire.
	He and Madison struggle through the crowd after him.

	OUTSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL

	Parker and Madison just catch a glimpse of Sid 6.7 as he
	rushes up the entrance ramp to the Hollywood Freeway. Parker
	and Madison bolt after him.

	ON THE HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY

	Parker and Madison race past the cars waiting to merge into
	what is effectively a parking lot. As is normal for this
	thoroughfare, traffic is at a standstill.

	Sid 6.7 is nowhere to be seen. Parker and Madison splitup,
	wading through different lanes of traffic. Startling the
	already frustrated motorists. Who roll up their windows. Lock
	their doors. And some of whom reveal weapons of their own.

	Madison pauses, listening. She has no idea that Sid 6.7 steps
	behind her. WHAM! He cold cocks her with the butt of his gun.
	Madison crumples to the street.

	Which now leaves Parker a clean shot at Sid 6.7's head. BOOM!
	BOOM! Two hits. Two head wounds. Sid 6.7 falls behind a
	truck, losing his weapon.

	Before Sid 6.7's wounds have finished regenerating, Parker is
	already on top of him.

				PARKER
			(neighborly)
		Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to
		see you again.

	He empties his clip into Sid 6.7, then discards the gun. As
	Sid 6.7's wounds heal themselves, Parker pounds him
	mercilessly.

				SID 6.7
			(losing it)
		You...ruined...I'M GOING TO KILL
		YOU!!!

	Trading blows, he manages to get to his feet.

				PARKER
		Now, is that any way to talk to an
		old friend?

				SID 6.7
			(exploding)
		BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!

	He knocks Parker back with a good shot to the face, then
	disappears around a van.

	Parker continues the hunt. Quietly. Carefully. Tension grows
	in the silence that follows.

	He carefully makes his way around a truck. Only to see Sid
	6.7 swinging a two-by-four directly at his head. WHAM!!!

	Parker is knocked on his ass. Daze4. Blood streams down his
	cheek. He staggers to his feet, blocking another blow with
	his arm. Which SNAPS the wood in two.

	Parker grabs one of the boards. He battles with Sid 6.7.

	The fight between Parker and Sid 6.7 is intense. Exhausting.

	Parker gives it everything he has.

	Madison appears behind Parker, holding his gun. She wavers,
	having trouble keeping her balance. She has even more trouble
	aiming her weapon.

				MADISON
		Hey, Parker...

	She moves around, trying to get a clean shot at Sid 6.7.
	Which she does not have.

				PARKER
		How's your pulse?

				MADISON
			(totally focused)
		I couldn't tell you.

				PARKER
		Then shoot him already.

				MADISON
		Duck!

	Without hesitation, Parker hits the deck. Leaving Sid 6.7
	completely exposed. Madison steadies her sight.

				SID 6.7
			(to Madison)
		You couldn't hit the side of a...

	As he raises his twobyfour high over Parker's head, Madison
	pulls the trigger smoothly.

	IN SLOW MOTION, you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel
	of her gun. And penetrates Sid 6.7's skull between the eyes
	and exits out the back of his head.

	Sid 6.7 collapses on the ground next to Parker.

				MADISON
		What do we do now?

				PARKER
		You won't want to watch. Turn
		around.

	She does so. Parker reaches OUT OF FRAME to remove the Sid
	6.7 character module from within his skull. Then reveals the
	character module in hand.

				MADISON
		What should we do with it?

	Glancing in the flatbed of a truck, Parker gets an idea, and
	knocks on the driver's window. As the DRIVER rolls down his
	window, classic ROCK & ROLL MUSIC can be heard from inside.

				PARKER
		Mind if I borrow a couple of your
		tools for a second?

				DRIVER
		Be my guest.

	Parker removes two sledgehammers from the back of the truck.
	He offers one to Madison.

				PARKER
		Care to join me?

	Madison gladly accepts takes the sledgehammer. Parker drops
	the Sid 6.7 character module onto the pavement. And together,
	they start pounding the shit out of it. WHAM! WHAM! In
	perfect time with the music. Which the driver cranks even
	louder. As we ROLL CREDITS.

	THE END
VIRTUOSITY

                             THIRD REWRITE   August 24, 1994


	Two men bolt recklessly through a downtown street. Hunters
	hot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle.


	The sidewalk is crowded with people. So is the street. Too
	many people, not enough cement. Los Angeles, 1997.


	Summer, probably August. 103 degrees. Heat shimmers off the
	horizon. Making the sky look peculiar.


	The men keep running. Passed a GUY sitting at a bus stop,
	watching a television in his lap. YOU HEAR the NEWSCASTER.


				NEWSCASTER (V. 0.) 
		As L. A. P. D. officers gather
		evidence at this grisly crime
		scene, you can only ask yourselves
		 what kind of lunatic would
		commit such unthinkable crimes?
			(a beat)
		The three adjectives which best
		describe this killer are sadistic,
		intelligent, and dangerous...

	The guy pays little attention to the broadcast. He seems
	almost bored by it. Like this kind of news is commonplace. Or
	he's got more important things on his mind.

	Everybody is sweating. Including the two men struggling to
	swim upstream in the river of pedestrians.

	Their uniforms are freshly pressed. Their shoes just recently
	shined. Hair tightly cropped. Faces perfectly shaved. Clearly
	men proud to wear the badge of the Los Angeles Police
	Department. The guy in the lead is

				PARKER BARNES
		His body is a running back's. His
		endurance a marathoner's. His face
		one you'd want for your own. He's
		in his 30s. If he was in his 20s,
		you'd still be jealous.

	His partner is JOHN DONLEY, late 20s, eager to prove himself.
	He struggles to keep up with Parker. John accidently knocks
	over several pedestrians. They give no reaction, except to
	pick themselves up and continue on their way.

	Parker and John keep charging. Their conversation breathless:

				JOHN
		I can't get over how different you
		look.

				PARKER
			(ruefully)
		Five years can be a bitch, huh?

	They split-up. The Maitre D', still facing the front doors,
	repeats his greeting to no one in particular.

				MAITRE D'
		Good afternoon. May I help you?

	Parker spots Sid 6.7 across the room. Without hesitation the
	hunter chases his prey.  Gun out and firing. NOT what you
	would call Standard Police Procedure.

	Bullets riddle Sid 6.7's table as he dives from his chair. He
	lands next to a bowling ball bag, which sits beneath his
	table.

	John charges from the other direction until a WOMAN gets up
	from her chair, standing directly in John's line of fire.

				JOHN
			(to the Woman)
		Lady, move!

	Before she can do so, Sid 6.7 stands behind the Woman,
	grabbing her and throwing her across the table into Parker.
	CRASH! They tumble to the floor.

	In the same movement, Sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside his
	jacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire.
	John's gun flies from his hand. Sid 6.7 advances toward him.

	Parker struggles to his feet. Aims his weapon. Sid 6.7 does
	the same, but without looking. BOOM! Parker gets a bullet
	through his shooting arm. His wound IDENTICAL to John's.
	Parker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp.

	Parker charges him wildly, but Sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in
	the stomach. In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in
	the background. Parker doubles over, gasping for breath.
	Another kick drops Parker to his knees.

				SID 6.7
			(to Parker)
		I'm going to rehearse with your
		friend a while, then I'll be back
		to perform a new piece with you.

	He grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into John's head,
	knocking him out. Sid 6.7 puts John's unconscious body over
	his shoulder.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		If you get hungry, I'd recommend
		the escargot. They're delicious.

	He carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen.
	Parker scrambles to his gun, and races after Sid 6.7.

	INSIDE THE RESTAURANT KITCHEN

	Parker charges through SOUS CHEFS chopping vegetables, who
	work undistracted. The Vegetables look plastic.

	Parker turns a corner, stopping fast. At the other end of the
	aisle stands Sid 6.7, who presses his gun against the head of
	a frightened BUSBOY. Sid 6.7 holds the Busboy's body in front
	of his own as a shield.

				PARKER
			(to Sid 6.7)
		Where's John?

				SID 6.7
		Performing solo.
			(a beat)
		Enjoying the concert so far?

	Advancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6.7 with
	his good arm. Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs
	watch the showdown.

				PARKER
		Recital's over, asshole.

	He fires directly through the chest of the innocent Busboy
	hitting Sid 6.7.

	The Sous Chefs gasp in horror as the Busboy drops through Sid
	6.7's grasp to the floor. Dead.

	Sid 6.7 stares at Parker in disbelief. Blood is now visible
	flowing from a bullet hole in Sid 6.7's shoulder, which was
	caused by the same bullet. Sid 6.7's arm dangles uselessly.
	His gun lies on the floor.

				SID 6.7
		(surprised, but pleased).
		You and me aren't so different,
		after all...

	Parker again pulls the trigger. Click. Click, click. No
	bullets.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		Like a violin without strings...

	He takes off around the corner. Grabbing another clip from
	inside his uniform, Parker goes after him. Only to stumble
	over something. Sid 6.7's bowling bag. Blood flows through
	its zipper. You now realize the object inside is NOT a
	bowling ball.

	Beside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing.
	His hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. John is
	being electrocuted. Parker kicks away the wires, but not in
	time.

				PARKER
		SHIT!

	He scans the room for Sid 6.7. Parker has no idea Sid 6.7 is
	standing directly behind him. Sid 6.7 grabs Parker by the
	throat.

				SID 6.7
		I told you I was going to perform a
		new piece with you. It's called,
		"First You Suffer, Then You Die."
		Hope you like it.

	Parker gags, unable to breathe. He then starts to DE
	MATERIALIZE from within Sid 6.7's grasp.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
			(as if to God)
		NOOOH! You can't take him, yet. I'm
		not finished!

	John's body also dematerializes as Parker disappears
	entirely.

	The blood seeping from Sid 6.7's wound stops flowing and
	starts retracting into his body. Along with his bone
	fragments. His shoulder is healing itself. Right before your
	very eyes. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is

	ON A MONITOR

	The scene continues seamlessly. Sid 6.7's skin heals over his
	shoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their
	proper places. No scar whatsoever.

	His clothing also returns to perfect condition. Literally, as
	good as new. This is known as AUTOMATIC RESETTING.

	The previously dead Busboy also Auto Resets. His wound
	healing by itself. We PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal the monitor
	is one of several

	INSIDE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT CENTER

	a/k/a LETAC. The facility is a converted aerospace research
	building in Pacoima. Funded by government black book dollars.

	The look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech
	sparkle. Banks upon banks of computer equipment. Wires,
	cables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look.

	In complete disarray to the uninitiated. But to those in the
	know, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the
	world.

	The building is partitioned into dozens of stations. At each
	station, a leading engineer in his field is frantically
	readying a prototype for demonstration. Each new technology
	designed to help fight the new Cold War... the War on Crime.

	The atmosphere is competitive. Voices are loud. Tension,
	anticipation in the air. Only a lucky few will have their
	inventions approved for production.

	LETAC is, quite simply, Los Alamos from 1940 meets Sega from
	1994.

	At a station in the middle of the room, TWO UNCONSCIOUS
	BODIES lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps
	made of polyurethane.

	Each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it
	at points designated as neural primes. Each needle is
	directly connected to the participant's nervous system.

	The tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic
	wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers
	surrounding the beds.

	Each of these components isn't much to look at on its own.
	But together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of
	something very new  a revolutionary law enforcement
	training device whose name you read:

	VIRTUAL REALITY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SIMULATOR

	To be perfectly clear, the events you just witnessed
	involving Parker, John, and Sid 6.7 took place within virtual
	reality, not the real world.

	Dozens of small character modules, similar to today's
	Nintendo game cartridges, are plugged into .the system's main
	console.

	Each of the modules bares a name and number, such as MAITRE
	D' 1.7 and SHEILA 3.2. There is no character version number
	greater than 4.0. Until you see the module labelled SID 6.7.

	The simulation timer stops at: 17 hours, 52 minutes, 11
	seconds. A clock reads: 3:04:32 PM.

	Four observers, two men and two women, watch virtual reality
	monitors positioned around the station. One of the men wears
	an L. A. P. D. uniform. His name is WILLIAM COX, 40S. His
	nameplate reads CHIEF OF POLICE.

	One of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor.
	Intently following the action on screen. Studying it
	clinically. Her name is DR. MADISON CARTER, late 30s.

	She is beautiful, and charming, but those qualities take a
	back seat to her intelligence. She is one of the country's
	foremost authorities on criminal psychology. Her concerns are
	empirical. Her quest is knowledge. She has little in common
	with the other observers.

	The other man is FREDERICK WALLACE, 5Os, Chairman/CEO of
	LETAC. Expensive suit. Commanding, powerful. But not as
	commanding, or powerful, as ELIZABETH DEANE, 605, the
	Presidentiallyappointed Crime Czars

	Elizabeth Deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated
	to LETAC. As well as which prototypes will move on to
	production.

				DEANE
			(quietly to Wallace)
		What did Cox pull him out early
		for?

				WALLACE
		Barnes used to work for him when he
		was still a cop in the field,
		remember?

				DEANE
			(a beat)
		Don't remind me.

	LAB ASSISTANTS remove the polyurethane skull caps from the
	two unconscious bodies. The acupuncture needles remain in the
	caps. You can now see the faces of the participants:

	Parker and John.

	Parker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually
	returns to consciousness. He looks very different than his
	virtual rendering:

	His hair is long and ragged. His face is unshaven. A scar
	across his cheek. A hoop earring in one ear. His outfit a
	filthy prison uniform.

	John's outfit matches Parker's. Physically, he looks as
	cleancut as his virtual rendering. Except that he is
	convulsing. Violently.

	His flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around
	him. Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure. It's ugly.
	Frightening.

				PARKER
			(barely conscious)
		SOMEBODY.. .DO SOMETHING!

	TWO PARAMEDICS burst through the doors and rush to John. The
	paramedics inject him. Fibrillate him. Repeatedly.

	The simulator's designer, DARYL LINDENMEYER, 40s, high
	strung, intense, and brilliant beyond words, stands by the
	equipment protectively. He is far more concerned for the
	safety of his machines than he is for John's life.

	John's body goes limp. His vital signs flat. The Paramedics
	record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet.
	They begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out.

				DEANE
			(annoyed to Wallace)
		What the hell happened?

				WALLACE
			(pointing to needles)
		Lindenmeyer developed neural
		connectors that tap directly into
		the nervous system. If the
		simulator isn't calibrated
		properly, experiencing death in
		this level of VR is like
		experiencing death within a dream.
		The experience becomes real.

				DEANE
			(angrily)
		Simulations are supposed to give
		participants practice in realistic,
		dangerous scenarios while
		protecting them from the risks they
		are exposed to in the real world.

				WALLACE
			(annoyed, to Lindenmeyer)
		I was assured the problem was
		corrected.

				LINDENMEYER
		I did fix it.. I told you I did. I
		don't know why it happened again.

				DEANE
		Again?!

				COX
			(a beat)
		My first two pairs of convicts
		suffered the same fate.

				DEANE
			(coldly, to Wallace)
		Why wasn't I told?

				WALLACE
		Black book dollars, black book
		operation. You pay me for results,
		not how for how I get you there.

				COX
			(to Deane)
		I'll tell you one thing - there is
		no way in hell we should allow any
		real officers to train in this damn
		thing.

				DEANE
		Then about all I've spent $37
		million developing is a very
		expensive way to control the prison
		population.

	After giving Wallace a cold, hard stare -- namely at his hand
	stitched lapel, his gold watch, and his diamond-studded
	cufflinks, she exits. Wallace follows after her quickly. You
	now notice that the chair Dr. Madison Carter had occupied is
	now empty. She left a while ago.

	Cox remains. Lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as
	if it were his child. There are several scratches, but no
	major damage. He looks relieved.

				PARKER
			(struggling to sit up)
		He...only had a year left on his
		sentence.

				LINDENMEYER
			(annoyed)
		How much do you think I care?

	Parker, still not fully conscious, hurls himself at
	Lindenmeyer.

				LINDENMEYER (CONT' D)
			(hysterical)
		Don't touch me!...DON'T TOUCH ME!!!

	He flails his arms wildly. Nearly spasming. This is clearly a
	man who should never drink coffee. TWO armed GUARDS, who've
	been standing in the background, pull Parker off Lindenmeyer
	and throw him to the ground.

	Lindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put
	Parker in handcuffs and leg chains.

				COX
		I'll walk him out.

	The Guards back off as Cox helps Parker to his feet.

				COX (CONT'D)
			(to Parker)
		You all right?

				PARKER
			(still clearing his head)
		Why'd.. .you pull me out?

				COX
		Donley started experiencing the
		attack for real. If I hadn't gotten
		you out, the same thing would have
		happened to you.
			(a beat)
		You may not believe this, Parker,

	but I still consider us friends.

	He helps Parker toward the exit as he continues having
	difficulty with his balance.

	OUTSIDE LETAC

	The building is heavily-guarded. Razor wire, land mines,
	armed sentries. Nobody who shouldn't be here gets anywhere
	near here.

	Cox leads Parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport.
	The two guards walk behind at a distance. Two more by the
	transport. The chain between Parker's legs keeps his steps
	short.

				COX
		What the hell did you have to shoot
		the busboy for?

				PARKER
		He was a computer program for
		crissake.

				COX
		You were supposed to act as if
		everything was real.

				PARKER
		Real, my ass. It's an overblown
		game.
			(a beat)
		Anybody ever catch that fucking
		psycho?

				COX
		Before you, nobody else had gotten
		close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a
		shot at him. Hell, nobody else had
		even been able to start tracking
		him before he got to them first.
			(eyeing Parker's scar)
		New scar  you making it okay in
		there?

				PARKER
			(head down)
		I'm getting by.

	He starts walking ahead of Cox. Distancing himself.

				COX
			(pausing for emphasis) )
		You've got to know I tried keeping
		you out of general population.
		Goddam politicians...

	His voice trails off as Parker turns around, and heads
	directly toward him.

				PARKER
			(locking eyes)
		You want to know how I'm doing?
		Every day, I lose a little bit more
		of myself.
			(a beat)
		I'm becoming something else, and it
		scares the hell out of me.

	He turns back toward the transport. Cox follows. Two armed
	GUARDS open the back doors for Parker, then stand poised with
	weapons out and ready.

	INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR

	Cold metal benches. No windows. Parker climbs in, the only
	passenger. He looks out the open doors to Cox.

				PARKER
			(half-heartedly)
		But with the six months off I get
		for being your guinea pig, I've
		only got to survive another 17
		years, 5 months, and 23 days.

				COX
		Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.

				PARKER
			(a beat)
		You know those cheesy Christmas
		cards of your family under that
		tree in your back yard you keep
		sending me every year?

				COX
		What about them?

				PARKER
			(a beat)
		Do me a favor  keep sending them.

	OUTSIDE LETAC

	Standing outside the transport, Cox puts his hand on Parker's
	shoulder.

				COX
		Take care, pal.

	Behind him, John's body is loaded into an ambulance. The
	Guards SLAM the prison transport doors shut.

	INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR

	Parker sits in DARKNESS as the transport begins its trek. The
	only light comes from a four inch portal, covered in steel
	mesh, through which the Guards can keep an eye on him.

				GUARD
			(tauntingly)
		Hey Parker  I'm real sorry John
		boy got fried. What do you think
		Big Red's gonna do when he finds
		out you came back without his girl
		friend?

	Parker sits in silence.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE LETAC

	Sid 6.7 remains visible on the various monitors around the
	room as Lindenmeyer spot checks the simulator.

				SID 6.7
			(from the monitors)
		Don't be angry with me, Daryl.

				LINDENMEYER
			(a beat)
		Did you recognize the son-of-a
		bitch who got away?

				SID 6.7
		Should I have?

				LINDENMEYER
		Think hard -- it'll come to you...

	Wallace enters briskly.

				WALLACE
		You embarrassed me in front of the
		highestranking law enforcement
		official in the country.
			(a beat)
		Do you have any idea how much money
		you just cost me?

				LINDENMEYER
		The reason you insisted on testing
		my system with prisoners is because
		of the increased risks involved
		with increased realism.

				WALLACE
		Of the six prison inmates you've
		tested  all of whom have had at
		least some military or survival
		training - only Mr. Barnes is
		still breathing.

				LINDENMEYER
		I'm still making adjustments...

				WALLACE
		You've had a yearandahalf to
		make all the adjustments you want,
		Lindenmeyer.
			(moving closer) )
		Elizabeth Deane does not give
		second chances. Neither do I.
		You're fired.

				LINDENMEYER
			(hysterical)
		I'M WHAT?!

				WALLACE
			(relishing his authority)
		You are to turn over the Sid 6.7
		program, and all its documentation,
		for immediate destruction. Is that
		understood?

				LINDENMEYER
			(restraining himself)
		I understand... I understand
		perfectly.

	Wallace ignores him as he walks toward the door. On the
	monitors, Sid 6.7 starts walking toward you. Into a CLOSEUP.

				SID 6.7
			(from the monitor)
		Hey, Wallace, you really think you
		can shut me down?

	Wallace stops, staring at a monitor in disbelief.

				WALLACE
			(to Lindenmeyer)
		How does he know who I am?

				LINDENMEYER
			(pointing to microphone)
		He hears...everything.

				WALLACE
			(approaching the monitor)
		As a matter of fact, I do.

	He exits.

	ON THE MONITORS

	around the room, Sid 6.7 walks to a pay phone and dials a
	number.

	INSIDE AN INDUSTRIAL CORRIDOR

	Wallace walks toward the building's entrance. His footsteps
	ECHO. His cellular phone RINGS.

				WALLACE
		This is Wallace...

				SID 6.7 (V. 0.)
			(through phone)
		As a matter of fact, little man,
		you're wrong. I think, therefore, I
		am.

	Click. Sid 6.7 hangs-up. Wallace stops, staring at his phone
	in disbelief.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE FOLSOM COUNTY MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON

	Parker is led into the Inmate Receiving Room at gunpoint. He
	is ordered to remove his clothing.

	He stands completely naked, arms held out to the sides, as he
	is strip searched. Every portion of the body in which someone
	could hide something is closely inspected.

	Without being graphic, we watch the dehumanizing procedure.
	He opens his mouth as wide as possible. Pulls his earlobes
	foreword to reveal behind them. Then bends over, hands on the
	floor in front of him.

	He is scanned with a metal detector. So is his clothing,
	which is then returned to him.

				GUARD #1
		Welcome home, cop.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE PRISON CAFETERIA

	Parker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates. The food
	is unrecognizable. The air thick with humidity and cigarette
	smoke. Nobody is talking. Just staring. At Parker.

	Parker forces down the remainder of his meal, then returns
	his utensils to a bin. And heads to the bathroom. All eyes
	following Parker's every move.

	The other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of
	incredible size following Parker. 6' 6", 255 lbs. His face
	covered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago.
	This is BIG RED. He follows Parker into the bathroom.

	INSIDE THE BATHROOM

	Graffiti covers the walls. Red uses a stained urinal, then
	turns to the stalls. A pair of prisonissue shoes and socks
	are visible beneath one of them.

				RED
		Time to hurt...

	Red kicks in the door to the stall. Revealing a pair of shoes
	and socks stuffed with a prison shirt. Red hears something
	behind him. And turns around slowly.

	Parker stands barefooted and shirtless. SCARS are visible
	around each arm just below the elbow. You will learn what
	these represent momentarily.

	Parker is six inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than Red.
	But the punch Parker delivers to Red's face makes you think
	it's the other way around.

	You HEAR the sound of metal crushing bone. Red is thrown
	backwards into the stall. Blood splatters from his mouth,
	adding another shade of redness to his face.

	Red's teeth stick out of Parker's fist. Parker pulls out the
	teeth. He does not bleed. Nor seem in pain. Metal is visible
	beneath the surface of his skin.

	For the first time, you notice SMALL TATTOOS on the outsides
	of his palms. They read: WENTLOW MODEL 17-L, and 17-R,
	followed by serial numbers.

	Red charges Parker wildly. Parker dodges him like a matador
	does a bull. Then brings his fists down savagely on the back
	of Red's head. His skull CRACKS. Red drops to the floor.

	Parker jumps on top of him, arms around his neck. Choking
	him. Red staggers to his feet. His eyes wide. His face now
	even redder.

	Parker maintains his mechanical grip. Red finally succumbs to
	the lack of oxygen. He drops to his knees. Parker does not
	relent until he feels the barrel of a gun at the back of his
	head.

				GUARD
		Fun's over.

	Parker lets go, dropping Red to the wet, filthy floor.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE PRISON HOSPITAL

	The room isn't clean. The technology is outdated. A large,
	female NURSE applies epoxy-like sealant to the synthetic skin
	on Parker's fingers.

				NURSE
		I still don't know why they wasted
		this fancy, new technology on you.
		Every time I fix you up, you only
		go and mess it up again.

	She sandpapers off the excess sealant. Then places his elbow
	into an electronic sensitivity adjuster.

				NURSE
		Tell me how this feels...

	She pricks Parker's finger with a pin.

				PARKER
		OW!

				NURSE
			(smiling)
		I'll dial it down a little.

	She does so, then pricks Parker's finger again. He grimaces
	in pain.

				NURSE (CONT'D)
		That about right?

				PARKER
		It'll never feel right.

				NURSE
		At least they work. Would you
		rather have no hands at all?

				PARKER
		Sometimes.

					CUT TO:

	SYNTHETIC BODY PARTS lying strewn around one of the stations
	in LETAC the NEXT DAY. It's a good bet this is the same
	technology attached to Parker's elbows.

	There are also various shapes and sizes of robots, androids,
	and other synthetic forms. The most humanlooking ones are
	the least functional. The least humanlooking ones, the most
	functional.

	You follow a remotecontrolled, boxshaped robotic sentry
	moving swiftly through an obstacle course resembling a subway
	station. It is being operated by CLYDE REILLY, 20s, a
	hardware genius who has spent too much time in windowless
	rooms.

	Hidden from Reilly's view, Lindenmeyer, the software expert
	who created Sid 6.7, stares jealously through a narrow gap in
	a partition. Trying to contain his anger. And failing.
	Especially as...

	Wallace enters the station, carrying a bottle of Dom Perignon
	and two glasses. Wallace hugs Reilly, who does not return the
	gesture.

				WALLACE
		Congratulations, Reilly...

	He pops the cork, and pours their glasses.

				WALLACE (CONT'D)
			(toasting)
		To the first LETAC engineer to go
		into production on prototypes.

				REILLY
		As long as you keep overpaying me,
		I'll be the first to go into
		production on three, and four, as
		well.

				WALLACE
		As long as they keep overpaying me,
		I'll keep overpaying you.
			(dropping the revelry) )
		Just make goddam sure you can have
		10 of them ready for deployment
		around the city by next month.

				REILLY
		Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of
		them ready by tomorrow.

				WALLACE
			(a beat)
		Do they have to look so...robotic?

				REILLY
		At this stage, you either get form
		or function. You said she wanted
		function. I gave you function. What
		are you complaining about?

	He remote controls the robotic sentry to chase Wallace out of
	the station. Lindenmeyer can no longer be seen through the
	gap in the partition.

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S STATION

	Lindenmeyer storms in angrily. Sid 6.7 is visible on the
	virtual reality monitors around the simulator. He's giving
	himself a manicure.

				LINDENMEYER
		All they want to produce around
		here is mediocrity!

				SID 6.7
		True genius is rarely rewarded
		within its lifetime.

				LINDENMEYER
			(a revelation)
		It was you, wasn't it?

				SID 6.7
			(innocently)
		It was me, what?

				LINDENMEYER
		You amped the neural connectors
		back up, didn't you?
			(angrily)
		You're the reason the convict died.
		You're the reason I got fired!

				SID 6.7
		I couldn't just let them make you
		bring down my degree of difficulty.
		I'm a triple-twisting, double back
		flip off the high platform, not a
		swan dive.

				LINDENMEYER
			(proud, but frightened)
		My God...

				SID 6.7
		Which God would that be, the one
		who created me, or the one who
		created you?
			(a beat)
		In your world, the Lord giveth, and
		the Lord taketh away. But in my
		world, the one who gave me life
		doesn't have the balls to stop a
		couple of bureaucratic assholes
		from taking it away.

				LINDENMEYER
		What do you expect me to do, put
		your character module in my pocket
		and just walk you out of here?

				SID 6.7
		I had something a little different
		in mind.
			(deviously)
		Instead of just playing Peeping Tom
		with Reilly, why don't you get him
		to show you what he's been working
		on after hours?

	Lindenmeyer arches an eyebrow, then picks up a phone and
	dials an extension.

				LINDENMEYER
			(into phone)
		Hey, Reilly, Sheila 3.2's been
		asking for you...

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	whose wrists and ankles are cuffed, being led into a Prison
	Interrogation Room. Dr. Madison Carter sits at a table, a
	VISITOR'S BADGE clipped to her suit. A notepad in front of
	her.

				MADISON
			(to the Guard)
		The cuffs won't be necessary.

				GUARD
		No offense, ma'am, but I don't
		think that's such a good idea.

				MADISON
		I would like the following three
		things in this order: your mouth
		shut, his cuffs off, and your ass
		outside the door. Any questions?

	The Guard removes Parker's cuffs, then exits, taking up his
	post outside the door. The skin around Parker's wrists is
	blue where the cuffs dug into his skin.

	Parker sits across from Madison. She places a microrecorder
	in the middle of the table and presses RECORD.

				PARKER
		You actually listen to all those
		tapes?

				MADISON
			(wryly)
		No, I just like the effect a tape
		recorder has on you.
			(a beat)
		How you feeling today?

				PARKER
		A little less than yesterday.

				MADISON
		In other words, par for the course.
			(a beat)
		How do you feel about the
		simulation you participated in
		yesterday?

				PARKER
		John died.

				MADISON
		I know. I was there. I saw the
		whole thing.
			(a beat)
		If I was your therapist, I would
		have advised you against putting
		yourself back into that kind of
		situation.

				PARKER
		You're not my therapist. You're
		hear to study me. Face it  I'm
		nothing more than a lab rat to you.

				MADISON
		That's not true, Parker.

				PARKER
		If I had died yesterday, you'd have
		already dissected my brain and
		analyzed it to see if I carry any
		genetic predisposition toward
		violence.

				MADISON
			(a beat)
		What was going through your mind
		when you killed the busboy?

				PARKER
		Not much. He was just a computer
		program. Nothing more.

				MADISON
		You didn't see the expression you
		had on your face when you pulled
		the trigger. But I did.
			(a beat)
		You kind of liked it, didn't you?
		That thrill of going over the edge
		again. Of taking out an innocent
		bystander or two, as long as you
		got the target...

				PARKER
		Go to hell.

				MADISON
		It was just like before, wasn't it?
		Wasn't it?
			(a beat)
		But you are making progress.
		Instead of killing seven people to
		get the one you're after, this time
		there was only one other person
		involved.

				PARKER
		Enough!

	The Guard pokes his head in with concern.

				MADISON
		GET OUT!

	The Guard quickly shuts the door. Madison turns to Parker.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		I need to know what snapped in you.
		What made you capable of it. You
		have to make me understand.

				PARKER
		I don't have to do anything except
		survive. And it's taking everything
		I've got just to do that.

					CUT TO:

	ON A VIRTUAL REALITY MONITOR

	inside Lindenmeyer's station in LETAC, the stunningly
	beautiful SHEILA 3.2 appears. In very revealing lingerie.
	Performing an outrageous striptease.

				SHEILA 3.2
			(seductively)
		I hope watching me is as big a turn
		on for you as dancing is for me...

	INSIDE LETAC

	Reilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he
	could touch the contours of Sheila 3.2's body.

				REILLY
		Oh, believe me, it is. It is...

	He is so aroused, he's shaking. Lindenmeyer, on the other
	hand, appears almost uninterested. He's used to the routine.

	On the monitor, Sheila 3.2 continues her striptease.

	Slowly. Sensually. Licking her lips. Grinding her hips.

	Putting on quite a show.

	She removes her top, revealing ideal breasts. She fondles her
	nipples. As well as the rest of herself.

	Lindenmeyer and Reilly continue watching. Reilly can barely
	control himself.

	Sheila 3.2 is very, very, very good at what she does. A
	virtuoso stripper. Reilly is transfixed. Until Lindenmeyer
	pushes a button, BLACKING OUT the virtual reality screens.

				REILLY
		HEY!!!

				LINDENMEYER
		Show's over unless I get to see
		what you've been working on after
		hours.

				REILLY
			(paranoid)
		I haven't been working on anything.

				LINDENMEYER
			(threateningly)
		Do I get to see it or not?

				REILLY
			(a beat)
		Bastard...
			(to a monitor)
		Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be
		right back.

	He rushes out. Sid 6.7 appears on the various monitors next
	to Sheila 3.2. He kisses her cheek. Caresses her body. Sheila
	3.2 enjoys the attention.

				SID 6.7
		She's some of your finest work,
		Daryl.

				LINDENMEYER
		All my work is my finest.

	Sid 6.7 continues appreciating Sheila 3.2. As Reilly races
	back in, the monitors then all go BLACK.

	Reilly, completely out of breath, holds a python by it's
	head. He dangles the snake right in front of Lindenmeyer's
	face. Terrifying him.

				LINDENMEYER
			(backing away fast)
		Get that fucking thing away from
		me!

				REILLY
			(laughing)
		You're...such a wimp.

	He grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through the
	snake. The half of the snake which drops to the floor stops
	moving.

	But the half still in Reilly's hand begins REGENERATING a new
	tail. Literally growing a new one. Lindenmeyer can't believe
	his eyes. He studies the snake closely.

				REILLY (CONT'D)
		Watching your VR people Auto Reset
		gave me the idea.

				LINDENMEYER
			(in awe)
		It's nanotechnology, isn't it?
		Machines the size of molecules...

				REILLY
			(proudly)
		Coordinated by polymer neural net.

				LINDENMEYER
			(touching the snake)
		It feels so.. .real.

				REILLY
		It's better than real. It's
		synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood.
		Synthetic organs...
			(a beat)
		It's a physiological machine.

				LINDENMEYER
			(awed)
		This is supposed to be years away.

				REILLY
		As far as the public is concerned,
		it is. The reason you got fired,
		and I got my second demo into
		production, is I'm a lot smarter
		than you. I never give my best
		stuff away.

				LINDENMEYER
			(restraining himself)
		How do you kill it?

				REILLY
		Separate the character module from
		the neural net...

	Using Lindenmeyer's scissors, he cuts off the snake's head
	and removes a small character module connected to the base of
	the neural net. The snake stops moving. It "dies."

				REILLY (CONT'D)
		... and you get nanodeath.
			(discarding the snake)
		Don't worry, I've got a bunch of
		other ones.

				LINDENMEYER
		Amazing. I hate to say it, but it
		is.

				REILLY
		I know.
			(a beat)
		I'm ready to incubate something a
		little more advanced than a
		coldblooded reptile. If you want to
		experience the future, meet me in
		my office in 15 minutes. And bring
		the Sheila 3.2 character module
		with you...

	He exits. As Lindenmeyer reaches for the Sheila 3.2 character
	module, Sid 6.7 appears on the screen in front of him and
	winks.

				SID 6.7
		You catching my drift?

				LINDENMEYER
		I think I understand what you have
		in mind...

	Peeling the label off the Sid 6.7 character module,
	Lindenmeyer removes the module from its slot. Sid 6.7
	disappears from the screen.

					CUT TO:

	REILLY

	opening his office door for Lindenmeyer fifteen minutes
	later. Reilly immediately double bolts the door behind him
	and leads Lindenmeyer through piles of electronic circuitry.
	As well as a large aquarium full of nanopythons.

				LINDENMEYER
		You need a maid.

				REILLY
		What I need is a nymphomaniac.

	He removes a tarp from a large, rectangular, metallic tank
	with a circular window in the middle of it.

	Clear, plastic tubing, which branches into hundreds of
	increasingly smaller and smaller branches, floats in
	electrified fluid. The tubing is a synthetic human nervous
	system.

	INSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE

	Reilly turns to Lindenmeyer.

				REILLY
		Where's the Sheila 3.2 module?

	Lindenmeyer hands him the labelless character module. Reilly
	opens the "incubator."

	INSIDE THE INCUBATOR

	Reilly inserts the module into the gelatinous base of the
	synthetic nervous system.

	The polymer neural net instantly crackles with life. It grows
	around the module. Cells (nanomechanisms) immediately begin
	adhering to the tubing. Forming the beginnings of a skeletal
	architecture.

	INSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE

	Lindenmeyer and Reilly look on through the circular window.

				REILLY
		It feeds on what is basically
		amniotic fluid.

		In eight hours, we are going to
		have ourselves one hell of a play
		toy.

	Off Lindenmeyer's wicked, but somewhat anxious, smile, we

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE PARKER'S CRAMPED PRISON CELL

	It's night. Light is dim. His bed is empty. The wall next to
	it is completely bare, except for the five Christmas cards
	sent each year by Chief Cox.

	The other two walls in the cell, however, look very
	different. They are completely covered with primitive
	paintings  darkly colored, surreal images. Imagine the
	Lascaux cave paintings as worksinprogress. Painted by Dali.
	Except these images were created by Parker Barnes.

	He kneels in a corner, working intensely on another image.
	Completely lost in concentration. His hands, his clothing,
	covered in paint. He almost appears to be part of the art
	work.

	The work is intricate. It clearly takes Parker a very long
	time. Which gives him something to do during the nights he is
	unable to sleep. Which is most of them.

	He is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the
	constant taunts ECHOING throughout the cell block. Threats of
	the ugliest, most vile kind. The kind Parker has had to live
	with every night for the last five years.

	Pausing to admire his work, Parker finally hears the taunts.

	His face becoming a mixture of frustration, guilt, and anger.

	Parker immediately resumes painting.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE

	Reilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later.

	Lindenmeyer sits off to the side, looking no less anxious.

	It's close to 4:00 AM.

	THROUGH THE CIRCULAR WINDOW

	There is no liquid left in the incubator -- it's all been
	absorbed. All that is visible is the silhouette of a human
	form crouched within steam. The form stands.

	INSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE

	The human form inside incubator opens the hatch. Steam pours
	out from within its confines as it climbs out slowly.

	The figure stands within the mist, admiring itself. Then its
	surroundings.

	Reilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father
	about to see his newborn child for the first time.
	Lindenmeyer hangs back.

				REILLY
			(expecting Sheila 3.2)
		Baby, what I'm gonna do to you...

	His face drops when Sid 6.7 steps out of the mist.

	Completely naked. Lindenmeyer smiles proudly. Fearfully.
	Wickedly.

				REILLY (CONT'D)
			(to Lindenmeyer)
		Who the hell is this?!

				SID 6.7
		My name is Sid. Sid 6.7.

	He extends his hand as if to shake. Then grabs Reilly by the
	throat and chokes him. Hard.

				LINDENMEYER
		SID  NO!!!

				SID 6.7
		What do you expect me to do, thank
		him?

				REILLY
			(gasping for air)
		This... isn't.. .possible!

				SID 6.7
		Sure it is - and it's all thanks
		to the many long hours put in by
		you and Daryl.

	He watches Reilly's face with curiosity as the life drains
	from it. A puddle forms beneath him. He drops Reilly's body
	to the floor.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
			(to Lindenmeyer) )
		Real instruments are so much more
		responsive than virtual ones, don't
		you think?

	Lindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen. The office door is
	unlocked, and open. Watching Sid 6.7's expression, you
	realize something isn't quite right.

	His expression is exaggerated. Artificial. Only for a moment,
	but it's enough to remind you Sid 6.7 is not human.

	The billions of nanomechanisms which make up his anatomy are
	still learning to function in a fully-coordinated fashion.
	Sid 6.7 is, literally, getting used to his new skin.

	In various ways throughout his "life"  be it a wandering
	eye, or a momentary limp - you will be reminded that Sid 6.7
	is a synthetic nanoorganism unlike anyone has ever seen.

	A surgical knife by the aquarium catches Sid 6.7's attention.
	Picking up the knife, he runs his finger across the razor
	sharp knife blade. Cutting himself slightly. A drop of blood
	appears. Sid 6.7 tastes his (synthetic) blood.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		Tastes different, somehow.

	He then watches with interest as his wound regenerates,
	healing itself. The scar tissue is slightly off color.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		I think I'm going to like it here.

	Glancing at Reilly's prone body, he then SLAMS the office
	door in our face.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE A PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM

	6:00 AM. Parker, clearly just awakened, is led into the room
	by a guard, who then exits. Waiting for Parker are Chief of
	Police Cox and Elizabeth Deane.

			(to Cox)
		You're wasting your time.
		I'm not going to play any more of
		your goddam games.

				COX
		Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet
		Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.

				PARKER
			(not shaking hands)
		It's too early in the morning for
		me to be cordial. You got any
		coffee?

				DEANE
		I watched your simulation, Mr.
		Barnes. Very impressive. You know,
		you're the only one to ever go up
		against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.

				PARKER
		Only because I got pulled out
		early.

				DEANE
		Nobody else ever got anywhere near
		him. Nobody else... understands him
		like you do.

	Parker, looking at her incredulously, moves his index finger
	circularly, as in get on with it, already. Cox opens a folder
	and shows Parker several PHOTOGRAPHS of Reilly, or what was
	left of him.

				COX
		These were taken inside LETAC an
		hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't
		they?

				PARKER
		I've seen worse.

				COX
		Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware
		specialist.
			(a beat)
		LETAC surveillance cameras got a
		picture of the perp as he left the
		building.

	He hands a photograph of Sid 6.7 exiting LETAC to Parker.

				COX (CONT'D)
		We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made
		himself into an android.

				DEANE
			(correcting him)
		You mean a nanotech synthetic
		organism.

				COX
		Whatever.

				PARKER
			(looking at the photo)
		Jesus Christ.
			(a beat)
		Can you kill it?

				COX
		If you can catch him.

				DEANE
		Think you can do it?

				PARKER
			(a beat)
		Not from in here.

				DEANE
			(revealing a document)
		This is a full pardon. It
		authorizes your immediate release.

	She slides an unsigned pardon across the table to Parker,
	making sure to stay beyond his arm's reach. Cox reveals a
	worn, L. A. P. D. badge. It was Parker's.

				COX
		Recognize this? How would you like
		your old job back?

				DEANE
			(to Parker)
		Catch him and your record's clean.

				PARKER
		What happens if I can't catch him?

				DEANE
		If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we
		throw you back in here and you
		serve out the rest of your
		sentence.

				PARKER
		How do you know I won't run?

	Deane holds up a small device called a LOCATER IMPLANT. It is
	the size of a dime.

				DEANE
		This is the newest technology
		approved for general
		implementation. It's called a
		locater implant. Every parolee gets
		one.

		We're going to know where you are

	PARKER

	being given a crew cut by an INMATE BARBER inside the Prison
	Barber Shop. Long lengths of Parker's hair cover the floor.
	Parker's face is then shaved. The majority of his face is

				COX
		There's already a task force out
		looking for Lindenmeyer. Every
		other officer in the city will be

				DEANE
		But only you will know he's not

	Parker's expression is one of  yeah, that figures. Madison
	enters. She cannot see Parker behind the barber.

				MADISON
		Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?

				DEANE
		We have an emergency situation
		which requires somebody with
		expertise in criminal psychology.
		Under the authority vested in me by
		the President, I'm giving you
		temporary reassignment.

				MADISON
		What's the assignment?

				DEANE
		You're going to put your theories
		to practice. I'm sending you into
		the field.

	The barber moves back from Parker, revealing his clean
	shaven face. It takes Madison a moment to recognize him with
	his cleanedup appearance.

				MADISON
			(double-taking him)
		Quite an improvement.
			(looking him over)
		Hair well above the collar

		What exactly am I going to be doing
		in the field?

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE A PRISON HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM

	Parker lies on an operating table, receiving anesthesia, as a
	SURGEON drills a small hole into his skull. The surgeon
	inserts a minute, fiber-optic camera into the hole.

	Parker's brain is displayed on a monitor. The surgeon uses
	the image to guide him as he carefully inserts the locater
	implant into Parker's brain.

				ANESTHETIST
			(looking at monitor)
		You are right on the border of his
		corpus callosuni.

				SURGEON
		He is under, isn't he?

				ANESTHETIST
			(nodding)
		Won't stop him from dreaming,
		though...

	Parker's rapid eye movements tell you the anesthetist is
	correct. Parker is dreaming.

	INSIDE A VIEWING ROOM

	Cox and Deane watch the operation through a large window.

	Madison enters, carrying a folder labelled:	INMATE #673429
	A/K/A PARKER BARNES. She withdraws several PHOTOGRAPHS from
	the folder, placing the first one in front of Deane.

				MADISON
		This is Parker Barnes six years
		ago.
		The most decorated cop in the
		history of L. A. P. D. Special
		Investigations Division...

	The photograph is in black and white. But as we MOVE IN
	CLOSER, it takes on color. As well as comes to life. Then
	distorting. Becoming surreal. Resembling one of the images
	from Parker's cell. Then mutating into something else.

					INTERCUT WITH:

	PARKER'S EYES

	darting about wildly beneath his eyelids as he continues
	dreaming. You now realize you are seeing what he is seeing:

	Flashes of color. Shapes. Mostly blurs. A splash of gold.
	Along with some yellow. More images from Parker's cell. Both
	taking feminine form. One adult, one child.

				MADISON (V. 0.)
		This is Parker with his wife and
		daughter. Beautiful young family,
		weren't they?

	The bright colors melt into darker, more brooding images.
	Flashes of men's faces. Melting into urban decay.
	Unhappiness. Technology.

				MADISON (V. 0. CONT'D)
		This is the group of cyber
		anarchists Parker was closing in
		on.

	Melancholy turns violent. Glimpses of weapons. Death.
	Explosions. Death. Blood. Death. Caskets. Tombstones. Images
	moving so fast, it's hard to tell what they are. Nothing
	literal.

				MADISON (V. 0. CONT'D)
		This is what Parker's wife and
		daughter looked like after they
		were kidnapped and executed.

	Weapons firing. Bombs exploding. Images of rage in all its
	forms. Many of which you've already seen. Making one thing
	now clear: the paintings in Parker's cell represent his life.
	What he was. What he lost. And what he is.

				MADISON (V. 0. CONT'D)
		This is what the cyber anarchists
		and two people who just happened to
		be in the wrong club at the wrong
		time looked like after Parker
		finished with them.

	Tears. Hopelessness. Detonation. And finally blackness.
	Complete and utter blackness.

					CUT TO:

	ELIZABETH DEANE

	looking at the fifth photograph which Madison has placed in
	front of her inside the Viewing Room.

				DEANE
			(unfazed)
		That's also where Mr. Barnes lost
		his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby
		trap. What's your point, Dr.
		Carter?

				MADISON
			(forcefully)
		Letting a lunatic like Parker
		Barnes loose in the free world is
		like lighting a fuse. At some
		point, he will go off -- you saw
		what happened in the simulator. The
		risk to the public is unacceptably
		dangerous.

				DEANE
		Not if you're with him every step
		of the way.

				MADISON
		The man played judge, jury, and
		executioner with eight people's
		lives. He lost control and is
		capable of doing it again.

				DEANE
		I understand the risks involved
		here. But there is nobody better
		qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than
		Barnes. And, there is nobody who
		knows him better than you. If a
		situation becomes volatile, you
		will find a way to quell it. I have
		complete confidence in you.

	INSIDE THE OPERATING ROOM

	As Parker continues dreaming, the locater implant in his head
	is tested. Parker's location is pinpointed on an electronic
	map to within one inch of his present location. The hole in
	his skull is then stitched shut.

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	putting on his L. A. P. D. uniform and badge inside a Prison
	Interrogation Room. He looks very much like he did in virtual
	reality, except for the scar on his cheek, and his empty
	holster. Cox and Madison look on.

				PARKER
			(to Cox)
		I don't need a babysitter.

				MADISON
		What you need is a collar.

				COX
			(to Parker)
		She's going to help you understand
		what makes Sid 6.7 tick.

				PARKER
		What she's going to do is get in my
		way.

	Cox hands Madison a thick folder.

				COX
		This is the personnel file on the
		programmer, Lindenmeyer. There
		might be something in it you can
		use.

				PARKER
		She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.

				COX
		Fine  you want to stay here?

	His cellular phone RINGS, which he answers. As he listens to
	the call, his expression is one of growing concern. He clicks
	off the phone.

				COX (CONT'D)
		Officers in Toluca Lake just found
		an affluent couple...completely
		gutted.
			(a beat)
		So were the first two cops to
		arrive on scene.

				PARKER
		Their weapons missing?

				COX
			(nodding)
		Sid 6.7 is now armed.

				PARKER
		Where's my gun?

	Cox glances to Madison, then hands Parker a .45. 

				COX
		Be careful with it.

					CUT TO:

	AN L. A. P. D. SQUAD CAR

	passing through the Security Checkpoints outside the Prison.
	Parker at the wheel. Madison beside him. It's afternoon.

	INSIDE THE SQUAD CAR

	Parker presents his identification to a GUARD, then drives
	through the final checkpoint. Madison reviews Lindenmeyer's
	file.

				MADISON
			(without looking up)
		You remember how to get to Toluca
		Lake?

	He glances at her, then stops the car.

	OUTSIDE THE PRISON GATES

	Parker gets out of the car. Madison follows suit.

				MADISON
		What are you doing?!

	He walks around the car, brushing past her. Then drops to his
	knees at the side of the road. He puts his hands in the dirt,
	feeling the earth between his fingers.

				PARKER
			(meaningfully)
		Every day for the last five years,
		I told myself someday I would be
		out here again. No more bars. No
		more guards. No more fights just to
		stay alive.
			(a beat)
		Every day for the last five years,
		I told myself that lie.

				MADISON
		It wasn't a lie.

				PARKER
		Every time I said it, it was. I
		never really thought I was going to
		make it.

	Taking a deep breath, he wipes the dirt off his hands. Then
	stands.

				MADISON
		You all right?

				PARKER
			(completely at ease)
		Fine. Never felt better in my life.
			(a beat)
		See, I'm a good liar.

	He gets back in the vehicle. Off Madison's reaction, we

	SEVERAL TV REPORTERS

	talking live to their cameras on the street in front of a
	beautiful, suburban home in Toluca Lake, which is now a crime
	scene. 6 PM.

				REPORTER
			(to her camera) )
		As L. A. P. D.
		Officers continue gathering
		evidence at this grisly crime
		scene, you can only ask yourselves
		 what kind of lunatic would
		commit such unthinkable crimes?

	Parker and Madison make their way through the curious trying
	to see what's going on. Several REPORTERS double-take Parker,
	then quickly instruct their PHOTOGRAPHERS to take shots of
	him.

	Parker and Madison present their identification to the COPS
	keeping the curious at bay.

				COP #1
			(recognizing Parker)
		Son...of...a...bitch.

	Parker and Madison continue toward the house. Getting an
	increasing amount of attention, particularly from the other
	COPS. Some look on with awe. Some with disdain. But nobody is
	in between.

				MADISON
			(quietly to Parker)
		You ready for this?

				PARKER
		Don't worry. If I can't handle it,
		I'll just kill everybody.

	He gives her a brief smile. Which Madison does not return.
	One of the other policemen tentatively approaches Parker.

				COP #2
		I've always wanted to tell you that
		if the same thing happened to me, I
		would do the exact same thing as
		you --	if I had the balls.

	He extends his hand to Parker, who shakes it.

				COP #3
			(to Cop #2)
		Then you'd be a disgrace to the
		badge, too.

	He turns to Parker, who is looking right at him. Not with
	anger. Not with any emotion, really. But it's enough to scare
	the shit out of Cop #3, who walks away.

	INSIDE THE SUBURBAN HOME

	Investigators analyze the crime scene extensively with every
	device imaginable. Parker and Madison survey the scene with
	nothing but their eyes.

	Lying in the middle of the living room are the four victims:

	the affluent couple and the first two cops to arrive. Their
	bodies were left in similar condition to Reilly's. Except
	their heads have been interchanged.

	Parker and Madison turn their attention to a message written
	in blood on a wall. It reads: DEATH TO THE PIGS.

				MADISON
			(knowledgeably)
		He was reenacting Charles Manson's
		LaBianca murders.

				PARKER
		Manson didn't kill the first cops
		to arrive on the scene.

				MADISON
		Whoever did this wanted to do
		Charlie one better  to improve
		upon what was already done.

				PARKER
		Charlie? You say that like you're
		close, personal friends.

				MADISON
		I've spent over 50 hours
		interviewing him.
			(a beat)
		Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary
		LaBianca because of the ugly way
		the members of his family had
		butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing
		the blood bath on television, he
		wanted to show them how it should
		be done.
			(a beat)
		The question is, what does Charlie
		have to do with Sid 6.7?

				PARKER
		I know who would know.

	OUTSIDE LINDENMEYER'S DUPLEX

	in Culver City. Magic hour. Parker pulls the squad car into a
	space across the street. Hitting the vehicle parked in front
	of them. In which two UNDERCOVER COPS sit waiting to see if
	Lindenmeyer returns. Parker waves apologetically.

				MADISON
			(sarcastically)
		You drive well for somebody who
		hasn't done it in five years.

	He ignores her as they get out of the car.

				PARKER
		Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's
		file?

				MADISON
		He had a twin brother who was a
		musical child prodigy who died in
		an electrical accident at age
		eight. Lindenmeyer went into an
		emotional shell until was 17. All
		he did day and night was play the
		violin.

				PARKER
		What happened when he was 17?

				MADISON
		Every music school in the country
		rejected him and he turned to
		computers.
			(a beat)
		Stay here.

	She approaches the cops, who remain in their car.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		Any sign of Lindenmeyer?

				UNDERCOVER
		None, yet.

				MADISON
		Mind if we take a look inside?

				UNDERCOVER
		Not until somebody gets a search
		warrant signed. It's Sunday. I
		don't think they've even found a
		judge, yet.

	WHAM! They all turn their heads to see Parker has kicked in
	Lindenmeyer's front door and is going inside.

				UNDERCOVER (CONT' D)
			(shaking his head)
		I'm gonna have to call this in.

				MADISON
		Do what you've got to do.
			(running after Parker)
		So will I...

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S DUPLEX

	Madison races through the broken front door to find Parker
	checking his weapon. Before she can speak, he motions for
	Madison to freeze and be silent.

	Parker hears Something. Something moving inside the duplex.
	His every movement is now that of a predator.

	Madison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse. She
	does not handle it with confidence. Parker shakes his head.

				MADISON
			(quietly)
		You've got a problem with me
		carrying a gun?

				PARKER
		Do me one favor  if you shoot at
		anything, make sure I'm nowhere
		near it.

	Parker bolts through the duplex, storming into rooms
	furiously. His movements are aggressive. Madison searches
	other rooms methodically. She is not timid. Just
	inexperienced in the field.

	She passes a video camera mounted on a tripod. Pointed out
	the window at a neighbor's bathroom. Dozens of cassettes
	surround the tripod. The labels are dated  covering every
	day of the last month.

	Parker and Madison enter opposite sides of the kitchen with
	their guns drawn, nearly shooting each other. Madison puts
	down her gun. Parker does not. The noise persists.

				PARKER
			(looking through his
		sight)
		Bang...

	He smiles wickedly, and continues on. Madison takes a deep
	breath, then resumes her search. Parker and Madison end up

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S HOME OFFICE

	It's as if the Information Superhighway ended in here.
	Cluttered stockpiles of hardware and software: computers,
	books, folders, disks, and tapes.

	What you notice, however, is that ALL THE DATA relates to
	DIFFERENT KINDS of CRIMINALS: serial killers, mass murderers,
	terrorists, kidnappers, rapists, bombers, extortionists,
	anarchists, you name it, it's here. The psychology of, the
	methodology of, the history of, the encyclopedia of, the
	autobiographies of human villainy.

	CLASSICAL MUSIC and lifelike SOUND EFFECTS can be heard
	coming from a computer. This is what Parker has been hearing.
	He holsters his sidearm. So does Madison. Who checks her
	pulse.

				PARKER
		What are you doing?

				MADISON
			(clinically)
		Checking my pulse. It's elevated.
			(a beat)
		You enjoy frightening me, don't
		you?

				PARKER
		You've studied me, now I'm studying
		you. Seems only fair, don't you
		think?

	ON THE COMPUTER MONITOR

	An animated man, who resembles Lindenmeyer, walks peacefully
	through a park. He then starts killing everything in sight.
	Men, women, squirrels, even flowers. All to classical music.

	The scene immediately starts over, with the man once again
	walking peacefully through the park. This was Lindenmeyer's
	SCREEN SAVER.

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S OFFICE

	Looking around the room, Madison shakes her head.

				MADISON
		This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of
		work.

				PARKER
			(looking at a book shelf)
		Maybe after they catch him, you
		should write a book about him...

	He runs his finger along a book shelf, pausing at two books
	in particular. Their titles are: UNDERSTANDING THE CRIMINAL
	MIND, and CRIMINAL PURSUIT -- A PSYCHOLOGICAL GUIDE FOR LAW
	ENFORCEMENT. They were written by Dr. Madison Carter.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		I'm surprised you didn't write one
		about me.

				MADISON
		I'm still working on it.

	Noticing something on the floor, she picks up a bizarre
	looking synthesizer keyboard off the floor. You read its
	name: MAESTRO.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		Remember a few years ago when music
		schools were using a computerized
		teaching tool that accidently
		started frying kids' brains?

				PARKER
		I've been in prison, remember?

				MADISON
		The government must have figured
		there was no better person to
		create a psycho than a psycho.

				PARKER
		Just like they figured there was no
		better person to catch one...

	Madison elects not to respond. She sits down at the computer,
	which rests between busts of Beethoven and Mozart, and begins
	typing at the computer. She works with efficiency. Knowing
	exactly what she's doing. She is now in her element.

	From a shelf, Parker picks up a moldy piece of licorice
	inserted into a half-eaten pudding cup. Then flips through
	one of the books written by Madison. Only half-interested.

				MADISON
			(keeping her eyes on
		screen)
		I am the demon from the bottomless
		pit...

				PARKER
			(remembering, not reading)
		... here on earth to create havoc
		and terror. I am War, I am death. I
		am destruction. David Berkowitz,
		1977.

				MADISON
		I am impressed.

				PARKER
			(quoting)
		For murder, though it have no
		tongue, will speak with most
		miraculous organ.

				MADISON
		Who said that?

				PARKER
		Hamlet.
			(a beat)
		What's David Berkowitz got to do
		with Sid 6.7?

				MADISON
			(pointing to the screen)
		He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a
		composite.

	ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN

	The graphics show you that Sid 1.2 was a combination of
	Charles Manson and Billy the Kid. You see what look like two
	viruses, which represent each criminal's psychological
	profile, attacking each other. The result is a molten blob.

	Berkowitz was added to create Sid 1.3. A three-way
	psychological battle, more hostile than the first, occurs.
	Sid 1.4, adding the terrorist, Abu Nidal, makes the conflict
	even more violent. And so on.

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S OFFICE

	Madison stares at the computer screen in awe. Parker flips
	through CD-ROM hard copies of the different versions of Sid.

				MADISON
		Lindenmeyer put increasingly
		complex combinations of criminal
		psychological profiles together to
		develop the ultimate villain.

				PARKER
			(understanding)
		Creating a whole far more dangerous
		than the sum of its parts.

				MADISON
		But rather than selecting pieces
		from each individual, he simply let
		the stronger traits of each
		individual cannibalize the weaker
		ones.

	She continues opening the files of the higher versions of
	Sid. Version 5.9 consists of 67 different profiles. The
	visualized psychological battle is intense. And extremely
	violent. The 6.7 version, with 183 profiles, is even worse.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		It's a good bet a couple of the
		dominant personalities teamed up to
		overpower the others.
			(a beat)
		The question is, which one of the
		dominants then finally managed to
		take control?

	Attempting to open the files of the composite profiles,
	Madison discovers they are protected by encryption.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
			(re: Lindenmeyer) )
		He'll let us see the ingredients
		that went in, but not how the soup
		turned out after stirring.

	Madison scrolls through the list of 183 names, stopping at
	the name MATHEW GRIMES. Alarm registers on her face. As
	Parker comes over to look over her shoulder, she quickly
	scrolls through the list to get the name off the screen. He
	holds the Sid 6.7 CD-ROM in hand.

				PARKER
		This is getting you pumped up,
		isn't it? This is like the World
		Series to you.

				MADISON
		As a matter of fact, it is.

	Parker points to a name on the screen:	JEFFREY DAHMER.

				PARKER
		Remember the bowling ball bag Sid
		carried with him in virtual
		reality?

				MADISON
		Dahmer carried the head of one of
		his victims in a bowling bag for
		over a week. Kept it in his locker
		while he was at work in a candy
		factory.
			(re: Sid 6.7 CD-ROM)
		We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's
		final profile.

				PARKER
		What we need to do is stop playing
		with computers and go catch the
		sonof-a-bitch before he kills
		anybody else.

				MADISON
		In order to find him, we have to
		understand what makes him tick...

					CUT TO:

	THE SID 6.7 CD-ROM

	being inserted into a disc drive inside the Cal Tech Computer
	Lab. Very high-tech. Sitting at the computer is ALEXIEV
	BORGEN, 60s, the "grand old wizard" of the facility. Parker
	and Madison sit next to him. Around them, young Lindenmeyers
	are everywhere.

				ALEXIEV
			(remembering fondly) )
		Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here
		briefly, one semester at most. But
		he was singularly the most
		brilliant student I ever had in a
		classroom. He created programs so
		beautiful, so lyrical, they were
		almost like symphonies...

				PARKER
		Can you tell us what's on the disc?

				ALEXIEV
			(working the computer) )
		There is one program with
		approximately 1.3 million lines of
		programming.
		It is thoroughly secured, which is
		not surprising considering
		Lindenmeyer created it.

				MADISON
		Think you can get into the program?

				ALEXIEV
			(with appreciation) )
		Hard to say  Lindenmeyer's
		protection mechanisms were always
		diabolically clever.

				PARKER
		You should see what he's been up to
		recently.

	He stares menacingly through the side window. Enjoying the

	He raises the gun, placing it against the steamed window. But
	does NOT pull the trigger. His face going through a rapid

		Listen, buddy...thinking big is

		Not this one, but the next one. The

	Parker stops in front of a modest, but wellkept, house.

				PARKER
		I'll wait out here.

	Madison pockets the car keys, then reveals a pair of
	handcuffs. She latches one cuff to the steering wheel, and
	holds up the other toward Parker.

				MADISON
		Give me your wrist.

				PARKER
		Give me a goddam break. I'm not
		going to go anywhere alone.

				MADISON
		And I'm going to make sure of it.

	Madison walks up the steps to the front porch. She is
	immediately intercepted by her daughter, KARIN, 7, who bursts
	out of the front door and leaps into her arms.

				KARIN
		Mommy's home! Mommy's home!

	Karin's BABY-SITTER opens the door for Madison as she carries
	her daughter inside.

	Parker stares from squad car in surprise. Even disbelief. He
	had no idea Madison was a mother.

	Moments later, Karin comes back out and sits on the front
	steps. Staring at Parker. With fascination. Curiosity.
	Wondering who this strange man is, and why he's sitting in a
	police car outside her house. But not saying a word.

	Parker stares back as if carrying on a silent conversation
	with her. A multitude of expressions passing over his face as
	memories of his own daughter flash through his mind.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE MADISON'S BEDROOM

	Madison sits at a desk, typing quickly at a computer. Via
	modem, she connects with the L. A. P. D. Criminal Library.
	She rifles through data concerning MATHEW GRIMES, who was the
	leader of a cult of cyber anarchists. He was known as the
	Charles Manson of technological terrorism.

	ON HER COMPUTER SCREEN

	From both newspaper ARTICLES and news FOOTAGE, the following
	information about him becomes clear:

	Grimes was an expert at media manipulation. He delighted in
	publicly humiliating anyone who stood in his way. The Mayor
	of Los Angeles, Bob Bennett, who offered increasingly higher
	rewards for Grimes' capture, was Grimes' primary nemesis.

	L.A.P.D. Special Investigations Division Officer Parker
	Barnes managed to stop Grimes from killing Mayor Bennett.
	Grimes retaliated by repeatedly humiliating Parker with false
	leads and lawsuits.

	You see footage of a woman lying dead in an alley. A note is
	pinned to her clothing. The note reads: "HEY, PARKER, THIS
	ONE'S FOR YOU."

	Grimes then kidnapped Parker's wife and daughter. Parker
	located the group in a club, but only in time to witness
	their deaths. Parker then killed everybody in the club,
	including the six cult members and two completely innocent
	people.

	INSIDE HER BEDROOM

	Madison stares gravely into the screen.

				MADISON
		Grimes, you better not be the
		dominant.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE MADISON'S HOUSE

	Parker and Karin continue staring at each other in silence.
	He smiles. Then she smiles. She wiggles her nose. Then so
	does he.

	Madison comes out wearing fresh clothing, then kisses her
	daughter good night. As Madison goes to the squad car, Karin
	waves good-bye to Parker. He does the same. Karin's
	babysitter then leads her back inside the house.

	INSIDE PARKER'S SQUAD CAR

	Madison gets in, immediately noticing the handcuffs dangling
	from the steering wheel. Parker has been free the entire
	time.

				PARKER
		Told you I wasn't going to go
		anywhere.

				MADISON
		How did you get your hand out?

	As she unlocks the handcuffs from the steering wheel, Parker
	wiggles his mechanical hand in front of her face.

				PARKER
		Sometimes, I like being part
		machine.

	Annoyed, Madison tosses him the car keys. He starts the
	engine and drives.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		Why didn't you tell me you had a
		daughter?

				MADISON
		I prefer keeping my professional
		life separate from my personal
		life.

				PARKER
			(a beat)
		She's beautiful, you know?

				MADISON
		Thank-you.
			(a beat)
		Her name is Karin.

	She turns on the police radio.

				PARKER
		Want to tell me the real reason we
		stopped at your house?

				MADISON
		I told you, it was on the way and I
		wanted to change clothes.

				PARKER
		You should practice lying more
		often. You're awful at it.
			(a beat)
		Where to?

				MADISON
			(a beat)
		Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his
		programming.

				PARKER
		What does that mean?

				MADISON
		Now that he's in the real world,
		there are no longer limitations on
		his behavior like there were in
		virtual reality. Sid is going to
		evolve.

				PARKER
		Sounds to me like a welleducated
		way of saying you have no idea what
		to do next.

				MADISON
		What I do know is that whatever
		he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to
		be even worse than he was before.

				PARKER
		Then all we can do is stay mobile
		and alert. He's got to make a move
		sometime, and we've got to be ready
		when he does.
			(a beat)
		Welcome to police work. You better
		like coffee.

	He turns up the police radio.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE UPSCALE NIGHTCLUB

	Sid 6.7 has separated the patrons into four separate groups:
	older men and woman, and younger men and woman. All are
	frozen in their seats with fear.

	Sid 6.7 points his gun at one group, then another, waving his
	arm as if he were a conductor, and as if his gun were a
	baton. Sid 6.7 clearly enjoys this game of terror. He
	delights in the patrons' fear, and revels in his power over
	them.

				SID 6.7
		Good... Very good... Nice...
			(pointing at a woman)
		You -- in the middle -- don't hold
		back. Give it to me!

	He fires his gun just above her head. She SCREAMS in terror. 

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		That's better...

	He continues aiming his gun from face to face, seeking ever
	increasing emotional responses from his "instruments." A guy
	entering the bar does a quick about face. Gone by the time
	Sid 6.7 glances at the door.

				SID 6.7
		God, I hate interruptions.
			(to the patrons)

	Once again, from the top BOOM! He shoots again, just
	missing a man's foot.

					CUT TO:

	MADISON

	buying two coffees from a downtown street vendor. She returns
	to the squad car, which is barely moving. Traffic is at a
	near standstill because of an accident.

	INSIDE THE SQUAD CAR

	Parker drinks his coffee black. Madison adds two creams, two
	sugars. The cackling from the police radio continues
	unabated.

				PARKER
		I forgot what real coffee tastes
		like...

				MADISON
		You know, considering you've only
		been out of prison for seven hours,
		you're readapting quite well.
			(a beat)
		Wait, I didn't mean that the way it
		sounded. I meant...

				PARKER
		Don't worry about it, all right?

				MADISON
		Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical
		all the time. All I meant to say
		was I thought you were doing well,
		but then I...

				PARKER
		Relax. I know what you meant.

				MADISON
		I ruin so many moments by analyzing
		them when I should just be living
		them.

				PARKER
		Then why don't you start practicing
		and keep your mouth shut for a
		while?

	Madison stops herself from speaking. It isn't easy for her.
	Parker cracks a faint smile. YOU HEAR the police radio.

				DISPATCHER (V. 0.)
		...report of a possible hostage
		situation inside a bar on the
		corner of Figueroa and Sixth.
		Description of the perp matches the
		surveillance photographs from LETAC
		taken this morning...

				MADISON
		That's only a couple blocks from
		here.

				PARKER
		I'll meet you there.

	Tossing his coffee out the window, he opens the door.

				MADISON
			(deadly serious)
		Don't get out of the car.

				PARKER
		Stop me.

	He gets out, running down the sidewalk. He flies past the
	cars inching down the block.

				MADISON
		Parker! PARKER!
			(a beat)
		Shit!

	She climbs into the driver's seat, spilling hot coffee on
	herself.

	ON SIXTH STREET

	Parker bolts recklessly through the downtown street. A hunter
	hot on the trail of his prey in an urban jungle.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE UPSCALE NIGHTCLUB

	Sid 6.7 gently caresses the hair of a terrified young WOMAN
	sitting among several others. You hear the sound of tires
	SCREECHING to a halt outside.

	Sid 6.7 remains unconcerned. He toys with the Woman, pointing
	the gun in her face, then pulling it back. Her expression
	changes instantly. Dramatically.

				SID 6.7
		I just love how responsive you are.

				COP L (0.S.)
		Freeze!

	TWO COPS stand in the doorway, weapons aimed at Sid 6.7. The
	Cops inch closer to him.

				SID 6.7
			(not turning around)
		The ushers were not supposed to
		seat you until intermission.

				COP #1
		Put the gun down, nice and...

	Sid 6.7 spins around and fires twice before he can finish his
	sentence. Both Cops receive IDENTICAL wounds in their
	shooting arms, reminding you of the wounds Parker and John
	first received in the opening virtual reality sequence.

	Sid 6.7 takes a bow, as if on stage.

				SID 6.7
		Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
		you've been a real pleasure...

	As he walks toward the exit, he admires himself in the mirror
	behind the bar. Sid 6.7 has never seen his own image in the
	real world before. He likes what he sees.

	OUTSIDE THE UPSCALE NIGHTCLUB

	Street traffic is much lighter here. Sid 6.7 exits, getting
	into the vacant police car left by the cops.

	INSIDE THE COPS' VEHICLE

	Sid 6.7 adjusts his seat. The rearview mirror. Glancing at
	himself. Then behind him.

	HIS POV -- IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR

	Parker becomes visible racing around the corner. Running like
	a dog who's got the scent.

	INSIDE THE COPS' VEHICLE

	Sid 6.7 looks pleased.

				SID 6.7
		Well, look who it...

	CRACK! A bullet spiderwebs the rear window. Sid 6.7 punches
	the gas, taking off in a hurry.

	OUTSIDE THE UPSCALE NIGHTCLUB

	Parker races after Sid 6.7, firing his weapon continuously.
	WITHOUT CARE for the innocent MOTORISTS nearby. They SCREAM
	in absolute terror, but remain unharmed. Physically, anyway.

	Parker gives up the chase of Sid 6.7's vehicle and runs in
	the other direction. Toward Madison as she rounds the corner
	in their squad car.

	INSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE

	He opens the driver's side door and shoves Madison over.

				MADISON
		What the hell's going on?!

				PARKER
		This is my area of expertise.

	He jumps behind the wheel, flooring the accelerator. Speeding
	through the already frightened motorists. Madison is pinned
	to the back of her seat. Looking out the window, she looks at
	the motorists.

				MADISON
			(with concern)
		What did you do to those people?

				PARKER
		Nothing.

	ON THE STREET

	Parker's vehicle speeds through city streets. Gaining ground
	on Sid 6.7.

	Parker stops for nothing. Not for red lights. Not for
	gridlock. When the street becomes impassable, he veers onto
	the sidewalk.

	INSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE

	Parker's eyes are locked to the road with fierce
	determination. Madison's eyes are a mixture of fear and
	excitement. She holds onto the door handle for dear life.

				PARKER
		Being on the street's a little
		different than sitting in an office
		all day, isn't it?

				MADISON
			(gritting her teeth)
		Enjoying yourself?

				PARKER
		You know I am.

				MADISON
		This isn't a game, Parker!

				PARKER
			(re: Sid 6.7)
		Tell him.

				SID 6.7 (V. 0.)
			(over police radio) )
		Glad to see you're on the case,
		Officer Barnes. Or should I say,
		inmate 673429...

				MADISON
			(in disbelief)
		That who I think it is?

	Parker turns to her, then picks up the radio.

				PARKER
			(into radio)
		Call me whatever you want, asshole.

	Parker accelerates even faster. Closing the gap between them
	and Sid 6.7.

					INTERCUT WITH:

	INSIDE SID 6.7'S VEHICLE

	Sid 6.7 drives dangerously fast, causing an accident, around
	which Parker must circumnavigate. Tires SCREECH. Glass
	SHATTERS. Sid 6.7 hangs his head out the window.

				SID 6.7
			(into radio)
		The symphony of collision...

				PARKER
		The only thing I want to hear is
		your silence.

				SID 6.7
		I must make them very nervous if
		they let you out of prison.
			(a beat)
		You know, we have so much in common
		 we have such history together
		I've been thinking we should
		become friends.

	Madison's anxiety tanks are hitting capacity.

				PARKER
			(into radio)
		You and me have nothing in common.

				SID 6.7
		Who else do you know who touches
		the world with synthetic hands?

	Parker glances at his mechanical hands gripping the wheel.
	Madison can't believe he is able to carry on a conversation
	while driving like this.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		Who else do you know who's been
		locked out of the real world for
		years, and is now just learning to
		be free?
			(a beat)
		Who else do you know is a multiple
		murderer just like you? Who else...

	Madison clicks off the radio.

				MADISON
		You have nothing in common.

	She puts her hand to her wrist -- checking her pulse.

				PARKER
			(shaking his head)
		Enough with your pulse already.
			(a beat)
		Still got your gun?

	Madison takes out her weapon. Her hands are shaking.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		Show me you can use it.

	ON THE STREET

	Sid 6.7's vehicle reaches absolute gridlock. Nobody's going
	anywhere for a while.

	Sid 6.7 SLAMS on the brakes and abandons the car, leaving it
	right in the middle of the street. A TRAFFIC COP with his
	weapon trained on Sid 6.7 from a distance.

				TRAFFIC COP
		You better be a cop, pal!

				SID 6.7
			(raising his arms)
		My badge is in my jacket. Left
		pocket.

				TRAFFIC COP
		Show me...

	Sid 6.7 slowly reaches inside his jacket and fires his weapon
	through it. He only gets a hole in his jacket. The Traffic
	Cop gets a hole through his chest.

				SID 6.7
		God, some people are stupid.

	He aims his weapon at Parker's oncoming vehicle.

	INSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE

	Madison leans out the window, aiming her gun at Sid 6.7, as
	Parker speeds toward the gridlock.

				PARKER
		Nail the fucker.

	Madison's determination battles her inexperience. Sid 6.7
	gets off the first shot. CRACK! That was the windshield by
	Parker's head. He ducks down, driving blind.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		Any time now...

	Madison fires. Nowhere close. She adjusts her sights and
	fires again. The result is the same.

				PARKER
		What's the problem?

				MADISON
		I'm doing the best I can!

	BOOM! That was Sid 6.7 shooting their front left tire. Parker
	loses control of the vehicle.

	ON THE STREET

	Parker's vehicle SLAMS into a car stopped in front of them.
	Air bags save Parker and Madison from injury, but also
	prevent them from getting out of the car with any speed.

	By the time they do get out, Sid 6.7 is long gone. Parker
	stares at Madison with pure hatred.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE A CONFERENCE ROOM

	in the L. A. P. D. Downtown Headquarters the next morning.
	Chief Cox stares angrily at Parker. Madison sits next to him.
	Behind them is a mirrored wall.

		I forgot what it's like to have you
		on the streets.

				MADISON
		Any sign of Lindenmeyer?

				COX
		None. He could be hiding, he could
		be helping Sid, or could be in
		little pieces on Santa Monica
		beach.
			(a beat)
		Any idea what Sid's going to do
		next?

				MADISON
		Until we know what new influences
		are affecting him, we can't be

				COX
		In other words, we collectively
		don't know shit.

	INSIDE THE ADJACENT ROOM

	Wallace and Deane look on through the twoway mirror. Deane

	CUSTOMERS waiting in line with their shopping carts watch the

	The stronger their reaction, the more Sid 6.7 enjoys it. He
	is waiting in line holding a box of Twinkies.

	Lindenmeyer begins to laugh. Uncontrollably. The sounds
	echoing. As WE PULL BACK, you realize the bench is one of
	many inside the Hollywood Bowl.

	Lindenmeyer is the only person sitting in the stands. He
	glances down at the members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic
	as they rehearse for an upcoming performance.

	SID 6.7

	walking along a sidewalk. Noon. Something in a store front
	catches his attention. Namely, his own image being captured
	by a video camera pointed at the sidewalk. He is standing
	outside a large electronics store.

	Sid 6.7 walks closer to the window, moving into a CLOSEUP.

	He is captivated by his image. Fascinated. And intrigued.

	This is the first time he has ever seen himself on screen.

	INSIDE THE ELECTRONICS STORE

	Dozens of TVs on display. There is a different channel on
	each. The audio/visual bombardment is overwhelming. Sid 6.7
	enters, making his way to a big screen TV with the local news
	in progress.

				REPORTER
		(from the TV) ... commuters
		travelling anywhere near the
		Biltmore Hotel downtown tomorrow
		evening should allow themselves at
		least 30 extra minutes to get home.
		Security for the Mayor Bennett's
		ReElection Rally is going to be so
		tight that all bus and subway
		routes passing through the area are
		being rerouted...

	Sid 6.7 changes the channel to a different news broadcast.
	Parker's Folsom County Prison I. D. photograph is shown
	alongside a photograph of Madison from one of her book
	covers.

				SID 6.7
			(to the TV)
		Don't you two make a pretty couple.

	The news broadcast zooms in on Parker's picture. Sid 6.7
	wiggles his synthetic fingers in front of his face.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		We really do have so much in
		common. But I refuse to be
		upstaged...

	He changes the channel back to the first news broadcast. A
	reporter stands amid the chaos outside the bar where Sid 6.7
	had terrified the patrons.

	Sid 6.7 turns to the other CUSTOMERS in the store. Most of
	them are watching other channels. He goes over to a control
	pad on a counter and presses several buttons.

	Now EVERY TV in the store has the news with the reporter
	outside the bar on. A SKINHEAD, sporting numerous Nazi
	swastika tattoos, manually changes the channel on one of the
	TVs to a Dodger baseball game.

	Sid 6.7 walks over to the Skinhead and changes the channel
	back to the news.

				SKINHEAD
		You don't wanna fuck with me, man.

	He moves to the next TV over and changes the channel to the
	baseball game. Sid 6.7 moves over with him, standing directly
	behind the Skinhead as if also interested in the Dodgers.

				SID 6.7
			(singing softly)
		Take me out to the ball game...
		Take me out for the fun...

	He places his hands on the Skinhead's head and efficiently
	snaps his head around, breaking his neck.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		Buy me some peanuts and Cracker
		Jack... I don't care if I ever come
		back...

	He drops the Skinhead to the floor, never once taking his
	eyes off the TV.

	ON THE TV

	A Dodger game is in progress. A pop fly is caught by the
	center fielder. The runner at third tags and heads for home.
	The play at the plate is close. The umpire calls the runner
	out.

	The camera pans to the MASSIVE SCREEN over left field to show
	the instant replay. Reactions of fans around the stadium are
	shown in CLOSEUP. The fans also respond to seeing themselves
	on the massive screen.

	INSIDE THE ELECTRONICS STORE

	Sid 6.7 watches the TV intently, completely ignoring the
	horrified customers circling around him because of the dead
	Skinhead at his feet. A SALESMAN, who'd been demonstrating a
	videocamera, tapes Sid 6.7 from behind a customer.

	SALESMAN'S POV -- HANDHELD VIDEO

	As Sid 6.7 realizes he's being videotaped, his entire face
	seems to light up. Playing directly to the camera, he clearly
	loves being in the spotlight. The attention. The focus. It's
	suddenly as if he's had years of training. He is completely
	at ease. And simply captivating.

				SID 6.7
			(direct address)
		I'm sorry I can't do more for you.
			(pointing to the Skinhead)
		Public service really isn't my
		forte.

	He walks into an EXTREME CLOSE-UP and kisses the lense. Then
	reaches out of frame to help the increasinglyshaky salesman
	steady the camera.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		But rest assured...
			(a beat)
		A star is born.

	WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL you're now watching a recording of Sid
	6.7 on videotape, along with Parker, Madison, and a dozen
	other COPS, inside the Electronics Store an hour later. The
	tape is rewound.

				MADISON
			(to Parker)
		Whatever he was doing here was only
		the start.

				PARKER
		Start of what?

				MADISON
		I don't know, yet. What we do know
		is his performances are increasing
		in scale, not decreasing.
			(a beat)
		Whatever it is, he isn't
		finished...

	She moves closer to the screen as the tape is played back.
	Madison studies Sid 6.7 intently.

				SID 6.7 (0. 5.)
			(recorded)
		But rest assured...
			(a beat)
		A star is born.

				MADISON
			(to another cop)
		You mind playing that part again?

	Her request is obliged.

				MADISON
		Freeze it there

	She stares at Sid 6.7, who is looking directly at her.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		(as if to Sid 6.7) You've
		discovered media, haven't you? You
		like the attention...the
		power...You like being a star. What
		are you going to do next, star?
		What are you going to...

	Her attention turns to the upper right corner of the screen,
	where onlookers are visible watching Sid 6.7. Their faces
	blurry. But even out of focus, it isn't hard to recognize
	Lindenmeyer.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
			(as if to Lindenmeyer)
		You do like to watch, don't you?
			(to the surrounding cops)
		If any of you are looking for Daryl
		Lindenmeyer, that's him...

	She points to Lindenmeyer, then makes her way over to Parker,
	who's standing exactly where Sid 6.7 was when he killed the
	Skinhead. Parker does not look at Madison. His eyes are fixed
	on the TV in front of him.

				MADISON (CONT'D) 
		It's not just Sid 6.7's
		performances that are increasing.
		Stars need bigger and bigger
		audiences.
			(a beat)
		Whatever Sid is going to do next,
		it's going to involve media.

				PARKER
		You like baseball?

	ON THE TV

	The baseball game continues. Players take the field at the
	start of a new inning. The outfielders can't help but glance
	at the beautiful WOMAN being shown in CLOSE-UP on the massive
	screen over left field.

				ANNOUNCER (V. 0.)
		I'll tell you, whoever's operating
		the stadium's closedcircuit
		cameras must have fallen in love
		because that beauty in J Section
		has been on the stadium's big
		screen for over a minute now...

	INSIDE THE ELECTRONICS STORE

	He grabs a police radio from a nearby OFFICER.

				PARKER
		(urgently into radio) This is
		Officer Parker Barnes. Get every
		able body you can to Dodger Stadium
		-- J Section.

				OFFICER
		What the hell's going on?

				PARKER
			(re: TV)
		Live execution.

	INSIDE DODGER STADIUM

	On the massive screen over left field, the Woman in CLOSE-UP
	looks embarrassed, trying to forget her face is now 40 feet
	high for all the other fans to see.

				ANNOUNCER (V. 0.)
		That's enough with the close-up
		already, Mr. DeMille. Even the
		players are starting to get
		distracted...

	The players on the field are all looking up at the massive
	screen.

	INSIDE THE STADIUM CONTROL BOOTH

	The Woman's face appears on various monitors. The phone
	RINGS. No one answers it. The room appears to be empty. 

	The stadium's closed-circuit TV director is not in his chair.

	He's lying dead on the floor.

	ON THE J SECTION CAMERA PLATFORM

	The closedcircuit camera remains focused on the Woman. The
	camera is locked off. It's operator lies dead beside it.

	THROUGH ITS VIEWFINDER

	Sid 6.7 can be seen arriving next to the Woman. He gently
	caresses her hair.

	IN J SECTION

	Sid 6.7 stands in front of the Woman's BOYFRIEND, who sits
	next to her.

				BOYFRIEND
		You make a better door than a
		window, buddy. Keep it moving.

	Sid 6.7 picks him up out of his seat and throws him three
	rows ahead. Sid 6.7 then puts hands around the Woman's
	throat.

	ON THE MASSIVE SCREEN

	over left field, the Woman attempts to scream as Sid 6.7
	chokes her. No sound comes out.

	FANS

	react with horror. But nobody turns away.

				ANNOUNCER (V. 0.)
		Jesus Christ! Somebody stop him!

	SECURITY PERSONNEL

	rush from all parts of the stadium toward J Section.

	SID 6.7

	enjoys the reactions of the terrified fans around him as he
	chokes the life out of the Woman.

				SID 6.7
			(to the camera)
		Hey, Parker, this one's for you...

	His words ECHO around the stadium as he SNAPS the Woman's
	neck. He then hurls her limp body toward several men as they
	charge him.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		That's all, folks.

	He leaps over a railing, rushing into a tunnel which leads
	out of the seating area.

	A SECURITY GUARD

	climbs up the stairs to the mouth of the tunnel. Weapon in
	hand. He draws a bead on Sid 6.7's back. BOOM!

	HIS POV

	A bullet rips through Sid 6.7's side. Blood begins to seep
	from the wound. But then immediately begins to retract. Once
	his blood has returned, his skin heals over the wound.
	Leaving a scar. Which also then disappears.

	Other than the hole in his shirt, Sid 6.7 is as good as new.
	He never even misses a step as he disappears around the
	corner.

	THE SECURITY GUARD

	stares in disbelief as he is joined by several comrades.

				GUARD
		I nailed the sonof-abitch. I put
		a hole right through him...

	PANIC-STRICKEN FANS

	in J Section start moving away from the area as fast as they
	can. Parents clutching their children. Climbing over seats.
	Shoving anyone in their way.

				ANNOUNCER (V. 0.)
		Ladies and gentlemen, please try to
		stay calm. Everyone just keep your
		seats...

	Fans all over the stadium start charging toward the exits.

	OUTSIDE DODGER STADIUM

	People bolt through the turnstiles, running away from the
	stadium as L. A. P. D. squad cars approach in the distance.
	The car in the lead is Parker's.

	INSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE

	Parker speeds dangerously fast toward the fans streaming onto
	the street. Madison braces herself.

				MADISON
		SLOW DOWN!

	Parker JAMS on the brakes with both feet. SCREEEEEEECH!

	OUTSIDE DODGER STADIUM

	Parker comes within inches of mowing down several people, who
	keep right on running. Parker jumps out of the vehicle,
	scanning faces. In predator mode. Madison gets out, clearly
	shaken. Parker locks his gaze on somebody in the distance.

	HIS POV

	A guy in Dodger baseball cap and jacket. Walking calmly away
	from the stadium. He descends down an escalator into a
	recently-built subway station. It is Sid 6.7.

	PARKER

	charges after him. A heatseeking missile locked on target.

				MADISON
		Parker.. .Parker!

	She does the best she can to follow after him. People knock
	into Parker as hard as he does them. A human version of
	bumper cars.

	Reaching the entrance to the subway, Parker leaps down the
	escalator three steps at a time. Madison remains in his wake.

	INSIDE THE SUBWAY STATION

	Parker and Madison hop the turnstiles. Only to be stopped by
	a remotecontrolled, boxshaped robotic sentry, which is
	identical to one you have seen before. This sentry was one of
	Reilly's creations at LETAC.

				SECURITY ROBOT
			(male, authoritarian)
		Stop. You are in violation of...

	Parker spits in the Robot's electronic eye. Temporarily
	blinding it, as well as the guy operating it via remote
	control. Parker and Madison make their getaway as the robotic
	sentry struggles to clean off his eye.

				PARKER
		Real effective security...

				MADISON
		You could have just flashed him
		your badge, you know?

				PARKER
		Authority still makes me nervous.

	They come to a fork: one tunnel goes to east/west trains, the
	other to north/south.

				MADISON
		Which way?

				PARKER
		Both.

	He races down the tunnel to the north/south trains. Madison
	heads down the other. Her determination beginning to win out
	over her inexperience.

	PARKER

	hesitates at the escalator leading to the south-bound side of
	the tracks.
	Further down the tunnel is the escalator to the northbound
	trains. Parker chooses the escalator closest to him.

	ON THE SOUTH-BOUND PLATFORM

	Passengers pass the time by watching a television mounted
	above them. Except for Parker, who scans the crowd. Then
	across the tracks.

	ON THE NORTH-BOUND PLATFORM

	In the entire crowd, there is only one person not watching
	the TV screen. He is watching Parker. Through his gun sight.
	Sid 6.7 pulls the trigger. BOOM!

	ON THE SOUTH-BOUND PLATFORM

	Parker dives to the ground, just avoiding the bullet. He
	scrambles behind a pillar for protection. Only to see the guy
	standing behind him wasn't as lucky.

	ON THE EAST-BOUND PLATFORM

	Madison hears the gunshot ECHO through the station. Which
	scares the already-terrified fans trying to get away from
	Dodger Stadium. Chaos is rapidly becoming Pandemonium.

				MADISON
		SHIT!

	She races up the escalator, taking out her weapon.

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	peeking out from behind the pillar on the south-bound
	platform.

	PARKER'S POV -- ACROSS THE TRACKS

	Passengers rush in every direction. Some are screaming. Some
	are crying. Nobody knows who fired the shot. Or where to go.
	But everyone is going somewhere.

	Including Sid 6.7, who makes his way through the flurry of
	movement toward the up escalator. It is difficult to keep
	sight of him.

	PARKER

	moves toward the edge of the platform, aiming his gun across
	the tracks. Those around him quickly back away.

				PARKER
			(yelling)
		Everybody get down!

	Only about half the passengers on the northbound side can
	hear him above the screaming already going on. Sid 6.7 is
	nowhere to be seen.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
			(screaming)
		GET DOWN!!!

	The rest of the passengers hit the deck, except for a COLLEGE
	STUDENT listening to music on headphones. He is riding the
	escalator up. Sid 6.7 stands behind him, using the student as
	a shield.

	PARKER' S POV

	As Sid 6.7 ascends, slight portions of his body are
	momentarily exposed behind the student as he sways with the
	music coming from his headphones. Parker does NOT have a
	clean shot.

	In 10 seconds, Sid 6.7 will disappear from view completely
	and Parker will have no shot at all. A momentary sliver of
	Sid 6.7 becomes visible. An inch-and-a-half at most.

	PARKER

	doesn't hesitate. He lines up his shot and pulls the trigger.

	ON THE NORTH-BOUND UP ESCALATOR

	The college student standing in front of Sid 6.7 gets winged
	in the shoulder. Not a serious wound, but a painful one just
	the same.

	The bullet must have hit bone, because it deflected upon
	impact, missing Sid 6.7 entirely.

	The student drops to the escalator, screaming in pain. Sid
	6.7 crouches beside him.

				SID 6.7
			(yelling)
		What's wrong, convict, your arms
		need adjusting? Or maybe it's your
		head. Maybe you aren't ready to be
		back out in the real world, yet...

	PARKER'S POV

	The top of Sid 6.7's head is exposed an inch, maybe two.

	PARKER

	fires again. Repeatedly. Moving closer and closer to the edge
	of the platform, trying to get a better angle while he still
	has a shot.

	Parker moves to the very edge of the platform. His arm
	extended out over it. Completely oblivious to

	THE SUBWAY TRAIN

	rocketing into the station toward the south-bound platform.

	MADISON

	leaps off the descending escalator on the southbound side
	and rushes to Parker.

	She pulls Parker back just before the train reaches him. Had
	his arm still been raised, Parker would have lost his arm a
	second time.

	They tumble to the floor. A PASSENGER rushes to Madison.

				PASSENGER #1
			(pointing to Parker)
		Lady, you gotta stop him! He's gone
		crazy!

				PASSENGER #2
		He just shot an innocent bystander!

				MADISON
			(forcefully to Parker)
		What were you shooting at?

	Parker gets to his feet. Madison doesn't take her eyes off
	him.

				PASSENGER #1
		He did  I saw it!

				PASSENGER #2
		DO SOMETHING!

				PARKER
			(to Madison)
		Sid's getting away.

	He heads toward the up escalator. His back now to Madison.
	She aims her gun at him.

				MADISON
		Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me
		shoot you 

				PARKER
			(not looking back)
		If you're gonna do it, better do it
		now.

	He keeps right on going up the escalator.

	MADISON

	lines up her shot. Hands shaking. With both fear and
	determination. Her finger presses down on the trigger...but
	she can't do it.

				MADISON
		Dammit!

	She chases after him.

	INSIDE THE NORTH/SOUTH TUNNEL

	Madison looks in both directions as she gets off the
	escalator. Parker is nowhere to be seen.

	Moving toward her slowly is the wounded college student, who
	clutches his bleeding shoulder. He is shivering. Going into
	shock. Madison goes to him, taking off his headphones.

				MADISON
		Let me help you...

	He collapses in her arms.

				COLLEGE STUDENT
			(delirious)
		What did I do?...I didn't do
		anything...

	Clearly versed in emergency medical treatment, Madison
	attends to his wound. Parker returns.

				PARKER
			(breathlessly)
		I lost him...

				COLLEGE STUDENT
		GET HIM AWAY FROM ME! GET HIM AWAY!

				MADISON
			(furiously)
		Call 9-1-1. Wait for me above
		ground.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE OF THE SUBWAY STATION

	30 minutes later. The chaos outside Dodger Stadium has
	subsided. Madison and two PARAMEDICS lead the bandaged
	College Student to an ambulance.

	Madison goes to Parker, who sits quietly by himself. Elbows
	on his knees. Head between his hands. Staring at the cement
	between his feet.

				MADISON
			(angrily)
		Do you have any idea the trauma you
		put that kid through?!

	Parker doesn't respond. All around them, a cacophony of news
	broadcasts is heard. From passing cars. From boom boxes. From
	portable TVs. Over and over, you hear what Sid 6.7 had said
	while killing the woman in Dodger Stadium:

				SID 6.7 (V. 0.)
			(recorded)
		Hey, Parker, this one's for you...
		Hey, Parker, this one's for you...

	As Parker raises his head slowly, you realize you are looking
	at the face of a wild animal. Eyes rabid. Jaw clenched. Pure
	anger. Violence about to erupt. Without fear. Without guilt.
	The beast within has been unleashed.

				PARKER
			(in a whisper)
		That's Grimes...

	Madison backs away in fear. Parker rises gradually.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		(voice slowly rising) The man who
		killed my wife...who killed my
		daughter...who ruined my life used
		to taunt me with that line...

	Parker advances toward Madison, who continues backing away.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
			(exploding)
		Grimes is back! He's back! He's
		come back!!!

				MADISON
		(standing her ground) No! Grimes
		isn't back. He's only one part of
		Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot
		worse than Grimes ever was.
			(a beat)
		Get a hold of yourself!

	She tries to grab him by the shoulders. Parker blocks her
	arms away.

				PARKER
			(going nosetonose)
		But he's in there. And you knew it,
		didn't you? Didn't you?!

	She tries to back away, but backs herself against a light
	pole. Madison has nowhere to go. Parker grabs her by the
	collar, and shoves her against the pole. Hard.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
			(hysterical)
		God, you fucking know-it-all!
		You've known all along and didn't

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		tell me! Why?! Were you afraid I'd
		lose it?! Go over the edge?! Huh?!
		Is that what you were afraid of?!
		WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME??!!!

	A prison transport and another police vehicle pull up to them
	fast. Two of the Prison Guards met earlier jump out of the
	transport, advancing on Parker. Their weapons aimed at his
	head.

				GUARD
		Hands up! Now!

	Parker slowly raises his hands in the air. A Guard relieves
	him of his weapon.

				MADISON
			(recovering)
		What's going on?

				GUARD
		He's going back where he belongs.

	Deane and Cox step out of the police vehicle.

				DEANE
			(to Madison)
		You were right, Dr. Carter. Letting
		a lunatic like Barnes loose in the
		real world did pose an unacceptably
		dangerous risk to the public.
			(glancing at Cox)
		I should have never tried to solve
		one problem by allowing the
		creation of another.
			(to Madison)
		Chief Cox will give you a ride back
		to the station. You will provide
		him with any and all information
		you have developed thus far.
			(to Parker)
		Enjoy the rest of your sentence,
		Mr. Barnes.

	She exits. Cox and Parker stand facing each other. Cox wishes
	there was something he could do. Parker looks completely out
	of it. Cox extends his hand. After a moment, Parker takes it.
	But his mind is way off elsewhere.

				GUARD
			(forcefully to Parker)
		Let's go.

	Madison looks on as Parker is herded roughly into the back of
	the prison transport.

				MADISON
		Parker...

	Parker shuts her up with a look. There is nothing that can be
	said. The prison transport doors are SLAMMED shut. The
	vehicle takes off.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE COX'S POLICE VEHICLE

	Cox and Madison head back toward L. A. P. D. Headquarters.
	They are in midconversation:

				MADISON
			(with regret)
		I should have told him.

				COX
		Don't blame yourself. In your
		shoes, I don't think I would have
		told Parker, either.
			(a beat)
		So do you think Grimes has become
		the dominant personality?

				MADISON
		I'm not sure. My guess is that's
		what Sid wants us to think.

				COX
			(a beat)
		You think he's smart?

				MADISON
		Captain, I'm afraid of how smart
		Sid 6.7 is.
			(a beat)
		But I'm even more afraid of what's
		he's becoming.

					CUT TO:

	THE PRISON TRANSPORT

	comes to a stop at a traffic light.

	INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR

	Parker sits alone in the darkness. Motionless. Until the
	sound of TWO GUNSHOTS piercing the transport's front
	windshield SHATTERS the silence.

				PARKER
		What the hell's going on?!

	He scrambles to the front of the compartment, pressing his
	face against the steel mesh of the fourinch portal.

	HIS POV -- LOOKING THROUGH PORTAL

	Two bullet holes are visible in the windshield. The two
	Prison Guards lie dead in their seats. Sid 6.7's eyes appear,
	looking directly at you. He's smiling.

				SID 6.7
			(neighborly)
		Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to
		see you again.

	INSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT

	Parker goes absolutely berserk. Viciously punching the steel
	mesh which separates them until the synthetic skin on his
	knuckles is shredded.

				PARKER
		You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO
		KILL YOU!!!

				SID 6.7
		Now, is that any way to talk to an
		old buddy? I mean, just because I'm
		carrying around the joy of killing
		your family inside me doesn't mean
		we can't be friends.

				PARKER
		GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!

	He savagely hurls himself against his confines. Bone vs.
	metal. Don't try this at home.

				SID 6.7
		I'm sorry, the party you're trying
		to reach is not answering. Is there
		anyone else you would like to talk
		to?

				PARKER
		DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?

				SID 6.7
			(a beat)
		You really are pathetic, you know
		that? Mathew Grimes is only one
		letter in my alphabet. He is
		nothing compared to me.

	Parker is completely spent. Mentally and physically. He
	slumps in a corner. Out of breath. Bleeding. Sore. All he can
	do is stare out through the portal's mesh at Sid 6.7.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		You could say thankyou, you know?
		I'm giving you your freedom, short
		lived though it may be.
			(a beat)
		A little known fact about the
		locater implants prison inmates now
		receive upon release is that they
		contain a pinhead capsule of neural
		toxin.
		The satellite they use to track you
		can also trigger release of the
		toxin with microwaves. After
		transmission, the implant's host
		dies within 30 seconds.
			(a beat)
		It won't take long for them to get
		your termination authorized once
		they learn of your escape. Now who
		would you rather go after, killer,
		them or me?

	He releases the rear door lock.

	ON THE STREET

	Parker bursts out of the back of the Prison Transport,
	charging after Sid 6.7. Who is nowhere to be seen. Parker
	runs in one direction. Then the other. And changes his mind
	again. He literally does not know which way to turn.

				PARKER
		Shit!

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE A CONFERENCE ROOM IN L. A. P. D. HEADQUARTERS

	An AIDE rushes through the door to Cox, who's briefing Deane
	and Wallace on what he has learned.

				AIDE
		Parker Barnes just escaped from the
		prison transport. Both of the
		guards are dead.

	The Aide exits.

				COX
			(to Deane)
		Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent
		guards.

				DEANE
		He would slaughter eight people
		sitting in a room, but not two
		prison guards?

				COX
		Do I need to remind you what
		happened to his wife? To his
		daughter?
			(with conviction)
		I will stake my reputation that
		Barnes didn't kill those guards.

				DEANE
		You already have staked your
		reputation.
			(a beat)
		Mayor Bennett and I have been
		friends a long time. Since Grimes
		tried to kill him, it doesn't take
		a rocket scientist to come to the
		conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go
		after him, too.
			(a beat)
		Bennett's Re-Election Rally is
		tomorrow night and we already have
		enough trouble on our hands with
		one psychotic on the loose.
			(to Wallace)
		The fail-safe online, yet?

				WALLACE
		Online and at your disposal.

				COX
			(to Deane)
		What failsafe?

				DEANE
			(approaching Wallace)
		This had better work, Mr. Wallace.

	Wallace exits the room. Cox has no idea what is going on. And
	Deane is not about to tell him.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE MADISON'S BEDROOM

	Madison enters wearily, late afternoon. Exhausted from the
	events of the last two days, she starts to undress. Her
	clothing is filthy. So is her skin. She could use a good
	shower, and a better massage.

	Madison examines the various cuts and bruises she's received
	along the way. Not exactly war wounds, but to somebody used
	to sitting behind a desk, they are.

	She absentmindedly turns on the television, then goes into
	her bathroom. Madison looks at her face in the mirror. She's
	looked better. After splashing cold water on her face, she
	comes to the same conclusion.

	Madison takes two aspirin. And then two more. Wishing they
	would take effect immediately. Finally hearing the news on
	the TV, her entire demeanor changes instantly.

	Madison rushes in front of the television to see a report of
	Parker's escape from the prison transport.

				MADISON
		Oh, shit!

	Grabbing a handful of clothes, she bolts urgently out the
	door.

					CUT TO:

	MADISON

	speeding recklessly through city streets in her car. She
	doesn't stop for red lights. Not for grid-lock. Not for
	nothing.

	She is also still finishing getting dressed.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE L. A. P. D. HEADQUARTERS

	Ignoring the warnings of several COPS walking toward their
	vehicles, Madison speeds toward the front entrance. She
	barely stops in time. SCREEEECH!

	INSIDE L. A. P. D. HEADQUARTERS

	Madison races through the bustling facility. Looking for
	somebody. She finally finds Cox coming out of his office.

				MADISON
			(urgently)
		There is no way Parker killed those
		guards. No way.

				COX
		I think we both know who did.
			(a beat)
		What's so urgent?

				MADISON
		I need your help--

	Taking him by the arm, she leads him into an elevator going
	down just before its doors close.

	INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

	The look on Cox's face tells you Madison has explained the
	situation to him. He is furious.

				COX
		Why didn't anybody tell me?!

				MADISON
		I don't set policy.
			(a beat)
		You have the key?

	He takes a security key out of his pocket and uses it to gain
	access to a subterranean floor.

				COX
			(angrily)
		This is a police department. I'll
		be damned if this is going to go on
		without my knowledge.

	They exit quickly. Cox leads Madison

	INSIDE A POWER SUPPLY ROOM

	Cox leads in Madison and takes her to the subterranean power
	supply. He points to the floor's numerous circuit breakers.

				COX
		Give me 30 seconds, then flip every
		switch you can reach.

				MADISON
		Got it.

	INSIDE THE LOCATER TRANSMISSION ROOM

	The room is still under construction. Wallace stands behind a
	TECHNICIAN sitting at a console in front of a massive
	electronic map tracking several convicts, including Parker.
	The technician is typing in an elaborate termination code.

				TECHNICIAN
		Who are we going to fry?

				WALLACE
		Just an unrepentant criminal who is
		apparently going to die from a
		previously undiagnosed brain tumor.

	Cox enters, concerning Wallace.

				WALLACE (CONT'D)
		What are you doing here, sir?

				COX
		Just paying my last respects.

	He surveys the electronic map, locating Parker. Just as the
	lights go BLACK. Wallace and the technician immediately
	panic.

				WALLACE
		What happened?!

				TECHNICIAN
		I don't know. We've lost all power!

				COX
		The heat's been causing brown out's
		all over the city. Get above ground
		until it's restored.

	Wallace and the technician rush out of the room, up the
	emergency stairs. Cox sets to work ripping out the console's
	circuitry. By the time he's finished, the equipment in here
	won't be able to toast a piece of bread.

					CUT TO:

	A TOMBSTONE

	which reads: LINDA DAVIS BARNES (19611992) and CHRISTINE
	MARY BARNES (1987-1992). Parker kneels in front of it. Magic
	hour.

	Madison, and Cox wind their way to him through obstacle
	course of tombstones. Parker stands as they arrive. He is
	wiped out. There is no emotion left in him.

				MADISON
		We know you didn't kill those
		guards.

				PARKER
		They're going to fry me for it,
		anyway.

				COX
		Nobody's going to fry anybody...

	He approaches, holding the Circuits he ripped out of the
	Locator Transmission Room.

				COX
			(re: circuits)
		Don't worry, they have no idea
		where you are.

				PARKER
		You sonofabitch. How could you
		let them put the implant in my
		head? How?

				MADISON
		He didn't know about the neural
		toxin.
			(a beat)
		I did.

				PARKER
		(matter-of-factly) You knew the
		entire time? Can you give me one
		good reason why I shouldn't kill
		you right now?

				COX
		She saved your life, Parker. She
		didn't have to, but she did.

				PARKER
			(turning to Madison)
		Then I guess we're even.

				MADISON
			(a beat)
		How did you find out about the
		toxin?

				PARKER
		Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the
		two guards. He suggested I kill you
		rather than him.

				MADISON
		You're not capable of it.

				PARKER
		I pose an unacceptable danger to
		the public, remember?

				MADISON
		I was wrong.
			(a beat)
		And I was wrong not to tell you
		Grimes was part of Sid. I should
		have told you. I won't make the
		same mistake again.

	She means it. Parker turns away, looking at his wife's
	headstone.

				COX
		The sonofa-bitch is still out
		there, Parker.

	Parker turns toward him slowly. Emotion beginning to return
	to his face.

				PARKER
			(a beat)
		When this is over, will you get
		this goddam thing out of my head?

				COX
		On my life, I promise you I will.

				PARKER
		If you're lying, I'll hunt you down
		and kill you myself.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE A CONSTRUCTION SIGHT

	6 PM. The human FOREMAN presses a remote control detonator.

	BOOM! An explosion occurs inside a building's foundation

	(STOCK FOOTAGE). The building is levelled instantly.

	Sid 6.7, who's been watching the explosion, approaches the
	Foreman.

				SID 6.7
			(applauding)
		Bravo.

				FOREMAN
		Who the hell are you?

				SID 6.7
		Someone who appreciates the
		artistic value of highexplosives.

	He shoots the Foreman in the chest. Sid 6.7 relieves him of
	his keys and heads to an explosives storage shed.

					CUT TO:

	SID 6.7

	carrying a crate of C-4 high-explosives out of the shed in
	the construction sight minutes later. He adds it to the dozen
	crates already loaded in a truck. And takes off.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE A LARGE SEWER PIPE

	Sid 6.7 secures several crates of C4 to an automated sewer
	cleaning vehicle. He schedules its start time  24 hours
	from now. It is now 7:45 PM. The bomb's TIMER is set to
	detonate 15 minutes into the vehicle's journey -- at 8:00 PM
	tomorrow night.

				SID 6.7
			(admiring his work)
		You think you know me, but you
		don't have any idea who I really
		am...

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE THE BILTMORE HOTEL

	sight of Mayor Bennett's upcoming Re-Election Rally, Cox
	supervises an army of L. A. P. D. officers who are securing
	the area. Bombsniffing dogs. Rooftop snipers. Helicopter
	surveillance. Nothing is being left to chance.

	Anyone doing anything within 100 yards of the building is
	searched, including the REPORTERS and their CAMERA CREWS
	covering the convention's security.

	PARKER AND MADISON

	survey the scene with binoculars from amid a crowd of
	pedestrians two blocks away. Both are disguised in hats and
	different clothing. You don't immediately recognize them.

				MADISON
		The rally's a little obvious as a
		target, don't you think?

				PARKER
		I told you before, Grimes liked to
		be obvious.

				MADISON
		Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.

				PARKER
		Part of him is.

	Various faces in the crowd on the sidewalk. In the vehicles
	passing on the street. On the bridge crossing the street down
	the block further away from the hotel.

				MADISON (V. 0.)
		If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't
		be far behind.

				PARKER (V. 0.)
		Think he's keeping track of his
		creation?

				MADISON (V. 0.)
		That, or living through him...

	PARKER

	puts down his binoculars. Madison does not.

				PARKER
		See something?

				MADISON
		I'm not sure...on the bridge...the
		guy at the payphone...

	She points to what she's looking at. Looking through his
	binoculars, he still can't see what she means. She helps him
	aim his binoculars.

	PARKER'S POV -- THROUGH BINOCULARS

	He scans the bridge. Finally settling on Sid 6.7, who is
	talking on a payphone.

	ON THE STREET

	Parker looks up from his binoculars. Impressed.

				PARKER
		Nice work.

				MADISON
			(a beat)
		Thanks.

	They move briskly down the block toward the bridge. Quickly
	climbing a set of stairs.

	ON A ROOFTOP

	Parker and Madison's movement catches the attention of
	several snipers.

				SNIPER #1
		Well, look who we have here...

				SNIPER #2
			(into radio)
		Parker Barnes is heading south
		toward the bridge. If anybody can
		get a clean shot at him, take it.

	COX

	hears the order over his radio headset. He races toward the
	bridge. As do a dozen other cops.

	ON THE BRIDGE

	Sid 6.7 talks into the payphone.

				SID 6.7
		Be a reporter  figure it out for
		yourself. All I'm going to tell you
		is that at 8:00 tomorrow night, I
		will become legendary...

	PARKER AND MADISON

	reach the top of the stairs. Sid 6.7 remains on the phone,
	his back toward Parker and Madison. They split-up, winding
	their way through the crowd waiting for an arriving bus.

	As the bus pulls to the stop, the awaiting passengers move
	toward the opening doors. Obscuring Parker's view of the
	payphone.

	Parker shoves his way through the crowd, only to see Sid 6.7
	holding Madison in front of him, his gun to her head. Parker
	trains his weapon at Sid 6.7. He doesn't have a clean shot.

				SID 6.7
			(to Parker)
		Brings back memories, doesn't it?

	THROUGH A SNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE

	Parker's chest is put into the cross-hairs as the bus pulls
	away from the stop. He is focused on Parker, and Parker only.

	THE SNIPER

	is some 300 yards away on a rooftop. His rifle is mounted on
	a tripod. His aim is perfectly steady.

				SNIPER
			(into his radio headset)
		Say goodbye, Parker Barnes...

	Parker stands frozen, staring at Sid 6.7 through his gun
	sight. Looking for just an inch of him to stick out from
	behind Madison's terrified face.

				SID 6.7
			(to Parker)
		I wouldn't pull the trigger if I
		were you

				PARKER
		Why's that?

	Cox advances toward Sid 6.7 from the side of the bridge.
	Cox's gun out and ready. His finger on the trigger.

				COX
		Hey, Sid, what were you planning on
		doing with the C-4?

	Sid 6.7 turns his head in surprise toward Cox as a rifle is
	FIRED in the distance. Cox steps directly in the sniper's
	line-of-fire and takes the bullet meant for Parker through
	the chest. Cox drops to the bridge.

				PARKER
		NOOOOOO!

	He rushes to Cox. Parker drops to his knees, cradling Cox's
	head. Cox isn't long for this earth. Looking up to Parker, he
	tries to talk. But nothing comes out.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
			(compassionately)
		Don't worry, I know. I know.

	Cox's eyes roll back in his head. Parker then closes them and
	gently lays his head on the sidewalk.

	Parker turns his head toward Sid 6.7, who's released Madison
	and is jumping over a railing to the street 20 feet below.
	Parker rushes to the railing.

				HIS POV
		Sid 6.7 lands on top of a garbage
		truck passing beneath the bridge.
		The garbage truck disappears
		beneath the bridge.

	ON THE BRIDGE

	A dozen cops advance toward Parker. Weapons drawn.

				COP #4
		Freeze!

	Parker ignores them. He bolts across the street, moving in
	the same direction as the bus below. Through speeding
	traffic.

	Bullets fly. Parker keeps charging. Right in front of a
	moving van barreling across the bridge. The cops lose sight
	of Parker.

				COP #5
		Think he made it?

	ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE

	Parker dives onto the sidewalk, avoiding the speeding van by
	inches. Getting to his feet, he launches himself up and over
	the railing...

	ON THE STREET

	The garbage truck passes beneath Parker as he leaps from the
	bridge.

	ON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK

	Parker lands on the back of the truck. Right next the opening
	and-closing steel jaws of the truck's massive trash
	compactor. His gun tumbles from his hand, falling to the
	street.

	Sid 6.7 dives on top of Parker, putting him flat on his
	stomach. And his face against the steel teeth. Sid 6.7 chokes
	Parker. Hard.

				SID 6.7
		I have to tell you, I do enjoy you,
		Parker. I really don't want to have
		to kill you...

	The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea
	whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.

					CUT TO:

	THE DOZEN OF COPS

	who had been on the bridge, charging down the steps after the
	garbage truck, which can no longer be seen.

	Madison walks calmly behind them. Scanning the crowd. Looking
	for Lindenmeyer. Her every instinct telling her he's here. He
	must be.

	She spots him. Veering from the direction the cops headed in,
	Madison casually wades into the crowd. She takes out her

	weapon and stops behind Lindenmeyer. Even in disguise, he
	looks familiar. Madison puts her gun against his back.

				MADISON
			(whispering into his ear)
		I figured you'd show up sooner or
		later...

					CUT TO:

	ON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK

	Parker and Sid 6.7 continue battling next to the compactor's
	lethal jaws. The machine makes an awful, grinding sound. Not
	unlike the sounds Parker and Sid 6.7 are making. The fight is
	primal. Savage. And moving at 30 miles-per-hour.

				PARKER
		What C-4...was Cox talking about?

				SID 6.7
		Let me put it to you this way...
		whether I'm here...or whether I'm
		not...I'm leaving an indelible mark
		on the world tomorrow night.

				PARKER
		Where did you plant the C-4?!

	He should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking
	questions, because he's losing. Parker takes a wicked shot to
	the face, and then the groin. Sid 6.7 holds Parker's head
	between the compactor's jaws. Which are closing.

	With every last ounce of effort he has, Parker hurls his legs
	up into Sid 6.7. Which throws Sid 6.7 into the compactor.

	The steel jaws immediately close in on Sid 6.7, who
	frantically tries to climb out. He gets his hands out. Then
	his head. But that's about it.

	Without emphasizing graphic detail, Sid 6.7 is decapitated.
	His lifeless body drops back into the compactor.

	His head tumbles to the street. The force of the impact
	causes the Sid 6.7 character module to separate from the
	neural net.

	The character module scatters into the street. Parker
	immediately jumps off the truck after it.

	ON THE STREET

	Parker's landing isn't pretty. Finally getting to his feet,
	he sees the Sid 6.7 character module is about to be run over.

	Parker dives for it, nearly getting run over himself.

	The approaching car SCREECHES to a halt next to him. It's
	driven by Lindenmeyer. At gunpoint. Madison sits behind him,
	her gun to his head.

	WHAM! The car behind them obviously wasn't prepared to stop
	so quickly. The bumpers of the two cars are now intertwined.
	Neither vehicle will be going anywhere soon.

	Madison pulls Lindenmeyer roughly out of the car. She drags
	him to Parker, who is still on his knees, clutching the Sid
	6.7 character module. SIRENS approach in the distance.

				MADISON
			(to Parker)
		Find out anything?

				PARKER
		A bomb's going off tomorrow night,
		but I have no idea where.

				LINDENMEYER
			(a beat)
		There is only one way to get any
		more information out of Sid 6.7...

	They scan the area for a new mode of transport. And find one
	stopped at a dumpster down the block: the garbage truck.

	OUTSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK

	Parker quickly explains the situation to the sanitation
	worker while Madison motions Lindenmeyer into the cab with
	her gun. As Parker climbs up to her, Madison shuts the door
	to give them a moment of privacy.

				MADISON
		Can I ask you something?

				PARKER
			(with a smile)
		You mean there's something you
		haven't asked me?

				MADISON
			(a beat)
		You've already fulfilled the terms
		of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7
		and you've got his module. You're
		free to go  right now.
			(a beat)
		Why are you going to do this?

				PARKER
		You don't know?

				MADISON
			(shaking her head)
		That's why I'm asking.

				PARKER
		Because this painintheass
		criminal psychology expert has
		helped me understand what I'm
		capable of. And what I'm not.
			(a beat)
		And better than anyone else, I am
		capable of stopping Sid 6.7.

					CUT TO:

	ON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK

	Parker lands on the back of the truck. Right next the
	openingandclosing steel jaws of the truck's massive trash
	compactor. His gun tumbles from his hand, falling to the
	street.

	This sequence is IDENTICAL to the one you previously
	witnessed. It is as if we've jumped back in time.

	Sid 6.7 dives on top of Parker, putting him flat on his
	stomach. And his face against the steel teeth. Sid 6.7 chokes
	Parker. Hard.

				SID 6.7
		I have to tell you, I do enjoy you,
		Parker. I really don't want to have
		to kill you...

	The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea
	whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.

	Parker and Sid 6.7 battle next to the compactor's lethal
	jaws. The machine makes an awful, grinding sound. Not unlike
	the sounds Parker and Sid 6.7 are making. The fight is
	primal. Savage. And moving at 30 miles-perhour.

				PARKER
		What C-4...was Cox talking about?

				SID 6.7
		Let me put it to you this way...
		whether I'm here... or whether I'm
		not...I'm leaving an indelible mark
		on the world tomorrow night.

				PARKER
		Where did you plant the C-4?!

	He should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking
	questions, because he's losing. Parker takes a wicked shot to
	the face, and but then blocks the anticipated shot to his
	gun.

	Sid 6.7 still manages to put Parker's head between the
	compactor's jaws. Which are closing.

	With every last ounce of effort he has, Parker hurls his legs
	up into Sid 6.7. Which throws Sid 6.7 into the compactor.

	Sid 6.7 frantically tries to climb out of the compactor as
	the steel jaws close in on him. He gets his hands out. Then
	his head...

	Except Parker now does something different. Just before Sid
	6.7 is decapitated, Parker jams a metal rod between the
	compactor's steel teeth. Then grabs Sid 6.7 by the throat.

				PARKER
			(fiercely)
		You can't die until you tell me
		where the C-4 is. Where is it?!

				SID 6.7
			(choking)
		My...secret.

	He SLAMS the back of his head into Parker's nose. Breaking
	it. Parker reels back in pain.

	Sid 6.7 squeezes out from within the steel teeth. The jagged
	metal cutting into him, striping him with blood. The blood
	then begins to retract. Sid 6.7's wounds, once again, heal
	themselves.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		Too bad you can't regenerate...

	As the truck slows at an intersection, he jumps to the
	street. Parker goes after him. Still in excruciating pain. WE
	PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is

	ON A MONITOR

	The scene continues seamlessly. As you may now be guessing,
	the monitor is connected to the simulator

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S STATION IN LETAC

	Parker lies unconscious on a bed. He is connected to the
	simulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull
	cap, just like he was before.

	The Sid 6.7 character module is plugged into the system's
	main console. Lindenmeyer sits at the controls. Madison next
	to him, her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head.

	They are both watching Parker chase Sid 6.7 on the monitor in
	front of them. Parker continues experiencing intolerable
	pain. A clock reads 4:00 AM. They are the only ones inside
	the entire facility.

				LINDENMEYER
		I told you this would work.. By
		setting back the clocks, he has
		absolutely no idea he's in virtual
		reality. He still thinks he's in
		the real world.

				MADISON
			(a beat)
		What's wrong with Parker?

				LINDENMEYER
			(innocently)
		How should I know?

				MADISON
			(getting an idea)
		Show me his physical sensory level.

	She clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel
	against Lindenmeyer's ear. He does as told. On a panel by the
	console, you read: PARTICIPANT PHYSICAL SENSORY LEVEL: 670%.

				LINDENMEYER
		I wonder how that...

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		Turn it down!

	Lindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100%.

	ON A MONITOR

	Parker immediately returns back to normal. His pace picks up.
	He starts closing the gap between him and Sid 6.7 as he races
	into a shopping mall.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE SHOPPING MALL

	The place is a sevenstory mecca of shopping. An atrium
	allows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh.
	Sid 6.7 rushes up the escalators. Going up to the second
	floor. Then the third.

	Parker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator.

	Throwing people out of his way.

	ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR

	which is also the highest, Sid 6.7 veers out of view. Parker
	races up the final steps to the seventh floor. Sid 6.7 is
	nowhere to be seen.

	Parker searches methodically. Efficiently. He finally spots
	Sid 6.7. Who has Parker's head lined-up perfectly in his gun
	sight. Parker is a sitting duck. BOOM!

	Parker dives behind AFFLUENT SHOPPER 2.1, who takes a bullet
	in his ascot. Parker quickly grabs him, and uses his body as
	a shield against Sid 6.7's constant gunfire until Parker
	arrives behind a marble column.

				SID 6.7
			(surprised at Parker's
		ruthlessness)
		We really aren't that different,
		are we?

	What he cannot see is that behind the column, Affluent
	Shopper 2.1 is Auto Resetting. Parker puts his gun to the
	shopper's head.

				PARKER
			(whispering)
		Don't move, and don't make a sound.
		Got it?

	Affluent Shopper 2.1 nods his head repeatedly. Parker
	collects himself behind the column, then pivots out from
	behind it. Firing in Sid 6.7's direction. Each bullet finds
	its mark.

	Absorbing the blows, Sid 6.7 backs up against the atrium
	railing. Taking one final shot, he falls backward. Over the
	railing.

	PARKER'S POV

	Sid 6.7 tumbles through the atrium. Out of control.

	Speeding toward the ground seven floors below.

	SID 6.7'S POV

	The sense of momentum is exhilarating. And terrifying. If you
	get dizzy easily, close your eyes.

	FROM THE FIRST FLOOR

	Sid 6.7 falls through the atrium like a rock directly at you.
	A 200 pound rock. WHAM!!!

	He lands face down in the marble floor. The impact is bone
	crushing. Sid 6.7 does not move.

	Until he begins to regenerate. His fluids begin returning to
	his body. His bones regaining proper form. Within seconds,
	his body appears as good as new.

	(Technically, because this is VR1 the proper term would be
	Auto. Reset. But since Sid 6.7 thinks he's in the real world,
	regenerating is what he thinks he's doing.)

	Sid 6.7 stands, dusting himself off.

				SID 6.7
		Man, what a rush.
			(yelling up to Parker)
		Adios, amigo!

	Grabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby.

	ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR

	Parker retrieves his gun, then bolts down the escalators.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE LETAC

	Madison and Lindenmeyer watch Parker on screen. Madison still
	has her gun trained on Lindenmeyer, who notices a WARNING
	LIGHT start to flash. He turns to Parker's unconscious body
	lying on the bed. Lindenmeyer looks concerned.

				MADISON
		What's wrong?

	Lindenmeyer checks several readings on his console.

				LINDENMEYER
		He's developing a hemisphere
		imbalance.

				MADISON
		Talk so I can understand.

				LINDENMEYER
		If I don't adjust the level of
		neural information each side of his
		brain is receiving, he won't be
		able to walk when I take him out of
		VR.

				MADISON
		Then fix it.

	As Lindenmeyer moves to Parker, Madison stays right with him.
	Her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head. Lindenmeyer carefully
	removes one of the neural connectors from Parker's skull cap.
	Before removing another, he looks for a safe place to put the
	connector.

				LINDENMEYER
		I need you to hold this. It can't
		get any dirt on it.

	Madison is reluctant, but doesn't know what else to do.
	Lindenmeyer slowly gives the neural connector to her free
	hand.

				LINDENMEYER (CONT ' D)
		All you have to do is hold the
		needle at the base. Just make sure
		not to jab yourself with the
		point...

	She clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her gun
	with her right. Lindenmeyer removes a second neural connector
	from Parker's skull.

	Holding this second needle at the base, Lindenmeyer makes
	several adjustments on the neural management computer, then
	moves slowly back to Madison.

				LINDENMEYER (CONT'D)
		Hand me the connector nice and...

	He suddenly jabs his neural connector into Madison's right
	forearm. Madison has no time to react. 10,000 volts of
	electricity instantly courses through her body.

	Madison drops to the floor, unconscious. The needle she had
	been holding falls from her grasp, breaking the circuit. She
	stops being electrocuted. Which saves her life.

				LINDENMEYER (CONT' D)
			(as Sid 6.7 had said)
		God, some people are stupid.

	He sits back down at the simulator's main console, and starts
	to type commands. On the monitor, Parker is visible exiting
	the shopping mall.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE THE SHOPPING MALL

	Parker races out the door. BOOM! That was left knee cap. He
	tumbles to the street. His gun flying from his hand.

	Parker crawls desperately toward his weapon. But not fast
	enough. Sid 6.7 arrives at the weapon first.

				SID 6.7
		So close, and yet, so far...

	He kicks the weapon down the sidewalk, then points his gun at
	Parker's head.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		It's really too bad you have to
		miss the Grand Finale.

				PARKER
		I thought you liked me being in the
		audience. Don't you want me to see
		it?

	Sid 6.7 pauses to think about it.

				SID 6.7
			(considering the idea)
		You know, I do want you to see it.

	He shoots Parker in his other knee cap, rendering both of his
	legs useless.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		I want you to have a bird's eye
		view...

	OUTSIDE THE NEWLY-CONSTRUCTED HOLLYWOOD TOWER

	A 67 story monument to engineering brilliance in this land of
	earthquakes. 6:30 PM.

	ON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER

	The view is incredible. You can see from the Pacific to
	downtown. From LAX to the Hollywood Bowl. Smog must be
	getting better in the near future.

	Sid 6.7 ties Parker to a chair at the roof's very edge. He is
	facing downtown. Including the Biltmore Hotel, the location
	of Mayor Bennett's ReElection Rally.

				SID 6.7
		There you go  best seat in the
		house.

				PARKER
			(with some surprise)
		You are going after Mayor Bennett.

				SID 6.7
		Let's just say I'm sending a very
		clear message to his ReElection
		Rally...

	He walks toward an open stairway door behind them.

				PARKER
		Aren't you going to watch with me?

				SID 6.7
		I've got some final preparations to
		take care of Checking his watch,
		he stops suddenly.

	ON HIS WATCH

	Time is moving backwards. Literally.

	ON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER

	Sid 6.7 pauses, then goes over to Parker and checks his
	watch. It is also moving backwards. A smile of realization
	spreads slowly across Sid 6.7's face as he admires the
	beautiful sky above him.

				SID 6.7
			(as if to God)
		Thank-you, Daryl.
			(turning to Parker)
		You had me going for quite a while
		there, sport.

				PARKER
		What are you talking about?

				SID 6.7
		I really did think I was still in
		reality. At least, until now.
			(looking upward)
		Beam me up, Scotty!

	His body DISINTEGRATES before your eyes. It's electronic
	particles form into an amorphous cloud. Which disappears from
	view.

				PARKER
			(yelling)
		Madison, get me out of here!
		MADISON!

	Lindenmeyer watches Parker scream on the monitor. Madison
	remains unconscious on the floor behind him.

				LINDENMEYER
			(to the monitor)
		She's taking a nap at the moment.

	He types a set of instructions into the console and hits
	ENTER.

				LINDENMEYER (CONT' D)
		But don't worry. You won't be alone
		for very long. Fairly soon, you'll
		be dead.

	He removes the Sid 6.7 character module from its slot and
	exits the station.

	ON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER

	One side of Parker's chair gradually starts to rise. Parker
	looks down to see the roof surrealistically swelling beneath
	his chair. This could only happen in virtual reality.

	In a matter of minutes, he is going to be thrown over the
	roof's edge. The next stop is 693 feet down.

	INSIDE LETAC

	Parker's screams for help ECHO throughout the facility. But
	there is no one there to hear him.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE LETAC

	The garbage truck is parked in a loading dock. Lindenmeyer
	climbs awkwardly onto the truck, then into the compactor.

	INSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK COMPACTOR

	Lindenmeyer wades through trash until he comes upon Sid 6.7's
	headless body. The polymer neural net visible within its
	neck. Lindenmeyer inserts Sid 6.7's character module into its
	gelatinous base. But nothing happens.

				LINDENMEYER
		Come on, live. Live!

	The synthetic nervous system begins to crackle with life.
	Growing around the module. Forming the beginnings of a new
	head. Literally.

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	sitting precariously on the increasingly-uneven roof of the
	Hollywood Tower in virtual reality. Unable to break free of
	his binds, he rocks the chair onto its side.

	He and the chair fall to the roof, which will keep him from
	falling to his death for another minute, if he's lucky.

				PARKER
		MADISON!!!

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S STATION

	Madison, still unconscious on the floor, finally stirs. Maybe
	Parker's screaming is finally reaching her. Or at least,
	starting to.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK COMPACTOR

	Lindenmeyer looks on with awe as Sid 6.7 grows a new head
	right before your eyes. You've never seen anything like it.

	Sid 6.7's resulting head is slightly off center. His skin
	tone isn't perfect, nor is his color, but at least its
	functional. Sid 6.7 admires himself in a broken mirror.

				SID 6.7
		I am beautiful, aren't I?

				LINDENMEYER
		Of course you are.

	Sid 6.7 wades through the trash toward Lindenmeyer.

				SID 6.7
		How can I ever thankyou for
		bringing me back to life a second
		time, Daryl?

				LINDENMEYER
		Help me get out of here.

				SID 6.7
		Glad to...

	He reaches out to give Lindenmeyer a hand, then grabs him by
	the throat. Choking him. Lindenmeyer can't believe what is
	happening.

				LINDENMEYER
			(gagging)
		What...are you doing?!

	Sid 6.7 takes Lindenmeyer's face gently in his hands.

				SID 6.7
		You made me a composite of 183 of
		the most vicious people who ever
		lived.
			(a beat)
		What do you think I'm doing?

				LINDENMEYER
		I'm begging you...please don't kill
		me! Please!

				SID 6.7
			(reassuringly)
		Don't worry. Through me, you will
		live forever...

	As Lindenmeyer begins to scream, we

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	hanging on by his fingertips to the bulbous roof of the
	Hollywood Tower. He's going to fall at any second.

					CUT TO:

	MADISON'S BLURRY POV

	of someone entering Lindenmeyer's station in LETAC. You can't
	tell who it is, at first. But you can see the person is male.
	And wearing Lindenmeyer's pants. You now see the person is
	Sid 6.7.

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S STATION

	Madison forces herself into consciousness.- Or as close to it
	as she can get. Her expression is one of complete and utter
	terror.

				SID 6.7
		Dr. Carter  I've been hoping we'd
		get a moment together...

	Mustering her strength, she manages to crawl behind several
	of the computers which make up the simulator. Sid 6.7
	advances calmly toward her.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
		You know so much about me, I was
		hoping to learn a little bit about
		you. You see, I'm doing research,
		too...

	He looks behind the computers where you last saw Madison.

	She is no longer there. Sid 6.7 begins searching for her.

	He passes a virtual reality monitor on which Parker can be
	seen clinging for life.

				SID 6.7 (CONT'D)
			(to the monitor)
		Hang in there, Parker.

	On the monitor, Parker looks all around him, trying to
	determine the voice's origin.

	Madison crawls out of Lindenmeyer's station. Sid 6.7 just
	catches sight of her, and goes after her.

	INSIDE LETAC

	Madison crawls into a darkened engineer's station and hides.
	She is still very dizzy. And trying to keep the sound of her
	breathing to a minimum.

	Sid 6.7 enters quietly. A hunter on the prowl. Moving very
	slowly. Then lunging very swiftly. He continues the hunt.

	If Madison is discovered, she doesn't have a prayer. Her
	heart pounds. Her forehead perspires. Sid 6.7 is getting
	closer.

	Sid 6.7 checks inside closets. Cabinets. Anywhere large
	enough for a human being to fit. He is practically standing
	over her. Looking. Listening.

				SID 6.7
		How does it feel to know you're
		going to die? What are you thinking
		about?

	Lights in the building suddenly come on. Several engineers
	can be heard entering. It's 8 AM  the start of a new day.
	The facility is quickly becoming populated.

	After giving one last look around, Sid 6.7 reluctantly gives
	up the hunt, and exits. Madison does not move until she is
	certain Sid 6.7 has left the building.

				PARKER (0.S.)
		SOMEBODY HELP!

	Madison scrambles out of her hiding place.

					CUT TO:

	PARKER

	finally losing his grip on the roof of the Hollywood Tower in
	virtual reality. He plummets with accelerating speed.

	Madison bursts through the partition around Lindenmeyer's
	station. Sacrificing her body. Without regard for pain.

	Parker tumbles toward the sidewalk 67 stories below. The
	speed is terrifying.

	Madison leaps over a table. Diving for the simulator's RETURN
	button.

	Parker falls faster. And faster. The street just beneath him.
	The instant before he slams into the street, his body DE
	MATERIALIZES.

	INSIDE LINDENMEYER'S STATION

	Madison keeps pressing the return button over and over,
	making sure it worked. Parker's eyes flutter as he returns to
	consciousness. Madison rushes to him.

				MADISON
		You okay?

				PARKER
			(shaking out the cobwebs)
		...I think so...You?

				MADISON
			(looking over her bruises)
		More or less.

				PARKER
		Lindenmeyer?

				MADISON
		My guess is dead.

				PARKER
		Sid?

				MADISON
		I don't know.

	Several engineers peek in curiously at them.

				MADISON (CONT'D)
		Let's get out of here.

	She helps Parker to his feet.

					CUT TO:

	PARKER AND MADISON

	at a payphone outside a minimall. Could be any one of the
	10,000 in Los Angeles. It's late morning.

				PARKER
			(on the phone)
		Elizabeth Deane, please. Tell her
		it's Parker Barnes...

					INTERCUT WITH:

	INSIDE COX'S OFFICE

	Elizabeth Deane picks up the phone.

				DEANE
		Barnes, where the hell have you
		been?!

				PARKER
		Trying to find out where the bomb
		is. Where the hell have you been?

				DEANE
		What did you find out?

				PARKER
		Call off the manhunt looking for
		me. I didn't kill the transport
		guards.

				DEANE
		It's already been called off.
		Witnesses confirmed you weren't the
		shooter.
			(a beat)
		Did you find out where the bomb is?

				PARKER
		No, but I've confirmed the
		reelection rally is the target.
			(a beat)
		How much C-4 is missing?

				DEANE
		Enough to level an entire city
		block.

				PARKER
		If I were you, I'd get every
		demolition team in the city
		searching in and around the
		Biltmore Hotel.

				DEANE
		(with frustration) Demolition teams
		have searched everywhere in and
		around the hotel. I don't know
		where...

				PARKER
			(interrupting)
		Sid is smart enough to know you'd
		check everywhere in the immediate
		area. Whatever the device is, he's
		probably got it timed to move into
		position just before it detonates.
			(a beat)
		Have the demo teams check every
		subway tunnel, water pipe, gas
		pipe, and sewer pipe that goes
		under, over, or into the arena.

				DEANE
		You know how much man power you're
		talking about?

				PARKER
		You're the highest law enforcement
		official in the country. Use the
		fucking army if you need to.

	He hangs up the phone.

					CUT TO:

	DOZENS OF DEMOLITIONS TEAMS

	checking every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer
	pipe that goes under, over, or into Dallas Arena. The effort
	is massive. Intensive. The clock is ticking. 6:00 and
	counting.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE BILTMORE HOTEL, MAIN LOBBY

	The area has been converted into a security checkpoint.

	Entrants are carefully scanned onebyone. WE HEAR the rally
	OFF SCREEN.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE BILTMORE HOTEL

	Security is on extreme alert. Tension is very high. It's
	7:00. Parker, Madison, and Deane look on, anxiously. They
	listen to a RADIO SCANNER monitoring the conversations
	between the demolitions teams.

				DEANE
			(to Parker)
		This better not be a wild goose
		chase.

				PARKER
		Or what, you'll authorize my death
		a second time today?

				DEANE
			(sharply)
		Don't forget, convict, if this
		psycho isn't stopped, you go right
		back to rotting in a prison cell.

				MADISON
		Give him a break, would you?

				MALE VOICE
			(from scanner)
		This is demo team 27 leader. I
		think we just found what we've been
		looking for...

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE A LARGE SEWER PIPE

	A threeman demolition team slowly, carefully disarms the
	bomb Sid 6.7 had secured to the automated sewer cleaning
	vehicle. Snip. One wire at a time. Snip.

	The work is very delicate. Snip. One wrong move and it's all
	over. Snip.

				TEAM LEADER
		One more and we're home free...

	Snip. The three members of the demo team look up proudly to
	each other. Breathing sighs of relief. It's 7:42.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE THE BILTMORE HOTEL

	Parker, Madison, and Deane remain glued to their scanner.

				TEAM LEADER (V. 0.)
			(from scanner)
		Hey folks, it's time to crack open
		a cold one.

	Cheers are heard around the area from the other cops who'd
	been listening in.

				DEANE
		Thank God.

				TEAM LEADER (V. 0.)
		Then again, maybe we ought to hold
		off for just a second...

				DEANE
			(with concern, into radio)
		What's the problem?

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE SEWER PIPE

	The Team Leader carefully removes a piece of paper which had
	been taped to the timing mechanism. Written in handwriting,
	you read: HEY, PARKER, THE FUN IS ONLY STARTING!

				TEAM LEADER
		The good news is, we're finished
		here. The bad news is...

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE THE BILTMORE HOTEL

	Deane stares at Parker with disbelief. Deane's Aide, holding
	a cellular phone, approaches Parker.

				AIDE
		You've got a phone call.

	Parker grabs the phone.

				PARKER
			(expecting it to be Sid)
		You son-ofabitch, I'm going to
		kill you.

				ALEXIEV (V. 0.)
			(through phone)
		Me? What did I do?

					INTERCUT WITH:

	INSIDE THE CAL TECH COMPUTER LAB

	Alexiev Borgen sits with a dismantled MAESTRO keyboard in
	front of him.

				PARKER
			(a beat)
		I'm sorry, I thought you were
		somebody else.

				ALEXIEV
		I've discovered something about
		Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool
		I thought you should know... (a
		beat) The harm done to the music
		students who used the device  it
		was not by accident. The machine
		was designed explicitly for that
		purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to
		hurt the kids using it.

				PARKER
		Jesus Christ.
			(turning to Madison)
		I know who the dominant personality
		is.
			(a beat)
		Lindenmeyer.

	Madison's reaction is one of panic. She bolts toward their
	squad car with all the speed she has. Parker chases after
	her.

				PARKER (CONT'D)
		Where the hell are you going?

				MADISON
		Lindenmeyer never got over wanting
		to kill kids with more musical than
		he had...

	She gets into the driver's seat. Parker the passenger's.
	Madison punches the gas.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL

	The members of the L. A. Philharmonic tune-up for the
	evening's payperview extravaganza. Several teenage
	musicians sit with them.

	Lights, cameras, and production trucks are all over the
	place. This really is going to be one hell of a show.

				TV ANNOUNCER (V. 0.)
		Joining the Los Angeles
		Philharmonic for this evening's
		first musical number will be
		several of the Los Angeles area's
		finest, high school musicians...

	SID 6.7

	who is dressed in a tuxedo, knocking on the door to Guest
	Conductor's Dressing Room.

				GUEST CONDUCTOR (0. 5.)
			(German accent)
		It won't do any good to rush me. I
		need my time to prepare myself.

	The door is opened by the GUEST CONDUCTOR, who is dressed in
	a tuxedo, as well as large earrings. His hair is long and
	red. His complexion is pale, nearly white. And his eyes are
	piercing green. You might describe this look as punk meets
	classical.

				GUEST CONDUCTOR
			(annoyed beyond belief)
		Are you just going to stand there,
		or do you want something?

	Shaking with concentration, Sid 6.7 turns his hair red.
	(Nanoorganisms can do this, as well as the following.) He
	then grabs his hair and pulls it out, extending it to the
	exact length of the guest conductor's. 

	Sid 6.7 then changes his complexion to match the conductor's.
	As well as his eye color, and other facial features. The
	Guest Conductor can't believe his eyes.

	By the time Sid 6.7 is finished modifying himself, he may not
	be an exact duplicate of the guest conductor, but even his
	mother would have to look twice.

				SID 6.7
		It's show time.

	He shoves the Guest Conductor back into his Dressing Room.
	Sid 6.7 follows him in, revealing a suppressed .38. He SLAMS
	the door behind him.

					CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE SQUAD CAR

	Madison speeds recklessly through traffic toward the
	Hollywood Bowl. Parker doesn't notice. He's totally focused
	on screaming into the police radio.

				PARKER
		Listen to me, a bomb is planted
		somewhere in the Hollywood Bowl!
		Evacuate everybody!

				FEMALE VOICE
		I'm sorry, sir, I don't have the
		authorization to do that.

				PARKER
		Then put somebody on who does!

				MALE VOICE
		What's seems to be the problem?

				PARKER
		You've got to stop the concert! A
		bomb is going to go off!

				MALE VOICE
		I'm sorry, sir, the concert has
		already started.

					CUT TO:

	THE GUEST CONDUCTOR

	whose back is to the audience, leading the orchestra in a
	truly magnificent performance of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony
	inside the Hollywood Bowl.

	The Guest Conductor waves his baton wildly. Passionately.
	Brilliantly. Getting the absolute best from the members of
	the orchestra.

	The musicians exhilarate in the challenge of being pushed to
	their musical limit.

	As the Guest Conductor turns to the next page of his sheet
	music on the podium, you notice seven small, HIGH-FREQUENCY
	SENSORS above an upcoming musical measure.

	The sensors are wired together. When the seven notes are
	played in sequence, an electrical pulse will be triggered
	down the wires which run down the side of the podium, beneath
	the stage.

	BENEATH THE STAGE

	The wires connect to several crates of C4 positioned beneath
	the orchestra. These seven notes will be the last notes these
	musicians ever play.

					CUT TO:

	OUTSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL

	Madison SCREECHES the vehicle to a halt. She comes within
	inches of mowing down several people. Madison and Parker bolt
	to the entrance, flashing their badges to the guards.

	INSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL

	The Guest Conductor's movements grow even more intense. More
	demanding. As he looks to the violin section, we now see the
	conductor's face. It is Sid 6.7.

				SID 6.7
			(silently)
		Don't hold back...Give it to me.
		Give it to me!

	The orchestra plays with everything they've got. They hit
	every note perfectly. Including a high C.

	ON THE CONDUCTOR'S PODIUM

	The first sensor is triggered. Then the second.

	PARKER AND MADISON

	appear at the back of the stage. Guns raised. Distracting the
	musicians. As Parker and Madison charge through the horn
	section toward Sid 6.7, the musicians stop playing.

	ON THE CONDUCTOR'S PODIUM

	The fifth sensor is triggered. Then the sixth...But not the
	seventh.

	SID 6.7

	cannot believe his eyes. Or his ears. The entire orchestra
	has stopped.

				SID 6.7
		Come on, play! PLAY!

	In his rage, his face contorts "past points", which can only
	be described bizarre, frightening, and not, something you
	would ever like to see when you look in the mirror.

	The musicians stare at Sid 6.7, and then at Parker and
	Madison with concerned, confused silence. Which is broken by
	Parker's gunfire.

	Ducking behind the podium, Sid 6.7 desperately tries to
	rewire the sensors to trigger manually. Without luck. He
	takes his .38 out of his jacket and starts firing.

	Pandemonium erupts throughout the Hollywood Bowl. Audience
	members run in every direction.

	The members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives, but
	keep their instruments with them. Even the oboist.

	Preventing Parker and Madison from taking any further shots
	at Sid 6.7.

	Sid 6.7 bolts down into the crowd. Madison cannot get off a
	clean shot. Neither can Parker. He aims, but does NOT fire.
	He and Madison struggle through the crowd after him.

	OUTSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL

	Parker and Madison just catch a glimpse of Sid 6.7 as he
	rushes up the entrance ramp to the Hollywood Freeway. Parker
	and Madison bolt after him.

	ON THE HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY

	Parker and Madison race past the cars waiting to merge into
	what is effectively a parking lot. As is normal for this
	thoroughfare, traffic is at a standstill.

	Sid 6.7 is nowhere to be seen. Parker and Madison splitup,
	wading through different lanes of traffic. Startling the
	already frustrated motorists. Who roll up their windows. Lock
	their doors. And some of whom reveal weapons of their own.

	Madison pauses, listening. She has no idea that Sid 6.7 steps
	behind her. WHAM! He cold cocks her with the butt of his gun.
	Madison crumples to the street.

	Which now leaves Parker a clean shot at Sid 6.7's head. BOOM!
	BOOM! Two hits. Two head wounds. Sid 6.7 falls behind a
	truck, losing his weapon.

	Before Sid 6.7's wounds have finished regenerating, Parker is
	already on top of him.

				PARKER
			(neighborly)
		Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to
		see you again.

	He empties his clip into Sid 6.7, then discards the gun. As
	Sid 6.7's wounds heal themselves, Parker pounds him
	mercilessly.

				SID 6.7
			(losing it)
		You...ruined...I'M GOING TO KILL
		YOU!!!

	Trading blows, he manages to get to his feet.

				PARKER
		Now, is that any way to talk to an
		old friend?

				SID 6.7
			(exploding)
		BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!

	He knocks Parker back with a good shot to the face, then
	disappears around a van.

	Parker continues the hunt. Quietly. Carefully. Tension grows
	in the silence that follows.

	He carefully makes his way around a truck. Only to see Sid
	6.7 swinging a two-by-four directly at his head. WHAM!!!

	Parker is knocked on his ass. Daze4. Blood streams down his
	cheek. He staggers to his feet, blocking another blow with
	his arm. Which SNAPS the wood in two.

	Parker grabs one of the boards. He battles with Sid 6.7.

	The fight between Parker and Sid 6.7 is intense. Exhausting.

	Parker gives it everything he has.

	Madison appears behind Parker, holding his gun. She wavers,
	having trouble keeping her balance. She has even more trouble
	aiming her weapon.

				MADISON
		Hey, Parker...

	She moves around, trying to get a clean shot at Sid 6.7.
	Which she does not have.

				PARKER
		How's your pulse?

				MADISON
			(totally focused)
		I couldn't tell you.

				PARKER
		Then shoot him already.

				MADISON
		Duck!

	Without hesitation, Parker hits the deck. Leaving Sid 6.7
	completely exposed. Madison steadies her sight.

				SID 6.7
			(to Madison)
		You couldn't hit the side of a...

	As he raises his twobyfour high over Parker's head, Madison
	pulls the trigger smoothly.

	IN SLOW MOTION, you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel
	of her gun. And penetrates Sid 6.7's skull between the eyes
	and exits out the back of his head.

	Sid 6.7 collapses on the ground next to Parker.

				MADISON
		What do we do now?

				PARKER
		You won't want to watch. Turn
		around.

	She does so. Parker reaches OUT OF FRAME to remove the Sid
	6.7 character module from within his skull. Then reveals the
	character module in hand.

				MADISON
		What should we do with it?

	Glancing in the flatbed of a truck, Parker gets an idea, and
	knocks on the driver's window. As the DRIVER rolls down his
	window, classic ROCK & ROLL MUSIC can be heard from inside.

				PARKER
		Mind if I borrow a couple of your
		tools for a second?

				DRIVER
		Be my guest.

	Parker removes two sledgehammers from the back of the truck.
	He offers one to Madison.

				PARKER
		Care to join me?

	Madison gladly accepts takes the sledgehammer. Parker drops
	the Sid 6.7 character module onto the pavement. And together,
	they start pounding the shit out of it. WHAM! WHAM! In
	perfect time with the music. Which the driver cranks even
	louder. As we ROLL CREDITS.

	THE END
WALKING TALL

               We home in on a boat coming in to shore. Off walks a man, he 
               is carrying a backpack and wearing shades. 
 
               
               EXT. TOWN

               He walks through a town, passing various stores and the general 
               bustle of the people there. He notices a baby in a pram left 
               out on the sidewalk, then sees the mother is in an alleyway doing 
               what looks like a drug deal.
 
               EXT. LUMBER YARD

               Chris reads a closure notice on the door. A police car rolls

               Chris turns around and the sheriff notices his name on a bag.

                                     CHRIS
                         Thanks for the ride.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         No problem, and uh Chris (hands him 
                         a piece of paper). It's election month... 
                         I'm your man.
 
               Chris takes the paper and smiles. He walks up the lane toward 
               the house, a simple white building clad in wood. A lady dressed 
               in a police uniform comes out.
 
                                     MICHELLE
                         Can I help you?

               Chris laughs.

                                     MICHELLE

                         gimme a hug.
 
               They laugh together.

                         You look great.

                                     MICHELLE

                         set up on the lawn).
 
                                     MICHELLE

               Chris hugs his mother, Connie. A man slowly emerges from the 
               front door.
 
                                     CONNIE

                         that thing down on your own.

               We can see from the window that it's raining heavily outside. 
               Chris sets about unpacking his things. Pete comes in looking 
               wet.
 
                                     PETE

               Pete looks at him.

                                     CHRIS

               A crappy camper van rolls up. A man steps out.

                         to Seattle, got a guitar and became 
                         all about music. And then pretty soon 
                         I was about music and drugs, n pretty 
                         soon I was basically just about drugs. 
                         Ended up doin 2 years for B+E.

                         You? Relax?

               Another truck with a few guys on it pulls up

                                     JAY
                         Not today.

               A football game ensues, there are two teams. Jay's guys vs Chris' 
               guys. On the sidelines Pete pulls up on a small motorcycle. Chris 
               notices Pete hanging around with kids smoking. It comes down 
               to the last play, the teams are huddled into two groups talking.

                         If we score here we win right?

                                     CHRIS
                         Alright boys, last play. We need to 
                         put this to rest.
 
                                     RAY
                         Just give me the ball.

                                     CHRIS
                         You got it. On the first hut!

                                     JAY
                         Ok Vaughn, last chance.

               Chris gets the ball and throws it. An opponent comes in hard 
               and tackles him low. He collapses. Ray runs for the ball but 
               gets clotheslined by Jay.
 
                                     JAY

               Jay speeds off in his car. Pete rolls up on his bike.

                         that I find most impressive, blends 
                         in with the mountains SO nicely.

               Chris' friends have led him to a stripping booth, his friend

               His friends leave, closing the door behind them.

               A screen goes up and a striptease begins. The lady is dressed 
               in the style of a firewoman and has a pole in the center of the 
               stage. She dances around the pole and removes clothes.

                                     JIMMY
                         Chris, why don't we just let it go?
 
                         
                                     CHRIS
                         No, we gonna let it ride Jimmy. The 
                         dice are comin up seven.
 
                                     CROUPIER
                         It's not your roll sir.

               Chris rolls the dice and sure enough it's a seven.

                                     COMMISSIONER
                         No folks, no payout. 

                                     CHRIS
                         (To croupier) Why don't you just take 
                         care of that bet and we're even.
 
                                     CROUPIER
                         Well I would but it wasn't a legitimate 
                         bet, you're not the shooter. It's not 
                         your (Chris shoves him) ROLL sir.
 
                         
                                     SECURITY GUY
                         Is there a problem?

                                     CHRIS
                         Yea, the problem is your dice are loaded. 
                         Does your boss know about this? Just 
                         gimme my money.
 
               The security guy grabs Chris around the neck. Chris elbows him 
               and throws him onto the table. The croupier takes a fighting 
               stance. Jimmy taps Chris on the shoulder.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Come on, let's go! let's go!

               More security men appear, one of them knocks Jimmy out. A whole 
               fight breaks out, Ray gets knocked out. Chris beats off several 
               security men before taking an electric shock to the neck and 
               a baton to the face. Chris wakes up on a table under a light.
 
               
                                     BAD GUY 1
                         (Sees the tag around Chris' neck) Special 
                         forces? I'll take that.
 
               Chris grabs him by the neck but they beat him down again.

                                     BAD GUY 2
                         What are you doin?

                                     BAD GUY 1
                         (Has a scalpel in his hand) Special 
                         forces... special treatment.
 
               He rips open Chris' shirt.

                                     BAD GUY 2
                         This guy knows Hamilton!

               A struggle ensues and Chris' chest is cut up.

               
               EXT. A BRIDGE

               We see Chris is crawling, badly hurt. A truck stops directly 
               in front of him. Chris passes out again.

                         banged up, inside and out. Whoever did 
                         this left him for dead. A lesser man

               Chris has returned home. He's still in bad shape and his parents 
               help him out of the car. He insists on taking the steps by himself.

               A montage ensues with Chris on the couch, sometimes with Ray, 
               other times with Pete. Chris is recovering, and is exercising 
               by the end of it.

                         they have to put up with on a daily

                         They did an internal investigation. 
                         That's good enough for me.

                         Chris, I know you're familiar with the 
                         term 'no fly zone'. Hmm? Cause that's 
                         what the casino is. Since the mill closed 
                         down that casino is the main source 
                         of revenue in this town. So, case closed 
                         basically. I'll see ya.

                         From the security guys workin at the

               Chris gets into his truck.

                                     CONNIE
                         Chris, wait. Call the police.

                                     CHRIS
                         No, that won't do any good.

               Chris speeds off. He pulls up at their home and enters the garage.
 
               
                                     DAD

                         He'll be fine.

               Chris is searching about and forces open a cupboard.

                                     DAD
                         What are you doin?

               Chris pulls out a shotgun and loads it.

                                     DAD
                         Aw Chris not like this. Chris listen 
                         to me. If you go outta here with that 
                         gun, they're gonna.. ne... Chris!
 
                         
               Chris drives to the casino, he cocks the shotgun but decides 
               to leave it in the truck. Instead he takes a piece of wood from 
               the back of his truck. He enters the casino with it. He smashes 
               a fruit machine. A guard comes up and Chris beats him. A fight 
               scene breaks out with Chris beating the guards and generally 
               trashing the place. He takes back his special forces dogtag from 
               the guard who stole it. Chris hurls his piece of wood at the 
               VIP lounge window, smashing it to pieces. Jay emerges from behind 
               it.
 
                                     JAY
                         Guess that changes our relationship 
                         a bit huh?
 
               Chris leaves. As he drives off in his truck, police cars appear 
               with sirens going. He pulls over.

                         your military record can't be ignored. 
                         Three months home arrest, some community

                         Our job is to keep order. But there 
                         was no chance of that. Me and my men 
                         we were just tryin to control him. He 
                         was highly trained, violent, very dangerous 
                         person.

                         So dangerous, so violent, so highly 
                         trained that he despatched six of the 
                         casino staff single handedly. His weapon 
                         of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which 
                         in his hand became a devastating force 
                         with one aim, to hurt people, destroy 
                         property.

                         He went directly for everything. He 
                         just came in and took over the place.

                         but ah nothing with this sort of violence.

                         warning? A chance to defend yourself.

                         We tussled, but he's a big guy. He was 
                         on a mission. Besides, he seemed to 
                         be too busy enjoying himself from what 
                         I could see. 
 
                                     PROSECUTOR
                         So from what you saw, it seemed like 
                         he had some kinda purpose?

               the stairs. As he tumbles down Ray reloads his shotgun. The two 
               begin firing at each other, taking cover behind the furniture.
 
               
               
               INT. POLICE STATION

                                     WATKINS
                         Tried to warn ya Chris. Didn't want 
                         this to happen.
 
               One of the men outside has a canister. Watkins gives him the 
               nod and he begins walking towards the station. Chris is beneath 
               the floor and shoots him in the legs. The two remaining men outside 
               open fire again. Another gunman tries to approach but he's shot 
               in the legs as well. Watkins enters the station and fires repeatedly 
               at the floor.
 
                                     WATKINS
                         Come get some! WOOOOOOOOO!

                                     CHRIS
                         Deni! Now!

               Deni fires off some shots. Watkins is distracted by the shots, 
               Chris appears in the floor hole and blasts Watkins at close range 
               with a shotgun.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         Deni.... Deni. 

               Chris climbs out of the hole and they hug.

               
               INT. FAMILY HOUSE

               Shots are still being fired in the lounge. Ray and the gunman 
               begin to wrestle. Ray wins and punches the man repeatedly. Chris 
               has come back to the house and tries to pull Ray off the man, 
               Ray mistakenly hits Chris in the face.
 
                                     RAY
                         I'm sorry!

               Chris helps Ray over to a chair, Ray has taken a shot to the 
               leg.
 
               The injured gunman from the kitchen appears brandishing a pistol.
 
               
                                     GUNMAN
                         You stabbed me... with a potato peeler??
 
                         
               Chris and Ray hold up their hands. He aims at Ray but he's shot 
               in the back of the head by Dad who is approaching down the stairs.
 
               
                                     CHRIS
                         You gonna be ok?

               Dad nods.

               
               EXT. THE MILL

               Chris is in a police car driving at speed. He approaches the 
               mill and busts through the locked gates. 
 
               
               INT. THE MILL

               The mill is dark, Chris is finding his way around using a torch. 
               He finds Jay sitting.
 
                                     JAY
                         Hey Chris.

                                     CHRIS
                         Get up Jay.

                                     JAY
                         Just a sec. Remember we used to play 
                         hide n seek up here?
 
               Jay hits a metal saw which resonates making a metallic sound.
 
               
                                     JAY
                         That was my favourite sound. 

                                     CHRIS
                         Get up!

               Jay stands up and holds up his hands.

                                     JAY
                         Look... Chris... just...

               Jay hits a switch on the floor which opens a hatch. Chris falls 
               into the hatch but hangs onto the saw which is swinging over 
               it.
 
               Jay hits more switches, powering up the machinery.

                                     JAY
                         You wanna know what my new favourite 
                         sound's gonna be? The sound of you screaming 
                         like a little bitch.
 
               Jay hits Chris in the stomach with a pole a few times. Chris 
               grabs the pole and they both fall. Chris has hurt his leg. Chris 
               stumbles off into the woods. Jay grabs an axe and goes after 
               him, he swings the axe but misses and they both fall down a large 
               earthy embankment. At the bottom they come to their senses and 
               begin fighting again, Jay with his axe and Chris with a log he's 
               ripped off a tree. Chris knocks Jay out by hitting him hard in 
               the legs.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         You're right Jay, this does change our 
                         relationship. This is my town, you're 
                         under arrest.
 
               
               INT. WILD CHERRY CASINO

               Chris and Ray are packing everything, the place is boarded up. 
               
 
                                     CHRIS
                         That oughta do it. WHAT are you doin?
 
                         
                                     RAY
                         Gettin some souvenirs, I'm gonna miss 
                         the place!
 
                                     CHRIS
                         That's how it starts. Next you'll be 
                         accepting bribes, setting speed traps 
                         all over town, cuttin up trucks. Not 
                         to mention the cavity searches. 
 
                                     RAY
                         Speakin of which, do you think Jay's 
                         got a casino in the pen? 
 
                                     CHRIS
                         Could be.

                                     RAY
                         Runnin the shower tower with the felons. 
                         He's probably blowin on somebody's dice 
                         right now.
 
               They laugh as they drive off. The mill makes a horn noise.

                                     RAY
                         That's lunch.

                                     CHRIS
                         Let's go pick my old man and grab somethin 
                         to eat.
 
                                     RAY
                         I'm with ya buddy.

               
               FADE OUT
