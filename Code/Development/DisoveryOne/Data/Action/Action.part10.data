BLACK CONTINUES... ELVISH SINGING....A WOMAN'S VOICE IS
whispering, tinged with SADNESS and REGRET:

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
              (Elvish: subtitled)
          "I amar prestar sen: han mathon ne nen,
          han mathon ne chae...a han noston ned
          wilith."
              (English:)
          The world is changed: I feel it in the
          water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it
          in the air...Much that once was is lost,
          for none now live who remember it.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          It began with the forging of the Great
          Rings.

IMAGE: THREE RINGS, each set with a single GEM, are received
by the HIGH ELVES-GALADRIEL, GIL-GALAD and CIRDAN.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Three were given to the Elves, immortal,
          wisest...fairest of all beings.

IMAGE: SEVEN RINGS held aloft in triumph by the DWARF LORDS.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great miners
          and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

IMAGE: NINE RINGS clutched tightly by the KINGS OF MEN...as
if holding-close a precious secret.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And Nine...nine rings were gifted to the
          race of Men who, above all else, desire
          power.

          For within these rings was bound the
          strength and will to govern each race.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But they were all of them deceived.

FADE UP: An ancient PARCHMENT MAP of MIDDLE EARTH...moving
slowly across the MAP as if drawn by an unseen force the
CAMERA closes in on a PLACE NAME...MORDOR.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...for another ring was made.

TEASING SHOTS: SAURON forging the ONE RING in the CHAMBERS of
SAMMATH NAUR.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          In the land of Mordor, in the fires of
          Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged
          in secret a Master Ring to control all
          others.

emerges on the plain BAND OF GOLD.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...and into this Ring he poured his
          cruelty, his malice and his will to
          dominate all life.

IMAGE: THE ONE RING falls through SPACE and into flames...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          One by one the Free lands of Middle earth
          fell to the power of the ring.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But there were some...who resisted.

FADE UP: ISILDUR, son of the KING OF GONDOR, leads an ARMY
ACROSS the PLAINS OF DAGORLAD...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
          against the armies of Mordor.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          On the slopes of Mount Doom they fought
          for the freedom of Middle- Earth.

TEASING SHOTS: THE BATTLE OF DAGORLAD...THE ELF LORD, ELROND,

commands rank after rank of ELVEN ARCHERS...ORCS RETREATING
before the ARMY of the LAST ALLIANCE...ELENDIL holds aloft
the great sword....NARSIL!

                    GALADRIEL
          Victory was near!

IMAGES: THE HUGE, DARK FIGURE OF SARURON, bearing the ONE
RING on his finger, looms over the field of battle...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But the power of the Ring could not be
          undone.

IMAGE: SAURON lays waste to the armies of the LAST ALLIANCE.
With desperate courage, ELENDIL leads a charge...THE BLACK
MACE OF SAURON LASHES OUT!! IMAGE: ELENDIL'S body falls like
a crumpled rag doll... IMAGE: ISILDUR cradles the body of his
father in his arms. The SHADOW OF SAURON falls over him...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It was in this moment..when all hope had
          faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
          took up his father's sword.

ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL..The BLADE
severs SAURON'S FINGERS... AND THE ONE RING FLIES from his
body.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of
          Middle Earth, was defeated. SAURON'S
          ARMOR clatters to the ground. His body

GONE....VAPORIZED! CLOSE ON: ISILDUR picks up the SEVERED
FINGER and removes the ONE RING...transfixed!

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The Ring passed to Isildur...who had this
          one chance to destroy evil forever.

IMAGE: GLADDEN FIELD...ISILDUR leads a small column of men
through DARKENING WOODS...the ONE RING glinting on a CHAIN
around his neck.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            But the hearts of Men are easily
            corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a
            will of its own.

SUDDENLY!    ARROWS FLY!   They are ambushed by ORCS...ISILDUR
SCREAMS!

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP: ISILDUR MATERIALIZES UNDER WATER...as THE RING slips
slowly from his finger. Ripples of LIGHT play across
ISILDUR'S PALE FACE...he is DEAD.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            It betrayed Isildur to his death.

IMAGE: THE RING falls through the MURKY WATERS of the RIVER
ANDUIN.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            And some things that should not have been
            forgotten...were lost.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            History became legend...legend became
            myth.

FADE UP: The waters of the ANDUIN RIVER lie dark and
undisturbed.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            And for two and a half thousand years the
            Ring passed out of all knowledge.

IMAGE: SILT SWIRLS...A THIN WHITE HAND reaches
down...grasping the RING...

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Until, when chance came, it ensnared a
            new bearer!

IMAGE: THE THIN WHITE HAND opens to reveal one ring.

                      GOLLUM (V.O.)
            My Precious...

                                                                5.



IMAGE: MIST SHROUDED MOUNTAINS...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who
          took it deep into the tunnels of the
          Misty Mountains.

IMAGE: THE GLOOM of a MOUNTAIN CAVERN..a MURKY POOL of
WATER...in the DARKNESS the SHADOWY OUTLINE of an EMACIATED
FIGURE.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And there, it consumed him. A RASPY VOICE
          mutters in the half light...

                    GOLLUM
          It came to me. My own.     My love...
              (ecstatic whisper)
          My preciousness.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
          life. For five hundred years it poisoned
          his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's
          cave...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

                       GALADRIEL (V.O.)   (CONT'D)
          It waited.

FADE UP: Bathed in COLD MOONLIGHT, the WORLD lies DARK and
STILL...the unsettled quiet before the storm...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Darkness crept back into the forests of
          the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
          East...whispers of a nameless fear. And
          the Ring of Power perceived...its time
          had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

SLOW MOTION: unseen by its KEEPER..THE RING falls to the
MUDDY FLOOR of a MOUNTAIN TUNNEL...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But something happened then the Ring did
          not intend...

RING.

                      GALADRIEL
            It was picked up by the most unlikely
            creature imaginable...

                      BILBO
                (to himself)
            What's this?

A YOUNGISH LOOKING BILBO BAGGINS peers down at what lies in
his hand...PERPLEXED by what he has found.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.)
            A Hobbit....Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

                      BILBO
                (surprised)
            A Ring.

SUDDENLY!   A VOICE SCREAMS...ITS ANGUISH RINGING through the

COLD, DANK TUNNELS...

                       GOLLUM (V.O.)
            Lost!   Lost! My Precious is lost!!

Frightened Bilbo quickly POCKETS the ONE RING and hurries on.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

WIDE ON: THE CAMERA SOARS AWAY FROM THE MOUNTAINS.      MOVING

FASTER AND FASTER...THEIR DARK GREEN FORESTS AND JAGGED

WHITE PEAKS RECEDING INTO THE SHROUD OF MIST

            For the time will soon come when Hobbits
            will shape the fortunes of all.

CONTINUED:

White flowers are scattered among the Well seeded grasses.
An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the
figure is reading a book. ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance,
growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching
cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to
the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..."

SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight
at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair
and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight
with EXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his
mouth, Frodo runs off.

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. SHIRE LANE -- DAY

The cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped
figure in Grey.

INTERCUT WITH; SHOTS OF FRODO RUNNING... CAREERING DOWN A

HILL. . .JUMPING OVER LOGS... DODGING TREE BRANCHES.

                                                       ANGLE ON:

The shambling OLD PONY snorts and rears as... SUDDENLY FRODO
appears on a bank above the cart.

                    FRODO
          You're late.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...

                    GANDALF
          A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
          nor is he early. He arrives precisely
          when he means to.

They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as
FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front
seat of the cart.

                    FRODO
          It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3
foot 6 inches tall.

                    GANDALF
          You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
          Bilbo's birthday?

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended by

HOBBITS.

                     FRODO
           What news of the outside world? Tell me
           everything!

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.

                     GANDALF
           What, everything? Far too eager and
           curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...

Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy
Hobbit Marketplace.

                      GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
           wide world goes on much as if it has past
           age. Full of its own comings and goings,
           scarcely even aware of the existence of
           Hobbits...

Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           ...for which I am very thankful.

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon
Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scOrcs of
Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
           the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
           a Party of Special Magnificence.

                     FRODO
           You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place
           in an uproar.

                     GANDALF
           Oh, well...that should please him.

          Half the Shire's been invited...

                    GANDALF
          Good gracious, me.

                    FRODO
          He's up to something.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.

                    FRODO
          Alright then..keep your secrets. Before
          you came along we Bagginses were very
          well thought of.

                       GANDALF
          Indeed?

                    FRODO
          Never had any adventures or did anything
          unexpected.

                    GANDALF
          If you're referring to the incident with
          the Dragon...I was barely involved...all
          I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
          out the door.

                    FRODO
          Whatever you did...you've been officially
          labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

                                                       ANGLE ON:

ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply

As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a
quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills

The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the

Excited children, chasing after the cart.

                                                     CLOSE ON:

Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries. The children stand
deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane. At that
moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of
the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. ODO
PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in
the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.

                    FRODO
          Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo
          leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf
          smiles.

                    GANDALF
          So am I, dear boy...so am I

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. BAG END -- DAY

Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG
END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a
large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is
a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON
PARTY BUSINESS." Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag
End. He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a
voice calls out:

                     BILBO (O.S.)
          No, thank you! We don't want any more
          visitors, well wishers, or distant
          relations.

                    GANDALF
          And what about very old friends?

Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him.
He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous
Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he
looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.

                     BILBO
          Gandalf?

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo Baggins!

                    BILBO
          My dear Gandalf!

Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.

                    GANDALF
          It's good to see you. One hundred and
          eleven years old, who would believe it!

Gandalf looks at him more keenly.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
          laugh together and enter Bag End.

                    BILBO
          Come on, come in!   Welcome, welcome!!

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.

                    BILBO
              (Calling)
          Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've
          a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
          1296...a very good year, almost as old as
          I am. It was laid down by my father. What
          say we open one, eh?

Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. He groans.

                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I was expecting you some time last week.
          Not that it matters, you come and go as
          you please, always have done, always
          will.

                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
          afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
          of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
          that might be a little risky...

Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf
smiles to himself.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
          tart...got some custard somewhere. Not
          much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
          no...we're alright...I've just found some
          sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
          it's enough.
              (comes into view)
          I could do you some eggs if you like?

Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.

                    GANDALF
          Just tea, thank you.

                       BILBO
          Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?

                    GANDALF
          No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
          knock on the front door.

MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.)

Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.

                    BILBO
          I'm not home.

Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I've got to get away from these
          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
          all day, never giving me a moment's
          peace. I want to see mountains
          again...mountains, Gandalf... and then
          find somewhere quiet where I can finish
          my book...Oh, Tea!

                    GANDALF
          So, you mean to go through with your
          plan, then?

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the
          arrangements are made.

                    GANDALF
          Frodo suspects something.

                    BILBO
          'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not
          some block headed Bracegirdle from
          Hardbottle!

                    GANDALF
          You will tell him, won't you?

                      BILBO
          Yes, yes.

                    GANDALF
          He's very fond of you.

                    BILBO
          I know. He'd probably come with me if I
          asked him. I think, in his heart,
          Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
          woods and the fields... little rivers.
          Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
          window.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at
          Gandalf sadly...

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning
          to feel it in my heart.

                                                      CLOSE ON:

Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I feel thin...sort of stretched, like
          butter scraped over too much bread. I
          need a holiday...a very long holiday and
          I don't expect I shall return...in fact,
          I mean not to.

INT. BAG END -- EVENING

Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below
them, final preparations are being made on the Party field.
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.

                    BILBO
          Old Toby, the finest weed in
          Southfarthing!

Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the
air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through
the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Ohhhh,
              (smiles)
          Gandalf my old friend...this will be a
          night to remember!

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT

BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above
Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding
branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down
from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned
faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and
drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the
tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark
that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting
visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo
notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,
Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.

                    FRODO
          Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

                     SAM
               (horrified)
          I think I'll just have myself another
          ale.

                    FRODO
          Oh, no you don't. Go on.

Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of
his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing
throng of dancers.

                                                            15.



ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE

as he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework
that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.

Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a
group of young hobbit children.

                    BILBO
              (melodramatic)
          So, there I was...at the mercy of three
          monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of
          a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
          Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
          things..and they're arguing...arguing
          about how they were going to cook us!

ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S

upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.

                    BILBO
          Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
          in a pie or whether they were going to
          sit on us one by one and squash us into
          jelly! But they spent so long arguing
          the whether-to's and why-for's that the
          sun's first light crept over the top of
          the trees...and turned them all to stone!

STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing
feat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young
Hobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back
of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework

                    MERRY
              (urgent whisper)
          No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin
          grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK
          FUSE crackles with flame!

Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the
fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
              (worried whisper)
          You're supposed to stick it in the
          ground!


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           16.
CONTINUED:


                    PIPPIN
          It is in the ground.

Merry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin!    The fuse
sizzles angrily.

                     MERRY
          Outside!

                    PIPPIN
          It was your idea.

Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.
WHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in
a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening
power. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low
towards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the
Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the
Panicking crowd and impending danger!

                     FRODO
          Bilbo!   Watch out for the dragon!!

                    BILBO
          Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon
          in these parts for a thousand years!

ANGLE ON: FRODO

As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon
roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express
train! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents
collapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a
somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night.

ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN,

clothes and hair smoking.

                    MERRY
          That was good!

                    PIPPIN
          Let's get another one!

LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears.
Low angle: Gandalf looking DOWN STERNLY!

MERRY AND PIPPIN

Are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy
water...with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and
sipping an ale. Cries of "SPEECH! SPEECH" erupt from the
party.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo stepping on a stool...he bows in gratitude at the
applause.

                       FRODO
          Speech!

                    BILBO
              (clearing throat)
          My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and
          Brandybucks...Grubbs, Chubbs,
          Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and
          Proudfoots...

ANGLE ON: A HOBBIT WITH PARTICULARLY BIG FEET

                       ODO PROUDFOOT
          Proudfeet!

                    BILBO
          Today is my one hundred and eleventh
          birthday. Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one
          years is far too short a time to live
          among such excellent and admirable
          Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of approval!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I don't know half of you half as well as
          I should like; and I like less than half
          of you as well as well as you deserve.

SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was
a compliment or not. CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to
themselves. CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his
head. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow.

Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and
holds it behind his back.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

          I have..things to do and I have put this
          off for far too long... CLOSE ON: BILBO'S
          knuckles turn white as he tightens his
          grip on the small object behind his back.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I regret to announce, this is the end. I
          am going now. I bid you all a very fond
          farewell!! Bilbo looks across at Frodo,
          hesitates... then...

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (whisper)
          Goodbye.

Bilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an
uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet.

ANGLE ON: FRODO

staring at the empty stool in disbelief.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away
as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End.
Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.

INT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a
plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the
ring in the air, then places it in his pocket.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He
finds Gandalf looming over him.

                    GANDALF
          I suppose you think that was terribly
          clever?

                    BILBO
          Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their
          faces?




                                                  (CONTINUED)

                    GANDALF
          There are many magic rings in the world,
          Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
          used lightly.

                    BILBO
          It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're
          probably right as usual.

                    GANDALF
          You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

                    BILBO
          I'm leaving everything to him.

                    GANDALF
          What about this ring of yours?   Is that
          staying too?

Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the
mantelpiece.

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over
          there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns
          at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly
          feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty
          surprise.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't
          that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after
          all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

                    GANDALF
          I think you should leave the Ring behind,
          Bilbo. Is that so hard?

                    BILBO
          Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it,
          I don't feel like parting with it. It's
          mine. I found it. It came to me!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN.

                    GANDALF
          There's no need to get angry.

                    BILBO
          Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
          mine. My own, my precious.

                    GANDALF
          Precious? It's been called that before,
          but not by you.

                    BILBO
          So? What business is it of yours what I
          do with my own things? Bilbo's voice,
          shape and manner have suddenly changed.

                    GANDALF
          I think you've had that ring quite long
          enough.

                    BILBO
          You want it for yourself!

Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow
suddenly seems to fill the room

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
          conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers
          from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a
          frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression
          softens.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
          to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to
          Gandalf and hugs him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          All you long years we've been
          friends...trust me as you once did. Let
          it go!

                    BILBO
          You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go
          to Frodo.

Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          It's late, the road is long... yes, it is
          time.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo?

                    BILBO
          Hmmm?

          The ring is still in your pocket.

Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.

                     BILBO
          Oh, yes.

CLOSE ON: Bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his
palm. With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to
slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. CLOSE ON:
The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.

EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT

Bilbo staggering out of Bag end...he braces himself in the
night air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring has
weakened him. Gandalf steps up behind.

                    BILBO
          I've thought up and ending for my
          book..."And he lived happily ever after
          to the end of his days."

                    GANDALF
          I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

                    BILBO
          Goodbye, Gandalf.

                    GANDALF
          Goodbye Bilbo.

Bilbo walks away from Bag End, disappearing into the night,
softly singing: "The Road goes on and on."

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
              (softly)
          Until our next meeting.

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

CLOSE ON: THE RING...Glinting on the floor...Gandalf circles
around it, a Puzzled look on his face. Gandalf slowly reaches
for the ring. His fingers barely touch the ring...the creepy
Hum rises on the soundtrack. Gandalf is sitting in front of
the fire, with his pipe...staring into the flickering flames.

          Bilbo! Bilbo!

Frodo rushes into Bag End...he stops and picks up the ring at
his feet. Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if
locked in thought.

                    GANDALF
              (to himself)
          My precious...precious..

                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          He's gone, hasn't he? Frodo steps into
          the living room.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          He talked for so long about leaving...I
          didn't think he'd really do it.

                     GANDALF
              (mutters to himself)
          ...my own.

                     FRODO
          Gandalf?

Gandalf turns...his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's
fingers.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo's ring.

Gandalf sorts hurriedly through Bilbo's papers...

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's
          left you Bag End...

Gandalf holds out the envelope...Frodo drops the ring into
it.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          ...along with all his possessions.

Gandolf seals the envelope with wax.   He hands it to Frodo.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          The ring is yours now. But it somewhere
          out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and
          starts to gather his things.

                    FRODO
          Where are you going?

                    GANDALF
          I have some things I must see to.

                    FRODO
          What things?

                       GANDALF
          Questions.     Questions that need
          answering.

                    FRODO
          You've only just arrived!    I don't
          understand...

Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo.

                    GANDALF
          Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
          safe.

Gandalf hurries out the door...leaving FRODO standing alone
in the Bag End.

ANGLE ON: THE ENVELOPE

ring...beneath the hum the whispered murmur of BLACK SPEECH

          Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has

                    GANDALF
          No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
          endured. His life force is bound to the
          ring and the ring survived. Sauron has
          returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his
          fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the
          land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
          ring to cover all the lands in the second
          darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
          all his thought is bent on it. For the
          ring yearns, above all else, to return to
          the hand of its master: they are one, the
          ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
          never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up

            My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing
            creatures. You can learn all that there
            is to know about their ways in a month,
            and yet, after a hundred years, they can
            still surprise you.

          You know this? How?

                    SARUMAN

plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...

          wise abandon reason for madness?

At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
He slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen
force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the
wall and swings his staff on Saruman...blasting him off his
feet! Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing

Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it
flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand! Gandalf is

EXT. FARMER'S FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: Frodo and Sam walking along a country lane which
borders Farmer Maggot's Fields. Sam is looking up...Frodo has
disappeared around a corner in the lane.

                     SAM
               (panicked)
          Mr. Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo turns,
          surprised as Sam comes running towards
          him.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (worried)
          I thought I lost you. Frodo looks at Sam
          suspiciously. Sam glances down,
          embarrassed.

                    FRODO
              (teasing)
          What are you talking about?

                    SAM
              (mumbling)
          It's just something Gandalf said...

                    FRODO
          What did he say?

                    SAM
          He said..."Don't you leave him, Samwise
          Gamgee."
              (looks at Frodo intently)
          And I don't mean to.

                    FRODO
              (laughing)
          Sam...we're still in the Shire...what
          could possibly happen?

SUDDENLY! A figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending
Frodo flying. Frodo picks himself up, only to be knocked back
down again by Pippin.

                     PIPPIN
          Frodo!   Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

                    MERRY
          Hello Frodo

Merry, Pippin, and Frodo picking themselves up... a variety
of vegetables have scattered everywhere.

                    SAM
          What's the meaning of this!

                    MERRY
          Sam, hold this...

Merry gives Sam a large cabbage.

                    SAM
              (accusing)
          You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the
Hedgerow...angry shouts from Farmer Maggot.

                    FARMER MAGGOT    (O.S.)
          Who's that in my field!     Get out of it!
          Get out of my field, you    young varmits!
          I'll show you...get out    of my corn.

Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race
away...with Frodo and Sam on their heels.

                    MERRY
              (looking behind him)
          I don't know why he's so upset, it's only
          a couple of carrots.

                    PIPPIN
          And some cabbages...and those three bags
          of potatoes that we lifted last week.
          And then the mushrooms the week before.

                    MERRY
          Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly
          over reacting.

The BAYING OF LARGE DOGS sounds!

EXT. WOODED ROAD -- DAY

Frodo, Sam, and Merry and Pippin tumble head over heels down
a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. CLOSE ON: A winded Pippin,
his face inches away from a large pile of Horse droppings...

                    PIPPIN
          That was close.

Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly.

                    MERRY
              (groaning)
          Ow...I think I've broken something.

Pulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle,
out from his back pocket.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Oh.

                    SAM
              (turning on Merry and Pippin)
          Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.

                    MERRY
          What? That was just a detour...a
          shortcut.

                    SAM
          A shortcut to what?

Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of
the road.

                     PIPPIN
              (excited)
          Mushrooms!

CLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy
undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the
mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are
on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling
down the road as if blown by an invisible wind...

                                                             41.



SUDDENLY... THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES...

                      FRODO
            I think we should get off the road.

A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some
evil and lonely creature.

                      FRODO (CONT'D)
                (more urgency)
            Get off the road!

Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble
down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES
is close... A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into
view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black
horse with insane eyes ! Frodo freezes in terror. The
RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits
very still with his head bowed, listening. From inside the
hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an
elusive scent; his head turning from side to side.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly
slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering
suspiciously into the woods.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling
hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of
some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. The SOUND OF SNIFFING
intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to
side like a bird of party.

CLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT...

QUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS!   AND EVIL DARK TOWER...A GREAT EYE...A

BURST OF FLAME.

ANGLE ON:   SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN

                      SAM
            Frodo?

Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the
ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far
side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly
slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken

                    MERRY
          What was that?

Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring
lying in the palm of his hand.

EXT. FERRY LANE -- NIGHT

Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the
trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground.

                      SAM
          Anything?

                      FRODO
          Nothing.

                    PIPPIN
          What is going on?

Merry moves past pippin, toward Frodo, watching
intently...Sam keeps looking around nervously.

                    MERRY
          The Black rider was looking for
          something...or someone...Frodo?

                      SAM
          Get down!

The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline.
The Four Hobbits... sprawled on the ground, holding their
breath. The BLACK RIDER turns and departs.

                    FRODO
          I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I
          must get to Bree.

Merry looks at his friend...realizing Frodo is in deep
trouble.

                    MERRY
          Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me !

The Hobbits break cover. SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of
the forest TOWARD THEM!

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          There's another one!! Frodo, this way! !

The Hobbits run   THE RINGWRAITH SHRIEKS!

FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN, are running towards the wide,
placid Brandywine river...and the FERRY.

          Get the ropes, Sam.

QUICK ANGLES: STOMPING HOOVES...SNARLING HORSES...

Four RINGWRAITHS are speeding through the Fog...converging on
the FERRY CROSSING. The HOBBITS stampede across the Wharf and
Tumble onto the Ferry.

                    SAM
              (screaming)
          Frodo!

Frodo races across the Wooden Wharf, followed by the
ringwraiths. He leaps into the Ferry.

CLOSE ON: HOOVES THUNDER DOWN THE WOODEN WHARF!

Sam and Merry shove off with the poles...the ferry slides out
into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. They pull up
on the end of the wharf... shrieking with rage! The Hobbits
cover their ears. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards
the north and Gallop away along the river bank, quickly
disappearing into the fog.

                    FRODO
          How far to the nearest crossing?

                    MERRY
          The brandwine bridge...twenty miles.

FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN approaching the gatehouse...wild
eyes, ragged, and out of breath.

                     FRODO
          Come on.

A SURLY GATEKEEPER glances down at them.

                    GATEKEEPER
          What do you want?

                    FRODO
          We're headed for the prancing pony.

The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing
them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,
          out of the Shire by your talk. What
          business brings you to Bree?

                    FRODO
          We wish to stay at the inn...our business
          is our own. To Frodo's relief, the
          Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.

                    GATEKEEPER
          All right, young sir, I meant no offense.

The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree...the gatekeeper eyeing
them curiously in the lantern light.

                    GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
          It's my job to ask questions after
          nightfall. There's talk of strange fold
          abroad...can't be too careful.

Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin come rushing in.   Frodo attracts
the INN KEEPERS'S attention.

                       FRODO
          Excuse me.

                     BUTTERBUR
          Good evening, little masters. If you're
          seeking accommodation, we've got some
          nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available,
          Mr...ah...

                    FRODO
          Underhill...my name's Underbill.

                       BUTTERBUR
          Underhill?     Hmmmm.

                    FRODO
          We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can
          you tell him we've arrived? BUTTERBUR
          frowns...

                    BUTTERBUR
              (Puzzled)
          Gandalf...Gandalf...Oh...
              (recognition)
          Oh yes! I remember...elderly chap...big
          grey beard...pointy hat? Frodo nods with
          relief...Butterbur shakes his head.

                    BUTTERBUR (CONT'D)
          Not seen him for six months. Frodo is
          shocked.

                    SAM
              (worried whisper)
          What do we do now?

INT. PRANCING PONY INN -- NIGHT

Wide on: the noise, smokey Inn. It is dimly lit, cheifly
from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of BIG
FOLK, LOCAL HOBBITS, and a couple of dwarfs. Frodo, Sam,
Merry and Pippin are sitting at a table against the wall...
clearly trying to remain Quiet and inconspicuous... Sam can't
help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around.

                    FRODO
          Sam, he'll be here.    He'll come.

Merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large
mug of beer.

                    PIPPIN
          What's that?

                    MERRY
          This, my friend, is a pint.

                    PIPPIN
          It comes in pints?    I'm getting one!

Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to
the bar.

                    SAM
          You've had a whole half already. Merry
          watches Pippin go.

A COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance at
Frodo, then quickly look away.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (tense)
          That fellow's done nothing but stare at
          you since we've arrived.

Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table
in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed
pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with
gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur...

                    FRODO
          Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
          he?

                    BUTTERBUR
          He's one of them Rangers; they're
          dangerous folk they are, wandering the
          wilds. What his right name is, I never
          heard, but round here he's known as
          Strider.

                    FRODO
              (to himself)
          Strider.

BENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE
RING.

                                                            47.



CLOSE ON: FRODO

Sweat runs down his brow.   The Strange hum of the Ring spills
into the Soundtrack.

"Baggins...Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's
head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:

                    PIPPIN
          Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's
          over there...

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN

sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.   Frodo leaps to his
feet and pushes his way towards the bar.

                    PIPPIN
              (loudly)
          Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin
          once removed, on his mother's side and my
          third cousin twice removed on his
          father's side...if you follow me.

Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.

                    FRODO
          Pippin!

                    PIPPIN
          Steady on, Frodo!

Pippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls
to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all
the attention turns to Frodo...

                                                      CLOSE ON:

The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to
hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto
his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp
intake of breath...followed by total silence.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. BREE COUNTRYSIDE -- NIGHT

The RINGWRAITHS turn sharply in their saddles...Instantly
aware that the ring is being worn. They spur their horses
towards the distant lights of Bree.

INT. "PRANCING PONY" INN -- NIGHT

Sam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly;
the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into
excited babble.

                                        IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

                                                      ANGLE ON:

FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring:
THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow
motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative
quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow
motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is
hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE
EYE, wreathed in flames.

VOICE OF SAURON

There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death...
FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately

          I carry nothing.

          Not nearly frightened enough. I know
          what hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound
          of a noise in the corridor. Strider
          deftly draws his sword.

The door bursts open and Sam, Merry and Pippin appear on the
doorway. Sam is Squaring off with is fists, Merry brandishes

          Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the

          them without question, one by one falling
          into darkness and now they are slaves to
          his will.

Strider looks from the window as the Ringwraiths gallop down

Hobbits, his face lit faintly by the Glowing Embers of the

Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking
his head.

blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist,
sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror,
throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in
on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head...

Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting
the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into
his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a
chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any
longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He

Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world...he looks
upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE:
Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and
Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand
towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's
trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the
ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.
The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo
with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger
sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the
RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch
in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea
of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint
image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.
With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off
his finger...

top of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. He
looks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep. The MOTH
flutters close to Gandalf. His hand suddenly moves at

close to his face and opens it. The moth sits on the palm of
his hand as Gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue.

The dead trees of Isengard are fed into roaring
furnaces...molten metal pours into casts...red hot metal,
beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths...armor and weapons are
forged from the great furnaces. Saruman strides among the
ORCS and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes
its birthing membrane...this is LURTZ, who rises up to stand
before his master.

          No. He is passing into the shadow world,

Without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow
water and thunders across the Ford. The 9 Ringwraiths pull up
short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water. The white
horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to
defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford.

                    WITCH KING
          Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws

THE GROUND SUDDENLY TREMBLES...A MIGHTY ROAR FILLS THE AIR!

Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water
flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had
burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing
white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in
terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing

              (slightly embarrassed)
          No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls
          to the edge of the Balcony.

                    FRODO
          I thought you wanted to see the Elves,
          Sam?



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    SAM
          I do...

                    FRODO
          More than anything.

                    SAM
          I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf
          wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this
          far, to Rivendell...and I thought...
          seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
          off soon. Off home.

                    FRODO
          You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          ...we did what we set out to do. Frodo
          opens his hand, the Ring sits in his
          Palm.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am
          ready to go home.

EXT. ELROND'S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- DAY

Gandalf and Elrond watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony,

                    ELROND
          His strength returns.

                    GANDALF
          That wound will never fully heal. He will
          carry it the rest of his life.

                    ELROND
          And yet to have come so far still bearing
          the Ring...the hobbit has shown
          extraordinary resilience to its evil.

                    GANDALF
          It is a burden he should never have to
          had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

                    ELROND
          Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's
          forces are massing in the east. His eye
          is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you
          tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of
          allies grows thin.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          69.
CONTINUED:


                    GANDALF
          His treachery runs deeper than you know.
          By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
          with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army
          in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
          can move in Sunlight and cover great
          distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
          the Ring.

Elrond turns and walks away...

                    ELROND
          This evil cannot be concealed by the
          power of the Elves...We do not have the
          strength to fight both Mordor and
          Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay
          here.

Gandalf turns and looks out the window.

Sounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through
Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This peril belongs to all Middle earth.
          They must decide how to end it. Not just
          for themselves but for those who come
          after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          The time of the Elves is over. My people
          are leaving these shores. Who will you
          look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
          They hide in their mountains seeking
          riches. They care nothing for the
          troubles of others.

                    GANDALF
          It is in Men that we must place our hope.

                    ELROND
          Men? Men are weak.      The race of Men is
          failing. The blood     of Numenor is all but
          spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten.
          It is because of men    the Ring survives.

FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off
Sauron's finger. Elrond reacts.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I was there, Gandalf...I was there three
          thousand years ago when Isildur took the
          ring.

                                                               70.



FLASH INSERT: ISILDUR PICKS UP THE RING AND STARES AT IT,

ENTRANCED.

                       ELROND
             I was there the day the strength of Men
             failed.

             volcano.

                       ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
             I let Isildur into the heart of Mount
             Doom, where the ring was forged: the one
             place it could be destroyed.

FLASH INSERT: ELROND AND ISILDUR STAND BEFORE THE FIRES OF

MT. DOOM.

                       ELROND
             Cast it into the fire...destroy it!

CLOSE ON: ISILDUR...CAPTIVATED BY THE RING.

                         ISILDUR
             No.

Isildur turns and walks away

                         ELROND
             Isildur!!

INT. ENROND'S CHAMBER, RIVERDELL -- DAY

Elrond turns to Gandalf.

                       ELROND
             It should have ended that day, but evil
             was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the
             Ring...and the line of Kings was broken.
             There's no strength left in the world of
             Men. They're scattered, divided,
             leaderless.

          There is one who could unite them, one
          who could re claim the thrown of Gondor.

                    ELROND
          He turned from that path a long time ago.
          He has chosen exile.

INT. ELROND'S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- NIGHT

Strider watches from the shadows...as Boromir strolls through
the darkened gallery. Boromir's eyes are drawn to an old
Fresco on the wall...depicting Isildur defeating Sauron.
Boromir looks with Wonderment at Narsil, the Broken Blade of
Elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth.

                    BOROMIR
              (quiet awe)
          The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut
          the Ring from Sauron's hand. Boromir
          picks up the sword and gently touches the
          Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood
          appears on Boromir's finger...

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Still sharp.

Boromir senses Strider's presence...he looks from the blade
to Strider, as if sensing a connection.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          But no more than a broken heirloom.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          replaces the Broken blade, but it
          clatters to the floor. Boromir walks
          away, leaving Strider sitting alone.

Close on: Strider picks up the broken hilt, as Arwen appears
behind him.

                    ARWEN
          Why do you fear the past? You are
          Isildur's heir...not Isildur himself. You
          are not bound to his fate.

                    STRIDER
          The same blood flows in my veins...the
          same weakness...

Night falls upon the beautiful valley of Rivendell... still
and quiet.

EXT. RIVENDELL WATERFALL -- NIGHT

Strider and Arwen stand upon a stone bridge...the Evenstar at
Arwen's breast shines in the moonlight.

                    ARWEN

          Renech I lu I erui govannem?   Do you

          Nauthannim I ned ol reniannen.   I thought
          I had strayed into a dream.

Arwen reaches up and gently touches the Grey at Strider's
temples.

          Gwenin in enniath...u-arnech in naeth I

Arwen looks into Strider's eyes.

          Renech I Beth I pennen? Do you remember

              (quietly)
          You said you'd bind yourself to me,
          forsaking the immortal life of your

          And to that I hold. I would rather share
          one lifetime with you than face all the
          ages of this world alone. Strider looks
          down. In his hand lies the Evenstar.

                    ARWEN (CONT'D)
          I choose a mortal live.

                    STRIDER
          You cannot give me this.

          It is mine to give to whom I will, like
          my heart.

Arwen closes Strider's fingers around the jewel.

Arwen leans towards Strider, gently kissing him.

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- DAY

Elrond addresses the council...

                    ELROND
          Strangers from distant lands ... friends
          of old. You have been summoned here to
          answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth
          stands upon the brink of destruction.
          None can escape it. You will unite...or
          you will fall. Each race is bound to this
          fate...this one doom...

Frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of Middle earth,
Elrond stands before them, addressing Gandalf, Strider,
Legolas, and 20 other elves, Dwarves, and men.

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

Frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone Plinth. He
places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat.

                    BOROMIR
              (shocked)
          So it is true!

                    LEGOLAS

          Sauron's Ring! The ring of power!

          The doom of man!

                    BOROMIR
          It is a gift...a gift to the foes of
          Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has
          my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
          the forces of Mordor at bay...by the
          blood of our people are your lands kept
          safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the
          enemy...let us use it against him!

                    STRIDER
          You cannot wield it. None of us can.
          The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it
          has no other master. Boromir turns and
          looks at Strider, coolly.

                    BOROMIR
          And what would a ranger know of this
          matter?

Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively.
LEGOLAS stands...

                    LEGOLAS
          This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
          son of Arathorn. You owe him your
          allegiance.

Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply.

                    BOROMIR
              (quiet disbelief)
          Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

                    LEGOLAS
          And heir to the throne of Gondor.

                    ARAGORN

          Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas..

          Gondor needs no king.

                    GANDALF
          Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.

                    ELROND
          You have only one choice..the ring must
          be destroyed.

The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears.
Gimli suddenly stands, excited.

                    GIMLI
          Then...what are we waiting for?

Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the
ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls
backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo
winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps
in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him
with concern.

                    ELROND
          The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
          of Gloin, by any craft that we

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          here possess. The ring was made in the
          fires of Mount Doom...only there can it
          be unmade. It must be taken deep into
          Mordor, and cast back into the fiery
          chasm from whence it came. One of you
          must do this.

Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if
a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the
council in a quiet voice

                    BOROMIR
          One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
          black gates are guarded by more than just
          Orcs. There is evil there that does not
          sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
          It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
          fire and ash and dust...the very air you
          breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
          ten thousand men could you do this. It
          is folly.

                    LEGOLAS
          Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
          said? The ring must be destroyed.

                    GIMLI
          And I suppose you think you're the one to
          do it?

                    BOROMIR
          And if we fail, what then? What happens
          when Sauron takes back what is his?

Gimli leaps to his feet!

          erupts around the room. CLOSE ON:
          FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in
          slow

motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory
fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows
louder in his head.

                    GIMLI (CONT'D)
              (shouting)
          Never trust an Elf!

CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow
across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band.

                    GANDALF
          Do you not understand? While we    bicker
          among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows!
          No one will escape it. You will   all be
          destroyed, your homes burnt and   your
          families put to the sword!

CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of
his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears
his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in
a strong, clear voice.

                    FRODO
          I will take it...I will take it...I will
          take the Ring to Mordor.

Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded
faces.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (quietly)
          Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf
          rises to his feet.

                    GANDALF
          I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
          Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

                    ARAGORN
          If, by my life or death, I can protect
          you, I will.
              (kneels before Frodo)
          ...you have my sword. Aragorn steps
          forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli.

          And you have my bow.

                    GIMLI
          And my axe.

Boromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo.

                    BOROMIR
          You carry the fate of us all, little one.

Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          If this is indeed the will of the
          Council, then Gondor will see it done.

Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle
earth stand at his side.

                    SAM
              (unseen)
          Here!

A Sudden Noise...Sam pops up from behind a Bush!

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me.

                    ELROND
          No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to
          separate you...even when he is summoned
          to a secret council and you are not.

Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush!

                    MERRY
          Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
          send us home tied up in a sack to stop
          us.

                    PIPPIN
          Anyway...you need people of intelligence
          on this sort of
          mission...quest...thing...

          Well, that rules you out, Pip.

ELROND SURVEYS THE GROUP

                    ELROND

          Nine companions ... so be it.

          You shall be the "Fellowship of the ring"

INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM, RIVERDELL---DAWN

Close on: An old sword sliding out of a shabby leather
Scabbard...its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold
and bright.

                    BILBO
          My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!

Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo.

                    FRODO
          It's so light!

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
          The blade glows blue when Orcs are
          close...and it's times like that, my lad,
          when you have to be extra careful.

Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
          as a feather, and as hard as dragon
          scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
          on.

CLOSE ON: Frodo peels off his shirt... revealing The Ring on
the Chain around his neck.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (entranced)
          Oh! My old Ring... Frodo frowns as Bilbo
          moves toward him.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I should very much like to hold it again,
          one last time. Bilbo reaches forward,
          eyes locked on the ring.

CONTINUED:


Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second
he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony,
groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo
falters...his eyes filling with tears.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Oh!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (sad)
          I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,
          my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry
          this burden. I'm sorry for everything.

Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him.

turbulent waters...the misty mountains rise sharply to their
left.

                    GANDALF (V.O.)
          We must hold to his course west of the
          misty Mountains for forty days. If our
          luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still
          be open to us. From there, our road

          Thanks.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf....

                    GIMLI
          If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
          which I note they have not, I would say
          we are taking the long way round.
          Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
          Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
          royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks
          that is a bad idea.

                    GANDALF
          No, Gimli. I would not take the road
          through Moria unless I had no other
          choice.

Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws
down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to
the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a
distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying
smoke in the wind.

                    SAM
          What is that?

                    GIMLI
          Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud.

                    BOROMIR

          little cover

there is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at
Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark
shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is
heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the
south. Gandalf staggers to his feet.

                    GANDALF
              (worried)
          Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is
          being watched.

Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing
towards a high mountain pass.

The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. CLOSE ON: Frodo
slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring
falls on the ground... CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the
snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands,
the ring dangling before his eyes. He seems to grow in
stature, as if absorbing its power. Aragorn warily approaches
Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as
if transfixed.

                     ARAGORN
          Boromir?

                    BOROMIR
          It is a strange fate that we should

Saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship
like thunder. A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside
above them. Frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche
thunders down towards them! The Fellowship throw themselves
against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge.
LEGOLAS pulls Gandalf to safety. Aragorn shields Frodo and
Sam as snow piles around them. Within moments, the pass is

Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and

luminous silver running through the stone.

Black Rippling rings slowly fan out. Pippin is about to
throw another stone, but Aragorn grabs his arm.

                    ARAGORN
              (ominous)
          Do not disturb the water.

Aragorn watches anxiously as the Ripples appear to grow....he
exchanges a look with Boromir.

Aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword. Gandalf gives up in
despair...he sits down beside Frodo. Close on: Frodo peers at
the Elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of
comprehension.

                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          It's a riddle...

Gandalf raises his eyebrows...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (explaining)
          Speak, friend, and enter.   What's the
          Elvish for friend?

                    GANDALF
          Oh...mellon.

With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and
two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness
deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness,
something in the water stirs....

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a
Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the
mountain.

                    GIMLI
          So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
          hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
          fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
          This, my friend, is the home of my
          cousin, Balin...and they call this a
          Mine...
              (snorting)
          A mine!

A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights    the chamber...
The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf    Skeletons are
strewn about, clearly the dead of some old    battle...the
rusting armor and shields are peppered with    arrows and axes.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           87.
CONTINUED:


                    BOROMIR
              (grimly)
          This is no mine...it's a tomb!

                    GIMLI
              (in horror)
          Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a
          crude arrow out of a skeleton.

                     LEGOLAS
          Goblins!

The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the
Entrance.

                    BOROMIR
          We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should
          never have come here.

EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous
Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him
towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush
forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls
him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20
more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils
as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the
creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is
flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature.
Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into
Boromir's arms.

                    GANDALF
          Into the mines!

                     BOROMIR
          Legolas!

Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a
few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of
the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from
the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many
Coiling arms seize the large doors.

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away,
creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face.
Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the
Fellowship into Pitch Blackness.

CONTINUED:


A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy
Glow across the old wizards face.

                    GANDALF
              (ominous)
          We now have but one choice...we must face
          the long dark of Moria. Be on your
          guard...there are older and fouler things
          than the Orcs in the deep places of the
          world.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. NEW CHAMBER, MORIA -- NIGHT

WIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above
deep mine workings.

                    GANDALF
          Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
          the other side. Let us hope that our
          presence will go unnoticed.

INT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN -- NIGHT

They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf
cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are
strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in
dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK -- NIGHT

The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into
dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning.

                    GANDALF
          I have no memory of this place.

LATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf
sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of
him. He appears to be in some kind of trance.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind
them.

                    PIPPIN
          Are we lost?

                    MERRY
          No. I don't think we are.   Shhhh,
          Gandalf's thinking.

                    PIPPIN
          Merry!

                    MERRY
          What?

                    PIPPIN
          I'm hungry.

Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the
darkness. Frodo is nervous...he approaches Gandalf.

                    FRO DO
              (whispers)
          There's something down there.

                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          It's Gollum.

                    FRODO
          Gollum!

                    GANDALF
          He's been following us for three days.

TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.

                    FRODO
              (disbelieving)
          He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?

                    GANDALF
          Escaped...or was set loose. And now the
          Ring has drawn him here...he will never
          be rid of his need for it. He hates and
          loves the ring, as he hates and loves
          himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.
          Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before
          the ring came to him, before it drove him
          mad.

Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is
large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice.

CONTINUED: (2)


                    FRODO
             (grim)
         It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
         had the chance.

                   GANDALF
         Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
         hand. Many that live deserve death, and
         some that die deserve life. Can you give
         it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         Do not be too eager to deal out death in
         judgment...even the very wise cannot see
         all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
         has some part to play yet, for good or
         ill, before this is over. The pity of
         Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

                   FRODO
         I wish the ring had never come to me...I
         wish none of this had happened.

                   GANDALF
         So do all who live to see such times, but
         that is not for them to decide. All we
         have to decide is what to do with the
         time that is given to us. There is a note
         of finality in Gandalf's voice.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         There are other forces at work in this
         world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
         Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
         which case, you also were meant to have
         it...and that is an encouraging thought,
             (sudden brightness)
         Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points
         at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship
         scramble to their feet.

                   MERRY
             (relieved)
         He's remembered!

                   GANDALF
         No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
         down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
         always follow your nose!
             (laughs)
         Ye s...

                                                               91.



INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and
empty space. Gandalf pauses...

                    GALADRIEL
          Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf
          taps his staff...for a brief moment a
          light

blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.    Great shadows
spring up and flee...

                    GANDALF
          Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
          of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief
          sight of a vast roof, far above

their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls,
polished and smooth as glass.

                    SAM
          Well, there's an eye opener and no
          mistake!

Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows
are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the
doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...

                    GANDALF
          Gimli!!

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. BALIN'S TOMB, MORIA -- DAY

Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near
the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the
far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls
directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a
single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great
slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...

                    GIMLI
          No...no...oh, no!

Gimli sobs.

Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto
the white stone slab.

            "Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
            Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had
            feared.

Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from
the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and
appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and
break as he opens it...

                      LEGOLAS
                (urgent whisper to Argorn)
            We must move on, we cannot linger.

                      GANDALF
                (reading)
            "They have taken the Bridge and the
            second hall: we have barred the
            gates...but cannot hold them for
            long...the ground shakes...drums in the
            deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves
            in the dark. Will no- one save us? They
            are coming."

Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against
the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton
tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin
before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as
the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing
loudly!

INT. MORIA CAVERNS -- DAY

Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.

                      GANDALF
                (angry)
            Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
            time and rid us of your stupidity!

ANGLE ON:    PIPPIN, CHASTENED.

They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths
below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of
Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts
nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries...
Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...

                       SAM
                (worried)
            Mr. Frodo!

Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's
Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing
blade!

                     LEGOLAS
          Orcs !

                    ARAGORN
              (to the hobbits)
          Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir
catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in
his eyes.

                    BOROMIR
          They have a cave troll!

Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the
tomb.

                    GIMLI
              (yelling)
          Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
          Moria who still draws breath!

BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments,
and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave
troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in
2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of
Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into
Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The
cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles
backwards...the huge club descends for the killing
blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword
slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back,
spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a
sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation
he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels
over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it
too, drops.

                    SAM
          I think I'm getting the hang of this.

The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest
with his spear.

                     FRODO
          Aragorn!   Aragorn!

Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip
and slammed against the wall.

                    ARAGORN
              (shocked yell)
          Frodo!!

The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee,
bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas
fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn
rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo
appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits
looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge
breath.

                    SAM
          He's alive!

                    FRODO
          I'm alright. I'm not hurt.

                    ARAGORN
          You should be dead. That spear would've
          skewered a wild boar!

                    GANDALF
          I think there's more to this hobbit than
          meets the eye.

Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll
Spear did not pierce the mithril."

                    GIMLI
          Mithril! You are full of surprises,
          Master Baggins.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM     the sound of the drums rings out again!
Gandalf turns to the others.

                    GANDALF
          To the bridge of Khazad-dum!

They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start
scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches!
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army
that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills
the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the
pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back
Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the
darkness.

                    BOROMIR
          What is this new devilry?

A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the
hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...

                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!

INT. STAIRWAY OF KHASAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY

The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great
40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a
blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP
of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a
dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his
staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.

                    GANDALF
          Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is
          near.

Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Do as I say; swords are no more use here.

THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up
Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE,

Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.

                    GIMLI
          Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes
          through the wall and spreads its vast
          wings.

INT. BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship run into a hall...the floor is split with
fissures that spit flame.

                    GANDALF
              (yelling)
          Over the bridge! Fly!

They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb
or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship
recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the
last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the
Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks
back in horror:

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You cannot pass!

                    FRODO
              (alarmed yell)
          Gandalf!

                    GANDALF
              (yelling)
          I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
          wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
          fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.

Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and
draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.
Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow
bridge.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes
          at Gandalf with its Sword of

flame...Gandalf blocks with his sword...a ringing clash and
the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
              (booming)
          You shall not pass!! The Balrog places
          one foot onto the bridge. Aragorn and
          Boromir race forward, swords drawn.

GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons up his LAST RESERVES OF
STRENGTH!

CONTINUED:

He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of
white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge
breaks... right at Balrog's feet. The stone bridge drops away
into the gulf...from under the Balrog. For a moment, the
great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down:
in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. Slow motion: As
the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... Slow
motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's
knees, dragging him over the brink! Gandalf just manages to
hand on by his fingertips

                    FRODO
              (screaming)
          Gandalf!

                    GANDALF
              (fierce)
          Fly, you fools!

CLOSE ON: Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away...
following the Balrog into the bottomless Abyss! Frodo cries
out! Boromir scoops him up and carries him away.

                     FRODO
          No!

                    ARAGORN
          By nightfall these hills will be swarming
          with Orcs! We must reach the woods of

forest can be seen...Lothlorien!

EXT. EDGE OF LOTHLORIEN--DUSK

WIDE ON: The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with
yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by
silver pillars...the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks
nervously around...

                    GIMLI
          Stay close, young hobbits..they say a
          Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf-
          witch of terrible power. All who look
          upon her fall under her spell...

Frodo hesitates...a STRANGE VOICE whispers in his head...

The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES.
Deadly arrows aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the Elvish
captain steps forward... he looks at Gimli with disdain.

          The dwarf breathes so loud we could have
          shot him in the dark.

              (Elvish: with subtitles)
          Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your
          help. We need your protection.

                    GIMLI
          Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We
          should go back.

                    HALDIR
          You have entered the realm of the Lady of
          the Wood. You cannot go back.

Haldir's eyes lock onto Frodo.

          Come, she is waiting.

Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top.   They look with
wonderment at the vista spread before them.

Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of
the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees,
taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the
mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of
the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east
of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale
gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land
appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,
it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies
on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie
beyond.

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls
are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the
trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its
crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair
is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no
sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady
of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless,
unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...

                    CELEBORN
          Eight there are, yet nine there were set
          out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is
          Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with
          him.

Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
              (softly aloud)
          ...he has fallen into shadow. Galadriel
          looks to Aragorn.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          The Quest stands upon the edge of a
          knife. Stray but a little and it will
          fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope
          remains while the company is true.

Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go
          now and rest for you are weary with
          sorrow and much toil. Galadriel's eyes
          turn to Frodo...her voice fades.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          Tonight you will sleep in peace.

          GALADRIEL as she is on the other

side... Powerful, divine...no longer of this world..a
Piercing white light surrounds her.

EXT. CARAS GALADHON LAWN -- NIGHT

Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a
pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on
soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL
SINGING drifts down from the trees above.

                    LEGOLAS
              (sadly)
          A lament for Gandalf...

                    MERRY
          What do they say about him?

                    LEGOLAS
          I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
          the grief is still too near. Boromir is
          sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.

                     ARAGORN
          Take some rest..these borders are well
          protected.

Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face.
Aragorn kneels down beside him.

                    BOROMIR
          I will find no rest here. I heard her
          voice inside my head...she spoke of my
          father and the fall of Gondor, and she
          said to me: "Even now, there

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          is hope left. But I cannot see it...it
          is long since we had any hope.

CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          My father is a noble man, but his rule is
          failing and our..our people lose faith.
          He looks to me to make things right...and
          I would do it, I would see the glory of
          Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
          Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
          glimmering like a spike of pearl and
          silver, its banners caught high in the
          morning breeze...have you ever been
          called home by the clear ringing of
          silver trumpets?

                    ARAGORN
          I have seen the white city..long ago.

Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes
heart,

                      BOROMIR
            One day our paths will lead us there, and
            the tower guards shall take up the call
             "the Lords of Gondor have returned."

Aragorn returns Boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet
sadness only when Boromir looks away.

LATER....

The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Gimli is snoring
loudly. CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the
lawn. CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by
instinct. GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the
moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her...as if drawn by
an invisible force.

EXT. GALADRIELS GLADE, LORTHLORIEN -- NIGHT

Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits
a shallow Silver Basin. Galadriel leads Frodo into the small
Glade.

                      GALADRIEL
            Will you look into the mirror? Frodo
            looks with apprehension at the silver
            basin.

                      FRODO
                (warily)
            What will I see?

Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a
glow rises from the water.

                      GALADRIEL
            Even the wisest cannot tell for the
            mirror shows many things...things that
            were ..things that are...and some things
            that have not yet come to pass.

Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers     into the
glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into     the water...
suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure     of an old
man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long      road. Frodo
leans closer to the mirror's surface...

                                                          103.



CLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO!

FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.

                    FRODO
              (joyous)
          Gandalf!

Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo
reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.
Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision
shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The
image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings
burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting
and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party
tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to
grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing
him entirely.

IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields
and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching
smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the
Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot-
stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-
hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black
abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable
to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches
above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire
erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself
away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light
instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his
senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue,
unmoved, untouched by the horror.

                    GALADRIEL
          I know what it is you saw...for it is
          also in my mind. It is the future,
          Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
          you should fail.

Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in
his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at
Galadriel.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          The fellowship is breaking. It has
          already begun. He will try to take the
          ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
          one, it will destroy them all.

                    FRODO (V.O.)
          If you ask it of me, I will give you the
          One Ring.

                    GALADRIEL
          You offer it to me freely...I do not deny
          that my heart has greatly desired this.

Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's
eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
          a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
          terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the
          Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
          the earth...all shall love me and
          despair! Frodo takes a step away from
          Galadriel...

Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more,
clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
              (gently)
          I pass the test.
              (laughs)
          I will diminish and go into the west and
          remain Galadriel. Frodo's confidence
          drains away.

                    FRODO
          I cannot do this alone...

                    GALADRIEL
          You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear
          a ring of power is to be alone. This task
          was appointed to you, and if you do not
          find a way, no one will.

Frodo realizes what her message is.

                    FRODO
          Then I know what I must do. It's
          just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel
          kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at
          him intently.

                    GALADRIEL
          Even the smallest person can change the
          course of the future.

The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close
over it.

                    SARUMAN (V.O.)
              (smiles)
          They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
          Powers ... tortured and mutilated...a
          ruined and terrible form of life. And
          now...perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.
          Whom do you serve?

                    LURTZ
              (gutteral rasp)
          Saruman.

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- DAY

QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored...Breastplate...Leg
guards, Helmet...a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. The URUK-
HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy
ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared
on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN address a crowd of 200
fully armed URUK-HAI.

                    SARUMAN
          Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
          are found. You do not know pain. You do
          not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.
          Saruman turns to Lurtz.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
              (coldly)
          One of the Halflings carries something of
          great value...bring him to me...alive and
          unspoiled...kill the others.

EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY

Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast,
their powerful legs carrying them at speed.

EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK--DAWN

The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from
the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves
quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small
Crystal Phial.

                    GALADRIEL
          Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
          light of Earendil, our most beloved star.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone,
watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo
still hears her voice...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          May it be a light for you in dark places,
          when all other lights go out.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven
boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees
slowly give way to a brown and withered land.

EXT. FOREST -- DAY

The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly
purpose.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale
sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.

EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN

The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky
gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly
paddling in the stern.

                    ARAGORN
              (quietly)
          Frodo.

Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide
on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot
pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of
Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power
and majesty.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          The Argonath...

Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the
silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (deeply moved)
          Long have I desired to look upon the
          kings of old...my kin.

The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes
them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to
reveal a large lake only a mile down river...

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.

                    ARAGORN
          We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
          boats and continue on foot..we approach
          Mordor from the North.

                    GIMLI
              (gloomy)
          Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
          our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
          labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
          after that gets even better...a
          festering, stinking marshland, far as the
          eye can see.

                    ARAGORN
          That is our Road...I suggest you take
          some rest and recover your strength,
          Master Dwarf.

                    GIMLI
              (indignant)
          Recover my...

Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.

                    LEGOLAS
          We should leave now.

                    ARAGORN
          No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
          must wait for cover of darkness.

                    LEGOLAS
          It is not the Eastern shore that worries
          me.

Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          A shadow and a threat has been growing in
          my mind. Something draws near, I can
          feel it.

CONTINUED:


Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means.
Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling
at Gimli's feet...

                    MERRY
          Where's Frodo?

Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his
eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp
bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!

EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND!
Frodo freezes....

                    BOROMIR
              (quietly)
          None of us should wander alone; you least
          of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?

Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I know why you seek solitude. You
          suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
          sure you do not suffer needlessly?

Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be
heard

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Let me help you. There are other ways,
          Frodo..other paths that we might take.

                    FRODO
          I know what you would say, and it would
          seem like wisdom but for the warning of
          my heart.

                     BOROMIR
          Warning?   Against what?

Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself
up.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
          fear drive us to destroy what hope we
          have...don't you see that is madness?

                    FRODO
          There is no other way.

                    BOROMIR
          I ask only for the strength to defend my
          people.
              (angrily drops the wood he has
               collected)
          If you would but lend me the ring...

                    FRODO
          No. . .

Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.

                    BOROMIR
          Why do you recoil?   I am no thief.

                     FRODO
              (wary)
          You are not yourself.

                    BOROMIR
          What chance do you think you have? They
          will find you, they will take the ring
          and you will beg for death before the
          end.

Frodo turns to leave.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          You fool! It is not yours save by
          unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
          It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
          me the ring.

Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo
has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.

                    FRODO DISAPPEARS
          Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into
          thin air!

                    BOROMIR
          I see your mind...you will take the ring
          to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
          your death and the death of us all.

            Boromir stumbles and falls. His body
            shakes as if in the Throes of a
            fit...slowly he comes to.

                      BOROMIR (CONT'D)
                (Disoriented)
            Frodo! Frodo! What have I done. Please,

EXT. SEEING SEAT -- DAY

                                          IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy
shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's
distraught voice carries from another dimension:

                      BOROMIR (O.S.)
            I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...

Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone
pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the
throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around
him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to
shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope
towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of
holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from
Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships
sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in
motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes
against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills
Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,
tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!

SUDDENLY!   SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF

LIGHT.

SAURON (V.O.)

(IN BLACK SPEECH)

They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down
the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,
seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring
off his finger...

EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.

                                                            111.



AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!

Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.

                       ARAGORN
          Frodo?

                     FRODO
              (numb)
          It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves
          towards Frodo...

                    ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Where is the ring?

Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the
movement.

                       FRODO
          Stay away!

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo...I swore to protect you.

                    FRODO
          Can you protect me from yourself?

Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It
glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Would you destroy it?

                    ARAGORN
              (kneeling to Frodo)
          I would have gone with you to the end...
          into the very fires of Mordor.

                    FRODO
          I know...Look after the others,
          especially Sam...he will not understand.

Aragorn freezes!   He draws his sword.

                     ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Go, Frodo!

Frodo hesitates.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (yells)
          Run! Run!!

Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto
Amon Hen behind Aragorn!

Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he
brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as
others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,
away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst
the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he
is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into
the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.

EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY

Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet
thunder down behind him.

                       SAM
          Mr. Frodo!

Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his
URUKS.

                     LURTZ
          Find the Halflings ... find the
          halflings!

Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a
tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the
forest rings out.

                    MERRY (O.S.)
              (urgent whisper)
          Frodo!

Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few
feet away.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Hide here, quick!

                       PIPPIN
          Come on...

Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great
sadness in his eyes...

                    PIPPIN (CONT'D)
          What's he doing?

Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.        Understanding.

          He's leaving.

                        PIPPIN
          No!

Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at
his arm.

                        MERRY
          Pippin!

THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and
Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards
the lake.

                    LEGOLAS
          The horn of Gondor!

                        ARAGORN
          Boromir!

Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling
URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear
guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he
tries to protect Merry and Pippin...

                        BOROMIR
          Run!   Run!

Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's
chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another
arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and
Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.

                        MERRY & PIPPIN
          Aaaaagh!      Boromir! Boromir!

Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn
charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock
into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races
towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI
arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI
lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven
in two.

                    BOROMIR
              (painful gasp)
          They took the little ones...

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
              (panicked)
          Frodo...where is Frodo?

                    ARAGORN
          I let Frodo go.

Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.

                    BOROMIR
          Then you did what I could not.   I tried
          to take the ring from him.

                    ARAGORN
          The ring is beyond our reach now.

                    BOROMIR
          Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed
          you all.

                    ARAGORN
          No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
          have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to
          bind Boromir's wound.

                    BOROMIR
          Leave it! It is over...the world of Men
          will fall and all will come to darkness
          and my city to ruin..Aragorn..

                    ARAGORN
          I do not know what strength is in my
          blood, but I swear to you... I will not
          let the White City fall, nor your people
          fail...

                    BOROMIR
          Our people...our people...

Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.   Boromir's
fingers tighten around the hilt.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I would have followed you, my
          brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn
          lays Boromir down. He is dead.

                    ARAGORN
          Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends

           Legolas and Gimli appear behind

                     ARAGORN (CONT'D)
           They will look for his coming from the
           white tower...but he will not return.

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish
Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as
hard as he can through the forest...

                        SAM
           Mr. Frodo!

Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the
camera moves in on the ring.

                     FRODO (V.O.)
           I wish the ring had never come to me..I
           wish none of this had happened...

Tears fall down Frodo's face...

                     GANDALF (V.O.)
           So do all who lie to see such times...but
           that is not for them to decide. All we
           have to decide is what to do with the
           time that is given us.

With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his
vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish
boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs
toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.

                     SAM
               (anguished)
           Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in
           the boat, paddling steadfastly away from
           the

shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on the
wind. Frodo whispers to himself

                        FRODO
           No, Sam.

Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.

SPLASH!   FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the
water.

CONTINUED:


                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Go back,Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.

Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

                    SAM
          Of course you are...and I'm coming with
          you!

                    FRODO
          You can't swim.

Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...

                       FRODO (CONT'D)
                 (frightened)
          Sam!

Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.

                     SAM
          I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.
              (fierce passion)
          "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
              (sobs)
          And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.

                    FRODO
              (crying)
          Oh, Sam!

Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Come on then..

The two Hobbits row through the water...

EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL -- DAY

Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing
water...Boromir's body slides under camera.

He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his
chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat
drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls
of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    LEGOLAS
          If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
          Sam before nightfall.

Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small
Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and
Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react.
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          You mean not to follow them...

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

                    GIMLI
          Then it has all been in vain...the
          fellowship has failed.

                    ARAGORN
          Not if we hold true to each other. We
          will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
          torment and death, not while we have
          strength left.

Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it
on.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          Leave all that can be spared behind...
          CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his
          eye.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (grimly)
          We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

                       GIMLI
          Yes!   Ha!

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods,
following the URUK-HAI trail.

EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP -- DAY

Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.

A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the
mountains....MORDOR!

                     FRODO
          Mordor!   I hope the others find a safer
          road.

                    SAM
              (simply)
          Strider'll look after them.

                    FRODO
          I don't suppose we'll ever see them
          again.

                    SAM
          We may yet, Mr. Frodo.   We may.

                     FRODO
          Sam?

Frodo looks at Sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, Sam is undeterred...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're with me.

towards the MOUNTAINS.

SETTLE ON: FRODO and SAM in a FILTHY CULVERT.
SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake . . . His
hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK ...

A SUDDEN HISS! FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers
at them with GLEAMING EYES.

                        GOLLUM
             Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We
             must go, yes, we must go at once!

SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO . . .

             Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?

CLOUD.

                        SAM (cont'd)
             It must be getting late.

                        FRODO
             No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
             The days are growing darker.

The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE
ECHOES down the VALLEY.

                        GOLLUM
             Come on, must go, no time ...

                        SAM
             Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.

                        GOLLUM
             . . . no time to lose, silly.

SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in
his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to
FRODO.

                        SAM
             Here.

                        FRODO

BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie

           We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
           taken over management of Isengard.

WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and
jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the
TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them,
ALARMING all but GANDALF.



                     TREEBEARD
           Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad

           stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
           be managed here ... Locked in his tower.

           And there Saruman must remain, under your

                 (urgent)
            Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!

PIPPIN doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth
black stone ...

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
            Quickly, now!

RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF ... who
immediately smothers it in his cloak.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks back at PIPPIN . . . troubled.

EXT. EDORAS - DAY

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EVENING

WIDE: A ROARING FIRE; a LAMB ROASTING on SPI; LONG TABLES
laden with FOOD; BARRELS of WINE; a banquet is-laid ready for
the returning soldiers.

                       THEODEN
            Tonight we remember those who gave their
            blood to defend this country. Hail the
            victorious dead!

ANGLE ON: Amidst the cheering crowd, EOWYN moves towards
ARAGORN . . . As she proffers the CHALICE their eyes meet.

                       EOWYN
            Westu Aragorn hal.

EOWYN watches as ARAGORN moves away . . . a voice speaks in her
ear.

                        THEODEN
             I am happy for you.

EOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THEODEN follows her gaze.

                       THEODEN (cont'd)
             He is an honourable man.

                        EOWYN
                  (smiling)
             You are both honourable men.

                        THEODEN
             It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
             people to victory.

EOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed'by his tone.

                       T HE ODE N ( co nt' d)
             Don't listen to me - you are young, and
             tonight is for you.

ANGLE ON: EOWYN watches concerned as her UNCLE moves away.

ANGLE ON: MERRY & PIPPIN are in full voice, on top of one of the
TABLES . . . both hold very large mugs of ALE in their hands.

                        MERRY & PIPPIN
                  (singing)
             Oh, you can search - up and down
             As many lands as can be found
             But you'll never find a beer so brown
             As the one we drink in our home town
             You can keep your fancy ales
             You can drink them by the flagon
             But the only brew, for the brave and true,
             Comes from the Green Dragon!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF laughing and clapping the HOBBITS. ARAGORN
steps up beside him, SMILING at the floorshow.

                    ARAGORN
          No news of Frodo?

                     GANDALF
          No word ... nothing.

                     ARAGORN
          We till have time.

GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN.

                    ARAGORN (cont'd)
          Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF watches his friend's face . . . seeking reassurance.

                    GANDALF
          Do we know that?

                     ARAGORN
               (gently)
          What does your heart tell you?

                     GANDALF
               (with a small smile)
          That Frodo is alive.
               (to himself)
          Yes - yes, he is alive.

EXT. MORGUL VALLEY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a
stagnant pool. SMEAGOL lies nearby, muttering in his sleep.

                     SMEAGOL
          Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
          stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them
          ... kill them both!

SMEAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT,
eyes wide in horror.

                     SME AGO L (c ont' d)
          No!

                  (hissed whisper)
             Shhh! Quiet!

SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT
face of GOLLUM!

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
             Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the
SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK
. . . silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL.

                        SMEAGOL
             They knows, they knows, they suspects us.



SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S
REFLECTION.

                        GOLLUM.,               .     ,.·
             What is it saying,.my Precious, my love? Is .
             Smeagol losing his nerve??

                        SMEAGOL                 :
             No! Not! Never!! Smeagol hates nasty
             Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see: them -
             dead!

                         GOLLUM
             And we will . . ,- Smeagol did it once. . .
                  (sly)
             . . . He can do it again.

FLASH INSERT: SMEAGOL choking DEAGOL . . . Fingers locked tight
around his THROAT.

                      SMEAGOL
           We must get the Precious. We must get it
           back.

                      GOLLUM
           Patience, patience, my love. First we must
           lead them to her.

                      SMEAGOL
           We lead them to the windy stairs.

                      GOLLUM
                (prompting)
           Yes, the stairs ... and then?

                        SMEAGOL
           Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until
           we come to . . .
                 (naughty excitement)
           ... the Tunnel!

                      GOLLUM
                (quiet)
           And when they go in, there's no coming out.
           She's always hungry, she always needs to
           feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy
           Orcses.

                      SMEAGOL
           And they doesn't taste very nice, does
           they, Precious?               .

                      GOLLUM
                (sinister)
           No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She
           hungers for sweeter meats . . .

CLOSE ON: SAM . . . his EYES flicker OPEN . . .

                         GOLLUM (cont'd)
           "Hobbit meat." And when She throws away the
           bones and the empty clothes, then we will
           find it . . .

                      SMEAGOL

          The Precious will be ours once the

SAM drops the POT and FLINGS himself ON TOP of GOLLUM! GOLLUM

               (crying)
          No! Not! Help! Master!

ANGLE ON: FRODO staggers over to SAM and PULLS HIM OFF
GOLLUM.

                    FRODO
          No, Sam! Leave him alone!

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM, huddled on the ground        WHIMPERING and
SOBBING.

            He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol
            and who makes up nasty lies!

SAM makes for SMEAGOL again . . . with a look of MURDEROUS
RAGE.

                       SAM
            You miserable little maggot! I'll stove
            your head in!

FRODO grabs SAM'S ARM.

            Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.

SAM pulls away from FRODO . . .

            I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I

FRODO beckons to GOLLUM.

GOLLUM turns slowly, staring at SAM through hooded, HATE-FILLED

EXT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EARLY DAWN

ARAGORN joins LEGOLAS on the STEPS to the GOLDEN HALL, oblivious
to the CHILL WIND . . . they look out across the SLEEPING CITY to
the LOOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE BEYOND . .-. DARK CLOUDS mark the sky.

                      LEGOLAS
           The stars are veiled, something stirs in
           the east . . . A sleepless malice.

LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN . . . realisation in his face.

                      LEGOLAS (cont'd)
           The eye of the enemy is moving.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - EARLY DAWN,

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN . . . he is AWAKE! He sits up . . . ANXIOUS,
FIDGETY . . .

Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING FORM
of GANDALF.

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on . . .

ANGLE ON: A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open! But
PIPPIN is undeterred . . .

MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from
GANDALF'S grasp ...

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin, are you mad?

                        PIPPIN
             I just want to look at it. Just one more

                       MERRY
             Put it back! Put - it - back!

PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED,
he gazes INTENTLY into it.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!

As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light

EYES WIDEN.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE . . . He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him . . .

THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE . . . PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.

PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
. . . He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.

                        MERRY
             Help! Someone help him!

GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . .

The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK.                                    ;


ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF

GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT'S SLUMPED HEAD.

PIPPIN is trembling ... GANDALF calms him . . .

             voice in my head.

                     GANDALF
          And what did you tell him? Speak!

                        PIPPIN
          He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he
          hurt me . . .

CLOSE ON: GANDALF stares at PIPPIN with a FRIGHTENING
INTENSITY . . .

                    GANDALF
          What did you tell him about Frodo and the
          Ring?

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAY

THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to
GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .

                     GANDALF
          There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,
          but an honest fool he remains. He told
          Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief.

GANDALF turns to look at THEODEN.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
             saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.

GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
             Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
             our enemy one thing.

The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
             not as weak as he supposed. There is
             courage still - strength enough left to
             challenge him.

THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

                                    GANDALF (cont'd)

ANGLE ON: GANDALF rounds on THEODEN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             If the beacons of Condor are lit, Rohan
             must be ready for war!

THEODEN holds GANDALF'S gaze.

           Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of
           those who did not come to ours?

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to look at THEODEN.

                      THEODEN (cont'd)
           What do we owe Gondor?

                      ARAGORN
                (low and urgent)
           I will go.

                        GANDALF
                 (hurried)
           No!

                      ARAGORN
           They must be warned.

                      GANDALF
           They will be.
                (low voice, to Aragorn)

                (louder, to all)
           Understand this . . . things are now in
           motion that cannot be undone.

GANDALF turns on his heel . . . and stares at a surpirsed
PIPPIN.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be

PIPPIN catches up to MERRY.

               (nervous)
          How far is Minas Tirith?

                     GANDALF
          Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and
          you'd better hope we don't have one of
          those on our tail.

MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN'S HAND . . .

                     MERRY
          Here - something for the road.

PIPPIN stares down at the leather-bound bundle of PIPE-WEED.

                     MERRY

. . . the BOY continues running. One by one the TREES TRANSFORM
into TALL WHITE PILLARS ...

ARWEN'S POV: The BOY now stands within a VISION of the
majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS
TIRITH.

A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves
towards the CHILD . . . the BOY runs to the FIGURE.

ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms - swinging the
LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR . . .

The figure turns to reveal ... ARAGORN, a little older,

A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp
ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS - DAY

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the
CITY - 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.

GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the
CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off . . .

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye
caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT,
FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.

                         PIPPIN                             ;
                                                            .
                  (whisper)
             It's the tree.           ,
                  (hurrying after GANDALF)
             Gandalf! Gandalf!

                       GANDALF
             Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
             the King.

GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES,
surrounded by GREEN LAWNS . . . towards a GREAT HALL benejath
the GLEAMING TOWER.                                         '
                                                            \

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
             is a steward only. A caretaker of the
             throne.

GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.

                  (quietly)
             Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
             Boromir's father. To give him news of his
             beloved son's death would be most unwise
             ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the
             Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either.
                  (hesitates)
             In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
             all, Pippin Took.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.

INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY

ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE
PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL
KINGS carved in cold STONE.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.

                        GANDALF
             Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
             Steward of Gondor.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
             with counsel.

DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES . . .

                         DENETHOR
                  (bitter)
             Perhaps you come to explain this?

DENETHOR holds up BOROMIR'S BROKEN HORN ...

                          DEN ETH OR (c ont 'd )
             Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is
             dead?

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN remembering . . .

INSERT IMAGE: BOROMIR, as URUK-HAI arrows thud into his body,
he falls to his KNEES . . .

PIPPIN starts forward unable to say nothing . . .

                       .. PIPPIN
             Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and
             me . . . he fell, defending us from many
             foes.

CLOSE ON: DENETHOR pain flickers in his eyes.

                        GANDALF
                  (hurried whisper)
             Pippin!

PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD . . .

                        PIPPIN
             I offer you my service, such as it is, in
             payment of this debt.

DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:

                         GANDALF
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Get up!
                  (a ddre ssin g D ENET HOR)
             My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
             Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
             ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
             Steward, you are charged with the defence
             of this city. Where are Condor's armies?

DENETHOR gaze turns slowly on GANDALF . . .

            You still have friends - you are not alone
            in this fight. Send word to Theoden of
            Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

                        DENETHOR
                 (softly)
            You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
            all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
            you think the eyes of the White Tower are
            blind? I have seen more than you know. With
            your left hand you would use me as a shield
            against Mordor and with your right you
            would seek to supplant me.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF looks shocked, DENETHOR'S eyes NARROW.

                      DENETHOR (cont'd)
                (contemptuous)
           I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
           yes. Word has reached my ears of this
           Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
           now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
           North - last of a ragged house, long bereft
           of Lordship.

                       GANDALF
                (stung)
           Authority is not given to you to deny the
           return of the King - Steward!

                       DENETHOR
                 (explosive)
            The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor
closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN
follows.

                      GANDALF
            Come.

GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL ... DENETHOR
slumps back into his SEAT.

INT. MINAS TIRITH, PIPPIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of
the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.

                     PIPPIN
          So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
          position . . . I mean, they don't actually
          expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?

WIDE: GANDALF STANDING QUIETLY on a BALCONY that overlooks
the GREAT CITY.

                      GANDALF
          You're in the service of the Steward now -
          you're going to have to do as you're told,
          Peregrin Took . . .

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN as he stares up at the vast NIGHT SKY.,

                     PIPPIN
          It's so quiet.

GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.



                     GANDALF
          It's the deep breath before the plunge.

                      PIPPIN
          I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
          waiting on the edge of one I can't escape
          is even worse.                                L

MOUNTAINS of MORDOR . . .

             There never was much hope.

PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small
self-deprecating smile . . .

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Just a fool's hope.

GANDALF and PIPPIN share a quiet moment as they stare out
towards the FIERY SKY over MORDOR . . .

                       GANDALF V/0
                  (grim)
             Our enemy is almost ready, his full
             strength gathered. Not only Ores, but men

ANGLE ON: GANDALF . . . he is almost talking to himself now ..
like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.


                       GANDALF
             This will be the end of Gondor as we know
             it. Here the hammerstroke will fall
             hardest.

INSERT IMAGE: The BATTLE-SCARRED CITY of OSGILIATH - last
bastion between MINAS TIRITH and MORDOR . . .

                       GANDALF V/0
             If the river is taken, if the garrison at
             Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this
             city will be gone.

            servant    . . . The one who will lead Mordor's
            armies    in war, the one they say no living
            man can    kill.

FRODO falls to the GROUND.

AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING
NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.

The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE,

ANGLE ON: 75,000 ORCS MARCHING TO WAR, just below FRODO and SAM.

                        GANDALF V/0
             This war is long planned. Sauron has hated
             the west through many ages . . . It is a
             hatred that flows from the depths of time,
             across the deeps of the Sea.

The WITCH KING SWOOPS down the VALLEY to join the HEAD of his
ARMY. He vanishes into the GLOOM - a shadow into shadow.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM peers out from his stony hiding place.

                        GOLLUM
                  (urgent)
             Come, hobbits. We climb - we must climb!

             The board is set, the pieces are moving.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH SIXTH LEVEL - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: GANDALF striding BACK STREETS of the CITY . . . so
DETERMINED and PURPOSEFUL is he, that PIPPIN has to RUN to
keep up. GANDALF suddenly stops and looks down at PIPPIN . . .

                       GANDALF
             Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to
             be done. Another opportunity for one of the
             Shire-folk to prove their great worth!

GANDALF kneels down and looks at PIPPIN earnestly, his hand
on PIPPIN'S shoulder.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             You must not fail me.

GANDALF watches as PIPPIN hurries away.

catching a STEALTHY MOVEMENT . . .

stop the advance as HUNDREDS OF ORCS cross the WIDE BRIDGE
into WEST OSGILIATH.

             Hope is kindled.

EOWYN turns and runs SMACK into ARAGORN ...

ARAGORN smiles . . . reaching past her, he lifts a cover to reveal
a SWORD, strapped to the side of the saddle of her HORSE.

                  (softly)
             The Men have found their Captain - they

                  (quietly)
             You have given us hope.

PULL BACK: to reveal THEODEN stares around at the STREETS and
PEOPLE of EDORAS . . . it is as if he knows he will not see
this place again.

SWERVES AWAY from the LIGHT, as it pierces the LOW CLOUD!

For a BRIEF MOMENT, SUNLIGHT streams through the hole onto
PELENNOR FIELDS . . . The NAZGUL circle away from the SUN RAYS,
swiftly spiralling higher and higher.

The NAZGUL defeated, GANDALF and the RANGERS ride towards the
safety of MINAS TIRITH.

             Battalions of Ores    are crossing the River.

                        IORLAS
             It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long

                        GANDALF
             Foreseen and done nothing!

             Faramir? ... This is not the first halfling

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying
STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF.

The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN.
They are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER ·
their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE - trying
not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is
HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE.

                      GOLLUM

             Get back, you. Don't touch him!

GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM
pulling him SAFELY onto the LEDGE.

GOLLUM glares down at SAM.

             Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has
             Smeagol ever done to him? Master?

their heavy pale lids.

             Here do I swear fealty and service to

             I do not think we should so lightly abandon
             the outer defences; defences that your
             brother long held intact.

                        FARAMIR
             What would you have me do?

                       DENETHOR
             I will not yield the River and Pelennor
             unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.

                        FARAMIR
             My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

                        DENETHOR
             Much must be risked in war. Is there a
             Captain here who still has the courage to
             do his Lord's will?

                  (quietly)
             You wish now that our places had been

                       FARAMIR
            Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do
            what I can in his stead.

tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN . . . he sits up and quietly
crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK.

SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD

                  (prevaricating)
             Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
             polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
             nobody else could find and they say
             "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh
             yes, my Precious, very nice.

                        SAM
             Alright, alright - you just startled me is

             Sneaking!

Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.

                        SAM
             Fine, have it your own way.

SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder.                            -

SAM rummages through his KNAPSACK, looking for a bite to eat.
FRODO sits up slowly.

           Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my

           great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
           sing of anything more terrible than wind or
           rain.

                      DENETHOR
           And why should your songs be unfit for my
           halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
           sing me a song!

PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.

                      PIPPIN V/0
           Home is behind, the world ahead,
           And there are many paths to tread.

                        ROHAN MARSHALL (0.S.)
             We have three hundred more from Fenmarch,
             Theoden, King.

THEODEN smiles grimly as he rides on.

                        DENETHOR
                  (quietly)
             Where are the riders from Snowbourne?

                        GAMLING ( O . S . )
             None have come, My Lord.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DUSK

ARAGORN joins THEODEN on a BLUFF overlooking the ENCAMPMENT
BELOW ...

CAMERA CRANES to REVEAL: THOUSANDS of MEN and HORSES! Smoke
from many small CAMP-FIRES has filled the VALLEY with a
TWILIGHT HAZE.

                         THEODEN
                  (quietly)
             Six thousand spears . . . less than half of
             what I had hoped for . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to THEODEN ...

                       ARAGORN
             Six thousand will not be enough to break
             the lines of Mordor.

                     THEODEN
          More will come.

             have till dawn. Then we must ride.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN realising what ARAGORN is saying - no
matter the numbers he must commit to war by the morning.
THEODEN nods.

The HORSES whinny loudly in the distance ... THEODEN looks up
at the MOUNTAIN which looms behind them . . .

quieten them ...

ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS and GIMLI move through the CAMP . . .

CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS looking at a group of ROHAN SOLDIERS . . .
they sit quiet and hunched ... no-one speaking ...

LEGOLAS looking toward EOMER who is unsaddling his HORSE ...

                        LEGOLAS
                  (uneasy)
             The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;.

             They grow nervous in the shadow of the
             mountain . . .

GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that
mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT
and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

                       GIMLI
             That road there - where does that lead?

                       LEGOLAS
             It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door
             under the mountain.

             That mountain is evil . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stands before the road as though transfixed
... before him a HORSE whinnies and pulls at his ropes
nervously . . .

ARAGORN POV: A GHOSTLY FIGURE seems to emerge from the gloom
... ARAGORN starts in fright as . . .

ARAGORN casts another look back at the ANCIENT STANDING
STONES before following GIMLI.

STRAP.

                        EOWYN
             There! A true Esquire of Rohan.

MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In
his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD ...

EOWYN steps back, laughing ...

                        MERRY
             Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are
sitting nearby, finishing a meal ... EOWYN ushers MERRY off.

                        EOWYN
             To the Smithy .- go!

MERRY hurries off    . . . EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.

                        EOMER
             You should not encourage him.

                        EOWYN
             And you should not doubt him.

                        EOMER
             I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach
             of his arm.

             I choose a mortal life . . . I wish I could

As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers ...
At that moment, ARAGORN wakes, his SWORD quickly in his HAND

ANGLE ON:- THEODEN looks up as ARAGORN enters.

                       THEODEN
             I take my leave.

ANGLE ON: THEODEN bows slightly to the HOODED FIGURE and
LEAVES, shooting ARAGORN a strange look as he goes ...

CLOSE ON: The FIGURE stands and pulls back the HOOD . . . to
reveal ... ELROND.

                    ARAGORN
          My Lord, Elrond.

                       ELROND
             I come on behalf of one whom I love.

ELROND'S face is ETCHED with PAIN ...

          Arwen is dying.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN receiving this news ... ASHEN-FACED.

             She will not long survive the evil that now
             spreads from Mordor.

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around
ARAGORN'S neck . . .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
             Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
             Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
             end has come.

                       ARAGORN
             It will not be our end, but his.

                         ELROND
             You ride to war, but not to victory.
             Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
             this you know - but in secret he sends
             another force which will attack from the
             river . . .

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock.

                       ELROND (cont'd)
             A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the
             South.

FLASH INSERT: A FLEET of BLACK SAILS moving along a SILVER
RIBBON of WATER .

             They will be in the city in two days . . .
             You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
             men.

                        ARAGORN
             There are none.

ELROND hesitates a BEAT ...

           There are those who dwell in the mountain.

A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS,
scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS . . .

As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S
EYE . . . The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD . . .

ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock . . .

                    ARAGORN
          Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
          them to fight? They believe in nothing.
          They answer to no-one.

                     ELROND
          They will answer to the King of Condor.

ARAGORN' S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND
draws from beneath his robes.

CLOSE ON: ELROND' S long white fingers draw the hilt of a
SWORD from the scabbard to reveal . . . a ELVEN SWORD glints in
the firelight!

ARAGORN takes the sword . . . staring at it in wonder.

          Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of
          Elendil . . .

ARAGORN draws the long blade from its sheath . . .

            than any that walks this earth.

ARAGORN looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her.

 ARAGORN                   (gentle)
             It is but a shadow and a thought that you

 GIMLI              And just where do you think you're off to?

ARAGORN looks at GIMLI - GRATEFUL for his COURAGE but
determined to go ALONE.

 ARAGORN              Not this time ... This time you must stay,
             my friend.

 LEGOLAS O.S              Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness

"What's happening?", "Where's he going?"

 GAMLING           Lord Aragorn!

 ROHAN SOLDIER O.S.           Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

 GAMLING           He leaves because there is no hope.

 THEODEN           He leaves because he must.

 GAMLING           Too few have come. We cannot defeat the

 GIMLI              What kind of an army would linger in such a

 LEGOLAS              One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of
             the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
             of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight,
             but when the time came, when Condor's need
             was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the
             darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur
             cursed them - never to rest until they had
             fulfilled their pledge.

          The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
          away.

Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of
night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.

 LEGOLAS                (translating)
          The way is shut. It was made by those who
          are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
          shut.

AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY
. . . ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING
WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and'BUCK'in terror, turning and
GALLOPING AWAY.

 THEODEN              I will say no more.

DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE
HORSES ride by . . . a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - DAY 
SAM stumbles blindly down the ANCIENT STAIRS, reckless and
uncaring, his face pale and devastated.

CLOSE ON: SAM'S FOOT slips . . .

... SUDDENLY, as if the ground has given way beneath him, SAM
is slipping and sliding dangerously OUT OF CONTROL.

ANGLE ON: SAM thudding into a LARGE ROCK, which saves him.
from tumbling headlong over the PRECIPICE.

Something catches SAM'S EYE . . . he stares, barely breathing.

 CUT TO: 
INT. SHELOB'S TUNNEL - DAY 
FRODO is running BLINDLY . . . He falls, trapped in the sticky
substance which CLINGS to him. As he lays on the ground,
unable to move, a VOICE comes to him as if froma distant-;,,
memory . . .

 GALADRIEL V/0            I give you the light of Earendil - our most
           beloved star. May it be a light for you in
           dark places when all other lights go out.

CLOSE ON: FRODO fumbles in his JACKET, FEAR growing in him
. . . he pulls out the GLASS PHIAL - his GIFT from GALADRIEL -
he holds it aloft.

 FRODO                 (stronger)
           Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!

The PHIAL flickers ... kindles into a SILVER FLAME - a BRIGHT

LOW ANGLE ON: The LIGHT instantly REVEALS a HUGE LOATHSOME
SPIDER . . . towering over FRODO!

CLOSE ON: SHELOB the SPIDER HISSES at the LIGHT! TWO great
clusters of many-windowed EYES protrude from her bulbous
head. Her LEGS are bent, with a 12 FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that
stick out like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast
bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old
BLACK HIDE is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS
. . . but her belly underneath is PALE and LUMINOUS.

SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS.

ANGLE ON: Calling up all his remaining STRENGTH and
RESOLUTION, FRODO forces his LEGS to MOVE . . . he backs away -
keeping his EYES on SHELOB.

SHELOB crawls SLOWLY towards him ... then, with sudden .
hideous SPEED, she ATTACKS!

She lashes out with her FRONT LEGS ... FRODO is flung back
... the GLASS PHIAL clatters to the TUNNEL FLOOR, casting an
eerie LOW LIGHT.

SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with
hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope
of escape.

SUDDENLY! FRODO draws STING! He slashes wildly at the GIANT
SPIDER . . . hewing off the TIP of A LEG!

SHELOB SPASMS . . . a WILD BLUR of thrashing LEGS!

ANGLE ON: FRODO leaps to his feet and RUNS - not even pausing
to pick up the PHIAL of LIGHT!

TRACKING BACK: with FRODO as he careers blindly down NARROW
TUNNELS, gasping in the CHOKING AIR ... looking back over his
shoulder for any sign of SHELOB.

ANGLE ON: FRODO sees the TUNNEL EXIT ahead . . .

. . . just as he runs straight into a great COBWEB!

ANGLE ON: Back up the TUNNEL - lit by the LIGHT OF GALADRIEL -
SHELOB'S HEAVING SHADOW approaches . . .

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM watches in mounting disbelief as STING
slashes through the WEB ... DISBELIEF turns to FEAR as SHELOB
gets closer and closer, GOLLUM quickly turns and BOLTS::.. . . .

FRODO hacks at the WEB and with a last desperate LUNGE, frees
himself ... STING is caught in the WEB ... FRODO leaves the
SWORD and THROWS HIMSELF through a narrow CREVICE . . .

 GOLLUM            Got away did it, Precious? Not this time,

             wouldn't hurt Master.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S fingers squeeze tighter around GOLLUM'S
THROAT. 
                        SMEAGOL (cont'd)
             Smeagol promised. You must believe us. It
             was the Precious - the Precious made us to
             do it.

FRODO has a sudden moment of SELF REALISATION and releases
GOLLUM, horrified at his VIOLENCE.

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM cowering back . . . COUGHING and SPLUTTERING.

ANGLE ON: FRODO looking at SMEAGOL, in SHOCK, he gets to his

             I have to destroy it, Smeagol. I have to
             destroy it for both our sakes.

SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in DISBELIEF . . . in a FURY he LUNGES
at FRODO who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge
of the PRECIPICE - GOLLUM tumbles over FRODO's BODY and FALLS
to the bottom of the RAVINE ...

EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - NIGHT 
FRODO, overcome with EXHAUSTION, stumbles down the steep

INT. TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL/TOP ROOM - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: FRODO struggling against his bonds, as GORBAG
climbs back into the room ... with VENGEANCE in his EVIL
EYES. 
 GORBAG            Stop your squeaking you dunghill rat!

CLOSE ON: GORBAG grabs FRODO'S hair and pulls his head back,
exposing his neck. He pulls out his SWORD, ready to cut
FRODO'S throat . . .

                      GORBAG (cont'd)
           I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!

SUDDENLY! GORBAG GASPS as STING is rammed into his back by
SAM! 
 SAM            Not if I stick you first!

GORBAG falls dead!

 FRODO                 (joyous disbelief)
           Sam!!!

ANGLE ON: FRODO . . . humbled by SAM'S unswerving loyalty.

                       FRODO (cont'd)
           Oh, Sam . . . I'm so sorry . . . sorry for
           everything.

SAM quickly cuts FRODO free.

 SAM            Come on.

 FRODO                 (despairing)
           It's too late. It's over . . . they've taken
           it. Sam - they took the Ring!!

 SAM                   (quietly)
             Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

SAM pulls the RING from his pocket ...

                         SAM (cont'd)
             I thought I ' d lost you . . . so I took it -
             only for safe-keeping.

CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at SAM amazed . . . his eyes drop to the
RN ... IG 
 FRODO              Give it to me.

SAM hesitates . . . . TENSION instantly builds between them.

                        FRODO (cont'd)
             Give me the Ring, Sam.

SAM seems strangely reluctant . . . ON THE SOUNDTRACK to HUM of
the RING builds

                        FRODO (cont'd)
             Sam! Give me the Ring.

CLOSE ON: SAM drops the RING into FRODO'S palm . . .

FRODO sags in RELIEF . . . he puts the RING back around his
nc . ..
 ek

                         FRODO (cont'd)
             You must understand . . . The Ring is my
             burden . . . it will destroy you, Sam.

FRODO looks at SAM, pain in his eyes ...

SAM looks down at FRODO ... his plain HOBBIT face full of
compassion. SAM'S resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold.

 SAM            Come on, Mr Frodo, we'd best find you some

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM turn east and walk over the SUMMIT of
CIRITH UNGOL ... into MORDOR.

CLOSE ON: FRODO and SAM . . . they STOP DEAD . . . STARING AHEAD:

ANGLE ON: MOUNT DOOM . . . 50 M,ILES AWAY - across the barren
GORGOROTH PLATEAU - the mountain is erupting streams of ASH
and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.

With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom . . .

. . . TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before
them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH ... Their eyes are drawn to
the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM ...

 SAM            We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.

ANGLE ON: FRODO's eyes travel down towards the HUNDREDS of
FIRES which glow on the PLAINS beneath them ... thousands
upon thousands of ORCS are encamped there .

 FRODO            There are so many of them . . . So many.
           We'll never get through unseen.

THEIR eyes are drawn to a DARK LOOMING SHAPE ... BARAD-DUR
. . . A RED LIGHT seems to sweep across the PLAIN ...

                      FRODO (cont'd)
               (terror)
           It's him - the Eye.

The GREAT EYE OF SAURON!

SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on.

 SAM              We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's
             nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it
             down the hill for starters.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, TOWER HALL - DAY 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF stands in the TOWER HALL . . . seemingly
alone . . . he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.

 GANDALF              Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
             darkness is deepening.

He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN . . .

ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF . . .

 ARAGORN              If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF - still troubled, still worried . . .

 GANDALF           It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
          a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
          Mordor our enemy is regrouping.

GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD . . .

 GIMLI           Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
          we care?

GANDALF looks across at the DWARF . . . His face ashen.

 GANDALF           Because ten thousand Ores now stand between
          Frodo and Mount Doom.

                  (to himself)
             I have sent him to his death.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns around suddenly . . .

 ARAGORN              No.

GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN . . .

                       ARAGORN (cont'd)
             There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
             time and safe passage across the Plains of
             Gorgoroth. We can give him that.

 GANDALF              How?

 ARAGORN              Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
             Then we gather our full strength and march
             on the Black Gate.

At this, GIMLI CHOKES on his pipe . . . EOMER steps forward.

 EOMER              We cannot achieve victory from strength of
             arms .

 ARAGORN              Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo
             his chance if we keep Sauron' s eye fixed
             upon us. Keep him blind to all else that
             moves .

 LEGOLAS              A diversion . . .

CLOSE ON: GANDALF speaks in a low tone to ARAGORN . . .

 GANDALF                   (doubtful)
             Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not
             take the bait!

fixed on the PLAIN below ... thousands of ORCS can be seen
marching away from MT. DOOM . . .

 SAM             Look, the Ores! They're moving off. You

twisted volcanic rock and STEAMING FISSURES.

FRODO gratefully takes a SMALL SIP from SAM'S BOTTLE . . .
hands it back.

 FRODO              There'll be none left for the return
             journey.

 SAM                  (softly)
             I don't think there will be a return

CLOSE ON: FRODO is walking half-bowed, often stumbling . . . as
if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet.

His right HAND is pressed against his CHEST ... supporting a
HEAVY WEIGHT. His left HAND often rises, as if to ward off
some invisible blow. SAM watches him, CONCERN etched across
his FACE . . .

             I see in your eyes the same fear that would

             tears are an evil.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF turns and walks away . . . FRODO is DOWNCAST
... SUDDENLY, GANDALF turns and looks toward him.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           It is time, Frodo.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks at FRODO then turns and slowly walks
towards the GANGPLANK to board the SHIP.

 SAM                 (alarmed)
           What does he mean?

CLOSE ON: FRODO turns to SAM. . . .

 FRODO                 (gently)
           We set out to save the Shire, and it has
           been saved ... but not for me . . .

 SAM                 (shaken)
           You don't mean that - you can't leave.

ANGLE ON: SAM looks down . . . FRODO is holding BILBO'S RED
JOURNAL out towards him.

 FRODO            The last pages are for you, Sam.

SAM is SOBBING . . . MERRY and PIPPIN are DISTRAUGHT . . . .

FRODO hugs MERRY and PIPPIN, and last of all SAM . . . and
climbs on board the SHIP.

ANGLE ON: FRODO a look of WONDERMENT crosses his face . . . as
he STEPS FORWARD and ACCEPTS GANDALF'S HAND . . . finally
released from his pain, care falls from his face . . . he is
the young FRODO we first met so long ago.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN comfort each other as the WHITE SHIP
glides away from the DOCK ...

WIDE ON: The WHITE BOAT sails away towards the HEADLANDS,
disappearing into the GOLDEN LIGHT of the SETTING SUN.

He hugs his daughter . . .

 FRODO V/0             My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
            two. You have to be one and whole for many
            years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
            to do. Because Sam, your part in the
            journey goes on.

ANGLE ON: ROSIE COTTON steps up and kisses SAM on the cheek
. . . she gives him a TINY BABY BOY to cradle.

 SAM             Hello, little Frodo!

ANGLE ON: SAM with his FAMILY . . . he draws a deep breath:

                      SAM (cont'd)
           Well ... I'm back.

                           [TITLE:  THE LORD OF THE RINGS]



                         [Camera pans over the Misty Mountains 
                         as voices drift in from the background.]
 
                         
                                     GANDALF
                         You cannot pass!

                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     GANDALF
                         I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder 
                         of the Flame of Anor!
 
                         [Camera pans closer to the mountain 
                         side.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark 
                         Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udûn! 
                         [Camera zooms in through the mountain 
                         and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog 
                         on the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Balrog 
                         strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming 
                         sword. Gandalf parries the blow with 
                         Glamdring, shattering the Balrogs sword.] 
                         YOU SHALL NOT... PASS!!!
 
                         [Gandalf strikes his staff onto the 
                         bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, 
                         the bridge collapses from under it and 
                         the demon plunges backward into the 
                         chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on 
                         his staff and watches the Balrog fall 
                         then turns to follow the others. At 
                         the last minute, the flaming whip lashes 
                         up from the depths of the abyss and 
                         winds around Gandalfs ankle, dragging 
                         him over the edge. He clings onto the 
                         bridge but is straining to keep his 
                         grip.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Argh!

                         [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains 
                         him.]
 
                                     BOROMIR
                         No! No!

                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     GANDALF
                         Fly, you fools!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Noooooooooooooooo!!!!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into 
                         the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
 
                         [Gandalf falls after the Balrog and 
                         grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on 
                         his way down. As they continue to plunge 
                         into the depths, Gandalf hacks away 
                         at the Balrog even as it thrashes and 
                         bounces off the walls. They continue 
                         to plunge at great speed, sometimes 
                         with Gandalf clinging to the horn of 
                         the demon. The battling pair then falls 
                         into an enormous cavern and plunges 
                         into the water. Just then Frodo awakens 
                         as if from a nightmare.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     SAM
                         What is it, Mr. Frodo?

                                     FRODO
                         Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
 
                         
                         [Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky 
                         terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the 
                         distance at the Mountain of Fire.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth 
                         we dont want to see any closer, and 
                         the one place were trying to get to. 
                         Its just where we cant get. Lets 
                         face it, Mr. Frodo, were lost. I dont 
                         think Gandalf meant for us to come this 
                         way.
 
                                     FRODO
                         He didnt mean for a lot of things to 
                         happen, Sam... but they did.
 
                         [Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eye 
                         zooming in on him. He gasps and pants 
                         as he backs away.]
 
                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo? Its the Ring, isnt it?
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         Its getting heavier. [Clutches the 
                         Ring by his chest and sits down, still 
                         panting. He then fumbles for his water 
                         bottle and takes a sip.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         What food have we got left?

                                     SAM
                         Well, let me see. [He takes out a package 
                         of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, 
                         lovely  Lembas bread. And look! [He 
                         digs deeper into his pack] More lembas 
                         bread.
 
                         [Sam shows another package. He then 
                         breaks off a piece and tosses it to 
                         Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         I don't usually hold with foreign food, 
                         but this Elvish stuff, its not bad.
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         [smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, 
                         does it Sam?
 
                         [Sam smiles back, and then looks ominously 
                         towards Mordor.]
 
                                     SAM
                         Those rain clouds might.

                         [They continue trekking through difficult 
                         terrain, often huddling underneath their 
                         cloaks.]
 
                                     SAM
                         [Looks around] This looks strangely 
                         familiar.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Exasperated] Its because weve been 
                         here before! Were going in circles.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant 
                         there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you 
                         smell it?
 
                                     FRODO
                         Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] 
                         Were not alone.
 
                                     [NIGHTTIME
                         Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape 
                         appears on top of the cliff. The creature 
                         Gollum has appeared and is making his 
                         way down to the hobbits.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         The thieves! The thieves! The filthy 
                         little thieves! Where is it? Where isss 
                         it? They stole it from us. My preciousss. 
                         [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse 
                         them! We hates them! Its ours, it is... 
                         and we wantssss it!
 
                         [Gollum reaches out his hand towards 
                         the hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits spring 
                         up, grab hold of Gollums arms and pull 
                         him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum 
                         wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo. 
                         As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring 
                         around his neck is revealed and Gollum 
                         jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries 
                         to grab at him but is knocked away. 
                         Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and 
                         tries to reach for the Ring even as 
                         Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push 
                         him away. Gollums cheeks puff with 
                         exertion as he struggles with Frodo, 
                         his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring. 
                         Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears 
                         him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns 
                         around and bites Sam on the shoulder, 
                         wriggles around and clasps his arms 
                         around Sams neck and legs around his 
                         waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes 
                         Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         [menacingly] This is Sting. Youve seen 
                         it before, havent you... Gollum! Release 
                         him or Ill cut your throat!
 
                         [Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on 
                         Sam and as the latter disentangles himself, 
                         Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum 
                         is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope 
                         around his neck, wailing and writhing 
                         in pain.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty 
                         Elves twisted it. Take it off us!
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Quiet you!

                         [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum 
                         cries some more and collapses onto his 
                         back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Its hopeless! Every Orc in Mordors 
                         going to hear this racket! Lets just 
                         tie him up and leave him.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         No! That would kill us! Kill us!

                                     SAM
                         Its no more than you deserve!

                                     FRODO
                         Maybe he does deserve to die, but now 
                         that I see him, I do pity him.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         [Begging] We be nice to them if they 
                         be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears 
                         to do what you wants. We swears.
 
                                     FRODO
                         Theres no promise you can make that 
                         I can trust.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         We swears to serve the master of the 
                         preciousss. We swears on... on the precious. 
                         *Gollum. Gollum.*

                         The Ring is treacherous. It will hold 
                         you to your word.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         I dont believe you! [Gollum backs away, 
                         frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] 
                         Get down! I said, down!
 
                         [Sam jerks strongly at the rope as Gollum 
                         tries to get away from him. He crashes 
                         onto the ground, choking.]
 
                                     FRODO

                         Hes trying to trick us! We let him 
                         go hell throttle us in our sleep!
 
                         
                         [Gollum lies panting and holding his 
                         throat. He backs away, frightened, as 
                         Frodo approaches him.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         You know the way to Mordor?

                         [nods again] Yes...

                         [Frodo reaches out and takes the rope 
                         noose off Gollums neck. Gollum seems 
                         surprised and relieved.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         You will lead us to the Black Gate.
 
                         
                         [Gollum scrambles off in the direction 
                         of Morannon and the hobbits follow in 
                         his wake.]
 


                         [A band of Uruk-hai marches across the 
                         plain, with two hobbits bound to the 
                         backs of two Uruk-hai. Pippin tries 
                         to call to Merry, who is unconscious 
                         with a gash on his right brow.]

                         [Suddenly, an Uruk-hai puts up his hand 
                         and signals a stop.]

                         struggles to reach his Elven brooch 
                         with his teeth. He then tears it off 
                         his cloak and drops it onto the ground. 
                         A foot stomps onto the brooch but it 
                         remains unbroken and visible on the 
                         grass.]

                         up.] They must have caught our scent. 
                         Hurry! [He runs off.]

                         and then runs after Aragorn]

                         No rest. And no sign of our quarry but 
                         what bare rock can tell. [Runs after 
                         his companions.]

                         time to time, Legolas looks back to 
                         make sure that Gimli is keeping up. 
                         Aragorn suddenly bends down to pick 
                         up an Elven brooch from the ground.]

                         off again]

                         Blood has been spilled this night.
 
                         
                         [Camera pans over the rock and plains, 
                         alternating between the band of Uruk-hai 
                         and the Three Hunters giving chase. 
                         The trackers hear the sound of horses. 
                         Aragorn and company hide behind some 
                         boulders. A large group of horse-men 
                         appears, galloping quickly with their 
                         banners flying. Aragorn comes out of 
                         hiding as they pass, followed by Legolas 
                         and Gimli.]

                         Riders of Rohan, what news from the 
                         Mark?
 
                         [At a signal from Éomer at the lead, 
                         the riders make a quick turn and head 
                         towards them, surrounding them in ever-tightening 
                         circles. As they stop, they point their 
                         long spears menacingly at them.]

                         a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak 
                         quickly!

                         and gets off his horse. Aragorn puts 
                         a hand on Gimlis shoulder.]

                         I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if 
                         it stood but a little higher from the 
                         ground.
 
                         [Legolas, in a lightning fast move, 
                         points an arrow at Éomer.]

                         at the travellers. After a tense moment, 
                         Aragorn pushes down Legolas arm.]

                         I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This 
                         is Gimli, son of Glóin and Legolas of 
                         the Woodland realm. We are friends of 
                         Rohan and of Théoden, your king.

                         Théoden no longer recognizes friend 
                         from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even 
                         his own kin.

                         Saruman has poisoned the mind of the 
                         king and claimed lordship over these 
                         lands. My company are those loyal to 
                         Rohan. And for that, we are banished. 
                         The White Wizard is cunning. He walks 
                         here and there, they say, as an old 
                         man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere 
                         his spies slip past our nets.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         We are not spies. We track a party of 
                         Uruk-hai westward across the plain. 
                         Theyve taken two of our friends captive.

                         The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered 
                         them during the night.

                         But there were two hobbits. Did you 
                         see two hobbits with them?

                         They would be small  only children 
                         to your eyes.

                         We left none alive. We piled the carcasses 
                         and burned them. [Points to a smoking 
                         pile in the distance.]

                         May these horses bear you to better 
                         fortune than their former masters. Farewell.

                         to hope, it has forsaken these lands.

                         towards the burning carcasses. Gimli 
                         starts to shift through the smoldering 
                         pile, and pulls out a charred belt and 
                         dagger sheath.]

                         of thrashing hooves bearing down on 
                         him. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.]

                         tree hes clinging to. The tree starts

                         Side? I am on nobodys side because 
                         nobodys on my side, little Orc. Nobody 
                         cares for the woods anymore.

                         Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens 
                         his hold on the hobbits and squeezes

                         axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, 
                         burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse 
                         them!

                         the sword into the Balrog. With a final 
                         cry, the Balrog falls from the peak

                                     FRODO
                         Are you saying theres another way into 
                         Mordor?
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, 
                         and then a tunnel.
                          [Frodo and Sam watch as the Black Gate 
                         closes. Gollum is stroking Frodos arm 
                         and burying his face in his cloak.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         Hes led us this far, Sam.

                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo, no.

                                     FRODO
                         Hes been true to his word.

                                     SAM
                         [Whispers] No!

                                     FRODO
                         Lead the way, Sméagol.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Good Sméagol always helps.

                         [Frodo follows Gollum as Sam stares 
                         after him in disbelief.]
 
                         [On the plains of Rohan. Gandalf, Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli stop as Edoras comes 
                         into view.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. 
                         There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan, 
                         whose mind is overthrown. Sarumans 
                         hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
 
                         
                         [In the Hall, Éowyn is kneeling before 
                         Théoden, holding his hand in hers.]
 
                         
                                     ÉOWYN
                         My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord? 
                         Uncle?
 
                         [Théoden just sits and stares ahead, 
                         his eyes clouded and unseeing.]
 
                                     ÉOWYN
                         Will you not go to him? [She weeps.] 
                         Will you do nothing?
 
                         [Scene returns to Gandalf and company.]

                         Be careful what you say. Do not look 
                         for welcome here.
 
                         [They ride on towards Edoras.]



                         [At Edoras, Éowyn is weeping at the 
                         dead Théodred's bed. She kisses his 
                         hand. Gríma appears at the door.]
 
                         
                                     GRÍMA
                         Oh, he he must have died sometime in 
                         the night. What a tragedy for the king 
                         to lose his only son and heir.
 
                         [He sits on the bed and puts a hand 
                         on Éowyns shoulder.]
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         I understand his passing is hard to 
                         accept, especially now that your brother 
                         has deserted you.
 
                                     ÉOWYN
                         [jumps back and throws off Grímas hand] 
                         Leave me alone, snake!
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         [Rises from the bed and moves ever closer 
                         to Éowyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who 
                         knows what you have spoken to the darkness. 
                         In bitter watches of the night, when 
                         all your life seems to shrink, the walls 
                         of your bower closing in about you, 
                         like a hutch to trammel some wild thing 
                         in.
 
                         [He puts a hand on her cheek and moves 
                         down to her throat.]
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         So fair, so cold, like a morning of 
                         pale spring still clinging to winter's 
                         chill.
 
                         [Éowyn and Gríma stare at each other 
                         intently.]
 
                                     ÉOWYN
                         Your words are poison!

                         [Éowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, 
                         she looks away into the distance. A 
                         flag comes off its pole and is carried 
                         by the breeze. Éowyn sees riders coming 
                         towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the 
                         entrance to Edoras, the flag floats 
                         down to land near him. Edoras is silent 
                         and somber. Everyone is dressed in black 
                         and staring at the newcomers in wary 
                         silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall 
                         and sees a lady in white standing on 
                         the steps. He looks around at more somber 
                         people.]
 
                                     GIMLI
                         Youll find more cheer in a graveyard.
 
                         
                         [Aragorn looks up to the hall again 
                         but the lady has disappeared. The company 
                         climbs up the stairs to the hall and 
                         is met by guards.]

                         I cannot allow you before Théoden-King 
                         so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order 
                         of Gríma Wormtongue.
 
                         [Gandalf nods in understanding and signals 
                         for the others to surrender their weapons. 
                         Aragon hands over his sword and knives. 
                         Legolas gives a little twirl to his 
                         knives before handing them over to the 
                         guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.]
 
                         
                                     HÁMA
                         [gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.

                                     GANDALF
                         Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You 
                         would not part an old man from his walking 
                         stick? [Looks at Háma innocently.]
 
                         
                         [Háma hesitates for a second and then 
                         gestures that they follow him into the 
                         hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink 
                         and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas 
                         arm.]
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         [Leaning down and whispering to Théoden.] 
                         My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. 
                         Hes a herald of woe.
 
                                     GANDALF
                         The courtesy of your hall is somewhat 
                         lessened of late, Théoden King.
 
                         [As Gandalf approaches Théoden, Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey 
                         the hall and its hostile occupants. 
                         A group of men starts to follow their 
                         steps with hostility.]

                                     THÉODEN
                         Why should I welcome you, Gandalf 
                         Stormcrow? [Looks to Gríma for affirmation.]
 
                         
                                     GRÍMA
                         A just question, my liege. [He walks 
                         towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in 
                         which this conjurer chooses to appear. 
                         Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news 
                         is an ill guest.

                         Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind 
                         you teeth. I have not passed through 
                         fire and death to bandy crooked words 
                         with a witless worm! [Raises his staff 
                         against Gríma.]

                         His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf 
                         while addressing the guards] I told 
                         you to take the wizards staff!
 
                         [The hostile guards attack. Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight 
                         as Gandalf continues to approach Théoden. 
                         Gamling tries to go forward but Háma 
                         holds him back.]

                         you sat in the shadows.
 
                         [Gríma tries to crawl away unnoticed, 
                         but Gimli catches him and pins him to 
                         the floor.]

                         Hearken to me! I release you from the 
                         spell. [Gestures with his hand]

                         [Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf 
                         opens his eyes in surprise.] You have 
                         no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
 
                         [Gandalf throws back his grey cloak, 
                         exuding blinding white light. Théoden 
                         is thrown back against his seat.]

                         I will draw you, Saruman, as poison 
                         is drawn from a wound.
 
                         [Éowyn rushes in. Seeing her uncle threatened, 
                         she tries to go to him but is held back 
                         by Aragorn.]

                         dies.
 
                         [Gandalf moves his staff sharply and 
                         Théoden flies back against the chair 
                         again.]

                         at him. Théoden is thrown back into 
                         the chair and the shot changes to Saruman 
                         flying backwards from the Palantír which 
                         he used to manipulate Théoden. He lands 
                         landing hard on the floor of Orthanc, 
                         bleeding from a gash in his forehead. 
                         In the hall, Théoden lets out a moan

                         an attack on the city. They will flee 
                         to Helms Deep, the great fortress of 
                         Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take 
                         through the mountains. They will be 
                         slow. They will have women and children 
                         with them.

                         He walks through the depths of Isengard 
                         and gives orders to an Orc.]

                         ferocious growls are heard and shadows 
                         dances.]

                         the river. He slips and falls, grasping 
                         at a slippery fish as he goes. Frodo 
                         and Sam follow behind.]

                         What?

                                     FRODO
                         Call him names; run him down all the

                         Because because that's what he is, 
                         Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im 
                         but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he 
                         wants. It's all he cares about.

                         it did to him. What its still doing 
                         to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.] 
                         I want to help him, Sam...

                         Because I have to believe he can come 
                         back.

                         know why I said that.

                         [Looks back at Frodo with tears in his 
                         eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't 
                         take your eyes off it. I've seen you. 
                         You're not eating. You barely sleep. 
                         It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. 
                         You have to fight it!

                         to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to 
                         me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He 
                         walks away]

                         [Gimli gets onto the horse with some 
                         help. Legolas gazes into the distance 
                         and sees many warg-riders coming fast 
                         towards them, kicking up dust trails 
                         as they go.]

                         [To Éowyn] You must lead the people 
                         to Helms Deep. And make haste!
 
                                     ÉOWYN
                         I can fight!

                         No! You must do this... for me.

                         [Éowyn holds Théodens gaze for a moment 
                         and then turn to attend to the villagers.]

                         I mean, charge forward! March forward! 
                         [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather 
                         unsteadily.] Thats it! Go on!

                         [She looks back at the Rohirrim and 
                         sees Aragorn on Hasufel. They hold each 
                         others gaze for a moment before Aragorn 
                         turns to join Théoden. Éowyn departs 
                         with the villagers in the opposite direction.]
 
                         
                         [Legolas takes aim at the distant target 
                         and fells a warg rider. He draws another 
                         arrow and kills another. Just as he 
                         reaches for a third arrow, he sees Théoden 
                         and company approaching. He quickly 
                         runs and mounts Arod with a smooth leap 
                         and joins in the fray with Gimli behind 
                         him on horseback.]

                         head on and the battle begins. Théoden 
                         and company hack away at the warg riders. 
                         In the midst of fighting, Gimli falls 
                         off Arod. He turns to find a warg growling 
                         at him.]

                         kills it with one shot.]

                         [As Gimli swings his axe at another 
                         warg, it dies and falls onto Gimli, 
                         pinning him under.]

                         an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills 
                         him quickly, twisting his neck, and 
                         it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at 
                         the Orc and makes a face. He tries to 
                         lift both the warg and Orc off him. 
                         Just then, another warg comes upon him 
                         and bares its teeth, ready to strike.

                         on horseback and throws it at the warg. 
                         It dies, landing on Gimli and adding 
                         to the pile on top of him.]

                         [Théoden stabs at a warg rider. Aragorn 
                         is knocked off Hasufel and attacked 
                         by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the 
                         warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt 
                         and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while 
                         the latter is half-dragged by the warg. 
                         In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off 
                         and he rips the Evenstar pendant from 
                         Aragorns neck as he falls. Aragorn 
                         tries to let go of the warg but finds 
                         his wrist tangled with the saddle straps. 
                         He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle 
                         himself and is dragged closer and closer 
                         to the edge of a cliff at great speed. 
                         The warg runs right off the cliff and 
                         they both disappear over the edge. The 
                         battle is winding down as the Rohirrim 
                         finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.]

                         Evenstar pendant. He takes it, runs 
                         to the edge of the cliff and looks down 
                         to see the great drop and rushing waters 
                         below, with no sign of Aragorn. Gimli 
                         comes to stand beside him.]

                         Helms Deep has one weakness. Its outer 
                         wall is solid rock but for a small culvert 
                         at its base which is little more than 
                         a drain.
 
                         [Camera turns to Gríma and Saruman at 
                         Orthanc. Saruman is pouring some dark 
                         dry substances into a vessel. Gríma 
                         is holding a lit candle in his hand.]

                         How? How can fire undo stone? What kind 
                         of device could bring down the wall?

                         takes hold of Grímas hand and pushes

                         If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep 
                         will fall.

                         it would take a number beyond reckoning, 
                         thousands to storm the keep.

                         the appearance of Saruman. A loud cheer 
                         is heard from the army. Saruman raises 
                         a hand.]

                         How many?

                                     MADRIL
                         Some thousands. More come every day.
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         Whos covering the river to the north?
 
                         
                                     MADRIL
                         We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but 
                         if the city is attacked, we wont hold 
                         it.
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks 
                         from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The 
                         fight will come to men on both fronts. 
                         Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us 
                         soon. And he will strike hard. He knows 
                         now we do not have the strength to repel 
                         him.
 
                         [The hobbits are unbound and blindfolds 
                         taken off them by Damrod and another 
                         ranger. Sam and Frodo find themselves 
                         in a cave behind a waterfall, with Damrod 
                         sitting behind them on a rock constantly 
                         watching them. Faramir comes up to them 
                         and sits.].
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Spies?! Now wait just a minute!

                                     FARAMIR
                         Well if youre not spies, then who are 
                         you?
 
                         [Frodo and Sam remain silent.]

                                     FARAMIR
                         Speak.

                                     FRODO
                         We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins 
                         is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         Your bodyguard?

                                     SAM
                         His gardener.

                                     FARAMIR
                         And where is your skulking friend? That 
                         gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured 
                         look.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [The merest hesitation.] There was no 
                         other.
 
                         [Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         We set out from Rivendell with seven 
                         companions. One we lost in Mória. Two 
                         were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, 
                         and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son 
                         of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Intently] Youre a friend of Boromir?
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         Yes... for my part.

                                     FARAMIR
                         It will grieve you then to learn that 
                         he is dead.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Shocked] Dead? How? When?

                                     FARAMIR
                         As one of his companions, Id hoped 
                         you would tell me. [Pause] He was my 
                         brother.
 


                         [Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought. 
                         Suddenly someone comes up to him.]
 
                         
                                     GONDORIAN RANGER
                         Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found 
                         the third one.
 
                         [Frodo and Sam are sleeping. Frodo awakens 
                         as Faramir stands before him.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         You must come with me. Now.

                         [Frodo gets up and follow. They come 
                         to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking 
                         the Forbidden Pool.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Pointing down] Down there.

                         [Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving 
                         into the water.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         To enter the forbidden pool bears the 
                         penalty of death. [He gestures to archers 
                         hidden in the bushes.] They wait for 
                         my command.
 
                         [The Rangers notch their arrows]

                                     FARAMIR
                         Shall I shoot?

                         [Frodo looks stricken. Gollum emerges 
                         from the pool onto a rock. He holds 
                         a fish in his hand and starts singing, 
                         slapping the fish on the rock as he 
                         goes.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         [singing] The rock and pool is nice 
                         and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish 
                         [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch 
                         a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The 
                         fish almost wriggles out of his grasp 
                         and he whacks it some more.]
 
                         [Faramir has his hand raised to order 
                         his men to shoot. At the last moment, 
                         Frodo calls out.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature 
                         is bound to me. And I to him. He is 
                         our guide. Please, let me go down to 
                         him.
 
                         [Faramir nods. Frodo descends to the 
                         Forbidden Pool and approaches Gollum 
                         who is gorging on the raw fish.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Sméagol. [Gollum turns round at Frodos 
                         voice.] Master is here. Come, Sméagol. 
                         Trust master. Come!
 
                         [Frodo gestures for Gollum to follow 
                         him.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         We must go now?

                                     FRODO
                         Sméagol, you must trust master. Follow 
                         me, come on. Come. Come, Sméagol. Nice 
                         Sméagol. Thats it. Come on.
 
                         [With the fish between his teeth, Gollum 
                         follows Frodo warily. Suddenly he looks 
                         up in alarm and is caught by Rangers.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO

                         Sméagol listen to me!

                         [A black cloth is brought over Gollum's 
                         head. Frodo stares after them with a 
                         stricken expression as Faramir leads 
                         Gollum and his men away. Back in the 
                         cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground. 
                         Crying, he crawls into a corner and 
                         curls up into ball.]

                         trickst us.

                         Of course he did. I told you he was 
                         tricksy. I told you he was false.
 
                         
                                     SMÉAGOL

                         little hobbitses. They stole it from 
                         us.

                         and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!
 


                         [Back in their holding area, Sam and

                         We have to get out of here. You go. 
                         Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, 
                         Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. 
                         Disappear.
 
                                     FRODO
                         I cant. You were right, Sam. You tried 
                         to tell me, but Im sorry. The Rings 
                         taking me Sam. If I put it on, hell 
                         find me. Hell see.

                         [Unsheathes his sword] So... this is 
                         the answer to all the riddles. Here 
                         in the wild I have you. Two halflings 
                         and a host of men at my call. The Ring 
                         of power within my grasp.
 
                         [Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo's 
                         neck with the tip of his sword.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, 
                         to show his quality.
 
                         [Frodo is backed up fearfully against 
                         the wall. The Ring whispers and Frodo 
                         falls into a trance. Suddenly, he grabs 
                         the Ring in his hand and jerks himself 
                         away.]

                         No!! [He runs away from Faramir]

                                     SAM
                         Stop it! Leave him alone! Dont you 
                         understand? Hes got to destroy it. 
                         Thats where were going. Into Mordor. 
                         To the mountain of fire.
 
                         [Faramir stares at Frodo. Just then 
                         Damrod enters.]
 
                                     DAMROD
                         Osgiliath is under attack. They call 
                         for reinforcements.
 
                                     SAM
                         Please. Its such a burden. Will you 
                         not help him?
 
                                     DAMROD
                         Captain?

                                     FARAMIR
                         Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to 
                         Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
 
                         [Sam looks after Faramir sadly.]



                         [Aragorn is riding towards Helms Deep. 
                         On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-hai 
                         army marching with great speed. He quickly 
                         makes haste towards Helms Deep and 
                         soon sees the refuge.]

                         my friend)

                         [Pushing his way through the crowd.] 
                         Where is he? Where is he? Get out of 
                         the way. Im gonna kill him! [He sees 
                         Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the 
                         canniest and the most reckless man I 
                         ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless 
                         you, laddie!

                         [Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn 
                         makes his way in, he runs into Legolas 
                         who stands waiting.]
 
                                     LEGOLAS

                         Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorns 
                         wounds.] You look terrible.
 
                         [To the side, Éowyn sees Aragorn and 
                         smiles joyously and with relief. Legolas 
                         takes Aragorns hand and gives the Evenstar 
                         pendant. Aragorn looks at the Evenstar 
                         and claps Legolas on the shoulder.]

                                     ARAGORN
                         Ten thousand strong at least.

                                     THÉODEN
                         Ten thousand?!

                         It is an army bred for a single purpose: 
                         to destroy the world of men. They will 
                         be here by nightfall.

                         Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]
 
                         
                         [Along the passage behind the Deeping

                         lad able to bear arms to be ready for 
                         battle by nightfall.
 
                         [Gamling nods and goes off. Théoden 
                         stands at the gate of Helms Deep, speaking 
                         to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         We will cover the causeway and the gate 
                         from above. No army has ever breached 
                         the Deeping Wall or set foot inside 
                         the Hornburg.

                         This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. 
                         These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick 
                         and their shields broad.

                         I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. 
                         I know how to defend my own keep.
 
                         
                         [Gimli seems miffed. Legolas claps a 
                         hand on Gimlis shoulder as he follows 
                         Aragorn and Théoden back in.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         They will break upon this fortress like 
                         water on rock. Sarumans hordes will 
                         pillage and burn, weve seen it before. 
                         Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. 
                         Within these walls, we will outlast 
                         them.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         They do not come to destroy Rohans 
                         crops or villages. They come to destroy 
                         its people. Down to the last child.

                         [Draws close to Aragorn] What would 
                         you have me do? Look at my men. Their 
                         courage hangs by a thread. If this is 
                         to be our end, then I would have them 
                         make such an end as to be worthy of 
                         remembrance.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Send out riders, my lord. You must call 
                         for aid.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We 
                         are not so lucky in our friends as you. 
                         The old alliances are dead.

                         Gondor will answer.

                                     THÉODEN
                         Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold 
                         fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies 
                         closed in around us? Where was Gon 
                          No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.

                         We need more time to lay provisions 
                         for a siege, lord 

                         [Cutting him off] There is no time.

                         time. But now something is about to

                         hear movement from the forest around

                                     THÉODEN
                         Who am I, Gamling?

                                     GAMLING
                         You are our king, sire.

                                     THÉODEN
                         And do you trust your king?

                                     GAMLING
                         [Puts armour onto Théoden] Your men, 
                         my lord, will follow you to whatever 
                         end.
 
                         [The villagers are handed their weapons. 
                         An oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed 
                         boy. Another stares at the axe that 
                         he is handed with frightened eyes. Another 
                         child wearing oversized chain mail takes 
                         up a huge shield. Théoden stands inside 
                         the main hall of the keep, his back 
                         to the entrance where a bright white 
                         light is streaming through.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         To whatever end Where is the horse 
                         and the rider? Where is the horn that 
                         was blowing? They have passed like rain 
                         on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. 
                         The days have gone down in the west. 
                         Behind the hills, into shadow. How did 
                         it come to this?
 


                         [Everyone is getting ready for war at 
                         the battlements. Aragorn is sitting 
                         on the steps. He sees a young lad in 
                         armour holding a sword looking around 
                         nervously.]
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Give me your sword. What is your name?
 
                         
                                     HALETH
                         Haleth, son of Háma, my lord. The men 
                         are saying that we will not live out 
                         the night. They say that it is hopeless..
 
                         
                         [Aragorn gives the battered sword a 
                         few swings.]
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         This is a good sword, Haleth, son of 
                         Háma.
 
                         [He hands the sword back to Haleth and 
                         leans close to him, putting a hand on 
                         his shoulder.]
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         There is always hope.



                         [Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his 
                         battle gear. His sword is handed to 
                         him as he reaches for it. He nods and 
                         accepts the sword from Legolas.]
 
                                     LEGOLAS
                         We have trusted you this far. You have 
                         not led us astray. Forgive me. I was 
                         wrong to despair.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Ú-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing 
                         to forgive, Legolas.)
 
                         [They smile and clap one another on 
                         the shoulders. They look at Gimli as 
                         he walks up to them, struggling with 
                         his chain mail.]
 
                                     GIMLI
                         If we had more time Id get this adjusted. 
                         [He drops the bundle and the chain mail 
                         lands with its length right to the floor.] 
                         Its a little tight across the chest.
 
                         
                         [Aragorn and Legolas bite back smiles. 
                         Just then, a horn sounds in the background]
 
                         
                                     LEGOLAS
                         That is no Orc horn. [They run out to 
                         the battlements.]
 
                         [The guards look down in wonderment.]

                         Open the gate!

                         [An army of Lothlórien Elves march up 
                         the Causeway into the Hornburg. They 
                         are led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldiers 
                         look upon them in wonderment and delight 
                         as they pass.]

                         How is this possible?

                         I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. 
                         An alliance once existed between Elves 
                         and men. Long ago we fought and died 
                         together. [He looks up to see Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli running down the steps, 
                         and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.
 
                         
                                     ARAGORN
                         [He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. (Welcome, 
                         Haldir) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace. 
                         Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back 
                         lightly.]
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         You are most welcome!

                         [Legolas and Haldir clasp each other 
                         on the shoulder.]
 
                                     HALDIR
                         [Turning to Théoden] We are proud to 
                         fight alongside men, once more.
 
                         [Men and Elves are in their positions 
                         on the battlements of Helms Deep. The 
                         sounds of a marching army move closer 
                         and closer. The women and children in 
                         the caves hear the sounds overhead and 
                         are frightened. Mothers draw their children 
                         close and try to sooth crying babies. 
                         The men and Elves look out into the 
                         darkness, lit by the thousands of torches 
                         carried by the huge advancing Uruk-hai 
                         army and the light bouncing off their 
                         armour. With a row of Elf archers, Gimli 
                         is standing beside Legolas behind a

                         lets hope it lasts the night.

                         and louder. Lightning flashes and it 
                         begins to rain. While the Uruk-hai army 
                         continues to march at the fortress, 
                         an Uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop.]

                         their spears furiously.The women and 
                         children in the caves huddle together

                         next to Haleth, loses his grip and releases 
                         his arrow prematurely, shooting an Uruk-hai

                         ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their 
                         teeth and roar with anger. With a cry,

                         climbing over the wall, whacking it 
                         in the groin with his axe and killing

                         can we do in the end? We've got the 
                         Shire. Maybe we should go home.

                         we are to danger, the farther we are

                         on, little Shirelings. I always like 
                         going south. Somehow it feels like going 
                         down hill.

                         runs up to Aragorn and embraces him, 
                         crying tears of relief.] Even darkness 
                         must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard 
                         is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on 
                         from their perch on Treebeard. On the 
                         balcony, Saruman stumbles back into 
                         his chamber] And when the sun shines 
                         it will shine out the clearer. Those 
                         were the stories that stayed with you. 
                         That meant something, even if you were 
                         too small to understand why. But I think, 
                         Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. 
                         Folk in those stories had lots of chances 
                         of turning back only they didnt. They 
                         kept going because they were holding 
                         on to something.
 
                                     FRODO
                         What are we holding on to, Sam?

                         Theres some good in this world, Mr. 
                         Frodo. And its worth fighting for.

                         moved. Faramir walks over and comes 
                         to kneel in front of Frodo]

                         laws of your father. If you let them 
                         go, your life will be forfeit.

                         retribution swift. The battle for Helms 
                         Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth 
                         is about to begin. All our hopes now 
                         lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere 
                         in the wilderness.

                         I wonder if people will ever say, lets 
                         hear about Frodo and the Ring. And 
                         theyll say yes, thats one of my favorite 
                         stories. Frodo was really courageous, 
                         wasnt he, dad. Yes, my boy, the most

                          Samwise the Brave. I want to hear

CHAPTER 1: Earth 2058
---------------------


FADE IN ON:

EXT.-SPACE

PULL BACK slowly as MARS fills THE FRAME, a sphere of red desert and
fast rushing crimson clouds.

A triangular CARGO SHIP descends from the dark of space.

                      PILOT (OVER)

          Mars mining base, this is Grissom One,
          Request final descent vector.

REVERSE ANGLE

EXT.-MARS

A row of giant red mountains and beneath, on the planet's surface, the
spires of A MINING BASE. Illuminated landing crosshairs alight a
landing pad, beckoning the ship.

                      CONTROLLER (OVER)

          Roger, Grissom One, this is Mars
          Mining, You are cleared to land. Hope
          you got some Partagas in that rust
          bucket, Sal.

EXT.-EDGE OF SPACE

THE CARGO SHIP changes attitude, landing thrusters FIRING as the
vessel begins to penetrate the atmosphere.

                      PILOT

          I brought you the most amazing...

Amazing, what, we'll never know. The CARGO SHIP begins to EXPLODE, the
bubble bridge BLOWING out into space in a ball of fire.

EXT.- MARS

LOW ANGLE from the planet's surface-. Two shapes BLAST through FRAME,
BUBBLE FIGHTERS, single pilot, transparent globes, racing up towards
the sudden star of the cargo ship at impossible speed.

INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER

POV of the burning Cargo Ship, coming towards us incredibly fast.
Speed, trajectory and tactical readouts flash.

EXT.-CARGO SHIP

The pulse lasers are still hammering the ravaged hull.

WIDER

Two sinister ATTACK SHIPS, their lasers locked onto the Cargo Ship,
FIRE away as they BLAST overhead. The nuclear core of the Cargo Ship
overloads, the craft finally EXPLODING in a storm of fire.

A BUBBLE FIGHTER ROARS through the hurling world of flame. PUSH IN.

INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER

A lone FIGURE stands in a gyroscopic harness, working a heads-up
holographic display, command controls spinning 360 degrees with the
pilot's Comas the fighter SCREAMS after the fleeing raider.

The harness spins, the pilot coming clearly into view. Handsome,
intense, reckless eyes. MAJOR DON WEST.

                      WEST

          Sino-Jordanian Raiders. They're
          claiming the cargo ship violated
          their air-space.

INT.-SECOND BUBBLE FIGHTER

Another pilot (JEB WALKER) commands an identical craft, ROCKETING
towards the assault craft just below West's.

                      JEB

          This cold war's heating up. Where did
          they come from?

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

                      WEST

          Hell. And we're going to send them
          back screaming.

West activates his targeting computer.

                      WEST

          Last one to kill a bad guy buys the
          beer.

TARGETING DISPLAY-CLOSE. The fleeing Attack Ship jogs in and out of
the crosshairs on West's holographic array. West fires.

EXT.-SPACE

The Attack Ship SHOOTS straight up, dodging West's laser BLASTS.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

West closes on the fleeing craft, as Jeb engages the other Attack
Ship, lasers FIRING in the b.g., visible through the transparent
surface of the bubble glass under West's feet.

                      WEST

          What's that sound? must be the fat lady
          warming up.

EXT.-SPACE

The fleeing Attack Ship loops in mid-space, reversing direction,
heading straight towards West's Bubble Fighter. A game of chicken.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

West doesn't flinch. Bears down, FIRING madly, the two space ships
heading straight for each other.

                      WEST

          That's right. Come on, come on, you wanna
          play, I wanna play.

EXT.-SPACE

The two ships are ROCKETING towards each other, locked in collision
vectors, lasers FIRING wildly.              asdasd

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

                      WEST

          I can hear her. Oh, yes, oh yes. She's
          gonna sing.

TARGETING:DISPLAY-CLOSE. The Attack Ship flashes, captured in the
targeting hatchmarks. The display expands into a tactical grid.

                      COMPUTER

          Target lock.

EXT.-SPACE

Imminent collision.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

The hull of the Attack Ship fills his bubble glass.

                      WEST

          The lights are dimming. The curtain's
          coming down. Sing you fat, old bag,
          sing!

West hits the firing stud.

EXT.-DEEP SPACE

West's pulse lasers converge on the Attack Ship barely meters ahead,
the ROARING craft EXPLODING directly before him.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

(OVER) WEST SCREAMS as he shoots through the sudden conflagration of
flame and debris, everywhere and then gone, giving way to the
blackness of space and the starfield beyond.

                      WEST

          Show's over.

Below, the second Attack Ship ROARS past, lasers FIRING, locked in a
pinwheel battle with Jeb's Bubble Fighter.

EXT.-SPACE

JEB'S BUBBLE FIGHTER banks, avoiding the high energy volley. Almost. A
laser BURST grazes his Bubble Fighter, the surface of his craft
sparking, suddenly scored with flames.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

The Attack ship is right behind him.

                      JEB

          Weapons are off line. Jettisoning main
          drive core.

EXT.-SPACE

The thruster core of Jeb's Bubble Fighter BLOWS off in a bolus of
flame, soaring back into the pursuit craft. The Raider EXPLODES.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

Controls are sparking. Displays flicker. (OVER) An ALARM sounds.

                      COMPUTER

          Eagle one clear this frequency and
          return to base.

DON takes a beat. Then he spins his chair towards Mars, begins working
the controls.

                      WEST

          This is Eagle One. I'm going after
          him.

                      BASE (OVER)

          Negative Eagle one, your craft is not
          equipped

West hits his thrusters.

EXT.-SPACE

West's craft dives toward Jeb's ship and Mars below.

INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER

Mars is coming up fast.

          Impact in 30 seconds.

                      WEST (OVER)

          Jeb, do you have navigational
          thrusters?

                      JEB

          Don?

                      WEST (OVER)

          It's a yes or no question.

Mars fills the windscreen. Jeb checks his status display.

                      JEB

          Marginal. But in the green.

                      COMPUTER

                      WEST (OVER)

          Head towards the canals.

                      JEB

          What are you doing?

                      WEST (OVER)

          Saving your ass. Read towards the
          canals. Now!

The canal streaked face of the Mars is all Jeb can see. He grabs his
throttle, engages his navigational thrusters and pulls.

EXT.-JEB'S SHIP

A tiny directional thruster FIRES, angling Jeb's craft so that it
scrapes the surface of Mars and dives into a giant canal, rocky walls
rushing up fast.

INT.-WEST'S SHIP

West is accelerating toward Jeb.

                      BASE (OVER)

          Major West, your ship is not equipped
          for rescue. You are not authorized to
          jeopardize this asset. That is
          a direct order. Acknowledge!

West slams a switch, deactivating his radio.

                      WEST

          Never liked that station, anyway.

He BLASTS into the canal, walls rushing up on either side of him.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

Jeb's tiny craft is plunging toward the rocky crater floor below.

Overhead West's fighter appears, under full thrusters, roaring towards
the crater floor faster and at a sharper angle.

INT.-3EB'S FIGHTER

The canal floor is rushing up fast.

                      COMPUTER

          Impact in five seconds.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

Don is blasting toward the canal floor, almost as if trying to beat
Jeb's ship to a fiery impact below.

                      COMPUTER

          Warning. Proximity alert.

                      WEST

          Jeb, I'm going to give you a little
          kiss. Don't take it the wrong way.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

West angles his ship directly under Jeb.

INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER

The expanding surface of Mars, visible beneath his feet, is suddenly
obscured by Don's fighter, swooping under his ship.

                      JEB

          Don, abort. Abort.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

Jeb's fighter is visible overhead.

West going up. Don angles the throttle.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

Don's ship, sandwiched between the surface of Mars and Jeb's fighter,
angles up and, like a cue ball hitting it's target, Knocks Jeb's ship
spinning toward the safety of space beyond. West's ship actually
scrapes the surface of the planet, sending up a plume of Martian dust.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

                      JEB (OVER)

          Does this mean we're going steady?

West pulls his throttle all the way back.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

West shoots up and out towards the dark of space.

                      WEST (OVER)

          You weren't getting out of buying
          those beers that easy.

The rescue craft converge on Jeb's ship as Don heads for base.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

WILL ROBINSON (10) hides in a small space, watching the commercial on
a jury-rigged, palm-sized computer. He mimics the Naylrator.

WILL-POV. Spying through the open slats of his biding place into...

INT:-LIVING ROOM-AFTERNOON

Basic twenty first century modern. MAUREEN ROBINSON stands, talking
with a PRINCIPAL who in less than happy.

                     PRINCIPAL

          He hacked our main power grid to run
          his experiment. The school was in
          chaos. We didn't even have lights.

The room lights suddenly dim. The Principal flickers, revealed as a
holograph, her head now sitting on Schwartzenegger body.

Maureen LAUGHS, then realizes the Principal has no idea her image is
being distorted. Maureen begins moving about the room, surreptitiously
glancing behind couches, into cabinets.

                     PRINCIPAL (OVER)

          This is no laughing matter, Mrs.
          Robinson. Will is terribly gifted. His
          little time machines, though pure
          fancy, are the products of a truly
          brilliant mind.

The Principal's body has become Twiggy's. Now that of an ape. Maureen
pulls open a closet. Will sits inside. Grins.

                     WILL

          The changing shape of education.

                     MAUREEN

          No more monkey business.

Will shrugs, adjusts his deck. The Principal returns to normal.

                     PRINCIPAL

          The boy is starved for attention. Was
          there no way his father could have
          attended the science fair?

EXT.-HOUSTON - DAY

Probably Austin and Dallas too. Texas has become a giant urban sprawl
spreading into Mexico and beyond. Immense industrial air purifiers
hang in a dark, wet sky.

EXT.-HOUSTON SPACE COMMAND-ESTABLISHING

A giant dome topped pedestal towers ever the skyline.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-MISSION CONTROL-DAY

A MAN stands before a large viewscreen facing the throng of PRESS.

He's a little uncomfortable with all the media attention. This is
PROFESSOR JOHN ROBINSON.

                     JOHN

          Once we have landed on Alpha Prime our
          on board robot will begin construction
          of a hypergate.

ON SCREEN a hi-tech orbital gate is highlighted and expanded.

                     JOHN

          By then, technicians here on Earth
          will have completed a companion
          hypergate in our planet's orbit.

ON SCREEN an image of an orbital gate now under construction.

                     JOHN

          Once both gates are complete, ships
          will be able to pass instantaneously
          between them. The Jupiter can bring
          the Dimondium back to Earth without
          the ten year delay of a return trip.

                     REPORTER

          Why can't you just use the Jupiter's
          hyperengine to zap straight to Alpha
          Prime?

                     JOHN

          As you know, hyperspace exists beneath
          normal space. If you try to enter
          hyperspace without a gate

ON SCREEN a graphic spaceship appears randomly in the corner of a
turning schematic of the galaxy.

                     JOHN

          Your exit vector is random. There's no
          telling where you'd come out.

                     REPORTER

          Professor, how is Captain Daniels
          recovering from the flu? Will we still
          be able to pilot the mission?

John glances to the doorway where a uniformed GENERAL stands.

                     GENERAL

          Ladies and Gentlemen, you came to get
          a look at the Jupiter One. Don't you
          think you've waited long enough?

John hits a button and the room darkens. A giant monitor reveals...

INT.-LAUNCH DOME

A giant saucer sits connected to its launch pad by loading belts,
steaming fuel tubes and spindled gantries.

                     REPORTER (OVER)

          about leaving the Earth behind....

          This whole mission sucks!

INT.-ROBINSON HOME HALLWAY-SUNSET

PENNY ROBINSON (14) furious, turns, looks downstairs at Maureen.

                      PENNY

          I Don't want to stay home for dinner.
          I want to see my friends for the last
          time.

She takes a beat, blinking away the tears. Lifts her wrist and turns
on a video camera watch. She begins down the hall.

VIDEO-POV. Penny's face in the monitor screen.

                      PENNY

          ... On the eve before she is torn from
          her friends, kidnapped, hurled into
          deep space against her will, what
          thoughts fill the mind of the young
          Space Captive....

INT.-WILL'S ROOM-SUNSET

Penny enters a strewn, boy' a world. Will is trying to select items to
place in a single packing canister marked: PERSONAL CARGO.

                      WILL

          Will there be boys on Alpha Centuri?
          What will I wear?

                      PENNY

          When we wake up in ten years the video
          journals of Penny Robinson, Space
          Captive, will be devoured by millions.
          I will be world famous. You on the
          other hand, will have been totally
          forgotten.

Penny shows the camera her arm, covered by strings of ribbons.

                      PENNY

          The Space Captive has decided to wear
          ribbons of support for fellow
          sufferers as she is dragged into deep
          space, green for the ecological
          issues, white for human rights

                      WILL

          You'd probably gag if I described the
          secondary infections loss of
          circulation can cause.

Penny seems about to speak, instead just smiles, goes to his bed and
pulls off the sheets, begins knotting them together.

                      WILL

          What are you grinning at?

                      PENNY

          I just found an upside to this
          mission. The thought of jettisoning
          your body into deep space.

Penny knots the sheets into a rope, ties it to the bed-post. Will
lifts several palm-sized gold-plated stars. Each reads: 1st prize.

                      WILL

          Dad says Don't bring them. Like
          anything I do matters to him.

                      PENNY

          He never showed, huh?

                      WILL


          Maybe if I had actually broken the
          time barrier he would have paid
          attention.

                      PENNY

          Don't let him get to you, kiddo. He
          just gets busy with work is all.

Penny tosses the rope out the window, prepares to climb.

                      WILL

          So, that's a no to family dinner?

                      PENNY

          Let's see, do I spend my last night on
          Earth watching Mom and Dad pretend not
          to be fighting again or get in ten
          years of making-out at the mall ...
          you do the math.

                      WILL

          Mom's gonna go thermal.

                      PENNY

          What's she gonna do. Ground me?

CHAPTER 4: Major West

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-CORRIDOR

John and the General walk the metal passageway.

                      JOHN

          We're lucky they didn't press on
          Daniels, condition.

                      GENERAL

          I figured a chance to look at the ship
          would keep the dogs at bay.

                      JOHN

          Ben, I'm worried about jamming in a
          replacement pilot at the last second.
          My family' a on this mission. I need
          someone who's more than just spit and
          polish.

                      GENERAL

          I've got your man. He just doesn't
          know it yet.

The General palms an access panel. A door hisses open to reveal...

INT.-SPACE COMMAND- CONFERENCE ROOM-CONTINUOUS

A figure stands staring silently out the window. Don West. He offers a
salute. By his eyes, West is clearly agitated.

                      GENERAL

          At ease, Major.

                      WEST

          Sir, why was I pulled off active duty?
          I salvaged my craft and Jeb's. I'll
          fight a court martial, General.

                      GENERAL

          Do you know Professor Robinson?

                      WEST

          By reputation only.

          (to John)

          Your father's battle strategies were
          required reading at the Academy.

                      GENERAL

          How much do you know about the Jupiter
          Mission, Major?

                      WEST

          The Jupiter is fully automated. The
          pilot flies the ship out of the solar
          system and lands on Alpha Prime. It's
          a baby sitting job, sir.

                      GENERAL

          Major, you are aware Earth's resources
          are severely limited.

                      WEST

          Every schoolchild knows our recycling
          technologies will save the
          environment. Sending a family across
          the galaxy is a publicity stunt to
          sell soda to people of all ages.

                      GENERAL

          What I am about to tell you is
          classified. Every schoolchild
          has been lied to. The recycling
          technologies have failed. In
          less than two decades Earth will be
          unable to support human life.

                      GENERAL

          We spun the ad campaign to give the
          mission a friendly face, keep people
          from panicking in the streets. We
          partnered with Coke because the 900
          billion this mission cost would have
          bankrupted the government. The
          SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth
          as well as we do. They hope to reach
          Alpha Prime first - And if they do,
          I guarantee you, they will not share
          the Dimondium with Western Demons like
          us. our crops will wither. We will be
          left to die.

                      WEST

          ...Captain Daniels doesn't have the
          flu, does he sir?

                      GENERAL

          Daniels was murdered in his apartment
          last night. The flu story is a cover
          we fed the press.

                      WEST

          Dan was a good pilot. A good man.

                      GENERAL

          Your rescue stunt over Mars was
          foolhardy. Explain yourself, Major.

                      WEST

          I had a friend in trouble.

                      GENERAL

          You endangered a one billion dollar
          spacecraft, disobeyed a direct order
          because of a friend?

                      WEST

          Yes sir. And I'd do it again. Sir.

                      JOHN

          He'll do.

          (stepping forward)

                      GENERAL

          Congratulations Major, you're the new
          pilot of the Jupiter mission.

CHAPTER 5: Dr. Smith

EXT.-DESERT-DAY

Sun beats hard on a MAN who stands on a windswept sand dune, talking
to a smartly dressed BUSINESSMAN.

                      MAN

          Perhaps a brief jaunt down memory
          lane is required. I was contracted
          to provide Daniels, apartment code.
          My work is done.

                      BUSINESSMAN

          They found a replacement pilot, the
          mission is going ahead on schedule.

                      MAN

          How tragic. For you.

                      BUSINESSMAN

          We require more direct intervention.

                      MAN

          I see. Well, that will cost you. And,
          I'm afraid my price has just become
          ... astronomical.

(OVER) a KNOCK. The man reaches forward and presses a button. The
businessman, the desert disappear, only holographs.

Room lights.

Lights come up to reveal...

INT.-MISSION CONTROL-MEDICAL LABS

The man turns, revealing a face as clever an his eyes are evil. This
is DR. ZACHARY SMITH. He walks to the door, palms a panel, and the
portal hiss open. A TECHNICIAN ENTERS.

                      TECHNICIAN

          Control hasn't received the results
          of your final pre-flight exams,
          Doctor Smith.

The Doctor moves to a circular overhead light board around which are
displayed the faces of the crew of the Jupiter craft. Removes the
micro-files, hands them to the technician.

                      SMITH

          The Robinsons are checked out at one
          hundred percent. They are in perfect
          condition and ready to fly.

He smiles, so sweet you can barely see the malevolence behind it.

                      SMITH

          Wish them good luck for me.

CHAPTER 6: Welcome Aboard!
--------------------------


INT.-SPACE COMMAND-WALKING

Three small figures walk through a gantry towards the ship.

                      GENERAL (OVER)

          The mission protocols are simple.
          Professor Robinson is in command
          unless you encounter a military
          emergency. In that case, Major West,
          you will assume command.

The figures have come to the saucer entry-port.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          Welcome aboard, Major.

INT.-JUPITER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Don, John, and the General ENTER. Don's eyes widen.

West looks like somebody sprung for the full extras package on this
baby.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hi-tech heaven. Two pilots, chairs face a giant windscreen. Don walks
to the consoles that stretch toward the back walls.

                      JOHN

          Some of this technology might be new
          to you. I'll be happy to explain.

                      WEST

          (off the com)

          Cold fusion drive

          (off the size consoles)

          Rambler-Krey Life Sciences stations.

Don strides to a pedestal in the center of the bridge. Flicks a switch
and a holographic Jupiter craft appears on the launch pad.

                      WEST

          Holographic navigational interface.

Don points to a row of man-sized glass cylinders on the back wall.

                      WEST

          Cryosleep array. Fully monitored.

He approaches the blast doors that lead off the back of the bridge.

                      WEST

          Sick bay, remote Ops, engineering and
          living quarters are below decks.
          Hyperengine should be in here.

Don hits a wall panel which opens to reveal an immense ENGINE ROOM.

                      JOHN

          If you have to baby sit, it's not
          such a bad nursery, wouldn't you
          agree, Major?

Just then the ELEVATOR rises from the lower decks. On its circular
platform stands a DOCTOR in a lab coat. She walks to the General.

                      DOCTOR

          The cryosleep systems are running at
          ninety five percent.

                      GENERAL

          Doctor Smith approved the specs-

                      DOCTOR

          Doctor Smith is base physician. I am
          responsible once this ship is in
          flight. These tubes have to keep the
          crew in suspended animation for ten
          years. They will be perfect or this
          ship will not launch. Is that clear?

                      GENERAL

          Absolutely, Doctor.

                      JOHN

          Judy, I'd like you to meet Major
          West. He's taking Mike's place.

                      DOCTOR

          He's heavier than Mike. We'll have to
          re-calibrate.

                      WEST

          I'd be more than happy to discuss my
          dimensions perhaps over dinner?

                      DOCTOR

          West - I've read about you. Something
          of a war hero, aren't you?

                      WEST

          (preening )

          Well, yes, actually.

                      DOCTOR

          Those who can't think, fight.

          (a freezing smile)

          Well, nice to have met you.

She heads toward the readouts. West turns to John.

                      WEST

          That's one cold fish I'd love to
          thaw.

                      JUDY

          (turning)

          I'm not going to make it home for
          dinner, Dad.

West turns to John. Dad?

                      WEST

          It's going to be a long flight.

EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT

Lights burn in the windows.

INT.-ROBINSON HOME-DINING ROOM-NIGHT

John ENTERS to find the remains of an elegant dinner on the table,
candles never lit, food never eaten.

John crosses to a small scale model sitting on the table. Around it
hangs another gold plated 1st prize star. He smiles.

                      MAUREEN (OVER)

          He won first prize again. He
          practically brought down his entire
          school. But he won first prize.

Maureen descends the steps in a bathrobe. Joins John.

                      JOHN

          A non-working prototype for his time
          machine. Sharp stuff for a midget.

Maureen is silent.

                      JOHN

          I'm sorry about dinner. I had to work
          late. The new pilot-.

                      MAUREEN

          What you had to do was prioritize
          your family over the mission

                      JOHN

          Maureen. This mission is about our
          family. So we can stay together

                      MAUREEN

          The perfect nuclear family. The most
          stable social unit, ideally suited
          for the isolation of a long journey
          into space. It's all just PR, John.
          You're never home. Judy is
          becoming a ghost just like you. Penny
          can't see past her own navel and Will
          has to black out-his school, just to
          get his father's attention. The
          perfect nuclear family in ruin.

John stares at his wife. Then he reaches forward, touches her hair.

                      JOHN

          I know, Maureen. I'm scared too.

A beat. Then she moves to him. And he holds her close.

INT.-ROBINSON HOME-WILL'S ROOM-NIGHT

John stands in the yellow wedge of hall light. He touches something
hanging around his own neck. A pair of metal dog tags.

WIDER

Will lies in his bed, eyes closed. Asleep. A beat. John turns, heading
out into the hall.

EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT

The bedroom lights go out, a normal home against the backdrop of the
launch dome towering in the distance.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-LAUNCH DOME-NIGHT

The Jupiter one stands amidst loading gantries, final supplies rolling
into the
ship on automated conveyer belts and lifts.

CHAPTER 7: Primary Directives
-----------------------------


PAN DOWN

TWO TECHNICIANS stand checking off supplies on a lightpad.

                      LOADING TECHNICIAN

          Anything else?

                      LOADING TECHNICIAN #2

          I'm showing a late shipment from
          Mission Medical. Smith's
          authorization. Here it is now.

HOLD on a canister that reads: BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS: Do Not Open, as
it passes on the loading belt. FOLLOW THE DRUM as it winds along the
conveyer, up a gantry towards the Jupiter One. PUSH IN...

INT. -CARGO DRUM

Smith sits crouched inside, cleaning his nails.

INT.-JUPITER ONE-LOWER DECKS

A giant robot stands attached to its service bay. Still. Silent.

A SERVICE DRAWER slides open and a shadowy infiltrator emerges, his
face visible in the dim service light. Smith.

Smith approaches the docked Robot, places a small keypad device on the
Robot's dormant CPU panel. Smith activates the device.

                      SMITH

          You'll forgive me if I forgo the
          kiss, my sleeping behemoth.

Smith hits a switch on the panel and the Robot's system indicators
light into life. Smith types several keys on the keypad.

                      SMITH

          But the time has come to awake.

                      ROBOT

          Robot is on-line. Reviewing primary
          directives. One, preserve the
          Robinson Family. Two, Maintain ship
          systems. Three

                      SMITH

          Spare me the chatter.

Smith taps the keypad. The Robot is silenced. Smith types again.

                      SMITH

          What noble charges my steely
          centurion. Sadly I fear you have far
          more dire deeds in store for you.

Smith completes his re-programming. Hits a switch.

                      ROBOT

          Robot is on-line. Reviewing primary
          directives. Two hours into mission
          destroy Robinson family. Destroy all
          systems.

Smith smiles. Removes the re-programming module.

                      SMITH

          Now that's more like it. Farewell my
          tin-plated pal. Give my regards to
          oblivion.

Smith climbs into a chute marked WASTE DISPOSAL.

INT.-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE

Smith begins crawling down the chute. His tiny reprogramming module
BEEPS. Smith activates a tiny, built in com-link.

From the mic, the familiar visage of the Businessman is projected into
the crawlspace over Smith's face.

                      SMITH

          I told you never to call me here.

                      BUSINESSMAN

          I see you have completed your mission
          on schedule Good work, Doctor. And
          goodbye.

The Businessman smiles. SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled.

Suddenly the tiny module in his hand OVERLOADS, the flesh on his palm
smoking as Smith is engulfed in an electrical charge. He goes out, his
body perfectly still.

CHAPTER 8: Launch!
------------------


EXT.-SPACE COMMAND-MORNING

The giant dome shines in the early sun.

INT-JUPITER ONE  John and Maureen face will and Penny who stand now in
their freezing tubes. All  wear silver flight suits. Maureen moves
Penny's hair from in front of her face.

                      PENNY

          Don't, mom. Vogue says this will be
          the style in ten years.

                      WILL

          Will she wake up less annoying?

                      PENNY

          Does he have to wake up at all?

                      MAUREEN

          Alright you two, enough.

Maureen kisses her children. John moves to will who reaches to shake
at the same moment John tries to hug him. A beat. Then John tries to a
shake as Will goes for the hug. A total miss. Will backs into his
tube.

                      MAUREEN

          You get a C in paternal expression,
          Professor. But an A for effort.

John kisses his wife, already in her tube.

                      MAUREEN

          You always get an A in that.

                      JUDY

          Don't let me shatter this unbridled
          display of affection, but we are
          running behind.

                      JOHN

          (entering his tube)

          Major, she's all yours.

                      WEST

          I'll try to give you a smooth ride.

Judy walks the row, checking their bio-monitors. Enters her tube.

                      JUDY

          Mission control this is Dr. Robinson.
          We are in the green.

                      MISSION CONTROL (OVER)

          Roger, Doctor, you are go to initiate
          cryostasis.

Don walks to Judy's tube.

                      WEST

          One question, Doctor. in there room
          in these tubes for two?

                      JUDY

          Barely enough for you and your ego,
          Major. Drive carefully.

              (touches her com-link)

          initializing cryostasis tubes.

The tubes rotate closed around the Robinsons. Suddenly each crew
member is surrounded by a shimmering blue glow, brightening like a
star and then subsiding. All stand fixed in suspended animation.

Don stares at the family a beat. He goes to the main console. Straps
himself in.

                      WEST

          Mission Control, this is Jupiter One.
          The Robinsons are asleep. We are
          ready to fly.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-MISSION CONTROL

Welcome to the future. Banks of monitors manned by gum-chewing, pink
haired technicians. A giant monitor shows the Jupiter on the launch
pad. The CONTROLLER (NOAH FREEMAN) pulls in to his console.

                      NOAH

          Jupiter Two this is Mission Control.
          You are at T-minus two minutes and

          We're outta here.

EXT. JUPITER ONE

The atomic power source fires a focused BLAST, shooting the Jupiter
through cloud and sky towards the black edge of space.

INT:-MISSION CONTROL

The main screen shows a graphic of the Jupiter's trajectory as the
ship arcs toward the outer edge of the atmosphere.

                      NOAH

A CHEER goes up in the control room.

EXT.-JUPITER ONE

The giant saucer shell EXPLODES, revealing the inner ship, the
glittering high tech shape of the JUPITER TWO.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Don watches as the Earth recedes into a blue marble, flickering
orbital billboards growing distant. Smiles at the familiar sight.

CHAPTER 9: Destroy!
-------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE-LATER

Smith lies still. He starts from a nightmare into...-a nightmare

INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS

Smith scrambles out of the chute, stares at his hand, the impression
of the overloaded communicator seared into his palm.

He spins around disoriented. Stumbles to a closed view screen and hits
a stud. The blast shield opens. Space.

SMITH-CLOSE. Shock. No words.

THE ROBOT-CLOSE. In his docking bay. Suddenly the automaton powers up,
lights activating as his CPU comes on line.

                      SMITH

          No.

Smith turns, slaps the burned out programming module on the Robot.

                      SMITH

          Disable program.

No response. The Robot continues to power up.

Smith engage interface. Initiate system shut-down.

                      ROBOT

          Robot is on line. Implementing prime
          command directives.

The Robot disengages from the service bay, begins rolling forward.

                      ROBOT

          Robinson family, destroy.

                      SMITH

          No. Cease. Desist.

The Robot rolls towards the bridge.

                      ROBOT

          All operating Systems, destroy.

Smith grabs a wrench from a tool bracket, leaps for the Robot. The
Robot swings once, sending Smith flying into a flaring console.

                      ROBOT

          Jupiter Two, destroy.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL-NIGHT

Dark. A single Techie (ANNIE) mans the watch, playing holo-games with
a stylus over her desk. SCREENS flicker into life.

                      ANNIE

          What the-?

          (into a mic)

          Somebody wake up the chief.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE

Still. The bridge doors open and the ambient lights come on.

The Robot rolls onto the bridge, faces the cryosleep array. He extends
his arms, an electrical charge arcing between his claws.

                      ROBOT

          Robinson Family, destroy.

He fires, a blast of electricity hitting the cryosleep controls.
(OVER) ALARMS sound as the tubes begin to descend, electricity
sparking across the sleeping Robinsons.

                      SMITH (OVER)

          Mechanical moron. You'll kill us all.

Smith, wrench in hand, rushes the Robot, is again hurled across the
room. The Robot turns towards the navigational computer.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

Fully lit. All the monitors are manned by sleepy Techies. Noah ENTERS,
taking a coffee from Annie without breaking stride. , ALARMS flash
everywhere.

                      NOAH

          This mission's over. Wake them up.

The Techies begins working the controls.

                      ANNIE

          No response, sir. I'm sorry.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The Robot is facing the navigational holograph in the center of the
bridge. The electricity arcs between his claws once again.

                      ROBOT

          Operating systems, Destroy.

Smith is slumped against the bulkhead. He shakes off his fall in time
to see the Robot fire at the navigational array, the holograph
disappearing in the flames of the exploding pedestal.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship begins to veer off course, falling towards the sun.

INT.JUPITER TWO

The Robot is rolling toward the com.

THE FREEZING TUBES are quickly being engulfed in flames. Smith
stumbles toward their control station. Begins typing madly.

                      SMITH

          Wake up, damn you. I can't stop this
          infernal contraption on my own.

He SMASHES a glass panel that reads EMERGENCY DEACTIVATE. The figures
inside the lowering tubes glow. All except Judy.

The Robot is before the Com, electricity arcing between his claws.

                      SMITH

          (off the tubes)

          Hurry up. Hurry up.

The Robot FIRES at the main Com, controls EXPLODING everywhere. The
freezing tubes begin to open, the Robot spinning to face them.

John blinks to life first. Emerges, ducking a BLAST of electrical
energy from the Robot, hitting the deck and rolling.

                      JOHN

          Maureen. The children.

Maureen grabs Will and Penny, pulls them down just as the Robot blows
away their tubes.

John pulls a laser pistol from a wall mount.

                      JOHN

          Disengage safety.

                      GUN

          Voiceprint confirmed.

The Robot spins towards John, FIRES an electrical charge - John dodges
at the last instant, the grazing blast burning his silvery suit,
singeing his side, sending into the wall, his gun flying.

                      WILL

          Dad!

Will ducks under his mother's arm, scrambles across the bridge.

                      MAUREEN

          Will, wait.

The Robot FIRES at the scrambling boy but misses, Will disappearing
down the gunny hatch leading to the lower decks.

DON leaps from his tube atop the Robot's back, trying to grab the
Robot's power source. The mechanical monster electrifies his shell,
sending the Major flying.

The Robot turns to Penny and Maureen. Extends his arms toward them.

Electricity arcing between his claws. The two are done for. Maureen
puts her hand over Penny's eyes.

                      MAUREEN

          Look away, baby.

The Robot is about to fire. Suddenly the Robot freezes, his claws
deactivate, his power lights go to stand-by and he stands immobile.

WIDER. Will stands in the b.g., his tiny hacking deck in his hands.

                      WILL

          Robot. Return to your docking bay and
          power down.

                      ROBOT

          Command accepted.

The Robot turns and begins heading for the elevator. All watch in
amazement. Will grins, a familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes.

                      WILL

          If the family won't come to the
          science fair, bring the science fair
          to the family.

An EXPLOSION rocks the ship.

                      PENNY (OVER)

          Mom, look, it's Doctor Smith.

Penny stands over Smith who lays crumpled in the corner. Maureen grabs
an emergency medi-kit from a wall clamp, tosses it to Penny.

                      MAUREEN

          Pulse, respiration and bleeding-

                      PENNY

          Basic triage, lock down and
          stabilize. I know the drill.

John is standing, helps Don to his feet.

                      WEST

          NEXT picnic, no robots.

Don moves fast to the helm. The main view screen is still closed,
covered by giant metal blast shields.

                      WEST

          Communications links are down.

Maureen is at the life sciences console.

                      MAUREEN

          Life support is at ten percent.
          Trying to bring secondary systems on
          line. It's not working.

VIDEO MONITOR-POV. Penny is bandaging Smith's head, her bravado barely
masking her fathoml4ss terror.

                      PENNY

          Explosions rock the ship. Danger is
          everywhere, 'Yet the Space Captive is
          fearless as she...

A console FLARES. Penny fights back tears, terrified.

                      PENNY

          I want to go home now.

Don is at the navigational system.

Suddenly the lights go on, the air compressors begin to Hiss.

                      MAUREEN

          Life support is back on line.

                      WEST

          I can't get the blast shields open.
          We're flying blind.

Penny in working ever Smith, bandaging his head. She runs stimulator
under his nose. Smith begins to stir, COUGHING.

                      PENNY

          I've got life signs.

          (wincing)

          Boy, somebody could use a breath
          mint.

West turns, spots Smith for the first time.

                      WEST

          (to John)

          Try the emergency back-ups.

Don moves to the fallen figure, lifts him up against the bulkhead.

                      WEST

          Smith, what the hell-

                      SMITH

          I was making a last minute check ...
          someone hit me from behind.

Don almost buys it. Then he notices Smith's hand, grabs it.

BURN-CLOSE. The reprogramming module's distinctive, foreign signature
seared into his flesh.

                      WEST

          Sino-Jordanian technology. You're a
          Goddamned spy.

          (realizing)

          You did this.

Don slams him against the bulkhead, begins dragging him towards the
airlock. The pilot hits a switch. The inner hatch opens.

                      SMITH

          Stop. What are you doing?

                      WEST

          Dropping some extra weight.

                      MAUREEN (OVER)

          Help, somebody. Please.

REVERSE ANGLE

Maureen stands at Judy's freezing tube. The young doctor's cryofield
is sparking on and off.

                      MAUREEN

          The thawing engine in broken. can't
          get her out. She's dying.

Smith uses the distraction to palm-slam Don in the chin, knocking him
backwards. Don staggers, goes again for Smith.

                      SMITH

          Touch me and the girl dies.

Don freezes in his tracks.

                      SMITH

          Your mission physician is indisposed.
          I can save her life. But only if you
          spare mine.

                      WEST

          I Don't deal with dead men.

                      SMITH

          Kill me, I kill the girl. How much is
          your revenge worth, Major? I will, of
          course, need your word as an officer
          that you will let me live.

Don's decision is lighting fast.

                      WEST

          Help her.

                      JOHN

          I've got a com signal.

Suddenly the radio SQUAWKS into life.

                      RADIO

          ...Is Mission Control. Do you read?

          Emergency power's on line. I think I

VIEWSCREEN CLOSE. The blast shields part to reveal a giant fiery orb
in their path. They are heading directly for the sun.

Noah stands over the Com. The room is a madhouse.

Noah looks up at the main monitor. The graphic of the Jupiter Two is
heading towards the graphic of the sun.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

John and Don stand over the Com.

                      NOAH (OVER)

DON straps himself into the pilot's chair.

                      WEST

          I'm going to try for the Mercury
          Mines.

SMITH stands at the freezing tube, Penny and Maureen assisting him.

                      SMITH

          I will need Dr. Robinson's portable
          gurney. I believe it is stored in-

                      PENNY

          I'm on it.

Penny races off. Smith begins working the controls to Judy's freezing
tube.

                      MAUREEN

          We trusted you.

          (sinking in)

          You tried to kill us all.

                      SMITH

          Existence offers us nothing if not
          the opportunity for an endless series
          of betrayals.

          (off her stunned expression)

          There's a world behind the world,
          Professor Robinson. Lie once, cheat
          twice and everything becomes clear.
          Do not mistake my deception for a
          character flaw. It is philosophical
          choice, a profound understanding of
          the universe. It is a way of life.

                      MAUREEN

          You're a monster.

                      SMITH

          Perhaps. But I am also the only one
          who can save your daughter's life.

Penny reappears, a case in hand. She presses a button and the case
unfolds into a hovering, gyroscopicaly-leveled gurney.

                      MAUREEN

          Where's Will?

                      PENNY

          He's futzing with that Robot.

                      SMITH

          Alright, Penny dear, I need you to
          short the power on my command.

                      PENNY

          Does he have to call me dear?

                      SMITH

          Professor, if you will assist me in
          lowering the body.

Smith hands Penny a wrench.

                      SMITH

          Penny, dear. Now.

Maureen nods. Penny SLAMS the wrench into the power circuit. The
freezing field FLARES and deactivates, the tube swinging open.

LIFESIGN MONITOR-CLOSE. Flatline.

                      MAUREEN

          She's dying.

Smith and Maureen lower her onto the gurney.

                      SMITH

          Sickbay. Move.

Penny, Maureen and Smith rush the gurney out the blast doors towards
Sickbay just as the ship tilts madly.

AT THE HELM

WINDSCREEN-CLOSE. The sun is growing ever larger.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-SICKBAY

Penny, Smith and Maureen have transferred Judy onto a hi-tech
scanning-bed. A hovering holographic schematic of Judy's physiognomy

Penny unzips the silver material as Smith works the console,
highlighting her holographic heart.

                      SMITH

          Clear.

The holographic image of her heart beats once, then is still.

                      SMITH

          Again. Clear.

The lights flicker on the bio-console, the holograph winks out.

A beat. Then Judy opens her eyes, manages a weak smile.

                      JUDY

          You should try to look less worried.
          It has a tendency to spook the

          Thank you.

Smith holds her gaze, his eyes almost snake-like.

                      SMITH

          You are a good woman, Maureen. Any man
          could see that. I hope I have proven
          the well-being of your family is of
          great importance to me. Perhaps, if
          you convinced your husband to trust
          me...

Maureen stares at him. A beat. She pulls a laser from the wall. Points
it at his forehead.

Maureen kneels before Penny and Will, making sure they're okay. Smith
stands silently in the b.g. Judy's gurney is empty. John ENTERS, his
face wrought with fatherly concern.

John holds her close, spared a father's worst fear.

          Will every disaster be an excuse for
          familial sentiment? Please tell me
          now so I may gather up a liberal

Don turns towards Smith. Maureen steps between them.

          What happened, John? Where are we?

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE

Don in at the navigational holograph, patching sparking wires. The
rest of the crew emerge onto the bridge.

Don makes a connection. The pedestal powers up, a holograph of the
Jupiter Two appearing over its surface.

          entire known galaxy.

                      PENNY

          We're lost, aren't we?

Judy wraps her arm around her sister.

                      WEST

          What the hell is that?

VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The nearest planet is starting to glow. Suddenly a
distortion field begins to emanate from the alien world. The edges of
space seem to sear away, leaving a glowing portal.

                      JOHN

          Any effect on the ship?

                      WEST

          No.

VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. All the planets and constellations beyond the
portal appear to be in different places.

                      JOHN

          (off the navigational hologram)

          All the planets have moved.

                      WEST

          And where did that come from?

CHAPTER 12: The Proteus
-----------------------


EXT.-SPACE

Breaking the inner edge of the portal, a long silver space needle
catches the light from the dual suns.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The crew man their stations. Only Will is absent as they the ship
maneuver around the portal.

VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. As they, move behind the portal it seems to
disappear, showing only the blackness of space. No ship beyond.

                      WEST

          It's gone.

                      JOHN

          No. Go back in front of it.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

As the ship moves back in front of the portal, the hole in space is
visible again, the giant probe ship revealed once more within...

                      JOHN

          It's a hole in space. A doorway.

                      WEST

          A doorway to where?

                      JOHN

          If we want to reach that ship, we're
          going to have to find out.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two flies through the pulsing hole in space.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The giant, silver ship looms in the windscreen.

                      MAUREEN

          No apparent effects on the ship.

                      WEST

          I'm hailing on all frequencies. No
          response.

                      JOHN

          There are some markings on the
          starboard side. Can you throw some
          light on her?

                      WEST

          Don't know if the exterior spots are
          working.- There we go.

THE WINDSCREEN-CLOSE. Powerful spotlights hit the ship.

WEST AND JOHN-CLOSE. And really surprised.

                      WEST

          If this in all a dream, why can't
          there be more girls?

THE SPACESHIP-CLOSE. Essentially a needle covered with metal scallops.
On its hull, under the legend PROTEUS, an American flag.

                      WEST

          I've never seen a design like this.
          what are those scales on her hull?

                      JOHN

          How could Earth launch a ship this
          massive and neither of us know about
          it? ... It just doesn't make sense.

                      WEST

          These scanners are damaged, I'm
          getting inconsistent life signs but
          they may be sensor ghosts.

                      JOHN

          Maybe her computer's still up. I'm
          trying standard remote access codes.

ON SCREEN-A docking ring on the giant ship comes to life, giant floods
coming to life, the docking aperture rotating open.

                      WEST

          What do you know?

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two heads towards the giant ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      JOHN

          Can you give me some light on the
          secondary docking ring?

A smaller docking ring is illuminated on the viewscreen.

                      WEST

          What do you make of that?

Attached to the starboard docking ring is another, smaller craft. Its
snaking anthropomorphic lines are not of human design.

                      MAUREEN

          Boys, I think we're having a close
          encounter.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter moves into the docking ring of the giant ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) a giant THUD as the Jupiter Two docks with the probe.

                      ROBOT (OVER)

          Crush.

REVERSE ANGLE. The Robot in rolling in through the doorway, arms
waving wildly before him.

                      ROBOT

          Crush! Kill! Destroy!

Don and John are up fast. But the Robot just rolls to a stop. Will
steps from behind the automaton, his hacker's deck in his hand.

He pulls a tiny mic from his deck. Lifts it to his lips.

                      WILL

          Crush. Kill. Destroy.

                      ROBOT

          Crush! Kill! Destroy!

Will points to several jury-rigged modifications.

                      WILL

          I hacked into his CPU, bypassed his
          main operating system and accessed
          his sub-routines. He's basically
          running on remote control.

All stare at him. Penny finally speaks.

                      PENNY

          Show off.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-CREW QUARTERS-LATER

Penny stands guard, a rifle in her hand, talking into her recorder.

                      PENNY

          And so the Space Captive finds
          herself helping the Robinsons by
          guarding the traitor. And she finds-

Penny's VOICE trails off. Stares out the porthole. Endless space.

                      PENNY

          She finds that out here, in the dark
          and cold, she's scared, and she's
          kind of glad they're all together.

Just then Don approaches, a silver bundle under his arm.

                      PENNY

          Identify yourself, soldier.

                      WEST

          West, Major, United Space Force,
          requesting permission to see the
          prisoner.

Penny steps aside.

                      PENNY

          Proceed Major West.

Don smiles, winks at her, going through the door.

                      PENNY

          Ouch. Could he be cuter? I don't
          think so.

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

Actually a med-lab. Smith turns to face Don an he ENTERS.

                      SMITH

          These quarters are totally
          unacceptable. I demand-

Don tosses his bundle on the seat. A silver flight suit.

                      WEST

          We're going to check out the probe
          ship. Maybe we can figure out how
          they got here. And how to get home.

                      SMITH

          Ta-ta. Have a wonderful trip.

                      WEST

          You're coming with us.

                      SMITH

          Out of the question. I'm a doctor not
          a space explorer. You and-

But Don is in his face in a heartbeat.

                      WEST

          What you are is a murderous saboteur
          and I am not leaving you on this ship
          so you can do more harm than you've
          already caused.

                      SMITH

          I absolutely refuse-

                      WEST

          (closer)

          Give me an excuse to kill you.
          Please.

Smith stares at him a beat. Then he smiles, looks to the flight suit.

                      SMITH

          Silver always was my color.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS

Will stands in front of the Robot, polishing a blast mark clean.

                      WILL

          When boarding a mysterious
          spacecraft, it always pays to look
          your best.

John enters, removes a gun from the weapons locker.

                      JOHN

          Deactivate safety.

                      GUN

          Voiceprint confirmed. Rifle is
          active.

GUN-CLOSE. A small light goes from red to green.

                      JOHN

          You did a good job up there son. You
          saved us all.

                      WILL

          Thanks.

An awkward silence hangs between them.

                      JOHN

          I know I haven't around much these
          days.That we haven't had time to-

                      WEST (OVER)

          Professor, we're ready.

John looks at his boy Will in silent.

                      JOHN

          Will, you're the most important thing
          in the world to me. I hope one day
          you'll be able to see that.

With that, John walks out. Will stares after him. Faces the Robot.

                      WILL

          Take care of my dad, okay Robot?

Will works his remote, sending the Robot towards the bridge.

INT.-PROBE SHIP

A long dark corridor. Slowly the ambient lights come up. A door opens
to reveal Smith, John, Don, Judy and the Robot, stepping out of the
docking chamber, the airlock closing in the b.g.

                      JUDY

          The air is stale. Old.

                      SMITH

          That's the smell of ghosts.

Don walks to a computer panel set into the wall. Begins typing.

                      WEST

          I'm interfacing with the on board
          computer... Odd.

                      JOHN

          Not working?

                      WEST

          No, it's just, I don't know, too
          fast. Most of the systems are down.

The Robot rolls deeper into the alien ship. The others follow. More
lights flicker into life, illuminating the long corridor ahead.

                      JUDY

          Motion sensors are still working.

                      WEST (OVER)

          What do you make of this?

Smith, John and Judy join Don at one of the bulkhead walls.

                      JOHN

          Some kind of hieroglyphics.

WALL-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphics are scrawled on the hull wall.
The sketches tell a story.

HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The alien craft docks with the giant ship.

SECOND HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE-A trio of inhuman bipedal stick figures enter
the giant ship.

THIRD HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The shape of a sun or a disc, from which juts
many legs. This final hieroglyph is circled in a clotted red
substance. Don touches the stain.

CHAPTER 13: Exploration
-----------------------


                      JUDY

          If I didn't know better I'd say this
          is blood.

                      SMITH

          I know an omen when I see one. I
          suggest a hasty retreat.

                      WEST

          Just imagine we're retreating in the
          opposite direction. Now, move it.

Don shoves Smith forward with the butt of his laser rifle, the group
heading deeper into the quiet ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will watches through the Robot's POV, toggling to move the automaton
forward. A readout marked AUDIO flashes. Will turns up a volume
control. (OVER) the sound of a slow, steady DRIP.

                      WILL

          Dad, do you....

INT.-PROBE SHIP

                      ROBOT

          ... Hear something?

The Robot turns, begins heading further down the corridor. (OVER) now
DRIPPING can be heard by all.

                      SMITH

          Like the drip, drip, drip of blood..

                      WEST

          You really need to shut up.

                      JOHN

          (pointing)

          Here.

THE CEILING shows a jagged hole, covered with some kind of viscous
membrane, leading to the dark of a service tunnel above. The membrane
DRIPS steadily onto the floor below.

                      JUDY

          That material appears biological.

                      SMITH

          Nothing good will come of this.

                      WEST

          What makes you such an expert?

                      SMITH

          Trust me, Major. Evil knows evil.

                      JOHN

          Let's find the bridge. Maybe we can
          get some answers.

They head off. HOLD on the dripping membrane.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen is at the main sensor console working an instrument panel.

Penny is hanging upside down in a harness overhead, using a laser
welder on a giant mass of exposed ceiling circuitry.

                      PENNY

          Try it now, Mom.

Maureen throws a switch. The panel lights up, then goes dead.

                      PENNY

          Damn.

INT.-SHIP-WALKING

The boarding party stand at the end of the corridor. Don presses a
wall panel. The giant doors hiss open to REVEAL...

INT.-MAIN BRIDGE

Immense. Empty. And battle torn. Sections of the controls have been
blown away. Blast scoring mars the walls.

                      JUDY

          What the hell happened in here?

                      WEST

          Some kind of fire fight. Look at this
          technology. I've seen some of this
          before. On the drawing boards.

Smith has moved off slightly, wandered over to a STORAGE ALCOVE.
Within, a row of docked Robots, larger and sleeker then ours.

John and Don are powering up the Com, console lights coming on.

                      JOHN

          Can you bring up the Captain's log?

                      WEST

          The data has degraded. I'm going try
          and gather any fragments I can. There
          isn't much, but ... here we go.

MAIN SCREEN-CLOSE. Fills with snow. Then a figure can be seen. It's
Jab. But his hair is grey.

                      WEST

          Jeb.

                      JEB

          The hyperspace tracker seems to be
          functioning...

          (static)

          No sign of the Jupiter Two...

                      JEB

          (static)

          Have exceeded our mission timetable
          by two...

          (static)

          I'm not willing to give up. Don would
          keep looking for me.

                      WEST

          That's it. The rest of the data is
          totally corrupted.

IN THE ALCOVE, Smith frees a power pack from one of the robots. Slips
it into the sleeve cuff of his field suit.

                      WEST

          This doesn't make sense. How could
          they launch a rescue mission for us
          when we've only been lost a day?

Judy stands by the life sciences panel.

                      JUDY

          I've got something here.

A turning holograph appears over the console panel. A degraded image
of a trembling, viscous pouch. Tiny shapes move within.

                      JUDY

          They brought it up from the planet's
          surface. It's seems to be some sort
          of egg sack.

Don notices Smith's standing in the storage alcove.

                      WEST

          Smith, step away from there.

                      SMITH

          Happy to oblige, Major. Although I
          don't think it's me you should be
          worrying about. But rather this.

In the corner of the ceiling, another membrane covered hole.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is at his station, watching Don and John via the Robot's POV.

                      WILL

          I'm detecting motion. Behind you...

INT.-PROBE SHIP BRIDGE

A towering SHADOW shoots past the open doorway.

                      JOHN

          After it. Move.

          (to the Robot)

          Bring Smith.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIDOR

Don races down the corridor. The walls are matted with flowering
plants. Vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor.

THE SCURRYING SHAPE, about the size of a small dog, shoots out from
behind a bulkhead, disappearing into the lush greenery.

Don pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to
a door. A plaque reads HYDROPONICS LAB. He races inside.

INT.-HYDROPONICS LAB

A jungle. John and Judy arrive behind Don.

                      WEST

          This explains where all the plants
          came from.

                      JUDY

          Growth like this would take decades.

The Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw.

                      SMITH

          Unhand me, you mechanical moron.

Don's eyes fix behind Smith's head.

                      WEST

          Don't move.

                      SMITH

          I am sick of your terrorism. If you
          are going to kill me, be done with
          it. Otherwise I will insist you treat
          me with the respect and-

                      WEST

          (like steel)

          I said don't move.

Smith is suddenly silent. Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's
head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he
pulls from its hiding place a small creature.

About the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf
color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales
of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is watching through the Robot's eyes.

                      WILL

          Neat.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-HYDROPONICS GARDEN

West stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more
friendly blue. Judy approaches.

                      JUDY

          Well, who do we have here?

As the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like,
trying to hide. No luck. Don holds fast.

                      WEST

          Easy there, little buddy. No one's
          going to hurt you.

                      SMITH

          How do you know it won't hurt us?

Don has begun stroking the creature's head. After a beat, the small
beast begins to COO and emit small BLIPPING sounds.

                      JUDY

          Looks like you've made a friend. You
          have a good bedside manner, Major.

                      WEST

          I'm going to let that one go.

                      SMITH

          How charming. Doctor Dolittle of
          outer space.

                      JUDY

          Where do you think it came from?

                      JOHN

          It's possible this is one of the
          creatures represented in the
          hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It
          must have been their ship attached to
          the other docking ring.

The beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there,
burying its tiny face into his neck. Don can't help but LAUGH.

                      WEST

          It looks like a child.

                      SMITH

          If so, my dear Major, what do you
          suppose happened to its parents?

                      JOHN

          Let's get back to the bridge.

As they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the
background. Ominous. Unseen.

CHAPTER 14: Giant Spiders!
--------------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO

Penny is still hanging overhead.

                      PENNY

          I think I've got it.

The sensor console comes back to life, displays lighting, status
lights going green. Maureen stares at the monitor.

                      MAUREEN

          That's strange.

SCREEN-CLOSE. Revealed in the sensor scan, the scallops pulse with
ambient heat. Penny lands beside her.

                      PENNY

          Those scales are giving off heat.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE

John is at the Com.

                      JOHN

          I've tapped into the internal sensor
          array. Besides us, this ship is
          totally deserted.

                      SMITH

          A ghost ship.

Don is sitting with the tiny creature. He pulls a ration pack from his
pocket. Turns it over in his hand.

                      WEST

          And the flavor of the day is ...
          banana/beef. Who thinks up these
          combinations?

The creature stares at him intently as he tears open the foil lip,
sucks a bit LOUDLY. Judy can't help but smile at him.

                      WEST

          MM. Good.

                      SMITH

          Major West, I highly recommend you
          never breed. That by the way is my
          medical opinion.

Don glares at him, hands the tiny creature the pouch. The creature
looks at it, emits a small BLIP, takes a tentative suck. Its eyes
widen in delight as it begins to suck the ration pack.

                      WEST

          Little thing was hungry.

                      SMITH

          Good Lord, who will - spare us the
          tyranny of the sentimental?

(OVER) a distant, high pitched WHINE.

                      PENNY

          Do you hear something?

Suddenly the creature begins to SCREAM, leaping on Smith's back,
clinging to his neck for dear life.

                      SMITH

          Get this infernal creature off me.

The WHINE is growing louder. it seems to be coming from above.

THE CEILING-CLOSE. There, in the corner, the membrane covering the
hole seems to be trembling.

                      WEST

          This can't be good.

                      SMITH

          You have a remarkably keen sense
          of the obvious.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen stands with Penny at the main sensor station.

                      MAUREEN

          John, get the hell out of there.

ON SCREEN. The silver disks on the hull of the probe ship are
beginning to move, rising to stand now on spindraled legs.

EXT.-PROBE SHIP

Heads and legs emerging, the disks reveal themselves to be armor
plated spiders. The monsters find viscous holes in the outer hull and
push through, vanishing into the probe ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) a THUD. The Jupiter Two shakes, as if struck.

                      MAUREEN

          Give me an external view.

Penny works the console.

ON SCREEN. Spiders are leaping from the probe onto the Jupiter Two.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE

The lizard monkey's SCREAMING has reached new heights of hysteria. A
shape begins to push through the viscous bole in the ceiling.

What bursts in is a monster out of nightmare. Nearly half the size of
a human, shiny metallic body from which wet, spider-like limbs extend.
A fang covered vAw opens below ravenous, green eyes.

Don draws his laser and FIRES, but the blast only reflects off the
metallic surface of its torso, forcing the creature to retract its
limbs and eyes, hiding within its protective shell.

                      JOHN

          Evacuate. Now!

The team races for the door as several more spiders drop through the
hole in the ceiling, landing in the bridge and scampering fast towards
our fleeing heros.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-TUNNELS

The boarding party race down the corridor. The spiders are bounding
after them, using walls, floor, and ceiling with equal facility.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is madly working his keyboard, controlling the fleeing Robot.

                      WILL

          This joy stick is too slow. Activate
          holographic interface.

A holographic robot appears on the bridge. Will steps inside, the
image now moving with his body. He spins, facing backwards, firing.

INT.-PROBE SHIP

The Robot is holding up the rear, its torso swiveled backwards so it
can retreat and FIRE simultaneously.

The Robot's plasma BLASTS have more effect than-the lasers, blowing
the spiders into tiny pieces of inhuman flesh and metal.

But more monsters are pouring through the holes in the corridor
ceiling, some giving chasing, others swarming injured comrades.

Judy watches as several spiders devour their fallen brethren.

                      JUDY

          They eat their wounded.

Our heroes race to a nexus, corridors leading off in all directions.
Spiders are dropping from the ceiling around them.

                      JOHN

          Which way?

INT. -JUPITER TWO

WILL-POV. A graphic map flashes within the holograph.

                      WILL

          Turn left.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIdOR

                      ROBOT

          Now right.

The spiders are swarming, closing fast.

                      JOHN

          Got to seal the bulkhead.

                      WEST

          The door control is at the other and
          of the corridor.

                      JUDY

          The fire sensor.

Judy pulls her gun, FIRES, hitting a ceiling sensor at the end of the
corridor. Blast doors SLAM, sealing out most of the spiders.

DON-CLOSE. Impressed.

BLAST DOORS-CLOSE. Metal teeth begin tearing through the steel.

Our group has made it to the door to the docking bay. They rush in,
the Robot coming through the open doorway last and holding there.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

Don activates the airlock to the Jupiter, the batch slowly opening.

The Robot stands in the doorway to the docking bay, FIRING at the
spiders as they come down the hall, blowing them away. More pour
through the now rending blast doors. There are just too many, rolling
towards them now like a single, shifting mass of death.

                      SMITH

          Open, damn you.

                      WEST

          It's cycling a vacuum check. There is
          no way to speed up the protocols.

                      SMITH

          Fools. I warned you not to come
          aboard this cursed craft. You've
          killed us. You've killed us all.

Judy throws him, hard, into the wall.

                      JUDY

          Shut up.

                      WEST

          Now that's a bedside manner.

The first spiders reach the Robot, leaping onto its metal bull.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen and Penny are at the Com, powering up the engines. Will is
within the holograph, fighting off the spiders.

                      WILL

          Charge.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

The Robot's shell electrifies, the spiders recoiling.

The airlock has opened enough for our heroes to duck inside.

                      JOHN

          Will, get the Robot in here.

The Robot stands in the open portal, covered by spiders, their fangs
shredding his hull, his electrical charge beginning to SHORT.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is throwing off the monsters, Extending the Robot's antenna
spikes and scanner dishes to skewer spiders that are squeezing by.

                      WILL

          I can't move him without letting the
          spiders into the ship.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

                      JOHN

          Leave him behind.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WILL

          I'm sorry, Robot.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-DOCKING BAY

A spider pushes past the Robot, head slipping around his metallic
body, bent on reaching the airlock and the crew within.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-AIRLOCK

                      JOHN

          Seal it. Now!

Don hits a switch just as a spider breaks free, rushing towards the
dropping airlock door. Smith recoils from the swiping talon.

SMITH'S BACK-CLOSE. A tiny rand and beneath, a razor thin incision.

THE DOOR drops, the spider's arm, still twitching, severed inside the
airlock.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The inner airlock door Opens. The crew tumble in.

                      JOHN

          Get us out of here.

Don is already powering up the ship's engines as Smith tries
separating himself from the tiny lizard monkey.

                      SMITH

          Get this cloying gargoyle off of me.

He throws the beast hard across the bridge. The creature hits the
wall, SCREECHING, begins racing across consoles.

John has strapped in beside Don.

                      JOHN

          Get me an external view.

A MONITOR shows the hull of the Jupiter Two. More spiders are leaping
onto the ship, attaching themselves to the hull.

                      JOHN

          Prepare to disengage.

THE LIZARD MONKEY skitters up the back of Penny's chair, over her
head, getting tangled in her hair before jumping into her lap.

                      PENNY

          Get it off me. Get it off.

Penny in frantically wiping the hair from her face. The tiny creature
on her lap begins a perfect imitation of Penny.

Don releases the docking ring, glances at the Monitor. The hull of the
ship is now entirely covered with spiders.

                      WEST

          Initiating separation.

LIZARD MONKEY'S EYES widen in terror as the ship SHAKES, burying its
head in Penny's chest. A beat. Then Penny hugs the tiny beast.

                      PENNY

          It's okay. Everything's going to be
          alright.

But she sounds anything but sure.

                      WEST

          We're clear. Everybody hang on.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The Jupiter Two's engines BLOW, peeling into the endless night.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) ALARMS sound.

                      JUDY

          I think those things were using the
          probe ship as a way to trap food.

                      WEST

          That I s probably what happened to
          the monkey's parents. We were going
          to be desert.

                      MAUREEN

          But what happened to the crew?

                      JOHN

          Nothing good.

                      WEST

          We're not out of the woods yet.

ON SCREEN. The hull of the Jupiter Two is covered with the giant
spiders, their teeth cutting through the outer hull.

                      WEST

          Let's see how these monsters like a
          hundred thousand volts.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The hull glows with electricity. The spiders fly off into space, their
limbs and heads retracting.

                      WEST

          And the crowd goes wild.

                      SMITH

          Recall your nightmares from
          childhood, Major. Monsters are rarely
          so easily dissuaded.

(OVER) a THUNK. Then another. A third.

ON SCREEN-The spiders shoot webs from their bellies, attaching to the
Jupiter, land on the hull again, re-extending their limbs, starting to
burrow once more.

                      WEST

          Persistent bastards.

                      JOHN

          Can you hit them again?

                      WEST

          Every time I electrify the hull, I'm
          draining our systems. Once or twice
          more and we're going to be dead in
          space.

                      SMITH

          A fate I fear may be inevitable one
          way or another.

Maureen emerges from the airlock holding the spider's severed limb in
metal tongs. Carries it to her life sciences analyzer.

                      JOHN

          That's the same expression you had
          when my mother came to stay with us.

MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A graphic of the severed spider leg. A small
line begins to extrapolate to the rest of the figure. Musculature and
flesh are drawn in on the screen.

                      MAUREEN

          DNA extrapolation - coming up.
          Silicone based. Admantium shell and
          lack of respiratory system suggest an
          ability to live in deep space. Tiny
          front brain implies communal
          relationships. More like bees.

VIEWS CREEN -CLOSE. More and more spider are spiraling from the probe
ship, all heading toward the Jupiter Two.

                      WEST

          There are thousands of those things

Maureen is working the COMPUTER.

                      MAUREEN

          They may be attracted to heat and
          light.

Don begins typing.

                      WEST

          With the right command codes, I can
          light up the probe ship from here.

MONITOR-CLOSE. More spiders are hitting the bull.

                      WEST

          Damn. No response.

                      JOHN

          Command codes are sequenced. Try the next series.

                      WEST

          But they won't work until the next
          fleet of ships are built. That's at
          least two years away.

                      JOHN

          Just do it.

Don begins entering command codes.

The mighty probe ship begins to power up, engines glowing red as they
begin their initial BURN.

                      WEST

          How did you know?

                      JOHN

          Think about it, Don. The ships's
          advanced technology. Your friend
          looking old. What if that ship is
          from our future?

                      COMPUTER

          Warning. Outer hull has been
          compromised.

SCREEN-CLOSE. Spiders are eating through the outer hull.

                      MAUREEN

          It's not working.

                      JOHN

          Can you get the fusion drive on line?

EXT.-SPACE

THE PROBE SHIP'S fusion drives FIRE. A few of the spiders divert back
toward the probe ship. But most still head for the Jupiter.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          Let's turn up the heat.

Don engages the THRUSTERS, grabs the throttle.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two banks toward the probe ship, heading directly for the
wake of the fusion drives.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      COMPUTER (OVER)

          Warning. Inner hull breach in twenty
          seconds.

                      JOHN

          Give them a little encouragement.

                      WEST

          Electrifying outer hull ... now.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The outer bull flashes with electricity, the spiders jumping off. Don
pilots the craft directly through the wake of the fusion drive.

The spiders jump off, begin attaching themselves to the nacelles of
the giant probe ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

ON SCREEN the giant spiral of spiders in now heading back towards the
giant probe ship.

                      JOHN

          Get us out of here. Fast.

Don looks at John a beat, then he begins working the controls.

                      JOHN

          What are you doing?

                      WEST

          Never leave an enemy stronghold
          intact. One of your father's first
          rules of engagement.

Don hits a button. On the remote control console a readout begins to
flash. The message is simple: FUSION DRIVE-OVERLOAD.

                      JOHN

          Don, stop. That's a direct order. We
          might need to salvage-

                      WEST

          This is a military emergency. That
          means I'm in command.

                      JOHN

          Don, no. I'm ordering you-

                      WEST

          I hate spiders.

Don hits a button. The panel light flashes: OVERLOAD.

                      WEST

          Hang on, it I a gonna be a bumpy
          ride.

Don angles the ship away, punching the thrusters as the probe ship's
engines begins to glow.

EXT.-SPACE

The probe ship's nuclear core overloads. The engines begin to glow,
venting plasma and then EXPLODE like a nascent star.

THE BLAST WAVE spreads across space, vaporizing the spiders.

THE BLAST WAVE hits the Jupiter Two.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is buffeted by the shock wave.

                      WEST

          I can't hold her.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is knocked into the atmosphere of the giant planet below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Don is struggling to keep control.

                      WEST

          We're going down.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is hurling toward the planet's cloud obscured surface.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The windscreen is filled with a RUSHING BLIZZARD.

                      WEST

          Can't get the stabilizers on line.

                      JOHN

          Pull up. Pull up.

                      WEST

          Really? No kidding? Thanks.

WINDSCREEN- CLOSE. The storm clouds suddenly PART TO REVEAL ... A
GIANT SNOW COVERED MOUNTAIN RANGE.

Don banks the controls.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship tilts on its side, passing between two snowy peaks, still
plunging towards the planet's wintry surface below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          I'm reading a clearing ahead. I'm
          going to try and make it.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE

The Jupiter Two BLOWS over a carpet of snowy treetops, the canopy of
leaves bursting into flames from the friction of the hull.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The surface is coming up fast.

                      WEST

          Got to slow us down.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE

The Jupiter Two hits the surf ace of the water and skips, once twice,
three times across the alien sea.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          Brace for impact!

The ship SMASHES into a crater miles long, PLOWING through rock and
vegetation, finally coming to rest near one of the crater walls.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Still. Automatic fire systems spray gas everywhere. only the dimmest
emergency lights cast any glow.

                      JOHN

          Everybody, by the numbers.

Maureen straightens, rubs her neck.

                      MAUREEN

          Life Sciences, still breathing.

                      JUDY

          Mission medical, I'm alive.

                      WILL

          Me too. Robotics, I mean.

                      PENNY

          Video Mechanics, okay.

                      SMITH

          I'm alive, Major West's poor excuse
          for piloting skills not withstanding.

                      WEST

          Let's take a look.

Don hits a switch, the windshield de-icing, becoming clear.

                      PENNY

          I don't think we're in Kansas
          anymore.

REVERSE ANGLE

Before them lies the crater, snow covered floor spreading out towards
a distant horizon stained red by two hanging crimson suns.

CHAPTER 15: Follow Orders!
--------------------------


EXT. -ALIEN LANDSCAPE-NIGHT

The moonless sky is filled with an utterly alien starfield. The
Jupiter Two sits near the wall of the crater, its tiny lights fighting
the otherworldly darkness.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          You violated a direct order.

INT.-ENGINE ROOM

Cavernous. John and Don stand by the giant drive engines. Don is
holding a cylinder containing a mixture of power chips, some glowing
with radioactive fire, others dull and charred as coal.

                      WEST

          About half the core material is
          burned out. We'll never generate
          enough power to break orbit.

                      JOHN

          I told you not to blow that ship's
          reactors and you did it anyway.

                      WEST

          Come on, Professor, give it a rest. I
          was technically still in command.

                      JOHN

          Don't hand me that. I'm commander of
          this mission.

                      WEST

          Look, no offense, but you're an
          egghead with an honorary rank. No one
          ever intended you to handle combat
          situations. You're spouting some
          nonsense about- time travel while
          those spiders posed a continuing
          threat. I made a judgement call and
          if I have to I'll make it again.
          Hell, you of all people should
          understand that. If your father were
          here-

                      JOHN

          My father is not here. My father is
          dead, killed in one of his combat
          missions you so admire. My family is
          on this ship And you're going to
          follow my orders. Whether you agree
          with them or not. Is that clear,
          Major?

Don's face is right up in John's.

                      WEST

          Save the speeches. I like you. But
          the fate of the Earth is at stake
          here. I'm going to do whatever I
          think it takes to ensure the success
          of this mission. With or without your
          help. Is that clear, Professor?

The two are too close to do anything but kiss or fight. Kissing seems
less than likely.

                      MAUREEN (OVER)

          Am I interrupting something?

WIDER. Maureen stands in the doorway.

                      MAUREEN

          No. Really. I think you two should go
          ahead and slug it out. I mean, here
          we are stranded on an alien world and
          you boys want to get into a pissing
          contest. So please, go for it. I'll
          have Judy down here in a heartbeat to
          declare you both unfit and I'll take
          over this mission. Now I don't want
          to hear another word from you two
          until you can play nice. Is that
          clear?

                      JOHN WEST

          Maureen- Listen-

                      MAUREEN

          Not another word.

          (a beat)

          Better. Now if you've finished hosing
          down the decks with testosterone, I
          suggest you come with me. I may have
          found a way to get us off this
          planet.

Maureen turns on her heal and EXITS. The two men exchange a look.

                      WEST

          Wow.

                      JOHN

          Tell me about it.

They head after her.

CHAPTER 18: Danger Will! (Out of Sequence in screenplay.)
------------------------

INT:-WILL'S CABIN

Will sits working over his hacker's deck. (OVER) STATIC.

                      WILL

          Can you hear me? Robot?

Will tunes the deck. More STATIC. Then...

                      ROBOT

          Systems error. Robot unable to
          register neural net outputs. Unable
          to locate motor controls. Unable-

                      WILL

          Calm down. Your body was destroyed in
          the conflict with the space spiders.
          Do you remember?

                      ROBOT

          Affirmative.

                      WILL

          But I downloaded your neural net.

                      ROBOT

          Robot tried to destroy the Robinson
          family. Why would Will Robinson save
          Robot's personality? Your actions do
          not compute.

                      WILL

          I guess sometimes friendship means
          acting with your heart, not your
          head.

                      ROBOT

          Logic error. Friendship does not
          compute.

                      WILL

          Don't worry, Robot. Im going to build
          you a new body. I promise.

Will turns to face a pile of pirated components from various par of
the ship. He lifts a circular bubble of diodes. Smiles.

                      WILL

          Mom always said I should try to make
          new friends.

INT.-BRIDGE

Maureen stands at her life sciences station with John and Don.

                      MAUREEN

          The atmosphere here can sustain human
          life. I've located 500 Rads
          radioactive material a mile north.

                      JOHN

          That's at least what we'd need to get
          the core functioning again.

John looks out the viewscreen at the alien night. Turns to Don.

                      JOHN

          We'll set off at daybreak. it'll be
          safer. Those are my orders, Major.

                      WEST

          I agree with your recommendation,
          Professor.

                      MAUREEN

          Dtente is a beautiful thing.

INT.-SICK BAY

Judy examines the lizard monkey. Penny strokes the tiny creature,
producing a string of BLIPS.

                      PENNY

          What's the diagnosis, Doc? Is it
          cowboy or ballerina on Halloween?

                      JUDY

          Right now she's a girl. But I think
          your little pal here is from a
          self-replicating species. At
          different stages of life she, or he,
          probably alternates sexes.

                      PENNY

          Imagine the savings on dating outfits
          alone.

The tiny creature has begun playing with an aural scanner.

                      PENNY

          Can I keep her?

                      JUDY

          Penny, you've never taken care of a
          thing in your life besides yourself.

                      PENNY

          Please. She's all alone. I promise
          I'll look after her. She needs me.

                      JUDY

          ...The moment you misplace her, or
          forget to feed her, we leave her on
          this planet where she can live in the
          wild. I'm not kidding Penny.

And with that Judy EXITS. Penny sits, stroking the tiny creature.

                      PENNY

          We're both a long way from home,
          aren't we little one?

The creature makes a tiny BLIP.

                      PENNY

          That's what we'll call you. Blip.

Blip reaches out, touches a green ribbon around Penny's wrist.

                      PENNY

          You like that?

Penny takes the ribbon off, ties it around Blip's wrist. Blip looks
up, eyes glowing. Penny caresses the tiny creature's cheek.

                      PENNY

          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

The creature reaches up, touches Penny's cheek. Her tiny tongue trying
to imitate Penny's words of comfort.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Judy stands, just out of sight, watching her sister, smiling.

CHAPTER 16: Alien World
-----------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-MED LAB

Don shoves an indignant Smith into the room, adjusts a newly installed
security panel in the wall.

                      SMITH

          Remove that lock this instant. I
          shall not be caged like some animal

                      WEST

          (lethal)

          I gave my word I'd let you live. I
          never said for how long.

                      SMITH

          These quarters will be fine.

Smith stares at him a beat.

                      SMITH

          Tell me, Major West. Are you really
          confident in Robinson's ability to
          guide us? If I were set free, I would
          support your right to command. With
          minimal force, we could take this
          ship and assure this mission
          continues under your leadership.

                      WEST

          ...My God Smith, you're right. How
          could I have been so blind? I'll just
          run and get you a gun so we can
          hijack the ship. Okay?

                      SMITH

          Sarcasm is the recourse of a weak
          mind.

                      WEST

          I'm hiding the pain. Really.

And with that West leaves.

Smith tries the door. Locked. Then, from one cuff of his field suit,
be removes the control belt he stole from the probe ship.

                      SMITH

          I assure you, Major West. Your pain
          has just begun.

Smith moves about the room, lifting small bits of metal, creating an
impromptu set of tools with which to alter the control bolt.

PAN DOWN. HOLD on SMITH'S BACK. Beneath the rend in his suit, the tiny
tear in his flesh is now covered with tiny, alien scales.

INT. -BRIDGE-NIGHT

Judy sits in one of the command chairs over a the remains of a meal,
sipping water, staring out into the alien night.

                      WEST (OVER)

          Star light, star bright...

                      JUDY

          A million strange stars and only one
          wish. I wish we were home.

Don comes and sits in the co-pilot's chair beside her.

                      JUDY

          I never thought a sky could look so
          alien. ...We really are lost.

                      WEST

          When the first sailors circled the
          globe and saw a brand new sky, they
          thought they had sailed off the edge
          of the earth. But they were really
          just around the corner.

                      JUDY

          (smiles)

          We just billow our sails and let the
          wind blow us home, Is that it Major?

                      WEST

          So those sailors found familiar
          shapes in the stars to make the skies
          more friendly, to help them find
          their way.

Don turns on a monitor below the viewscreen. MONITOR-CLOSE. It shows
the star-field above. He lifts a light-tipped stylus.

                      WEST

          That's how constellations were born.

Don begins to draw on the screen, connecting the stars like dots in a
children's book. Slowly, a familiar porcine face takes form.

                      WEST

          Porky the wise and mighty Pig.

Judy LAUGHS. She takes the stylus. Begins to draw.

                      JUDY

          The great bucktoothed Bunny... Bugs.

Don smiles. Judy can't help but smile back. Their faces are close.

                      WEST

          So, my quarters or yours?

                      JUDY

          Excuse me?

                      WEST

          We are the only single man and woman
          of consenting age in the galaxy. How
          much more of a set up do you need?

                      JUDY

          So you figure just dispense with the
          pleasantries, get down to business?

                      WEST

          You have a way with words, Doctor.

                      JUDY

          (provocative)

          Right here? On this console?

Don moves his face to hers, only a breath apart.

                      WEST

          Here would be fine.

Judy smiles sweetly.

DON-CLOSE. Lips parting. Suddenly water begins to pour down over his
head. His eyes open wide. Judy holds her empty glass in hand.

                      JUDY

          Next time, fly slower.

She rises, walks off, leaving Don mopping his brow.

INT.-JOHN & MAUREEN'S QUARTERS

Maureen sits on the edge of her bed brushing her hair as John
activates the automated security systems.

                      JOHN

          What was I thinking, bringing us all
          out here into space?

                      MAUREEN

          The world needed saving. You were the
          right man for the job.

                      JOHN

          But solving the world's problems
          doesn't leave much time for the
          people you love, does it?

                      MAUREEN

          Did you get any time with Will?

                      JOHN

          Now he's decided he can rebuild the
          robot. Wants to show me his designs.
          I've got too much to do-

                      MAUREEN

          Funny creatures, men. You try so hard
          not to be your fathers, end up making
          the same mistakes. Will adores you.
          He needs your attention.

                      JOHN

          We can't get off this planet much
          less back on course. I don't have
          time to...

                      MAUREEN

          John, just listen to him. it doesn't
          matter what he's saying. Just listen.
          Sometimes, at least in the eyes of
          their fathers, little boys have to
          come first.

                      JOHN

          As soon as we get back into space,
          we're going to spend some real time
          together. I promise.

Maureen looks out the window. A long beat. Then she smiles.

                      JOHN

          What?

                      MAUREEN

          It's nice to have our family under
          one roof. Even if we had to go half
          way across the galaxy to manage it.

John presses a button, the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked
orbs of three glowing moons. Maureen smiles.

                      JOHN

          How would you feel about a little
          late night tutorial, Professor?

John moves to her, begins pulling her down, out of FRAME.

                      MAUREEN

          Mm. That's new. What are you doing?

                      JOHN

          Going for extra credit.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-NIGHT

The ship sits on the alien landscape.

                      MAUREEN (OVER)

          Good night John.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          Good night Maureen.

                      WILL (OVER)

          Good night Judy.

          Good night Will.

          Good night Penny.

                      WEST (OVER)

          You guys have got to be kidding.

CHAPTER 17: The Core
--------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-MORNING

Will comes up on the elevator, rubbing his eyes, first awake in the
morning. He stumbles to the viewscreen.

WILL-CLOSE. His eyes widen with shock.

                      WILL

          Oh man.

REVERSE ANGLE

A giant portal shimmers at snow's edge about 100 yards from the ship.
Beyond it, a sun-stained field of towering plants and trees.

INT.-BRIEFING ROOM

The crew gathers at the table. (OVER) a RUMBLING. The ship shakes.

                      PENNY

          What are those rumblings? They've
          been happening all morning.

                      JUDY

          How can half the landscape have grown
          up overnight?

                      JOHN

          Okay, let's get settled. Maureen?

MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A geothermal analysis shows the giant plates
that make up this world appear mismatched.

                      MAUREEN

          It's impossible. But this planet's
          geothermic plates don't match up.

                      JOHN

          I was afraid of this.

Al1 eyes turn to John.

                      JOHN

          I think these tremors are the result
          of opening and closing doorways.

                      PENNY

          Doorways to where?

                      JOHN

          The future.

                      SMITH

          Perhaps the Professor was hit on the
          head when we landed.

                      JOHN

          Remember the portal that lead us to
          the probe ship? What if we crossed a
          into a time years after Earth sent a
          rescue mission.

                      WEST

          You're not serious? Time travel is
          impossible.

                      WILL

          No it's not. It's just improbable.
          Like hyperdrive was a hundred years
          ago. Nothing's really impossible.

                      JOHN

          This world could be riddled with
          doorways to the future.

                      WILL

          So if we walk into that forest
          outside, we're really just walking
          into this crater years from now.

                      MAUREEN

          Geological plates from different
          times wouldn't fit together. That
          would explain the tectonic mismatch.
          But doorways in time, John?

                      JOHN

          If these portals are opening and
          closing, part of some cascading,
          natural phenomenon, they could be
          tearing this planet apart

                      WILL

          These portals are exactly what I
          predicted my time machine would do.
          What if the doorways aren't natural?
          A machine that bends space, like our
          hyperdrive, could be modified to bend
          time as well. What if someone on this
          world has built a device?

                      JOHN

          Son, I appreciate your input but now
          isn't the time for flights of fancy.

                      WILL

          You never listen to me. Not ever.

And with that Will storms out. John stares after him a beat, sorely
wanting to follow. (OVER) another RUMBLE.

                      JOHN

          There's no telling how long before
          this planet breaks up entirely.

          (rising).

          Don and I are going to locate the
          radioactive material for the core.
          Get the ship ready to go. We may have
          very little time.

INT. -BRIDGE

John, suited up, heads for the open front hatch when he spots Will
sitting alone in the Com chair, tinkering with his deck.

                      JOHN

          Aren't you coming out to say goodbye?

Will just shakes his head.

                      WILL

          You're always leaving. What if...

Will looks away, finally giving voice to his worst fear.

                      WILL

          What if one time you don't come
          home...

John stares at his son, unsure what to say, the boy's anguish so deep
and apparent. He reaches into his shirt, takes off his dog tags.

                      JOHN

          Whenever your grandfather went away
          on a mission, held leave these with
          me. For safe keeping. And when he got
          home I d always be waiting to give
          them back.

He lifts the chain and places it around the boy's neck.

                      JOHN

          I'm coming back Will. I promise.

Will is silent. John touches the boy's hair, then walks out. A beat.
Will looks up after his father, fingering the dog tags.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The Robinsons, all except Will, stand-gathered around the front of the
ship. Don has a small tracking device in his hand.

                      WEST

          I've got a fix on the radioactive
          material. It's through the portal.

                      JOHN

          We'll just have to hope the doorways
          remain stable.

                      JUDY

          These crater walls are disabling the
          com-links. You won't be able to
          communicate with the ship.

(OVER) the ground shakes again.

                      Maureen

          Come home to me, Professor.

                      JOHN

          I love you, wife.

John kisses her. Don looks at Judy.

                      JUDY

          I'm going to regret saying this, But
          try to get back in one piece.

                      WEST

          This is kind of a kiss for luck
          occasion, wouldn't you agree, Doc?

                      JUDY

          See. I'm regretting it already.

          (coy)

          Kisses have to be earned. Say
          goodbye, Blip.

Blip reaches up and touches John's face. Then her CHIRPS form a rough
approximation of the words Penny taught her.

                      BLIP

          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

                      JOHN

          You take care of her, Penny.

          (kisses her head)

          Take care of you too, baby.

Then the two men bead off, towards the portal and forest beyond.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Smith stares out the cabin window. PUSH IN as

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

                      SMITH

          Yes, enjoy your moments of trite
          familial bonding.

He turns, heads back to his table, transformed now, into a makeshift
lab, the stolen control bolt in mid-modification.

                      SMITH

          Because they will be your last.

INT.-WILL'S CABIN

The beginnings of Will's home-made robot sits on the table. WILL is in
the f.g. riffling his PERSONAL CARGO container.

Penny ENTERS, an assortment of small electronic devices, hairclips,
and other metal and electronic objects. Dumps them on the table.

                      PENNY

          That's everything even close to
          nonessential. Even my bellybutton
          ring.

                      WILL

          Thanks, Pen.

                      PENNY

          You want to come on a land survey?

But Will just shakes his head, sulky.

                      PENNY

          Look, what does dad know? Maybe
          someone did build a time machine.

She ruffles his hair. Disappears. Will activates a CPU speaker.

                      ROBOT

          Robot is on line.

(OVER) a KNOCKING has begun. WILL looks up, puzzled.

                      WILL

          It sounds like old morse code.


Chapter 18: Danger Will!
------------------------


INT.-CORRIDOR

Will walks down the corridor. (OVER) The KNOCKING continues. Will
follows the SOUND until he comes to the door of Smith's prison.

Smith is visible through the door window, sitting at a table,
hammering out the code with his boot. He beckons Will inside.

Will shakes his head. Smith begins TAPPING again.

                      WILL

          (sounding out the code)

          Danger.

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

The door slides open and Will ENTERS, a laser pistol in hand.

                      WILL

          You said someone is in danger.

                      SMITH

          We all are. You are wise to arm
          yourself.

Smith eyes the weapon, moving towards the boy.

                      WILL

          This gun is set to fire for me only
          so don't try anything funny.

Smith barely misses a beat as he adjusts, passing the child, going
instead to the window and opening the blast shield.

                      SMITH

          William, you misjudge me. I only want
          to help you.

                      WILL

          Help us? You tried to kill us all.

                      SMITH

          But now our fates are intertwined. if
          your father and that idiot West fail,
          I will have no chance of getting
          home. It is in my best interests they
          succeed. And I always follow my best
          interests.

Smith gazes out at the exotic terrain. (OVER) an inhuman WAIL.

                      SMITH

          What monsters roam these alien wilds?
          Fools. To set off blindly across this
          savage land. Much as I hate to admit
          it, it will be harder to manage
          without them.

                      WILL

          What are you talking about? They'll
          be back. They'll be okay.

Smith is silent. A long, lethal beat.

                      WILL

          Someone should go after them.

                      SMITH

          Will, I forbid it. You're a boy. A
          clever one, certainly, but a child
          nonetheless. This planet is likely
          full of predators. Even if you found
          them, what if they're hurt, ravaged,
          dying, what good could you do?

                      WILL

          But you're a doctor.

Smith turns away, hiding his smile.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY

Judy and Maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater
wall, shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds.

                      JUDY

          It's impossible.

                      MAUREEN

          Not really. Geologists have
          speculated that Dimondium might be
          naturally occurring in many older
          worlds. Part of a biosphere's way of
          rejuvenating itself.

                      JUDY

          This one is ten times more powerful
          then that on Alpha Prime. There's
          enough here to save Earth.

Penny stands in the f.g. with Blip on her arm, taking plant samples,
talking into her video recorder.

                      PENNY

          After much deliberation, the Space
          Captive has decided to accept her new
          role as member of the crew. The
          Robinsons, after all, can  obviously
          use her help...

Blip jumps up on Penny's arm, knocking her recorder to the ground.

                      PENNY

          (flaring)

          Now look what you've done. Stop
          hanging all over me.

Blip stares at her, frightened by her tone, begins backing away to the
edge of the forest. She looks at Penny, then disappears into the thick
brush..

                      PENNY

          Blip. Wait. I'm sorry. Damn.

Penny heads after the creature. HOLD on her recorder. Forgotten.


CHAPTER 19: A Different Future
------------------------------


EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY

Will and Smith are walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation
tracker in his hand.

                      WILL

          I've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon.

Dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves
moving in the wind like an azure sea.

                      WILL

          Wow, that's Mom's favorite color.

                      SMITH

          How droll.

(OVER) a tremendous RUMBLING. The WIND ROARS. Suddenly, the air in the
distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them,
flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within.

                      SMITH

          Run, child, run.

Smith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the
rushing warp. Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the
distortion to overtake him. A beat. He opens his eyes.

SMITH-POV. A glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing
beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown.

                      SMITH

          Will? Will?

No sign of the boy. Then, from behind a tree, Will appears.

                      WILL

          Wow!

The field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants, the
flowers a deep red. Will rushes across the rip in space.

                      SMITH

          William, wait!

                      WILL

          See, over here I'm in the future.

(steps back towards Smith)

          Here I'm in the past. Don't worry.
          If my theories are correct, these
          doorways should remain stable, for
          a while anyway.

                      SMITH

          I can barely contain my glee. Why
          aren't you aging like the plants?

                      WILL

          That's just an effect of the portals
          forming. Once they stabilize you can
          cross from one time to another
          just like stepping between two
          rooms.

          (off his tracker)

          Dad's signal is this way. Come on,
          Doctor Smith.

Will takes Smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold.

SMITH-POV. Where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing
crimson. Yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared.
Younger. The sky, bright. Will has run deeper into the brush.

Smith notices something by his feet. He clears away the brush,
revealing shapes beneath the foliage. His expression darkens.

                      WILL (OVER)

          What did you find?

Will has returned.

                      SMITH

          Come, come, son, no time for
          distractions. Let's move on.

Smith shoves Will on, the boy unable to see what Smith saw.

PAN DOWN. Headstones. Each bears a marking, the names still legible.
Maureen, Penny and Judy Robinson.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY-PRES

John and Don emerge from the brush. They have come to one of the
crater walls. John looks from the rock face to his tracker.

                      JOHN

          Damn.

                      WEST

          Damn? Damn is not good.

                      JOHN

          The radiation signature we've been
          tracking. it's a  ghost. A
          reflection from the Jupiter Two
          bouncing off the ore in these walls.
          There's no core material here.

(OVER) a sudden RUMBLING. The ground shakes. The ROAR of WIND. A time
portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw, the side of the
crater aging and crumbling in it's wake.

John and Don race away from the distortion, ducking falling trees,
roll clear as the portal stabilizes, now a fixed doorway to a darker,
more deserted future.

                      JOHN

          The ship's back that way. we have to
          go through.

EXT.-BRUSH-DAY-PRESENT

Penny is pushing through the forest.

                      PENNY

          Blip? I'm sorry. Blip?

She spots the tiny creature ahead in the distance. Blip SNIFFS the
ground, runs a few steps. SNIFFS again. Looks up. There, before Blip
is another glittering hole in time. The forest beyond is far thicker,
the sky red. Blip steps through the portal.

                      PENNY

          Blip, wait.

Penny goes to the edge of the portal, stares at the monstrously tall
trees beyond. A beat. Then she steps through, following.

EXT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE

Penny pushes through dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs
and caverns cut into the crater wall.

BLIP is standing over a large circular stone, hopping up and down,
CHIRPING and BLIPPING madly.

                      PENNY

          Blip, you can't run off like that.

(closing on the stone)

          What the-?

THE STONE-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphs are painted on the giant
rock, their images the same style as those on the probe ship.

HIEROGLYPH ONE-CLOSE. A mighty battle in space is depicted.

                      PENNY (OVER)

          Some kind of fight, in space. It
          almost looks like the probe ship
          Major West blew up.

HIEROGLYPH TWO-CLOSE. A fiery star falls to the planet's surface.

                      PENNY

          That could be the Jupiter Two crash
          landing.

HIEROGLYPH THREE-CLOSE. Here a dark haired beauty holds a single
lizard monkey aloft, her face remarkably like Penny's.

Suddenly BLIP begins to SHRIEK. (OVER) RUSTLING leaves.

SHAPES are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms
dropping to the ground. Five figures suddenly de-camouflage. Lizard
monkeys, two large, two smaller.

Directly in front of Penny, the largest monkey de-camouflages. Fully
grown, the beast is nearly twice Penny's height. Around the creature's
wrist is something odd. An old, tattered green ribbon.

BLIP begins to SCREAM and SHRIEK.

                      PENNY

          Blip, no!

Too late. Blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon. The
beast could slap Blip away like a fly. But the creature doesn't
resist, just stares down at Blip with something akin to tenderness.

Blip looks at the ribbon in his hand. Then at the one around her
wrist. Save for their age difference., the ribbons are identical.

The giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified Penny, paw
reaching out, touching her face. The beast begins stroking Penny's
cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort.

                      GIANT BLIP

          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

Penny stares up in stunned wonder.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Don and John are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more
desolate, desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon.


                      JOHN

          We should be able to see the ship.

Something catches the light on the ground beside them. Don reaches
down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand.

METAL-CLOSE. On it is the familiar logo of the United Space Agency.

                      WEST

          Could these be from the probe?

                      JOHN

          Corroded. This metal is decades old.

Don finds another piece of wreckage, turns it over in his hand.

                      WEST

          It's not possible.

WRECKAGE-CLOSE. The fragment bears a simple legend: Jupiter Two.

                      WEST

          What kind of nightmare is this?
          Where the hell are we?

                      JOHN

          No, Major, when the hell are we?

Suddenly Don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying.
John ducks and rolls, FIRING his laser from behind the cover of a
rocky mound. John goes up to take another SHOT, is bit with a powerful
electrical blast, falling hard. Still.

REVERSE ANGLE

Rolling out from behind him, claws extended in attack Position and
apparently many years old, is a rebuilt Robot.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Will and Smith are crossing the alien terrain. The plants have given
way to desert. The suns hang low in the crimson sky.

                      WILL

          I feel like we got turned around.

                      SMITH

          Just follow your father's signal,
          young William.

                      WILL

          Oh shit.

                      SMITH

          A boy of your intelligence shouldn't
          swear.

                      WILL

          (pointing)

          Look.

                      SMITH

          Oh. Shit, indeed.

REVERSE ANGLE. At the edge of the crater wall sits the wrecked hull of
the Jupiter Two. The lower sections are gone, the hull scarred, open
to the sun.


                                                               CUT TO:

JOHN-CLOSE. Stirring to consciousness.

WIDER

INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE

Or what is left of it. Dark. The occasional COMPUTER panel flickers
Shattered monitors. An awful history-told in torn metal. John is
slumped in a corner, Don still on the floor beside him.

                      VOICE (OVER)

          Well, well. All things really do
          come to he who waits.

A FIGURE sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow.

                      JOHN

          What is this place?

                      FIGURE

          Why Professor, the shock must have
          scrambled your brain. Look around
          you. Don't you recognize the spot?
          You've come home.

                      JOHN

          This can't be...

But even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is.

                      JOHN

          What have you done to the ship.
          ...Where's my family?

                      FIGURE

          Your family is dead. Dead and in the
          ground.

                      JOHN

          No!

                      FIGURE

          What fickle consort in memory. Time
          dims certain images while others
          shine clear and bright as yesterday.

The figure stands, light hitting his face. Late thirties. Long blond
hair, a shaggy beard and moustache. Eerily familiar.

                      FIGURE

          I'll never forget that morning.
          Twenty years ago. What was it you
          said? I'll be back. I promise. But I
          knew better. You never came home.

The figure walks to one of the burned out panels.

                      FIGURE

          Without you, your family never had a
          chance. A few spidersv survived the
          destruction of the probe ship. They
          reached the planet and attacked. I
          can still hear the women scream.

                      JOHN

          Who are you?

The figure walks forward, into the light. Stands there a moment. Then
he lifts something hanging around his neck. Tarnished metal, old but
familiar. John's father's dog tags.

                      FIGURE

          Don't you recognize me, Dad? It's
          me. I'm your son. Will.

EXT.-CRATER CAVES-DAY

Maureen and Judy, lasers drawn, are pushing through the brush.

                      JUDY

          Penny? Penny?

The four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around Penny.

                      MAUREEN

          Penny? Baby, are you alright?

Penny rises, steps forward, carrying Blip. The other beasts hang back,
their faces genuflecting, almost reverential.

                      PENNY

          It's okay, Mom. They're not going to
          hurt us. it's like  they think I'm
          their princess or something.


                                                               CUT TO:

EXT.-CRATER CAVES -EVENING-FLITURE

Judy is examining the palm of the largest beast as Maureen scrutinizes
the images graven into the giant stone.

                      JUDY

          Best as I can tell this whole clan
          was spawned by this single creature.

          (to the beast)

          We've been a busy girl haven't we?
          But...

                      MAUREEN

          Speak, doctor.

                      JUDY

          Each creature seems to have unique
          corpuscular patterns on their palms.
          As individual an fingerprints, no
          two alike. Except...

                      MAUREEN

          Except the prints on this giant
          creature and our little Blip
          match exactly. Don't they?

                      JUDY

          How did you know?

                      MAUREEN

          Because, I think Blip and our friend
          here are actually one and the same.

Penny and Judy stare at her in wonder.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

The Robot, shoving John with one claw, carrying Don in the other,
follows Older Will into the giant room.

                      OLDER WILL

          Father, I give you ... eternity.

                      WIDER

War torn and pirated. A pit of molten lava bursts through the floor
above which floats a giant ball of silvery liquid held suspended by
the pulsing field of the hyper-drive. Tendrils of fire strain towards
the bubble. As they EXPLODE into the silver liquid, images form within
the sphere, nearly coherent, then gone.

A tracked gantry stretches from the floor, leading out over the
bubble. At the end of the track a crow's-nest of COMPUTERS SHOOTS a
single laser down into the center of the bubble.

                      WEST

          (coming to)

          . . .ouch. Who ordered me that last
          drink? What the hell is going on?

                      JOHN

          I think we crossed into our own
          future. We've come back to the
          Jupiter Two decades after we left.

                      OLDER WILL

          Look father, what my flights of
          fancy have wrought. I used your
          hypergate to build my time machine.

Will moves to a control console at the base of the giant gantry.

                      OLDER WILL

          Over the years I have struggled in
          vain to harness the awesome power of
          time. All my experiments at creating
          a stable doorway have been futile.
          Until now. Today you will witness my
          ultimate triumph.

Will hits a button. A generator opens, revealing a glowing cylinder of
core material incrementally descending into the console.

                      WEST

          The core material. if we could get
          that back to our Jupiter Two...

                      JOHN

          The doorways in time that led us
          here must be a side effect of his
          machine coming on line. Like streams
          running into the ocean....

                      OLDER WILL

          Once this core material in fully
          introduced into the control console,
          I will open a doorway stable enough
          for one person to take one trip
          through time and space as well.
          Today, I will change history.

Will turns a switch on the control console. (OVER) More TREMORS. The
laser beam's intensity grown, and in the corridor cut by the beam into
the bubble images begins to stabilize. Images of Earth.

                      OLDER WILL

          I will return home, to the very day
          you took us on this cursed mission.
          I'll stop us from taking off. I'll
          do what you never could. I'll save
          the family. I'll save us all.

                      JOHN

          Look around. Your machine is ripping           this planet
apart. What if the force
          wave you ride home has the same
          effect on Earth? What if, in getting
          home, you destroy Earth in the
          process?

A beat. Then Will turns away, goes back to work.

                      OLDER WILL

          I'm going home. I'm going to save
          the family.

                      JOHN

          Will, I'm your father. You've got to
          listen to me-.

                      OLDER WILL

          Let me tell you about my father. My
          father was a walking ghost. Never
          there when I needed him. He dragged
          his family into deep dark space and
          lost them there. My father is not
          coming to the rescue.

CHAPTER 20: Spiders Sting
-------------------------


EXT.-ALIEN PLAnet-EVENING-FUTURE

Will and Smith are closing on the battered ship. Smith puts his hand
on the boy's arm, holding him back.

                      WILL

          We've got to go inside.

                      SMITH

          Slow down, now. We can't know what
          waits inside that ravaged craft. But
          we can be confidant it is nothing
          good. And I for one am frightened.

                      WILL

          But Dad's in there.

                      SMITH

          Will, listen to me. I have crossed
          this world with you, found your
          father as promised. But I can't let
          you go in there unarmed.

                      WILL

          But I've got a gun.

                      SMITH

          If we go forward, the barer of that
          weapon must be ready to kill. Murder
          is a skill, one which I have
          developed and, luckily dear boy, you
          have not. Look inside your heart,
          Will. Are you truly capable of
          taking a life? If not, then I ask
          you now, put your faith in me. Give
          me your trust. Give me that gun.

Will stares him. Pulls free the pistol. Thumbs the lock pad.

                      WILL

          Enable gun for all users.


                      GUN

          Voiceprint confirmed.

Will hands Smith the gun.

                      SMITH

          Finally.

Smith grabs Will by the neck, pressing the barrel to his temple.

                      SMITH

          A brief lesson in survival on this
          world or any other. Never trust
          anyone. Remember it into your old
          age, should you have one.

          (shoving him forward)

          Now move!

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

John stands facing older Will. Don is in the b.g., edging towards the
control panel and the descending core material.

                      JOHN

          We can go back across the portals to
          the past, to the functioning Jupiter
          Two, where your mother and sisters
          are still alive. We can use this
          core material to escape together.

                      OLDER WILL

          And then what? All of us lost in
          space. Don't you see? I can do what
          you never could. I can save us all.

Don has edged his way to the descending core material.

                      SMITH (OVER)

          I'm afraid not.

          Through the doorway comes young
          Will, Smith walking behind him, hand
          on his shoulder, gun to his head.

                      SMITH

          Never fear. Smith is here.

                      JOHN

          Will, I. . .

                      SMITH

          Don't move, Professor Robinson or
          this rather peculiar family reunion
          will be tragically brief.

          (off Don)

          I'll ask you to step away from that
          console, Major.

Don stares at him a beat. Then obliges, walking over to join John.
Smith approaches the Robot.

                      SMITH

          Well, well, some of us just don't
          know when to stay dead.

Smith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt.

                      SMITH

          I borrowed this from the probe ship
          in hopes of taking over the helm
          once we were in flight. But I seem
          to have found a better use instead.

Smith slaps the bolt on the Robot's CPU. The automaton's arms go up,
then fall limp. Docile.

                      SMITH

          Let's try this dance again. You are
          the puppet. I am the puppeteer. Do
          get it right this time.

Smith activates the bolt. The Robot powers up once again.

                      SMITH

          Robot, enable electric disrupters.

The Robot's claws begin to glow with electricity. Smith smiles.

                      SMITH

          Now that's a good gargantuan.

Smith walks to Older Will, puts the gun to his head.

                      SMITH

          Say goodbye to your past. You're
          future lies with me. I'm going home
          in your place.

Smith starts to pull Older Will away when Will comes forward, staring
at the time machine, eyes wide with awe.

                      WILL

          You did it. Just like I imagined.
          Re-routed the hypercore. But the
          natural power source, the delivery
          system. I never thought of those.

Older Will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger
self. Touches his hair.

                      OLDER WILL

          You will. The future is never what
          it looks like when you're ten.

                      SMITH

          Heartwarming. Nauseatingly
          sentimental but heartwarming.

Smith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to Older Will.

                      SMITH

          We certainly could have aged better,
          I must say Now, show me how your
          little time machine works.

But Will just smiles.

                      SMITH

          An odd moment for mirth, don't you
          think? What are you grinning at?

                      OLDER WILL

          Look around you, Doctor. At this
          hostile world. Do you really think a
          boy could have survived all alone?

SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled. Unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be
moving, shifting. A VOICE comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar.

                      VOICE (OVER)

          Never fear, Smith is here.

The shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and
legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half Smith.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Hello, Doctor, how nice to see me
          again after all these years.

Smith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled
legs, goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          The spider's sting had some
          unexpected side effects.

Spider Smith flexes his three jointed arm.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          But my unique gifts gave me an
          advantage in this quarrelsome world.

Spider Smith reaches out and caresses Will's cheek. Turns  to John.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          After the women were savaged, I
          became the father Will never had.

He grabs Smith's arms and begins to move him about like a marionette,
engaging in a bizarre dance with himself.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          (bending him)

          But you, Doctor. Your crude ambition
          fills me with self-loathing.

          (twisting him)

          You see I have looked within me and
          what I see is you.

With that Spider Smith lifts Smith over his head and hurls him like
torpedo through a torn hole in the hull, towards the rocks beyond.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          I never liked me, anyway.

Spider Smith turns to face the Robot.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Kill them all.

                      OLDER WILL

          No.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          But my dear boy, once the doorway in
          time stabilizes, this planet is
          going to come apart at the seams.

Smith throws the back of one hand over his forehead in a parody of a
twenties starlet.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          I am willing to perish here on this
          world for the sake of your most
          noble mission. But your selfish
          father will only try to stop you.

His head comes forward, neck elongating so he faces WILL.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Once your mission is complete, none
          of this will have happened anyway.
          So why not just dispose of them?

But Will's gaze is impassive. Spider Smith actually SIGHS.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Very well. Robot, take them inside
          the ship and keep them there. If
          they move, then kill them.

ECT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE

Maureen and Judy are examining the heiroglyph stone. The ground
shakes. Birds SCREAM. (OVER) RUMBLING.

                      MAUREEN

          We've got to get to the ship. Penny?

She turns. The clearing is empty. No Blips. No Penny. Blip runs cut
before them, grabs Maureen's hand, trying to pull her forward.

                      MAUREEN

          Where is she, girl?

In Blip's hand, a mass of colored ribbons from Penny's wrists. Blip
waves them in the air, then races off. A beat. The women follow.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

The pulse laser is increasing its intensity, the corridor of images in
the bubble stabilizing. The TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

PAN DOWN

Spider Smith stands with Will, watching as the Robot shepherds the
crew towards the body of the ship.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Well, it would seem the time is upon
          us. Off we go, William.

Spider Smith starts climbing the gantry, truly like a spider, up
towards the bridge and crows nest hanging over the bubble.

Will walks to the control console platform, the platform now beginning
to rise on the gantry, towards the bridge above.

JOHN-POV. Something hangs from below the climbing Spider Smith's back.
It's an egg pouch of the kind they saw on the probe ship log.

                      JOHN

          (shouting)

          Will, it's a trick. Smith's carrying
          an egg sack. If he's willing to stay
          on this world and die, why is he
          about to spawn? He's going through
          the portal himself.

The Robot FIRES a charge between its claws.

                      ROBOT

          Proceed to the ship or be destroyed.

ON THE RISING CONTROL PLATFORM.

OLDER WILL-CLOSE. Frowns.

Suddenly, Smith's head drops INTO FRAME. The creature is hanging
upside-down. He smiles.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Hurry, boy. Time waits for no man.

EXT.-GANTRY SYSTEM-WIDE SHOT

The platform bearing Will reaches the top of the gantry and begins
moving out across the bridge towards the crows-nest.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FUTURE

Spider Smith drops into place beside Older Will as the control
platform comes to a stop on the crow's-nest.

The core cylinder continues sinking into the console. Smith looks out
over the platform. Beneath them, imagine of infinity flicker.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          It's almost time. I really am a
          word-smith.

                      OLDER WILL

          Once the core cylinder is fully
          injected, the planet will begin to
          come apart and the time doorway will
          stabilize. Then I jump in.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          A leap of faith. How fitting.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. In the circle made by the laser, the images are not
yet stable, but discernable. Earth the day before the launch.

                      OLDER WILL

          Tell me again, old monster, how did
          the girls die?

                      SPIDER SMITH

          We've been over this before, son.
          The spiders attacked the ship

                      OLDER WILL

          In all the years since, the spiders
          have never re-surfaced. Why?

Smith stares at him. Then he smiles. A horrible sight.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Let's forget the past.

Will turns a switch. The laser generated aperture narrows.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          What are you doing?

                      OLDER WILL

          Focusing the aperture. Remember, the
          energy around the portal will rip a
          man to pieces.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Isn't the doorway too small?

                      OLDER WILL

          Not for me.

          (a beat)

          But then I'm not going, am I? The
          spiders didn't kill the girls. It
          was you. I just never let myself see
          it. You kept me alive because you
          needed me. Because I could build
          this for you. You killed my family.
          Destroyed this world. And I helped.
          You became mad as the spiders.
          ...And I became you.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Poor, poor boy. Did you really think
          I would let you go home? Let all
          that I have become vanish? Look at
          me. I am no mere man. I am a God.

Spider Smith opens his pouch, revealing a thousand tiny spiders.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Your father was right. Within me
          roil the growing needs of a master
          race. We WILL descend upon helpless
          Earth. An entire planet to rule.

His arm whips out, grabbing Will, bringing him close, opens his mouth,
bearing venomous fangs.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          An entire planet on which to feed.

INT.-MODIFIED JUPITER TWO-FUTURE

John and Don talk in the holding area. The Robot stands guard. (OVER)
the TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

                      WEST

          I'll run, draw his fire. You may
          have time to get away with Will.

                      ROBOT (OVER)

          Halt or Robot will destroy.

The men look up. In the b.g., Will has approached the Robot.

                      WILL

          Do you remember what I taught you. A
          long time ago. About friendship?

                      ROBOT

          Friendship means acting with your
          heart not your head.

                      WILL

          That's why I rebuilt you. Because I
          wanted us to be friends.

                      ROBOT

          Logic error. Friendship does not
          compute.

                      WILL

          Forget logic. Act with your heart.

                      ROBOT

          Robot has no heart. Robot is powered
          by a fusion pulse generator

                      WILL

          Every living thing has a heart.

The Robot stares at him a beat.

                      ROBOT

          Any attempts to override command
          protocols may result in fused
          processors in my neural net.

The floor trembles again. The planet is coming apart at the seams.

                      WILL

          Please, Robot, if you don't let us
          go, we're all going to die. I'm
          asking you now, will you help us?
          Will you be my friend?

The Robot stands still a beat. Then he reaches towards Smith's control
bolt attached firmly on his CPU.

                      ROBOT

          Robot attempting to deactivate
          control bolt-commands

          reroute-dangercircuitry
          overloadattempting to escape-kill
          them, kill them...

The Robot's claws lift into attack position, an electrical charge
building with dangerous intensity. He is about to fire.

At the last minute, the Robot jerks his hand upward, BLOWING away a
piece of the ceiling. He rips off the control bolt.

                      WILL

          You did it.

                      ROBOT

          Robot will save ... I will save Will
          Robinson. I will save my friend.


CHAPTER 21: Time to Die!
------------------------


EXT.-FOREST-DAY-PRESENT

Penny and Maureen chase a frantic Blip through the portal back into
the daylight of the present. Here, too, the world RUMBLES.

                      MAUREEN

          (shouting )

          Penny? Penny?

Penny stands in front of the Jupiter Two, beckoning them urgently.

                      MAUREEN

          Where did you go?

                      PENNY

          I came through the forest. I had a
          promise I had to keep.

Before Maureen can respond the ground RUMBLES, begins crumbling.

                      JUDY

          Inside. Fast.

INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE

Don, John, Will and the Robot stand at the open hatch. Outside, the
ground RUMBLES.

                      JOHN

          You've got find your way back to the
          ship. The portals may still be
          stable. I'll try to meet you there.

                      WEST

          What do you mean?

                      JOHN

          I'm going to get that core material.
          It's our only chance to escape.

                      WEST

          I'll stay. The family needs their
          father

                      JOHN

          The crew needs their pilot. No
          matter what happens, when the planet
          starts to break up you take off.

                      WEST

          Without the core we'll never have
          enough power to make orbit.

                      JOHN

          You've got to try. Promise me, Don.

A beat. Then Don extends his hand.

                      WEST

          Good luck. Commander.

Just then Will and the Robot arrive.

                      JOHN

          Will. Son. I want you to know-

                      WILL

          (fighting tears)

          You'll tell me when you get back to
          the ship. Now there just isn't time.

John bites back a bittersweet smile. (OVER) another RUMBLING.

                      JOHN

          I could use a weapon.

The Robot extends his claw. A panel opens on his arm and he tears out
a hand-made component. A conduit made from Will's golden first prize
medals, joined together to make a jagged star.

                      ROBOT

          Professor, I have a plan.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FuTURE

Spider Smith has Will against the rail.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Time to die, son.

                      OLDER WILL

          I'm not your son.

And with that Will SMASHES Spider Smith in the face with two closed
lists. Smith recoils, lifts the boy aver his head.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Goodbye.

Smith hurls Will over the rail towards the time pool below.

The creature walks to the end of the arm, stares at the forming
aperture into the past below him.

PORTAL-CLOSE. Images of the day before the mission launch swirl in the
laser-generated opening, growing ever more stable.

WIDER

Will is hanging over the time bubble, unconscious and unseen, dangling
from the gantry by a flashing chain around his neck.


CHAPTER 22: Time Travel
-----------------------


EXT:-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Don and the Robot, Will riding his back, navigate the terrain
alongside the ravaged hull of the Jupiter Two.

                      WILL

          Look.

On the ground, crumpled in a heap, is Smith. Don checks his pulse.

                      WEST

          (disappointed)

          Damn. He's still breathing.

(OVER) the rushing WIND. RUMBLING. A portal opens before them to a far
younger world. Then another portal, to a world far older. A third
portal RIPS across the sky overhead.

                      WILL

          The time machine must be near full
          power. The portals are collapsing.

                      WEST

          Which one leads us home?

More portals are opening around them, others winking shut.

                      WILL

          There.

Through a new rip in time, the intact Jupiter Two can be seen in
relief of the battered future craft. The ground beneath their feet is
beginning to give way.

                      WILL

          We can't just leave him here.

                      WEST

          Sure we can.

          (off WILL's stare)

          Damn it.

          (slapping the Doctor)

          Smith. Wake up. Smith.

                      SMITH

          (coming to)

          Oh, the pain, the pain.

                      ROBOT

          Danger. Will Robinson. Danger.

The PORTAL is beginning to shimmer. The ground starts to fall away.

                      WEST

          Jump!

Don hurls Smith through, Will, the Robot and West darting across the
threshold just as the portal winks closed.

EXT. -FOREST- PRESENT

The trees are bursting into flames an Will, Don, the Robot and Smith
emerge from the woods. Race forwards towards...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-PRESENT

The women are powering up the ship. The men are visible through the
windscreen. Outside, the ground in beginning to crumble.

                      PENNY

          Mom, the forest.

Penny opens the air lock. Maureen holds close her son. Steps back.

                      MAUREEN

          Where's John?

                      WEST

          The portal closed behind us. It was
          his only way back.

MEE GROUND-CLOSE. A geyser of fire BLOWS into the air.

                      WEST

          We've got to try and lift off.

                      MAUREEN

          We've already begun the pre-flight
          countdown. You have the Com.

          (off Don's expression)

          I'm going to save as many lives as I
          can, Major. Now strap in.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFoRm-FUTURE

(OVER) TREMORS. More lava is rushing up towards the mercury, the walls
themselves beginning to crack.

SMITH opens a gate at the end of the crow's-nest and a gang plank
unfolds above the doorway in time.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          Not so fast.

WIDER

John stands on the platform behind Smith, fighting star in hand,
slashes for his face. Smith moves fast, knocking the star to the
gantry bridge with his arm. John leaps on Smith, using his fists.

                      JOHN

          You sabotaged our mission.

          (hook)

          You killed my family

          (jab)

          You stole my son. It's payback time.

Smith's head moves from each impact, but the punches have no effect.
It smiles. Grabs John and hurls him across the platform.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Spare me the fury of the righteous.

The monster leans down over John. Opens its jaw.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          I think there's time for a snack
          before my trip.

John's hand is reaching towards the fallen fighting star. At the last
moment John grabs the metal weapon from the catwalk, slashes Smith
across the face, silver-red blood pouring down his cheek.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          (sarcastic)

          Oh, the pain. The pain.

                      JOHN

          You ain't seen nothing yet.

John feints towards Smith's head and then slashes low, cutting the
viscous membrane of the monster's egg pouch.

SPIDER SMITH-CLOSE. Surprised.

                      JOHN

          Remember the probe ship? These
          monsters eat their wounded.


SMITH'S EGG SACK-CLOSE. Scores of the tiny spiders are pouring out of
the sack, rushing up towards Smith's face, tiny jaws chomping.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          No. Stop. No!

Spider Smith tumbles backwards, falling against the rail on the side
of the platform. John rises and rushes him, SHOULDER-SLAMMING him,
sending Smith hurling over towards the bubble below.

Spider Smith hits the bubble, missing the doorway formed by the red
laser and is swept up by the tides of time.

                      JOHN

          Take all the time you want to die.


Spider Smith SCREAMS as he disappears and reappears in the various
half-formed images within the bubble before vanishing altogether.

John turns. The core cylinder has descended almost entirely into the
main console. only seconds before it's too late to retrieve it.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The landscape is a sudden inferno.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Don is at the Com. Maureen strapped into the co-pilot's chair.

                      MAUREEN

          I kept hoping somehow he'd appear.

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

                      MAUREEN

          Let's go, Major.

Don hits the engine switch. The.mighty generators WHINE into life.

                      MAUREEN

          (quiet)

          Goodbye, my love.

CHAPTER 23: Escape Velocity
---------------------------


The ship rocks as land masses on all sides begin to give way.

                      WEST

          Engaging primary thrusters. Now!

EXT. -JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The power drive begins to glow, diodes spinning. The landing struts
retract. The Jupiter Two begins to rise.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-INSERTION ARM-FUTURE

CONTROL CONSOLE-CLOSE. The core material in sinking fast. John moves
towards it when something on the gantry catches his eye.

GANTRY-CLOSE. Wedged into the grill work is a shiny scrap of metal
reflecting the setting sunlight. John's father's dog tags.

John rushes to the rail. There, still unconscious and hanging by the
dog-tag chain is Older Will.

CHAIN-CLOSE. The metal links are pulling apart. Will is seconds away
from falling into the pool.

JOHN-POV. The cylinder has completely sunken into the machine. It's
Will or the core material. No time for both.

John stands a beat, immobile. Then he drops to his knees, reaching
down as the chain breaks, grabbing Will's wrist at the last second.

The dog tags tumble into the pool below as John hoists Older Will up
onto the safety of the gangplank.

                      JOHN

          Come on, son. Wake up.

Will is still. Then, finally, his eyes open.

                      OLDER WILL

          Dad?

                      JOHN

          I thought I lost you.

                      OLDER WILL

          The core.

Will turns in time to see the core cylinder sink into the control
panel, the laser exploding in intensity below them as it drains the
cylinder's radioactive power. The world begins to EXPLODE.

                      OLDER WILL

          You could have taken the core and
          left before it was too late. You
          saved me instead.

John stares at him.

                      JOHN

          There wasn't any choice. I couldn't
          let you fall.You're my boy.


THE LASER-CLOSE. Reaches full power. The image in the time pool
stabilizes, becoming clear.

TIME POOL-CLOSE. Mission Control the day before the launch.

Father and Son stare into the past, eyes filled with wonder.

                      OLDER WILL

          Look. They made it.

PAN UP. Through a torn hole in the hull and a glowing rip in space,
the Jupiter Two is rising into the flame ravaged sky.

INT.JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

The ship is shaking madly.

                      WEST

          We're not getting any altitude.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The fire GEYSERS are legion, giant chunks of the planet's surface now
falling away beneath them. A huge spew of flame rages from the
fire-pocked surface, hitting the bull of the tiny craft.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Judy is at navigation, frantically enhance the stabilizers.

                      JUDY

          I'm reading a power build up.
          Markers in the red-

Suddenly the panel EXPLODES, sending Judy flying across the bridge.
Penny races to her sister. Kneels. Judy's eyes are wide, still.

                      PENNY

          She's dead.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

The ground is breaking, falling into an endless fiery abyss below.

                      WEST

          Not enough power to make orbit.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRES ENT

Another firestorm. A flame geyser hits the ship. Then another.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Control panels all around the ship begin to SLOW. The main screen is
hit by a flying chunk of rock. The giant glass begins to crack.

                      WEST

          (to Maureen)

          I'm sorry.

The windshield EXPLODES, sucking them both out into space.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The ship is hit by another fire geyser. The Jupiter Two EXPLODES.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

John and Will kneel on the crow's nest as the Jupiter Two dodges the
fire geysers in the sky through the torn hull. The ship is struck
once, again, finally EXPLODING in a ROARING ball of fire.

JOHN-CLOSE. A man who has lost everything he ever loved.

                      JOHN

          I couldn't save them.

Will stares at his father and beyond him. There, in the time doorway,
a young Will walks towards the entrance to Mission Control in the
morning sun, innocent with no knowledge of the future.

                      OLDER WILL (OVER)

          So many years ago and I can still
          feel it. Our sun. Our Earth. It's
          all I've thought about. Going home.

Will reaches forward and touches the control console. The images in
the laser generated doorway begin to change.

                      OLDER WILL

          A long time ago, you told a small
          boy that one day he'd understand how
          precious he was, how much his father
          loved him. Today is that day.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. Instead of Earth we now see this planet's surface,
the Jupiter Two rising as it did just moments ago.

                      OLDER WILL

          All I could see was your need to go
          forward at any cost. What you never
          showed me was your love. I lost
          that. Robbed by time. I could never
          see how much you cared. Until now.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The Jupiter Two tries in vain to dodge the fire
geysers, then EXPLODING all over again. Will enters some commands.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The image in the portal begins to run backwards,
the Jupiter Two reconstituting from a ball of flame, receding past
diminishing flame geysers, beginning to land again.

                      OLDER WILL

          Father, take my hand.

INT.-CUPITER TWO

We are back in the ship just before take off. DON mans the Cam.
Maureen straps herself into the co-pilot's chair.

                      MAUREEN

          I kept hoping somehow he'd appear.

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

                      MAUREEN

          Let's go, Major.

Don hits the engine switch. The mighty generators WHINE into life.

                      MAUREEN

          (quiet)

          Goodbye my love.

                      PENNY

          Look.

The roof of the hull is beginning to swirl, becoming translucent, like
water. There, standing above them, John and Older WILL.

2NT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-CROW'S NEST-FUTURE

The bridge of the Jupiter Two is visible in the laser generated
doorway. Older WILL looks to his father.

                      OLDER WILL

          DON'T make me wait another lifetime
          to know how you feel.

And with that he pushes John over the edge, the Professor falling down
through space and into the bubble and the doorway below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The ceiling becomes water an John drops into the ship. Maureen cradles
her husband. Then she looks up. Will is still visible through the
watery hull.

                      JOHN

          Come with us.

But the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the
world of the engine room EXPLODES in the b.g.

                      OLDER WILL

          I can't. There was only enough power
          for one person, one trip, remember?

                      MAUREEN

          Will?

                      OLDER WILL

          It's good to see you again, Mom.
          It's good to see you alive.

          (fading)

          Sorry about all the monkey business.

Maureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands
almost touching before Will is gone, the portal closed forever.

                      JOHN

          He sacrificed everything for his
          family.

                      MAUREEN

          (fighting tears)

          He had a good example.

Maureen holds him close. A small figure walks up beside them. Will.

                      WILL

          Dad?

A beat, then Will reaches up, hands him his dog tags.

                      WILL

          I'm glad you came back.

                      JOHN

          I just want you to know I love you
          son. I love you very much.

John takes the boy in his arms, father and son finally holding close.
(OVER) more RUMBLING as the ground continues to give way.

                      WEST (OVER)

          The planet is breaking up around us.

John moves fast to the Com.

                      WEST

          Nice of you to drop in.

John smiles a beat, then he's all business.

                      JOHN

          Status?

(OVER) A tremendous CRASH.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The land masses are falling away beneath them, plummeting into

giant caverns of fire.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      SMITH

          We're doomed. We're doomed.

West turns, hauls off and PUNCHES Smith, knocking him out cold.

                      WEST

          Boy, that felt good.

                      JOHN

          Get us airborne.

Don throws the power switches to full.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The landing struts retract. The power drive begins to spin. The
Jupiter Two rises above the ground just as the firmament collapses
upon itself. Fire geysers ERUPT. History in about to repeat itself.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          I'm going to try to reach escape
          velocity. Maybe we can break the
          gravitational pull.

                      JOHN

          No. We don't have the core material.
          The gravity wells will drag us down.

                      WEST

          We might-

                      JOHN

          We won't make it. Trust me. I know.
          We've got to go down.

                      WEST

          What?

                      JOHN

          Through the planet as she breaks up.

                      WEST

          That's insane.

                      JOHN

          I don't have time to argue. I'm
          giving you a direct order, Major.

Don and John stare at each other a beat. Then Don smiles.

                      WEST

          Yes Sir.

VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The world is breaking up beneath them, revealing a
fiery maw. DON GUNS the engines, heading straight for the chasm.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The tiny ship flies into the giant expanding crevice.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

DON is flying into the shattering center of the planet. Masses of
continents, some bearing forests, others oceans, all soar past.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The tiny ship flies deeper toward the molten center of the planet.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      JOHN

          There.

A window out the windscreen a portion of the planet has torn away
revealing the black of space and the starfield beyond.

                      WEST

          I see it.

Don banks the ship toward the opening, flying past exploding fragments
of this shattering world.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship clears the planet as the world EXPLODES in the b.g.

CHAPTER 24: Alpha Prime
-----------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO

DON guides the ship out into space. Judy comes up behind him.

                      JUDY

          Nice work, flyboy.

                      WEST

          So, I earn that kiss yet?

                      JUDY

          (a peck on the cheek)

          You earned that.

DON shrugs, begins to turn away. Judy grabs him.

                      JUDY

          This one is on credit.

She gives him a long, passionate kiss. She lets him go, stunned.

                      JUDY

          Cold fish, huh?

Penny holds Blip in her arms, who has begun to BLIP madly.

                      MAUREEN

          Poor thing. She's lost her whole
          family.

          (off Penny)

          Penny, why are you looking at me
          like that. Penny?

Penny presses a button. Blast doors open on a storage hold.

                      PENNY

          I promised Judy I'd take care of
          her. I couldn't leave her all alone.

(all stare at her)

          Well I am their princess, after all.

          (turning)

          You can come out mow.

Forms in the cargo hold de-camouflage. The other lizard monkeys,
standing amidst glittering canisters of Dimondium.

                      JOHN

          Dimondium. Now if we could only find
          our way back to Earth.

                      ROBOT

          If I may, Professor.

The Robot projects a holographic schematic of the galaxy. The Jupiter
Two is highlighted. Earth blinks at the other and.

                      ROBOT

          Your son's star charts.

                      WILL

          It's a map home.

(OVER) ALARMS. The shattered planet's core is turning bright red, a
sudden ROARING blast wave heading towards the ship.

                      WEST

          The planet's gravity field in
          collapsing.

                      MAUREEN

          We'll be sucked in.

                      JOHN

          There's no way to get clear in time.

                      JUDY

          The hyperdrive.

                      MAUREEN

          Everybody hang on.

                      PENNY

          Here we go again.

                      WILL

          Cool.

Don throws the switch.

EXT. -JUPITER TWO

The planet's core EXPLODES as the Jupiter Two vanishes into
hyperspace, a sudden star and then gone.


FINAL FADE TO BLACK
MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD



                        Written by

                 John Collee & Peter Weir




   1. THE OCEAN - DUSK

   From blackness, a pattern slowly emerges - shimmering,
   abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep-sided
   valleys of water.

   Finally the picture settles into a high, wide shot of the
   ocean and an adjacent coastline.

   In a corner of the screen, the last rays of sunlight touch a
   small, dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering
   darkness: A three-masted sailing vessel.

   2. THE SHIP - DUSK

   [   ] She passes close enough to touch: hawsers as thick as a
   man's trunk, massive black-painted timbers, muzzles of her
   great guns projecting from every gun-port.

   As the ship glides past and away from us, her name is
   visible, picked out in dull gold on the transom - Surprise.

   3. ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK

   The ship in silhouette - RUN CAPTION:

           HMS Surprise
           Armament: 28 guns Crew: 197 souls.
           Location: Coast of Brazil, November 1806
           Mission: Intercept and destroy French
           Privateer, Acheron


   5.   THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

   CAPTAIN JACK AUBREY, with his back to us, bends over the
   table, studying charts.

   His servant, KILLICK, a pig-tailed, ear-ringed man of
   indeterminate age, refills the glass at his elbow.

   JACK drinks. The glass catches the setting sun as it drops
   below the great casement windows.

   KILLICK lights a lamp, places it next to his captain and
   retires.
                    JACK
          (Absently) Thankee Killick

   4. THE CHARTS:

   a beautifully drawn chart of the South American coastline.

   Jack's hands place a second chart on top of the first,
   bringing the north-east coast of Brazil into view. Then
   another, each one enlarging the view of the preceding one.

   On the final chart we can read navigational symbols and
   detailed information in fine copperplate script:

          6 fa. Shoals suddenly to half fa. Rocks
          (exact position unknown). Hidden reef.

   6. BELOW DECKS - NIGHT

   Another lamp illuminates 1st lieutenant TOM PULLINGS, his
   pleasant open face marred by a diagonal sabre scar running
   from brow to chin.

   He is making a final tour of inspection before lights out.

7. THE DOCTOR'S CABIN - NIGHT

Dr STEPHEN MATURIN, a keen naturalist, sits at his desk
surrounded by specimen jars, books and scientific
instruments.

[   ]

TOM PULLINGS glances in as he moves past the cabin door, but
the doctor, placing weights on some finely-balanced
structure, is too engrossed to notice him.

8. MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - NIGHT

In the quarters for the 'young gentlemen', boys trained from
an early age to become officers, four lads play at marbles.

PETER CALAMY (16) and LORD BLAKENEY (13) are arguing about
whether a marble was inside outside the circle as their berth
mates BOYLE (15) and WILLIAMSON (14) wait for the game to
resume.

                    BLAKENEY
          In
                      CALAMY
          Out.

                    BLAKENEY
          In. It was here. The line is in.

                    CALAMY
          It was there. It was out. Out

                    BLAKENEY
          In. Tell him Boyle. It was in I say.

The lamp moves on, illuminating a fifth midshipman, much
older than the rest. This is HOLLOM, aged 24. He's a
sensitive-looking fellow, idly strumming a guitar, glancing
up briefly as TOM PULLINGS passes.

9. GUN-DECK - NIGHT

By the galley stove at the forward end of the gun-deck a few
of the foremast hands enjoy a last smoke and a mug of grog.

Faster Doudle passes his mug to Higgins who guzzles it down
greedily

One man, BECKETT, sits shirtless while another, AWKWARD
DAVIES, brow furrowed with concentration, tattoos the first
link of what will be a great chain round BECKETT's waist.

JOE PLAICE, at 45 one of the oldest men on board, stops in
the middle of a story as PULLINGS passes, everyone knuckling
their foreheads in deference to the officer.

10.    BETWEEN TWO GUNS - NIGHT

Boys no more than eight or nine years old play a game of
'jacks' with some sheep bones. ADDISON, RYE and SWIFT are the
powder-monkeys who ferry powder from the hold to the guns
during action.

11.    BERTH DECK - NIGHT

A hundred hammocks swing like strange pods, close packed
under the immense beams. Most of the occupants are already
asleep: here an arm, there a lolling head

                    HOLLAR
          Lights out!

On the bosun's command, the last of the off-duty men climb
into their hammocks.

The last lights are extinguished. Only PULLINGS' lamp
remains, moving up the ladder to...

12.   WEATHER DECK - NIGHT

The uppermost or weather deck consists of two parallel
gangways linking the forecastle (forward) to the quarterdeck
(aft).

The lead is dropped from the bows. As PULLINGS walks aft to
the quarterdeck as each man lets go his coils of the deep sea
line.

                     CREWMEN
           Watch there! Watch

Somewhere a bell sounds and the silent figures of the watch
call from their stations.

                     WATCH CAPTAINS
           - Lifebuoy all's well!
           - Starboard gangway all's well!
           - Starboard bow all's well!

Over this, the splash of the lead and the repeated cry of
"Watch there! Watch!"

13.     QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

Pullings has joined the officer of the watch, 2nd Lieutenant
MOWETT, a short tubular man in his early 20s.

JACK climbs up a ladder and we see him properly for the first
time: a heavy-set man in his thirties, thick blonde hair
clubbed at the back

At the binnacle, by the ship's great wheel. The helmsman,
BONDEN - a London cockney with a boxer's face - gives JACK
their current course.

JACK nods, then moves to the gunwale with PULLINGS. Jack
sniffs the air and speaks in a low voice.

                     JACK
           How I do hate a lee shore

                     PULLINGS
           You think we'll have long to wait?
                    JACK
              (shrugs)
          Intelligence reports had her leaving
          Boston on the 12th, that should put us at
          least a week ahead.

                    PULLINGS
          She'll be in for a surprise, Sir.

The pun on the name of their ship was unintentional, but JACK
lets out a great hoot of laughter, shattering the tense,
expectant silence.

                    JACK
          In for a "Surprise". Now that's wit. "In
          for a Surprise". 'Pon my word I shall
          have to tell the Doctor.

He leaves, still laughing. Those on the quarterdeck are more
amused by JACK's unique sense of humour than by the feeble
joke itself.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
              (calls back)
          Don't put her on the reef, Tom.

                    PULLINGS
          I'll try not to, Sir.

13A    INT. STEPHEN'S CABIN

Jack looks around the door

                    JACK
          What do you have there, Stephen?

He enters. Stephen has wired together the thorax of a bird's
skeleton and is suspending lead weights from it

                    STEPHEN
          The breastbone of a frigate bird. Do you
          remark its prodigious strength.

Jack bends forwards into the candle-light, sharing his
friends keen interest in this strange assembly

                    JACK
          I do and I am not in the least surprised,
          for it reminds me of nothing so much as a
          ship under sail. See here the bowsprit.
          Here the mast, and here the backstays
          running aft.

                    STEPHEN
              (adds another weight)
          Ten pounds sixteen ounces. I am preparing
          a paper for the Royal Society.

Jack straightens, moving with care between the bottled
specimens, open books and brass measuring instruments

                    JACK
          I was thinking when our business here is
          finished, we will have to put in to
          Recife for provisions. You may care to
          take a tour round the forests of Brazil,
          botanizing and collecting specimens. An
          anaconda or two. A giant cassowary.

                    STEPHEN
          I should like it of all things, Jack.
          Thankyou.


14.     WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Time passes. The fog intensifies. White coils of mist drift
and eddy over the glassy sea, RUN FINAL TITLES as the ship
moves slowly through the night.

15-16   (ADDED TO SC 12)

17.     IN THE GREAT CABIN, LATER - NIGHT

The chronometer ticks. The coffee-pot swings on its gimbals.
JACK lies awake in his hanging cot. Finally he gives up
trying to sleep.

                    JACK
          Killick! Killick there! Strong coffee,
          and light along my topcoat.

18.     ON THE QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

JACK on deck again.

                    QUARTERMASTER
          Six bells and all's well.

A hint of daylight to the east. The mist beginning to shift
as an offshore breeze picks up.
                    LEAD-MAN
          90 fathoms, white shelly sand.

                    CALAMY
          Four knots, Sir.

BONDEN is still at the wheel.

                    BONDEN
          Oi reckon as she's liftin' Sir, if you
          feels like putting your éad down.

JACK takes his advice and goes below again.

19. - THE SHIP (TIMELAPSE)

The sky a shade paler. A wind coming up.

20.    ON THE STARBOARD GANGWAY - DAWN

The lookout, VINCENT, peers into the mist.

                    VINCENT
          Starboard gangway ahoy.

HOLLOM, the oldest of the midshipmen, whose watch it now is,
appears at his shoulder.

                    HOLLOM
          What is it, Vincent?

                    VINCENT
          I heard something. A bell.

HOLLOM peers out into the fog, then turns.

                    HOLLOM
          Native fisherman perhaps.
          (shouts) Mr. Calamy!

Midshipman CALAMY comes running forward.

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)
          The lead, if you please.

Young CALAMY takes the lead, scrambles into the chains at the
bow of the ship and throws out the lead line.

HOLLOM takes up a telescope and searches through the eddies
of fog.
Over HOLLOM's P.O.V. we can hear CALAMY sounding the depth.

                     CALAMY (O.S.)
           Sixty fathoms, white sand!

Hollom folds his telescope

                     HOLLOM
           Well. It can't have been a reef marker.

CALAMY, unconvinced, checks through his own telescope

                     HOLLOM (CONT'D)
           False alarm Mr CALAMY

CALAMY ignores him, still scanning

21.   TELESCOPE POV

The telescope pans. A dark shape in the distance. The mist
parts a little. A ship. Coming straight toward them.

Close on CALAMY as he turns to camera, screaming -

                     CALAMY
           Enemy on the larboard bow! Beat to
           quarters!

22. JACK'S SLEEP CABIN

JACK instantly awake, piling out of his bed, still dressed.

23.     BERTH-DECK - DAWN

A drum blazes as the off-duty watch tumble out of their
hammocks and run to their battle stations.

24. COCKPIT, ORLOP DECK

Rows of wicked-looking instruments are hastily thrown on the
operating table by PADEEN, MATURIN's servant - saws,
retractors and knives glistening in the lamp-light.

DR. MATURIN hurries in blinking sleep out of his eyes as he
ties on his black apron - behind him, HIGGINS, the assistant
surgeon.

25.   POWDER MAGAZINE

Little ADDISON and his team of powder-monkeys run with their
boxes of gunpowder to the...

26. GUN-DECK

As LAMB, NAGEL and the other carpenters bash down cabin
partitions, transforming the entire gun-deck into a single
continuous space, from the bows to the Captain's Great Cabin
in the stern.

As the crews swarm about their guns, grotesque shadows are
thrown on the walls and ceiling by the numerous battle-
lanterns arriving to illuminate the scene.

27. WEATHER-DECK

JACK and PULLINGS stride the length of the deck toward the
bow [ ] . They pass crews manning the carronades while
others swing the ship's small boats out and over the side to
be towed behind the ship.

28. FORECASTLE

JACK and PULLINGS join HOLLOM.

                    JACK
          Where away?

CALAMY points forward and a little to the left of the
Surprise's bow.

                    CALAMY
          Not two miles distant, Sir.

JACK and PULLINGS stare through telescopes into the fog,
which is beginning to lift. JACK lowers his telescope.

                    JACK
          Mr. Hollom?

                    HOLLOM
          I saw nothing, nor heard anything either.
          Shall I ask them men to stand down?

JACK steps closer to the bow, and again lifts his telescope.

29. TELESCOPE P.O.V

A slow pan across the sea, past a darker patch of fog. What
was that? The lens pans back toward the darker area to see a
series of flashes.
30. CLOSE ON JACK

He turns and shouts to the crew -

                     JACK
           Lie down! Everybody lie down!

His words are underscored by a series of distant explosions,
followed by a deep rumble, then a tearing, howling sound.

31. ANGLE ON THE SKY

Chain shot and grape, bar and canister shriek through the
air. A blizzard of iron.

32. ON THE DECK

The crew hit the deck, the last to drop is BONDEN hanging
grimly to the wheel.

33. MIDSHIPMAN BLAKENEY

Close, as he tries to bury himself in the deck timbers.

34. DELETED

35. DELETED.

36. QUARTERDECK

The broadside hits the bows and a cloud of splinters and
metal scythes the length of the deck at head height. This is
rapidly followed by billowing smoke from a small fire now
burning on the forecastle.

CALAMY is working at putting the fire out as JACK issues a
stream of orders.

                     JACK
           Run out the guns! Marines to the tops,
           and get that wounded man below!

He pulls a gold watch from his pocket and checks the time.

36A.   GUN DECK

Hollom is nervously supervising a gun crew which includes
DAVIES and his mates.
                     HOLLOM
           ...C-cast loose now... Um swab. That's
           right. Run out your guns.

The men work as a team, largely ignoring Hollom's hesitant
instructions. The shot rack is empty

                     DAVIES
           Shot. There's no shot!

37.   QUARTERDECK (CONTD)

As red-coated marines led by Captain HOWARD climb into the
rigging JACK calls to his clerk -

                     JACK
           Note the time Mr. Watt.

An anxious TOM PULLINGS appears.

                     PULLINGS
           She's out of our range, Sir!

JACK calls to his sailing master, ALLEN.

                     JACK
           Closer, Mr. ALLEN. You must lay me
           alongside her at pistol-shot.

ALLEN purses his lips. He knows what he's doing and slightly
resents the instruction

                     JACK (CONT'D)
           Mr. Pullings - bow-chasers to fire as she
           bears.

38. P.O.V. ENEMY SHIP

She's crossing their bows, about a mile distant.

39. ON DECK

PULLINGS is racing up the larboard gangway to the forecastle,
past men stacking hammocks as blast protection.

40. ON THE FORECASTLE

Gun-captains stand ready, the slow-match burning in the tubs.

                     PULLINGS
           Fire on the uproll.

The little drummer's huge eyes are fixed on PULLINGS' face.
The ship rolls.

                       PULLINGS (CONT'D)
           Fire!

The drum-roll is all but drowned by the blast of the guns.

The smoke clears, the gunners look on baffled as their balls
bounce harmlessly off the side of the enemy ship.

                     OLD SPONGE
               (In Greek)
           Witchcraft!

                     DOUDLE
           Never seen the like of it

                     PULLINGS
           Damn and blast you! See to your guns!
           Fire high! Fire for the masts and
           rigging!

As the enemy's murderous long guns run out again.

41.   WIDE ON THE ENEMY SHIP

Her French ensign clearly visible as she swings broadside on
to the approaching Surprise - again her side lights up in a
series of red flashes.

42.   IN THE COCKPIT

By the dim light of a battle-lantern STEPHEN struggles to
hold a wounded man on the table, his feet slipping in pools
of blood on the deck.

                     STEPHEN
           More sand on the floor, Mr. Higgins!

The slightly hung-over HIGGINS reaches for the sand bucket
and is thrown over by the awful jarring shock as the
Acheron's third broadside hits home.

43.   IN THE GREAT CABIN -

The Captain's crockery smashes to the deck. KILLICK, cursing
freely, stows what he can.
44.   IN THE ORLOP

Shards of timber implode, followed by a great spout of water
knocking the massive AWKWARD DAVIES sideways as he runs for
the ladder carrying two cannon-balls.

A second explosion, a second jet of water and DAVIES, finding
his feet, starts yelling for the carpenter.

                       DAVIES
             Wood and Lead! Mr Nagel! Mr Lamb!!

45. STAIRS

Follow DAVIES as he runs up to the gun-deck with the shot
under his arms past the powder-monkeys ADDISON and SWIFT,
canisters of gun-powder slung over their shoulders, then he
sees MR. LAMB, the carpenter.

                       DAVIES
             Orlop! We're holed!

As LAMB dives for the ladder.

46.   ON THE GUN-DECK

DAVIES arrives to find a gaping hole opposite where his own
gun once stood. Its crew lie scattered, horribly wounded or
dead.

The dismounted gun and twelve pound shot are rolling around
dangerously. HOLLOM, the sole survivor, is backed against
the bulkhead, cradling an injured arm.

CALAMY emerges from the smoke, meets DAVIES's horror-struck
gaze and takes command.

                       CALAMY
             Davies! Get those bodies overboard!
                 (to HOLLOM)
             Mr. Hollom sir!

HOLLOM sits immobilized by fear. CALAMY grabs the poulterer,
JEMMY DUCKS, who has been rescuing the ship's goat, Aspasia.

                       CALAMY (CONT'D)
             Jemmy - leave the damned goat and take
             Mr. Hollom below.

                        JEMMY DUCKS
           Aye, sir!

The ship heels as she turns.

Midshipman BLAKENEY, Calamy's rival in the game of marbles,
turns to see the dismounted gun rolling free. He throws a
hammock net under it, stopping its roll before it crushes
CALAMY against the bulkhead.

CALAMY shoots him a brief look of gratitude and runs aft.
BLAKENEY carries on shouting to the powder-monkeys -

                     BLAKENEY
           More shot! More cartridge!

47.   HULL OF THE SURPRISE

In the great jagged hole on the gun-deck where the gun was
destroyed, JACK stands framed, a wrathful soot-stained
figure. He glances back at his men, hunched and ready,
itching to fire.

                     JACK (bellows)
           Steady... Wait for it!

48. WIDE ON THE BATTLE

to see the two ships about to pass abreast, the Surprise
heading south as it were, the enemy ship, north.

The French vessel is clearly the bigger ship, and from both
come the sounds of shouted orders and the thunder of drums.
They will pass broadside to broadside, 500 yards apart.

49.   GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

JACK watching the enemy, judging the moment.

                     JACK
           ...wait WAIT! And FIRE!

The great guns go off all together. The cannons leaping back
between their crews. JACK snatches a powder-monkey, ADDISON,
out of the way of the lethal recoil.

50.   QUARTERDECK

Smoke clears to reveal holes in the enemy's foretopsail, a
bowline hanging loose, but again many of her balls have
failed to penetrate the enemy timbers.
                     BONDEN
           By all that's holy what is that ship made
           of?

His question coincides with a third full broadside from the
Frenchman. The Surprise's wheel shattered. BONDEN thrown
aside, MR. WATT jerked back to the taffrail, the mizzenmast
hit.

A rope sheers and JOE PLAICE is smacked on the skull by a
swinging boom.

Midshipman BLAKENEY, running up on deck, goes to help PLAICE
and is struck down by a flying splinter - a shocking wound to
his upper right arm.

51. COMPANIONWAY

JACK is half-way up the ladder when he falls, scored across
the forehead by a musket-ball.

Eyesight blurred. Hearing gone. He is dimly aware of small
arms cracking above his head, and someone trying to lift him.

                     JACK
           Belay there ye poxed son of a whore!

                     MOWETT
           You must go below, Sir, you must let me
           help you below!

JACK puts a hand to his bleeding forehead and drags himself
back up the ladder.

52. IN THE TOPS

A furious exchange of fire between CAPTAIN HOWARD's marines
and the sharpshooters in the enemy's rigging.

Howard, a big red-faced man, is in his element, laughing
madly every time he scores a hit.

53. QUARTERDECK

JACK emerges into bloody chaos: screams of the wounded all
around, the enemy ship moving astern in mist and gun-smoke.

He wipes blood from his eye as he raises his telescope.

54/55.   TELESCOPE P.O.V.
As the ship passes, her name is visible on the transom -
Acheron.

                     PULLINGS V.O
           Sir....

Jack lowers his telescope. Pullings' expression spells
catastrophe

                     PULLINGS
           It's the rudder.

56.   STERN OF THE SURPRISE

Grim-faced, JACK hobbles to the shattered taff-rail, sees
BONDEN soaked, having climbed down onto the stern-post.

                     BONDEN
               (shouts up)
           It's shot away below the waterline!


58. COCKPIT

STEPHEN, up to his armpits in blood, operating on a wounded
man, looks up to see three more seriously injured men
arriving.

He pauses, aware of some change.

                     STEPHEN
           Why are we not firing?


57.   GUN-DECK

Spirals of drifting smoke. Blackened bleeding men, their guns
pointing at nothing


                     FASTER DOUDLE
           No steerage.

                     NEHEMIAH SLADE
           We're fish in a barrel



59.   HIGH SHOT
The fog has rolled back, like a great curtain, to reveal the
two frigates.

The badly damaged Surprise, drifting rudderless.

The Acheron, most of her sails intact, beginning the turn
which will put her in position to finish off the Surprise.

60. QUARTERDECK

JACK is joined by ALLEN as the enemy vessel starts crossing
their wake.

                     ALLEN
           He's coming about, Sir.

                     MOWETT
           Should I strike the colours?

All eyes on Jack, poised on the brink of awful defeat.

                     ALLEN
           I'm afraid there's nothing else for it.

JACK looks from the wall of fog to the three little boats
they are towing astern.

                     JACK
           Damned if there ain't. We'll tow her.

61.   STERN OF THE SURPRISE

Sudden feverish activity, running and shouting as men
scramble down into the boats. DAVIES settles himself beside
NAGEL in the cutter, turning to look at the approaching
Acheron.

His P.O.V.: puffs of smoke from its bow-chasers.

                     PULLINGS
           Sail trimmers away, Warley, make what
           sail you can!

                     JACK
           Stern-chasers to fire when she's in
           range!

62.   STERN OF SURPRISE

Gouts of water from the enemy gunfire rise not fifty yards
from them, acting as little needed encouragement for the
boats to get clear of the stern and pull around towards the
bows as....


64.   MAINMAST/FOREMAST

Men scramble up the ratlines, and through the shattered
rigging.

65.   THE GREAT CABIN

Two long brass nine-pounders set up through the open windows
of the Captain's day cabin, open fire on the approaching
Acheron.

                        MOWETT
           Fire!

65A. MAINMAST

WARLEY, captain of the maintop, directs his men about the
mare's nest of rigging, getting a tattered top-sail to fill
with what little breeze there is.

                     WARLEY
           Sharp now with that fancy-line! To the
           clew line from the reef points, Cully,
           double up and run her back again!

66. QUARTERDECK

Through PULLINGS' telescope: the enemy ship coming straight
at them, her guns now getting the range of the Surprise.

                     PULLINGS
           She's gaining on us.

                     JACK
           Start the water, carronades over the
           side.

67.   ANGLE ON THE QUARTERDECK

Crewmen furiously at work cutting the ropes securing the guns
on the quarterdeck.

68.   ANGLE ON THE STERN

Water spouts from the pumps, while at the same time the
quarterdeck guns tumble into the ocean.
(NOTE: they only abandon guns on the quarterdeck, not their
main armament on the gun-deck.)

69. FORECASTLE

JACK races to the bows. Towlines strain as the three small
boats pull the great ship toward the curtain of fog and
cloud. He yells to the straining oarsmen -

                     JACK
           Pull! Pull for your lives.

70.   ANGLE FROM THE BOATS

The men heave on their oars, faces bathed in sweat, the
towlines taut behind them, dragging the Surprise toward the
safety of the fog-bank.

71. WIDE

to see the Surprise slipping into the cover of fog and low
cloud, only her top masts visible, before they too disappear.

72. QUARTERDECK

JACK joins his officers looking back into the white-out, in
the direction of the enemy.

                     JACK
           Quiet now. No calls, no shouts. Mr.
           ALLEN, signal the men in the boats to
           head due east.

ALLEN hurries toward the bows, as behind them the fog is
momentarily illuminated by flashes of gunfire from their
pursuer.

73.   THE LEADING JOLLY BOAT

CALAMY, in the prow of the jolly-boat, sees ALLEN on the
ship, signalling the turn to eastward.

CALAMY signals to BONDEN in the stern of the jolly-boat.

                     BONDEN
               (urgent whisper)
           Starboard haul. And stroke! Stroke!

One side stops rowing and the boat turns.
74.   THE SURPRISE

A low angle, the ship coming slowly toward us.

Beyond, the rowers strain at their oars, the great ship
rearing out of the mist above them, as though carried on
their backs.

75.   QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE

Somewhere astern and to the left JACK can hear shouting on
the Acheron. Flashes of cannon fire, directed away from them.

                     PULLINGS
           He's beating inshore.

                     JACK
           Keep rowing

76 MASTS OF THE SURPRISE, (TIMELAPSE) - NIGHT

The tortured sounds of exhausted men rowing as skeins of mist
drift away to reveal a dim, yellow moon. On the horizon the
battered ship in silhouette, lines stretching ahead to her
three small boats.

77 QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Some of the wreckage has been cleared aside, the wounded
moved below. We can hear their moans, and the constant
creaking of the bilge pumps.

JACK and his officers scan the moonlit sea through
telescopes.

JACK's telescope POV: A long slow pan along the dark horizon.

                     ALLEN
           I believe we've lost her, Sir.

JACK collapses his telescope.

                     JACK
           Pass the word to ship oars


78 IN THE JOLLY BOATs. - NIGHT

The rowers slump forwards in their seats, their hands raw and
crabbed.
79 STAIRWELL - NIGHT

JACK moves down a ladder past LAMB coming up from below,
soaking wet and exhausted with his mate Nagel.

                    LAMB
          Three feet of water in the hold, Sir, but
          the pumps are keeping it from gaining.

                    JACK
          Very good, Mr. Lamb.

The constant creaking and sloshing of the pumps becomes
louder as he continues down past men handing up food and
powder from the flooded levels below.

81. SICK-BAY

Stephen, his face spattered with blood, is adjusting the wick
of a lantern when Jack arrives beside him

                    JACK
              (sotto)
          What's the butchers bill?

                    STEPHEN
          Six dead, thirteen wounded.

He notices the gash on Jack's forehead

          Your head ...

                    JACK
              (Brushes him away)
          Later.

STEPHEN raises his lantern to reveal groaning bloodstained
men close-packed in the gloom.

Together they make the rounds, passing men propped upright by
their mates, pale with shock or tense with pain, some
struggling to breathe, some barely alive.

JACK clasps hands, whispers encouragement.

A bandaged head swims into the glow of the lamp, streaked
with blood and deeply unconscious.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Who's this - Joe Plaice?
                    STEPHEN
              (sotto)
          A severe depressed fracture of the
          skull. I am not sure he will see out the
          night.

Moving on to another barely recognizable face: young
Blakeney, pale and sweaty, breathing hard from the pain and
the blood loss.

                    JACK
          Mr. Blakeney?

                    BLAKENEY
          Just a broken arm, Sir.

JACK looks at STEPHEN, whose expression is grim, but he says
nothing, steering Jack forward to the foot of the ladder
where they can speak more privately

                    STEPHEN
          I will do everything possible. I know you
          were close to his father.

Jack nods, defeat weighing heavily, and makes to go. Stephen
puts a restraining hand on his shoulder.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          One moment Jack let me look at that brow
          of yours.

                    JACK
          Its a scratch.

                    STEPHEN
          I will tell you if its a scratch or not.
          Sit down.

Jack submits meekly, and sits on a lower rung while Stephen
puts a bandage round his forehead

                    JACK
          How did he find us Stephen?
          Seven weeks sailing and he happened in
          darkness on our exact position. Its
          uncanny. He really is a phantom

                    STEPHEN
          Unless she was alerted to our presence,
          and looking for us.
                    JACK
          Tosh. How could that be?

                    STEPHEN
          The French have their spies, in Britain
          as elsewhere.

                     JACK (astonished)
          You're saying there are traitors in the
          Admiralty?

                    STEPHEN
          I am saying do not imagine it was a lone
          privateer who did this to us. He is
          working for Napoleon himself, with access
          to all that tyrant commands, overtly and
          covertly. So do not let defeat weigh too
          heavily upon you.

82.    THE GREAT CABIN - DAWN

Wan dawn light reflects off the ceiling onto the bloody,
bandaged officers, conducting an angry post-mortem as KILLICK
serves coffee.

                    ALLEN
          ...Call her a frigate? Ha! You ask me
          she's no more a frigate than a painted
          Dutchman. More like a ship of the line, a
          two-decker more'n a frigate.

MOWETT is trying to staunch a persistent nosebleed.

                    MOWETT
          One does wonder what manner of hull she
          has. Our balls seemed to bounce right off
          her.

Jack enters, his head newly bandaged. He walks past the
seated officers and stands looking out through the stern
windows. The officers continue their conversation, though
their words are intended for Jack

                    PULLINGS
          She had the weather-gauge and long
          eighteens which could hit us beyond our
          effective range. That's the sum of it

                     ALLEN
          And   40 guns to our 28, I counted the
          muzzle flashes.

                    PULLINGS
          It was an unfair match, no dishonor in
          defeat no dishonor at all.

Jack still has his back to them. He puts his hand in his
pocket and finds something there - the shattered fragments of
his gold pocket watch.

                    ALLEN
              (sighs)
          Well, we can patch up our main and mizzen
          the foresail is too far gone so we'll
          bend our spare.

                      PULLINGS
          Sir.

Jack finally turns.

                    PULLINGS (CONT'D)
          Mr. Allen is confident, with basic
          repairs, we can get home as we are...
          allowing for a stop in Jamaica.

                     ALLEN
          At Port Royal we can haul her into dry-
          dock, and hopefully get her home
          without...

                    JACK
          We're not going home.

An expectant hush. KILLICK is all ears, as he picks up the
coffee cups and places them carefully on a silver tray.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What is our purpose here gentlemen? Why
          were we sent? To punish a blackguard
          privateer who has decimated our Atlantic
          whaling fleet and now threatens to do the
          same in the pacific. Are we to leave
          those ships to his mercy and slink back
          into Portsmouth - another defeat to add
          to the list. Is that what we draw our
          wages for? I say we pursue her and pay
          her back with interest

                    ALLEN
          With respect, Captain, she could be half-
          way to Cape Horn by the time we're
           repaired and underway.

                     JACK
               (sternly)
           Then there's not a moment to lose.

83.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN

KILLICK exits the cabin with the tray of coffee cups. As he
passes them to his mate, BLACK BILL -

                     KILLICK (a whisper)
           We're for the Horn.

84.     THROUGHOUT THE SHIP - DAWN

Word passes like lightning from the wounded in the orlop, to
the beak of the ship

                      MUTTERED VOICES AD LIB
           -   The Horn you say?
           -   Never! In this condition?
           -   Eh? What news mates
           -   Heading for where?!

85.     FORECASTLE - DAWN

A few of the old 'Surprises' have gathered for a smoke, all
of them men who've sailed with JACK before: Jittery alcoholic
Higgins, loyal Nehemiah Slade, sharp-faced tobacco-chewing
Faster Doudle, and the big Welshman Awkward Davies, still
shaken by the loss of his gun-crew.

                     higgins
           We're for hell in a hand-barrow if you
           ask my opinion

                     slade
           I'm game. If the captain says we can take
           her we can take her.

                     DAVIES
           Can we catch her is the question.
           And if we do what's different? She'll
           just hold us off with them long eighteens
           til she sends us all to the bottom. All
           for what?

                     DOUDLE
           I'll tell you for what, matey. She's a
           privateer, loaded with all the gems of
           Araby. Think of the gold. Think of the
           prize-money.

                     HOLLAR
           Hoi there! You men jump to it!

86.     WAIST OF THE SHIP - NOON

The gratings are hauled aside and light floods down into the
gun-deck.

87.     GUN-DECK - DAY

Part of a huge tree-trunk - spare timber for repairs - is
manhandled by a dozen crewmen.

                     HOLLAR
           Heave. And heave. Handsomely now. One
           long pull. Belay!

88.     QUARTERDECK - DAY

Crewmen labour at the capstan.

                     HOLLAR (O.S.)
           Two six heave! Two six heave!

The huge log rises from below and hangs suspended from its
gantry. JACK shouts down from the quarterdeck -

                     JACK
           Have her placed along the gunwale for
           now, Mr. Hollar, and the guns moved to
           that side also.

89.   ABOVE JACK'S HEAD

Men are hanging in the rigging throwing down damaged sections
of rope.

                     FASTER DOUDLE
           All clear below!

90.     QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK dodges the falling rope, moving back, past NAGEL and his
men who are cutting out damaged sections of the gunwale with
saws and adzes, prizing up decking and wrestling with the
wrecked steering mechanism.

91.     THE STERN - DAY
JACK looks down to where PULLINGS and others have lifted the
broken rudder from its hinges.

92.    WIDE SHOT - DAY

The ship swarming with men, cutting, splicing, hammering and
hauling. Every able-bodied soul hard at work.

93.    QUARTERDECK - DAY

An optimistic breeze has picked up, fluttering the tattered
ensign.

The deck is now sloping at a forty-five degree angle. KILLICK
hands a sandwich to Pullings who passes it down to JACK.

                    JACK
          Damn this wind, Mr. Pullings! The Acheron
          will be making a hundred and fifty miles
          a day in this.

                    PULLINGS
          Aye, but hugging the coast, and stopping
          to board the odd merchantman

JACK smiles at this and bites into his sandwich.

To the uphill side, carpenters are erecting a scaffolding
over the side of the ship.

94.    THE SHIP - DAY

The ship's copper-plated keel is partly revealed as the men
clamber and slip about on the steeply-sloping side erecting
scaffolding. The tropical heat resounds with shouts, curses
and hammering.

95.    SIDE OF THE SHIP - DUSK

Carpenters working inside the scaffolding, are fitting new
sections of wood into the holes low in her hull.

                    LAMB
          Down. Down. Stop.

The new piece of wood is an almost perfect fit. MR. LAMB
marks the places where it is jamming.

                      LAMB (CONT'D)
          Up again.
Then he begins to work on it with his rasp.

96.    UNDERWATER - DUSK

Among tropical fish, a diver, a Greek crewman, 'OLD
SPONGE' (father of YOUNG SPONGE) a hammer at his belt, plugs
a few smaller holes with hemp fibre, then surfaces to...

97.    THE SIDE OF THE CUTTER - DUSK

                    OLD SPONGE
              (In Greek)
          The smaller bit. No. That bit there.

YOUNG SPONGE passes him a piece of lead and some nails and
OLD SPONGE dives again.

Our P.O.V. descending into the sea as...

98.    WAIST OF THE SHIP - NIGHT

Roaring flames, flying sparks, the clang of metal on metal. A
forge has been set up. Powder-monkeys sweat on the bellows.
The ship's blacksmith is churning out iron bolts, pintles and
gudgeons, which are snatched away by NAGEL with tongs and
thrown into a bucket of water to cool.

A few yards away, wood chips fly from LAMB's adze as the
ship's massive new stern post takes shape.

The new rudder is laid out flat, already cut to its final
shape and being strengthened with great nails and iron bands
which NEHEMIAH SLADE and AWKWARD DAVIES are nailing into
place.

The hammering travels through the ship to...

99.    THE SICK BERTH - NIGHT

BLAKENEY with his splinted arm jerks awake, feverish and
confused.

                    BLAKENEY
          No. No. Not through my nose!

                    CALAMY
          Its alright. William. You were dreaming.

Blakeney looks around, disoriented and finds Calamy by his
side.
                    BLAKENEY
          Joe Plaice told me when you die they sew
          you up in your hammock with the last
          stitch through your nose... to make sure
          you're not just sleeping

                    CALAMY
          You know old Joe, always telling [ ]
          stories.

                    BLAKENEY
          Is it true though? [    ] About the last
          stitch?

                    CALAMY
          Come on, you'll be stitching me in mine
          first.

                    BLAKENEY (drifting)
          Not through my nose. You'll tell them.

                     CALAMY
              (nods)
          Nor any other part of you.

Trying to make light of it, though he fears BLAKENEY is
dying.

100.       SICK BAY, LATER - NIGHT

CALAMY has fallen asleep by BLAKENEY's side. He wakes to find
STEPHEN sniffing BLAKENEY's wound.

                    CALAMY
          Is it mending, sir?

                    STEPHEN
          No, I'm afraid it will not do.

101.        THE COCKPIT - NIGHT

BLAKENEY is lowered onto the table, delirious. CALAMY holds
his head and PADEEN, MATURIN's giant manservant, his legs,
which are lashed together.

                    BLAKENEY
          No. Mamma. Mamma.

                    STEPHEN
          It is the laudanum speaking. You will be
          a regular Nelson.

He tests the edge of his knife with his thumb.

CALAMY places the leather gag between BLAKENEY's teeth.
Padeen mumbles a Gaelic prayer. STEPHEN turns and grips
BLAKENEY shattered arm.

A sharp, grating noise as STEPHEN works out of shot, cutting
off the arm.

Close on STEPHEN, lips compressed, utterly focussed.

He puts down the bloody knife and reaches for the spatula in
the pail of hot tar.

BLAKENEY has not uttered a sound, though he is shaking
uncontrollably and his face is wet with tears. CALAMY has
tears in his eyes also.

STEPHEN finishes his work, breathing hard, a gentle smile to
BLAKENEY.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          There. I have never seen a braver
          patient.

102.        SICK-BERTH - NIGHT

An exhausted CALAMY keeps vigil by BLAKENEY's cot. The boy
wakes, and looks for CALAMY in the darkness.

                    BLAKENEY
          Peter? Is that you? I dreamed they cut my
          arm off.

Then he realizes, with sudden horror, that it wasn't a dream

                    CALAMY
          You would have died else.

Blakeneys eyes brim with tears and he turns away

                    CALAMY (CONT'D)
          Come. You can still sup your grog with
          your left. And I shall take your turn at
          marbles.

103.        MIZZEN TOPGALLANT - DAY

MOWETT stands in the cross-trees, making a final check on the
lashings round the new mizzen top. Below him the great work
is nearing completion, men swarming like ants over every part
of the hull.

MOWETT climbs down past FASTER DOUDLE who has one leg looped
through the shrouds and is splicing a rope with both hands
and his teeth.

Farther down, a patched sail is being furled up tight in its
gaskets.

Beyond that, at the base of the main-mast a fascinated group
of men have gathered to watch the Doctor trepanning JOE
PLAICE.

104.        BASE OF THE MAINMAST - DAY

STEPHEN's drill carves out a neat disc of bone to reveal a
purplish mass which he starts spooning from the cavity.

A small crowd of crewmen pause in their work, watching the
doctor with morbid fascination as he drops the purple stuff
in a dish.


                    SLADE (shouts)
          Is them his brains, Doctor?

                    STEPHEN
          No, that is just blood. These are his
          brains.

Exposing them to view. Several of the crew move in for a
closer look. The armourer hands STEPHEN a flattened coin,
which he begins to screw in place over the cavity as the old
hands whisper his praises to the men who have never seen
Stephen at work.

                    SLADE
          Physician he is, not one of your common
          surgeons.

                    FASTER DOUDLE
          Cured Prince Billy of the marthambles and
          the strong fives, wouldn't look at you
          for under ten guineas on land.

                    DAVIES
          [   ] Knows his birds and beasts too
          boyo, show him a beetle and he'll tell
          you what it's thinking.
105.           THE SURPRISE - DAY

A wind causes the ship to turn on its moorings, stirring
impatiently, like a racehorse ready to be off as...

106.           QUARTERDECK - DAY

...JACK jumps down from the mizzen ratlines.

                    JACK
          Let us be off, Mr. Allen!

                    ALLEN
          Weigh anchor! All hands to make sail. Mr
          Hollom!

107. ON DECK

Barefoot men are suddenly running to their stations, racing
above and below, running out along the bowsprit, up the
ratlines, along the yards.

A small group, supposed to be assisting Hollom, are
contrasting slow off the mark

                    HOLLOM
          Bear a hand there you fellows!

The men he is addressing, shoot him a look of distaste which
unsettles Hollom slightly, then they assist him pulling on a
rope

108.       QUARTERDECK - DAY

                    MOWETT
          Up and down Sir, thick and dry for
          weighing.

109.           WAIST OF THE SHIP - DAY

Men strain on the capstan bars.

110.           BOWS - DAY

The anchor bursting up out of the sea.

111.           MASTS OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

The shrouds darken with climbing figures, framed against the
sun.
                    HOLLAR (O.S.)
          Trice up. Lay out.
          Sheet home!
          Hoist away!

112.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

HOLLAR staring up as the sails unfurl and fill with wind.

                    HOLLAR
          Cheerly there in the foretop, our
          William!
          T'garnsl sheets!
          Hands to the braces!

Men slide down ropes from high amongst the shrouds, then
swing out and drop down to the deck like monkeys, pulling
ropes and sails tight with the weight of their bodies.

113.        WIDE SHOT - DAY

The ship spreading its wings. A sudden cracking of canvas as
she turns and runs directly downwind.

114.        QUARTERDECK - LATE AFTERNOON

The sun has sunk lower. BONDEN, solid as the rock of
Gibraltar is back at the helm, the wind stronger and directly
behind.

                    JACK
          Speed, Mr. Boyle

BOYLE heaves the log clear of the ship's side. The log line
races out on its reel. BOYLE checks the run, pulls the pin.

                    BOYLE
          Ten and a half knots, Sir.

JACK makes no comment but the news seems to please him.

115.        CLOSE TO THE WATER - DUSK

The great hull powers past us.

116.   DELETED

117.        OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK prepares toasted cheese in his small serving-area.
From inside the cabin, the sound of a violin and a cello
tuning up. KILLICK glances irritably at the door and elbows
his mate, BLACK BILL.

                    KILLICK
          Here we go again: scrape, scrape,
          screech, screech and never a tune you
          could dance to, not if you were drunk as
          Davey's sow.

118.    INSIDE THE GREAT CABIN

JACK and STEPHEN are both keen amateur musicians - JACK,
violin, STEPHEN cello.

As Stephen completes his tuning, Jack experiments with a
refrain.

                    STEPHEN
          Is that one I know, or are we breaking
          new ground?

                    JACK
          I am trying to remember that air they
          played all those years ago at the
          Governors house in Port Mahon. You
          remember When we first met.
          Corelli if I'm not mistaken.

He plays another riff

                     STEPHEN
          If that is your "A" you are very much so.
          This is A.

Jack corrects his A string, plays another few bars

                    JACK
          Or Locatelli. pom pom pom pom

                    STEPHEN
          All I remember is you being unable to sit
          in your seat the entire performance.

                    JACK
          Aye and you practising apon that poor
          bishop with your "puddings athwart the
          starboard Gumbrils" or some such arrant
          nonsense.

                    STEPHEN
              (laughs)
          No. That was off Toulon, during the
          blockade. At our first meeting they
          played this:

He plays a short refrain

                    JACK
          No. No. Entirely off the mark.   pom-pom-
          POM I have now

He plays another variation

                    STEPHEN
              (enjoying the game)
          Or was it something like this....

Cello answers violin, as they hand it back and forth,
improvising freely now with an infinity of variations,
sometimes playing together, sometimes separately, suddenly
hitting it, the music soaring and continuing over

119.        A HIGH POINT OF VIEW, TIME LAPSE - DAY

The tiny ship on the vastness of the ocean. From its side,
cotton-wool puffs of smoke.

120.        GUN-DECK - SAME TIME

A rippling broadside, the crews sweating over their guns.

                    JACK
          And pitch 'em up! It's spars and rigging
          we want!

MOWETT timing the gap between each broadside.

                    MOWETT
          Three minutes ten, Sir.

                    JACK
          Not good enough! We must fire three
          broadsides to her two. Again!

Turning to BLAKENEY, who though much recovered, still looks
pale and a little unsure of himself.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Mr. Blakeney? Think you can supervise a
          gun?
                    BLAKENEY
          As you will. Sir.

                    JACK
          'Spitfire', hop to it.

BLAKENEY takes command of the gun. To one side CALAMY is in
charge of 'Beelzebub', on the other side HOLLOM is now
directing 'Sudden Death'.

Once again the orders are given, and the crews, now competing
with each other, go through the sequence: 'Out Tompions',
'Cast loose your guns', 'Cartridge. Ball. Prime. Run out your
gun. Prime. Aim. Stand clear... Fire!!'

121.        AND AGAIN - DUSK

As another broadside shakes the deck, STEPHEN hauls his
collecting net on board and empties out a glistening array of
sea creatures - shrimps, squid and minnows, glinting like
opals in the pink light.

                    MOWETT (O.S.)
          Two minutes five, Sir.

                    PULLINGS
          Again!

122.        AND AGAIN - NIGHT

It's a race. JACK's orders are just a formality, the sequence
having become so automatic now.

                    JACK
          Out Tompions... Run out your guns...
          Prime.

Seconds ticking away on MOWETT's stopwatch, barrels float on
the sea a hundred yards out.

                    JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D)
          As she bears, from forward aft. Point
          your guns... Fire!!

123.   THE OCEAN AT NIGHT

The black ship spouting tongues of flame, the water around
the target barrels erupting in great spouts.

                    MOWETT (O.S.)
          Two minutes dead.

124.   THE GUNPOWDER ROOM

Boom! Another splendidly coordinated broadside resounds
through the ship as the powder-monkeys come racing down
through the dreadnought screens to the magazine and back with
more cartridge.

For them too it's a race, little ADDISON just ahead of SWIFT,
RYE hot on his heels.

125.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The sound of the guns is faint down here, at least when heard
from STEPHEN's perspective - his ears are stuffed with wax.

He is surrounded by his specimen bottles, and he looks from
his microscope to his ledger where he is documenting the
array of aquatic life-forms. He removes his ear-plugs, but
the noise of the guns is deafening and he hastily replaces
them.

126.        ON THE GUN-DECK - NIGHT

MOWETT watches the second hand of his stopwatch, glancing up
as he notes -

The concentrated fury of the men swabbing, ramming, heaving
in, heaving out, firing at a raft this time.

And he stops the watch as the first gun fires.

                    MOWETT
          One minute forty-nine, Sir!

His voice is drowned by the firing of the other guns in close
succession entirely demolishing the raft, the sound mixing
with cheering and the frenzied hammering of Nagel and his
mates as the gun-deck partitions are cheerfully re-erected.

127.        IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

The table is dragged back into place and settings laid for
dinner.

JACK enters, his face flushed with victory.

                    JACK
          Killick? Killick there.
KILLICK appears.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What do you have for us tonight?

                    KILLICK
          Which it's, Soused Hoggs-Face.

                    JACK
          Aah! My favorite.

128.        MAIN DECK - NIGHT

The sky a great canopy of stars, the ship racing onwards
through the warm night.

Crew men and the recovering wounded have come up on deck. Now
they sit around in groups, supping their grog. Someone
produces a jaw-harp, someone else a drum.

A guitar is passed from hand to hand, stopping with BLACK
BILL who sings a ballad in an African dialect.

There's an effortless integration of race and rank, of age
and nationality - bonds forged by battle and hardship.

OLD SPONGE gets up and dances a Greek dance: obviously a
favorite among the crew. Cheering and cat-calls. Lanterns
coming up from below. More dancing, insults in many
languages, and a song.

                    GUN-CREWS
          Boneparte Boneparte
          That red-faced son of an old French fart
          Hey ho, stamp and go
          Stamp and go, stamp and go
          Hey ho, stamp and go

129.        THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

The singing mixes with the end of a lively dinner given by
JACK for his officers, including a special guest, young
BLAKENEY.

                    PULLINGS
          With your permission, Sir, Mr. Mowett has
          composed a short poem in honour of our
          mission.

                    JACK
          Let's hear it, Mr. Mowett.

Reactions around the table, glasses re-filled in
anticipation. MOWETT stands and declaims with a number of
precise airy gestures, like a conductor.

                    MOWETT
          Our brotherhood, some old, some new.
          In blood baptized, in strength renewed.
          In purpose unified and true.
          All thoughts of home forsaken.
          Where duty leads us, there we go.
          Nor rest nor comfort shall we know.
          Until the unrepentant foe, is boarded
          sunk or taken

                    ALL
              (raising their glasses)
          Aye! Capital! Well said! Hear him, hear
          him! 'Sunk or taken'...

                    JACK
          Aye and when we do take her we shall give
          her to Tom Pullings as his first command.
          If he don't die before then. Bumpers up
          Tom

                    ALLEN
              (A toast)
          'To wives and sweethearts'.

They raise their glasses -

                    ALL
          'To wives and sweethearts'.

                    PULLINGS
          And may they never meet.

Amid the laughter someone bumps Blakeney's stump. He winces,
then puts a brave face on it

                    BLAKENEY (to JACK)
          I believe you knew Nelson, Sir?

                     JACK
          Lord Nelson? Yes. I had the honour of
          serving under him at the Nile.
               (aside)
          Mr. Mowett, the bottle stands by you,
          sir.
               (as the bottle moves on)
          In fact I dined with him twice, and he
          spoke to me on both occasions.

The table goes quiet. BLAKENEY is wide-eyed, though partly
from his strenuous efforts to appear sober.

                    JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D)
          The first time he said to me - 'May I
          trouble you for the salt, sir?' I have
          always tried to say it as close as I
          could [   ] The second time someone had
          offered him a boat-cloak on a cold night
          and he said no, he was quite warm - his
          zeal for his king and country kept him
          warm.

Amid the general agreement - 'Hear him, hear him', etc.
STEPHEN is noticeably silent.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          It sounds absurd, I know, and were it
          another man you would cry out, "Oh, what
          pitiful stuff" and dismiss it as mere
          enthusiasm, but with him you felt your
          heart glow.

                    MOWETT
              (raising his glass)
          To Lord Nelson.

                    ALL
          Lord Nelson!

[ ] Stephen joins on the toast, but JACK knows that his
friend deplores such overt patriotism and seeks to draw him
back in with a joke.

                    JACK
          You see those two weevils, Doctor?

He points at a faint movement amongst the crumbs of a ship's
biscuit.

                    STEPHEN
          I do.

                    JACK
          Which would you choose?

The table tenses with anticipation of one of the Captain's
'jokes'. STEPHEN concentrates.
                    STEPHEN
          There is not a scrap of difference. They
          are the same species of curculio.

                    JACK
          But suppose you had to choose?

                    STEPHEN
          Then I would choose the right-hand
          weevil, it has a perceptible advantage in
          both length and breadth.

                    JACK
          There I have you. You are completely
          dished. Don't you know in the Navy you
          must always choose 'the lesser of two
          weevils'?

He thunders with laughter, the rest joining in, breathless
with mirth, tears of laughter streaming down their faces

                    ALLEN
          'Pon my life. He who would pun would pick
          a pocket. Dýe not smoke it doctor?

                    STEPHEN
              (poker faced)
          Sure there would be some poor thin barren
          minds that would catch at such a paltry
          clench.

Then he too cracks a smile and joins in their laughter

130.        MAIN DECK - NIGHT

The crew continue with their own celebration.

The excitement penetrates JOE PLAICE's stupor. Never having
woken since the trepanning he suddenly opens his eyes and
speaks.

                    PLAICE
          "...And the righteous shall inherit the
          earth."

The men around him stare in amazement.

                    BONDEN
          You hear that. He said something. Joe
          spoke! Say something else Joe
                     JOE
           Handy with that gasket

                     BONDEN
               (shouts up to the quarterdeck)
           He spoke doctor. Joe plaice spoke

131. QUARTERDECK

The officers have appeared on deck with their coffee and
Stephen raises a hand in acknowledgment.

132.   IN THE RIGGING - NIGHT

Midshipmen CALAMY RYE and BOYLE are eating from a bag of
broken biscuits ('ships nuts') as they sit perched up in the
rigging.

On seeing JACK, they break into their own song.

                     MIDSHIPMEN
           Our captain was very good to us.
           He dipped his prick in phosphorus.
           It shed a light all through the night.
           And steered us through the Bosphorus.

133. QUARTERDECK

JACK pretends not to have heard, but he can't hide his smile.
Beside him in a chair sits BLAKENEY, his empty jacket sleeve
pinned to his front 'Nelson' style, laughing incredulously at
the older boys cheek.

From somewhere on the forecastle, WARLEY and his top-men
start singing.

                     TOP-MEN
           Farewell and adieu you fine Spanish
           ladies Farewell and adieu to you ladies
           of Spain...

The older midshipman, HOLLOM joins in, his fine voice soaring
effortlessly over the others, hijacking their roistering
ballad and converting it to something much more poignant.

                     HOLLOM
           For we've received orders to sail for Old
           England.
           Perhaps we shall never more see you again
His singing is appreciated by STEPHEN on the quarterdeck.

                    STEPHEN
          What a wonderfully true voice Mr. Hollom
          does possess.

134.        IN THE WAIST - NIGHT

KILLICK and NAGEL are less than impressed with HOLLOM and
sing over him, led by ORRAGE the cook.

                    ORRAGE
          Come all you thoughtless young men,
          A warning take by me,
          And never leave your happy homes
          to sail the raging sea.

135.        OCEAN - NIGHT

The Surprise sailing away from us, the chorus drifting across
the darkness.

135a.   OCEAN. DAY

The colours are changing, from the rich hues of the tropics
to the cold muted colours of colder, more southerly climes.

Still the surprise sails on

136.        THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

Fingers trace a course down the east coast of South America.
Another, more detailed chart is placed on top of the first.

                    ALLEN
          This one's by Colnett, Sir. He travelled
          with Captain Cook and carried a pair of
          Arnott's chronometers.

JACK finds their position and marks it with pencil. A knock
on the door. Officers and crew are now dressed according to
the change in climate

                    KILLICK
          Couple of the men to see you, Sir.

                    JACK
              (without looking up)
          Show them in.
The door opens to reveal NAGEL and WARLEY carrying something.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What's this?

A scale model of a ship, 15 inches long, perfect in every
detail. Jack takes it, delighted, the name picked out in gold
on the stern - Acheron.

                    NAGEL
          It were Warley's idea, Sir.

                    WARLEY
          I thought she were familiar like, then I
          remembered where I'd seen her - in
          Boston, during the Peace.

                     JACK
          [   ] In Boston?

                    WARLEY (nods)
          Yes, Sir. She's Yankee built. I seen them
          working on her, something right strange
          about her scantlings. Then I seen them
          balls bounce off her an' I got to
          thinking.

                    NAGEL
          If you look here, Sir. One side opens up.

He pulls a side off the model, exposing its construction.

                    WARLEY
          Mister Nagel here done it just like I
          seen her - a third layer 'tween the
          outer and inner ribbing - diagonal
          bracing, see?

                    JACK
          Just like the U.S. Constitution - our 12
          pounders couldn't penetrate except at
          close range.

He passes the model to ALLEN.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Killick. Killick, there.

KILLICK enters.
                    JACK (CONT'D)
          An extra ration of rum for these men,
          from my private store.

                    KILLICK
              (shaking his head)
          Which I was saving for Saluting Day, Sir.

                    JACK
          Rouse it up, Killick, and a bottle for
          Mr. ALLEN and me. Let us live whilst
          we're alive!

KILLICK goes to get the bottles

JACK hunkers down to bring his gaze level with the ship, as
though studying its tiny occupants.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          He's vulnerable here.

He taps the stern windows.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Cross her stern, rake her with a
          broadside through her length. But how to
          get close enough? Past those long
          eighteens. That's the devil of it.

136b    SURPRISE QUARTERDECK DAY

The Surprise has stopped level with a Spanish merchantman,
which lies three hundred yards away, headed in the opposite
direction.

The two boats have hove to and are communicating by
megaphone, Stephen translating the Spanish captains words,

                    STEPHEN
          He says they were chased for three days
          till they finally our-ran her. Forty gun
          French privateer headed due south.

                    JACK
          Capital. Thank him and let us be off.

The Spanish captain, already making sail, waves and shouts a
greeting, which Stephen calls back to him.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What did he say there?

                    STEPHEN
          A Spanish farewell. "May no new thing
          arrive." New things being generally by
          their nature bad.

137.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Stephen is with Blakeney, re-bandaging the younger man's
stump. Blakeney looks away, his eyes moving over the doctors
collection of books, learned texts in French Spanish, Greek
and Latin

                    BLAKENEY
          Do you have a manual of exercises sir.

                       STEPHEN
          Exercises?

                    BLAKENEY
          Physical exercises, to make the left arm
          as powerful as the right once was.

                    STEPHEN
          I think that will happen with usage, at
          least to a certain extent.

                    BLAKENEY
          But not completely. I will never be whole
          again, will I?

                    STEPHEN
          No but you will adapt to your new
          situation

          The natural world shows us any number of
          examples of how that is possible.

Blakeney bites his lip

                    BLAKENEY
          You know my father was a great fighting
          captain. It was always his expectation I
          would follow in his footsteps. I worry
          that with this arm I will now be good for
          nothing but book learning and philosophy.

                    STEPHEN
          Ah. Like me you mean.
                     BLAKENEY
               (becoming tearful)
           I cannot use a sextant, cannot tie a knot
           or climb the rigging. Cannot even dress
           myself. What chance to I have now of even
           making first lieutenant.

                      STEPHEN
           You have every chance. You hear me every
           chance. Only the other day I heard the
           captain singing your praises. Your
           courage, your fortitude in battle, your
           skill at logarithms and double elevations
           whatever they may be. And when you are
           rated lieutenant you shall have someone
           to tie your bootlaces for you. Aye and
           help you with your jacket. Here take my
           handkerchief. I believe we are summonsed
           to dinner.

139.         MAIN MAST - DAWN

The maintop captain, WARLEY, shouts to the deck, his breath
forming in the frosty air -

                     WARLEY
           Sail on the larboard bow!

140.   GREAT CABIN/LADDER

JACK throwing on a heavy boat-cloak, running for the ladder,
KILLICK behind him trying to get a scarf about JACK's neck
and a cap on his head.

141.         THE RIGGING - DAWN

Follow JACK as he runs up the ratlines, over the futtock
shrouds, then up the topmast shrouds, finally arriving at the
very top of the mast, to join WARLEY and PULLINGS.

                     JACK
           Where away?

                     PULLINGS
           Hull down, two points off the larboard
           beam.

JACK takes the telescope.

142.   TELESCOPE P.O.V.
Just the tips of masts, the hull below the horizon.

                    WARLEY (O.S.)
          She's a frigate all right, but no way of
          knowing if she be the phantom.

Beyond the distant ship, a line of black clouds.

143.        RIGGING - DAWN

JACK and PULLINGS slide to the deck on parallel back-stays,
as careless as a couple of midshipmen.

144.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

JACK shouting -

                    JACK
          Set studdingsails and top gallants. Then
          wet the sails and have the idlers placed
          along the rail.

PULLINGS and HOLLAR bark out their orders. Men race to obey.

JACK steps up on the gunwale, spying out the distant ship.
BLAKENEY, nearby, rests his telescope on CALAMY's shoulder,
focussing with his left hand.

                    BLAKENEY
          Is it him, Sir?

                    JACK
          Touch wood, Mr. Blakeney. And I fancy
          she plans to out-run us. Ask Dr. Maturin
          to join us, he loves a good chase.

BLAKENEY goes below. Above, the topmen release more sail
which is tightened by the men on deck hauling on cables.

Those not working sit on a row along the windward gunwale,
like the crew of an ocean racing yacht, to counterbalance the
pull of the sails.


145.        WEATHER-DECK - DAY

Their speed is so great green seas are now sweeping the
forecastle. A man falls and rolls into the scuppers.

                    MOWETT
          Lifelines fore and aft!

                    JACK
          Speed, Mr. Calamy?

CALAMY heaves the lead and reads the log line, then shouts
back to JACK -

                    CALAMY
          Twelve knots, Sir!

146.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Heeled over under a great press of sail, her copper showing
as she clefts the waves.

147.        FORECASTLE - DAY

Lined up along the starboard rails, the crew look back at
their captain riding the ship like a charioteer, one eye
aloft on the creaking topmost spar.

                    JEMMY DUCKS
          We're cracking on, eh?

                    FASTER DOUDLE
          We'll be cracking off presently if he
          doesn't watch it.

                    SLADE
          No, he knows this ship. He knows what she
          can take.

He touches wood, just the same and looks at Joe Plaice who
gives a meaningful roll of his eyes.

Ahead, the bank of storm clouds loom gunmetal grey.

148.        GREAT CABIN - DAY

PULLINGS knocks and enters, with an anxious looking MR. LAMB,
with whom he has been arguing a point.

                    PULLINGS
          We can just see her topsails. She's made
          her turn westwards.

                    LAMB
          I can't vouch for the mizzen Sir, not
          round Cape Horn.
                     JACK
          I'll not lose her now. Set a course
          westwards.

Both men accept this and leave.

149.        QUARTERDECK (TIMELAPSE) - DAY

The wind has increased considerably, the deck sloping like
the roof of a house, the masts bending like coach-whips.

PULLINGS and LAMB are looking up at the mizzenmast which is
making ominous creaks and groans.

                    JACK
          Mr Hollar, rig preventer backstays. Warps
          and light hawsers to the mastheads.

JACK stares ahead to the darkening sky as they move across a
switchback landscape of massive rolling waves.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Better get below, Mr. Pullings!

                       PULLINGS
          What, Sir?

                    JACK (GRINNING)
          Better get some food in you. Before it
          turns nasty.

150.        OCEAN - DAY

Wide to see the two ships. The Surprise and the Acheron with
a mile of sea between them. It's like some great ocean race,
with neither prepared to take in canvas despite the appalling
conditions.

151.        QUARTERDECK - LATER, DAY

They are running fast before a dangerous, following sea: a
landscape of hills and valleys, the whole thing in terrifying
motion.

The forecastle now vanishes in foam with every plunge, rising
each time with water pouring over the waist and spouting from
her scuppers.

KILLICK comes up with the coffee pot inside his jacket. JACK
drinks from the spout, peering ahead into the murk. A wild
unruly part of him is loving this.

Above him, more top-men struggle up the rigging, with the
mast drawing crazy figure of eights on a rushing sky.

152.   BELOW DECKS

The dog watch are wolfing their food, mugs and dinner plates
sliding over the table. Crewmen walk up hill to the grog
barrel, down their ration and head up top again.

                     HIGGINS
           You reckon Captain will keep chasing him
           'round the Horn with every stitch of
           canvas flying?

                     DAVIES
           I reckon he'd chase him to the gates of
           hell if he has to.

                     PLAICE
           And that's where we're all going if he
           doesn't take in sail.

Since his injury, Joe Plaice's startlingly random
pronouncements have acquired the quality of an oracle.

153.   ON DECK

The wind rising from yell to shriek. Waves blown flat by it,
the ship travelling at a drunken sideways angle across a
raging expanse of white foam.

Four men on the wheel, lashed to it, with the air around them
full of water.

In the distance a tower of black rock on the rim of the sea,
distant rollers breaking against it and surging up to a
preposterous height.

JACK looks up at the great press of canvas as he paces the
quarterdeck, the officers glancing from the sails back to
JACK.

                     JACK
           Strike the topgallants.

Men gratefully rush to the ratlines and begin climbing to the
masts.

STEPHEN staggers up onto deck. JACK calls to him, pointing at
the black rock.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Cape Horn, Doctor!

STEPHEN stares across at the legendary Cape. He's struggling
with his pocket-glass when a lurch of the ship sends him
tumbling. As men help him below, WARLEY, the maintop captain
reports to the bosun.

                    HOLLAR (to WARLEY)
          Help them with that mizzen topgallant!
          You go too, Mr. Hollom!

HOLLOM looks desperate as he follows WARLEY up the ratlines
of the mizzen.

154.   MIZZEN TOPgallant MAST

WARLEY works frantically. He's out on the yardarm high above
the raging sea. He shouts for HOLLOM to join him, but HOLLOM
is still in the top, some twenty feet below, unable or
unwilling to climb any higher.

155.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Wide to see the ship. WARLEY working on the swaying mizzen.
The bow swinging a couple of points further south.

156.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

Wood and rope straining as they wrestle to turn. Then a
tremendous crack as the mizzen-topmast splits and flies
backward into the sea, carrying WARLEY along with it.

                    BONDEN
          Man overboard!

Sail and cordage falling over the men at the wheel. A loose
block and tackle swinging murderously in the gale.

JACK fights free from the tangle of ropes as WARLEY vanishes
in the foam. The mizzenmast is acting as a sea-anchor
dragging the ship's head northwards toward the black rocks.

JACK grabs a speaking-trumpet as WARLEY briefly reappears.

                    JACK
          Swim for the wreckage, man!

Then to PULLINGS.
                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Reduce sail!

As crewmen scramble frantically into the rigging, JACK turns
back to see WARLEY desperately swimming toward the trailing
wreckage, his mates shouting encouragement over the howling
wind.

With sails reduced the ship perceptibly slows, but the
dragging wreckage is swinging the ship broadside on to the
waves.

                    BONDEN
          She's broaching!

PULLINGS runs to JACK, pointing to the trailing mass of ropes
and mast.

                    PULLINGS
          It's acting as a sea-anchor! We must cut
          it loose, Sir!

WARLEY still struggling to reach the wreckage but going under
with each wave. JACK, agonized, makes his decision.

                    JACK
          Axes!

AWKWARD DAVIES scrambles up the ladder with an axe, but loses
his footing and falls sprawling over the quarterdeck.

JACK grabs the axe and attacks the ropes. He's joined by
NAGEL who has run to assist before realizing that the man
overboard is his friend Warley.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Set to then. Set to!!

NAGEL's face is a mask of horror, but he obeys Jacks orders
and starts chopping. He and Jack work shoulder to shoulder,
matching blow for blow [   ]

The prow keeps turning, wave after wave coming at right
angles to the ship.

157.        ON THE GUN-DECK - DAY

A hatch cover is torn off by the force of water, a sudden
mighty deluge pouring down into the lower levels drenching
the men and swamping the guns.
                    HOLLAR (yells below)
          All hands to the pumps!

158.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK and NAGEL [   ] keep hacking at the tangle of ropes.
Knocking chips off the railing in their urgency to cut free
the dragging mast.

Finally they succeed. The last of the ropes [ ] whips away,
the broken mizzen disappears aft and the ship swings
southward, away from the rocks.

The wreckage is swept away by the next wave, leaving WARLEY
struggling, his last chance of getting back to the ship gone.

Then another wave breaks over him and he is gone.

NAGEL is bereft. JACK lowers his head.

159.        OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK and BLACK BILL.

                    KILLICK
          He's been at it again.

                    BLACK BILL
          Who's that then?

                       KILLICK
          The Jonah.

                    BLACK BILL
          What Jonah?

160.        THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

JACK sits at his desk. The model of the Acheron that WARLEY
helped make sits accusingly in front of him.

STEPHEN pours him a glass on wine, and one for himself.

                     STEPHEN
          The deaths in actual battle are the
          easiest.
              (beat)
          For my own part - those who die under the
          knife or from some consequent infection:
          I have to remind myself that it is the
          enemy who killed them, and not me.
              (beat)
          Warley was a casualty of war, as surely
          as if a French ball had taken him.

JACK nods. Obviously the death still weighs on his
conscience. [ ]

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
              (offering the wine)
          At the same time....

He breaks off

                    Jack
          At the same time, what?

Stephen hesitates, aware that he has to proceed carefully

                    STEPHEN
          You know that I wear two hats on every
          voyage. I am the captains particular
          friend and supporter, but also I am the
          ships doctor in which later capacity I am
          party to....

He catches a steely glint in Jacks eye and breaks off.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

                    You don't want me to continue.

                    JACK
              (stiffly)
          On the contrary. I insist on it.

                    STEPHEN
          There is talk below decks of turning
          back. Or rather that we should have
          turned back some weeks ago. Of course the
          men would follow "Lucky Jack" anywhere,
          and usually in the confident expectation
          of victory. But that of course is the
          problem.

                    JACK
          What is the problem?

                    STEPHEN
          That you are not accustomed to defeat
          Jack. That you have taken it too
          personally. That chasing this larger,
          faster ship, with its long guns, is
          beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth
          before destruction'?

                    JACK
          It's not pride nor anything like it, it's
          a question of duty.

                    STEPHEN
          'Duty', ah yes. The naval signal for end
          of discussion.

                    JACK
          You can be as 'satiric' as you like,
          Stephen, but I have my orders. She is
          attacking our whalers. For why? Without
          whales we have no boot polish, nor any
          soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil
          our sabres and muskets. Destroying our
          whalers could win the war for Napoleon.
          Which is why we must catch this Acheron.
          As a man of learning surely you can see
          that.

                    STEPHEN
          At whatever the cost?

                     JACK
          Any whatever cost I choose to pay. And I
          will calculate that myself, Stephen
          without reference to your friends in the
          ward room.

160A MIZZEN-TOP

An icy wind whips at the men working on the temporary mizzen
mast.

Hollom, half way up the rigging is relaying instructions
between the men in the rigging and the men on deck

                      HOLLOM
          Cast off.

The new yard flails around on its pulley, bashing dangerously
against the mast. Almost claiming Nagel

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)
          Belay. Sorry. Sorry.
161    QUARTERDECK

PULLING craning upwards. The topmen's shouted commands are
whipped away by the gale.

JACK joins him, still smarting from the conversation with
Stephen

                    JACK
          We'll have to go further south, get
          around this bloody west wind.

                    PULLINGS
          How far south?

                    JACK
          As far as is necessary, Mr. Pullings. The
          sixtieth parallel if need be.

162.        THE SHIP - DAY

Tacking southwards. The sun, a pale anaemic disc, gradually
disappearing behind layers of cloud.

The wind is a constant shrill whistle through the rigging, a
sound like some infernal drill which rises and falls but
never ceases.

                                                DISSOLVE TO -

163.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

The sun rising in a clear sky which turns a sapphire blue.
White ice-islands lie all around them, some a pure, rosy
pink. Others bright ultramarine.

And still the wind howls, driving them further south.

MOWETT passes his telescope to STEPHEN MATURIN. As STEPHEN
studies some seals on an ice-beach, MOWETT launches into
verse, shouting against the wind -

                     MOWETT
          Then we upon the globes last verge shall
          go to view the ocean leaning on the sky
          from thence our rolling neighbours we
          shall know
          and on the hidden world securely pry!

He is interrupted by a bundle of guns clattering on board
from one of the small boats. They are followed by Mr Howard
clad in several thicknesses of sealskin and carrying a brace
of dead penguin.

164.   THE SHIP AT NIGHT

The ship scudding onwards, soundless at this distance, but
for the chilling high pitched whistle of the wind.

An iceberg passes in foreground, fantastic shapes of ice,
like a Gothic cathedral, sculpted by the elements.

165.         BERTH DECK - NIGHT

Hanging stoves provide some feeble warmth. Men huddle close
to them, their breath condensing, or lie shivering in their
bunks, unable to sleep for the cold.

HOLLAR appears with a lantern.

                     HOLLAR
           Rise and shine! Show a leg there, tumble
           up, tumble up - sleepers awake!

As the previous watch arrive downstairs, numb and dazed from
the cold, the next watch emerge from their hammocks and
dress. No-one speaks.

166.         THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

The officers take their places at dinner. Once again it's
penguin stew.

PULLINGS comes in, with an unexpected smile on his face and
whispers something to JACK.

                     JACK
           Praise be. At last.

The others seem to know what's going on, all except STEPHEN
who looks baffled.

                     STEPHEN
           Pray what is there to celebrate?

JACK holds up his hand for silence. A series of creaks and
groans from the ship. The coffee pot tilts on its gimbals.

                     JACK
           We have made our turn northward, Doctor.
           We are headed back toward the sun...
The officers give a slightly ragged cheer.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          ...in anticipation of which. I asked
          Killick to prepare something special.
              (shouts off)
          Killick. Killick there.

KILLICK comes in with his usual exasperated expression,
bearing a tray with a silver tureen lid on it.

                    KILLICK
          Which I was just coming.

He lays it on the table.

                    JACK
          Gentlemen, I give you... our destination.

He whips off the lid to reveal a strange glutinous mass, a
pudding cut in the oddest of shapes. Everyone stands to get a
better look.

                    STEPHEN
          The Galapagos Islands.

                    PULLINGS
          'Pon my word so it is. Look: here's
          Narborough, Chatham and Hood...

                     JACK
          That's where the whalers are, ain't it Mr
          Allen. So that's where the Acheron will
          be headed.

The mood is now taken over by the glee of recognition, as the
officers marvel over the pudding.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Mr. Pullings, if you'll permit me, a
          slice of Albermale. For you Doctor,
          Redondo Rock.

There's a tiny man-of-war made of icing, between the islands.
JACK picks it up in his spoon.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          And, with a fair wind behind us the
          Acheron for me.
167.        OPEN OCEAN, DOLDRUMS - DAY

Slow pan over a glassy expanse of water. JACK's head suddenly
breaks the surface, close to camera.

As he swims he brings the Surprise into view. The ship is
utterly becalmed, wallowing in the swell, her sails hanging
limp. A 'painted ship upon a painted ocean'.

JACK swims around the ship, which currently presents a less
than warlike picture with washing hanging from every part of
the rigging.

He calls up to PULLINGS -

                    JACK
          Best bowers chipped... Lot of rust on
          these forechains... black strake needs
          another coat.

168.   QUARTERDECK

JACK comes aboard, takes a towel from KILLICK and looks about
him.

The men are holystoning the deck and polishing the
brightwork. They look thin and exhausted and burnt dark-brown
by the sun and wind.

169.   FORECASTLE

Killick is with NAGEL and others tarring the ratlines as he
looks back at HOLLOM, patrolling the gangway.

KILLICK indicates him with a tilt of the head.

                    KILLICK
          That engagement off Recife: his whole gun
          crew killed and him not a mark on him.
          Soon as he went up the mizzen mast Warley
          falls. And whose watch was it when we
          lost our wind?

HOLLOM sees them looking at him.

170.        THE SCUTTLEBUTT, SHIP'S WAIST - DAY

A marine sentry, TROLLOPE, stands guard by the ship's water-
barrel - the level is very low. STEPHEN ladles some water
into a phial.
                     TROLLOPE
           One glass per man, sir, Captain's orders.

STEPHEN straightening, irritated by the challenge.

                     STEPHEN
           A mere thimbleful, Corporal, for
           scientific purposes only.

171.         STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAY

In the gloom of his cabin, STEPHEN angles the mirror of his
brass microscope toward the window, and places a slide
containing a droplet of water under the lens.

172.         MAINMAST-TOP - DAY

JACK climbs into the top. He adjusts his telescope, studies
the horizon.

173.   JACK'S TELESCOPE P.O.V.

He pans across the empty sea.

174.   STEPHEN'S MICROSCOPE P.O.V.

An assortment of mobile, transparent micro-organisms rotating
wildly.

                     STEPHEN (O.S.)
           My God, Padeen, a veritable zoo.

PADEEN takes a look, amazed then greatly amused.

175.         THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

Charts are spread all over the table, STEPHEN poring over
them when Jack comes in

                     [   ]

                     STEPHEN
           Show me where these Doldrums lie?

JACK joins him.

                     JACK
           Stephen. Will we never make a sailor of
           you? The doldrums is a condition, not a
           region. But you tend to strike 'em
          here...
              (pointing)
          ...between the trades, and the
          sou'easterlies. I hope the Acheron is
          having it as bad as we are.

STEPHEN considers their current position on the chart, the
tiny Galapagos Islands to the north and the vast emptiness to
the west of them.

                    STEPHEN
          Assuming he is heading for the Galapagos,
          and not some other point in all this
          vastness?

                    JACK
          Come. I'd have thought you'd be delighted
          to go there. It is said to be a natural
          paradise

                    STEPHEN
          In truth I'd be delighted with the merest
          guano stained rock provided it didn't
          sway beneath my feet

                    JACK
          Well, we'll take on food and water once
          we're there, and as compensation for not
          having put ashore in Brazil I pledge that
          during that time, several days at least,
          you can wander at will, catching bugs and
          beetles to your heart's delight. You will
          be the first naturalist to set foot on
          the islands. That is my solemn promise

                    STEPHEN
          I accept, provided the men have not
          mutinied and thrown us all overboard
          before we get there.

                    JACK
          Mutiny? No. They are already counting
          their share of the prize money.

                    STEPHEN
          Another week of this and they shall
          gladly give it up for a glass of clean
          water.

                    JACK
          Ach, Stephen. Stephen. Pray stop your
          bellyacheing. We shall have rain
          presently, and if not we shall damned
          well tow ourselves out of this.

176.        JOLLY BOAT - DAY

Disgruntled, under-slept men, in boats towing the ship.

NAGEL and DAVIES look back darkly at HOLLOM who sits in the
stern.

                    HOLLOM
          Stroke. Stroke...

                    DAVIES (whispers)
          I heard he were on the Fair Marion as
          foundered off Tresco. And he were on the
          Zephyrus what exploded at Trafalgar.

HOLLOM has heard this, as DAVIES intended, but he looks away
choosing to ignore them.

177.        FIGHTING TOP - DAY

A view from above of men towing the ship. Over this an
unpleasant scraping sound - chalk on slate.

                    BONDEN
          M-a-s-t... mast

STEPHEN is writing words on a slate then offering them to
BONDEN whom he is teaching to read.

                    BONDEN (CONT'D)
          S-u-n... sun

STEPHEN nods and scratches another word on the board. As
BONDEN struggles to decipher it there's the sound of a musket
shot and a seabird falls out of the sky.

HOWARD, the captain of marines, reloads his smoking musket
laughing aloud.

                    STEPHEN
          Is that man completely mad?
              (shouts down)
          Mr. Howard, a petrel is not good eating!

HOWARD looks up towards them, a broad smile on his red moon
of a face.

                    HOWARD
          Were you never a man for sporting,
          Doctor? Why you could shoot all day in
          these waters with two men loading!

178.        GUN-DECK - DAY

The midshipmen and powder-monkeys have assembled for weapons
practise, armed with cutlasses. CALAMY and WILLIAMSON divide
the group into two teams, choosing sides as for school-yard
football.

                    CALAMY
          Blakeney...

                      WILLIAMSON
          Rye...

                      CALAMY
          Swift...

                      WILLIAMSON
          Boyle...

                    CALAMY
              (the final choice)
          All right, come on Addison.

Little ADDISON joins CALAMY's side, trailing his too-large
sword. WILLIAMSON tosses a coin.

                      CALAMY (CONT'D)
          Heads.

                    WILLIAMSON
          It's tails. We attack.

CALAMY's side retire to a defensive position made of tar
barrels at one end of the deck. From here they are suddenly
aware of Jack idly watching their mock-fight from the
quarter-deck

WILLIAMSON's team give a yell and charge at them.

It's serious fighting. Heads are struck, fingers are rapped.
BLAKENEY, trying gamely with his left arm but frustrated by
his own ineptitude, goes down under the rush of attackers.

                      BLAKENEY
          Ow ow ow!

                      WILLIAMSON
          Yield.

                    CALAMY
          Let go of him.

                    WILLIAMSON
          Yield!!

CALAMY can't drag the bigger boy off. He whips a pistol out
of his belt and fires it at WILLIAMSON's head.

WILLIAMSON is blasted sideways, clutching his face and
yelling in pain. The other boys separate, horrified.

                    CALAMY
          It's just powder. There wasn't a ball in
          it, just powder.

He helps BLAKENEY to his feet.

                    CALAMY (CONT'D)
          Are you all right?

                    BLAKENEY
          No.

Angrily shaking free of him, he looks to where Jack stood,
but the captain is no longer watching.

                    CALAMY
          What's wrong? I saved you.

                    BLAKENEY
          I didn't need to be saved.

179.        ON DECK - DAY

Tar bubbling under the heat of the sun. Cannons fizzing and
steaming as they are washed.

There's been a change of crews in the long-boats, and HOLLOM
and his men are now back on board. NAGEL is approaching from
one end of the narrow gang-way, HOLLOM from the other. NAGEL
pushes past, deliberately bumping HOLLOM, who stumbles,
clutching for the gunwale.

180.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK sees this outrageous act of indiscipline and yells out -

                    JACK
          Master at arms! Take that man below and
          clap him in irons. Mr. Pullings,
          defaulters at six bells.

181.        THE GREAT CABIN, DOLDRUMS - DAY

JACK stands behind his desk, brow like thunder. From outside
the sounds of the muster. HOLLOM stands in front of him,
twisting his hat between his hands.

                    JACK
          The man pushed past you without making
          his obedience. And yet you said nothing.

                    HOLLOM
          No, Sir, I intended to but the right
          words just didn't...

                    JACK
          'The right words'? He failed to salute
          you. It's deliberate insubordination.

HOLLOM looks at the floor, mumbles -

                    HOLLOM
          They don't like me, Sir.

                    JACK
          They what? Speak up, man!

HOLLOM raises his head and looks at JACK, his eyes shiny with
tears and when he opens his mouth the words tumble out in a
rush.

                    HOLLOM
          I've tried to get to know the men a bit,
          Sir, be friendly like, but they've taken
          a set against me. Always whispering when
          I go past, giving me looks. But, I'll set
          that to rights, be tougher on them from
          now on.

                    JACK
          You can't make 'friends' with the
          foremast jacks, they'll despise you in
          the end. Nor do you need be a tyrant.
          It's leadership they want, strength,
          respect.

                    HOLLOM
          I'm very sorry, Sir.
                    JACK
          You're what twenty-three, twenty-four?

                    HOLLOM
              (smiling weakly)
          Twenty-five next Friday.

                    JACK
          You've failed to pass for lieutenant
          twice. You can't spend the rest of your
          life as a midshipman.

                    HOLLOM
          I'll try harder, Sir.

KILLICK helps JACK on with his full-dress uniform.

                    JACK
          Well, it's an unfortunate business,
          Hollom. Damned unfortunate.

KILLICK seems to endorse this by placing the captain's hat
emphatically on JACK's head.

Jack turns and strides out of the cabin, HOLLOM following
slowly after him.

182.        QUARTERDECK, DOLDRUMS - DAY

The entire crew has been mustered. The uniformed officers
line the quarterdeck as JACK reads from the Articles of War.

                    JACK
          'Article Thirty-Six. All other crimes not
          capital, committed by any person or
          persons in the fleet... shall be punished
          according to the laws, and customs, of
          the sea.'
              (then, to NAGEL)
          Mr. Nagel, you're an old man-of-war's man
          and yet you failed to salute an officer.
          You knew what you were doing. Have you
          anything to say in your defence?

NAGEL looks at the deck.

                     NAGEL
          No, Sir.

                     JACK
          Have his officers anything to say for
          him?

DAVIES and KILLICK scowl across the deck at HOLLOM, who looks
wretched but says nothing.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Seize him up.

NAGEL is spread-eagled to the grating, his hands tied.

                    HOLLAR
          Seized up, Sir.

                    JACK
          One dozen. Bosun's mate, do your duty.

The mate takes the leather cat-o-nine tails out of its red
bag.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                                                   FADE UP ON -

183.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

JACK stands alone, tuning his fiddle. No matter how much he
turns the peg the top string always sounds flat. He tunes
some more and breaks it.

                    JACK
          Red hell...

184.        QUARTERDECK - DUSK

                    JACK (O.S.)
          ...and bloody death!

Every word is plainly audible to the men on watch, who
pretend to hear nothing.

185.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

JACK is fitting a new string. Widen to reveal STEPHEN sitting
opposite with his cello.

                    STEPHEN
          I was merely remarking that you have
          always prided yourself on not being a
          flogging captain and this...
                    JACK
          I am not a "flogging captain". I have not
          once rigged the grating on this voyage,
          not once in twelve thousand miles.
          Besides, I wager you will find a deal
          more brutality on land.

Tightening the new string. The note escalating as he turns.

                    STEPHEN
          I'm not a party to it on land.

                    JACK
          Well you are party to it on my ship.
          Men must be governed. Often not wisely I
          grant you, but there are hierarchies even
          in nature, as you've often said yourself.

                    STEPHEN
          Hierarchies. That is the excuse of every
          tyrant in history. Of Nero. Of Boneparte.

                    JACK
              (trying to call a halt)
          Yes. Fine words I'm sure

                    STEPHEN
              (continues regardless)
          ...We are not animals and I for one am
          opposed to authority, that egg of misery
          and oppression..

                    JACK
          Very fine words Stephen, but In these
          current circumstances, hard-work and firm
          discipline is what keeps our little
          wooden world together.

                    STEPHEN
          And grog I suppose.

                            JACK
          Of course. What of it? Of course they
          have their grog!

                    STEPHEN (sits) (CONT'D)
          You know Nagel was drunk when he insulted
          Hollom. And Higgins is never sober. Even
          the midshipmen...

                    JACK
          The men will have their grog Stephen. It
          is part of the immemorial tradition of
          the service

                    STEPHEN
          Well a shameful tradition it is too. To
          have them pressed from their homes, kept
          in a permanent state of dull inebriation.

                       JACK
          Stephen...

                    STEPHEN
          ...confined for months in a wooden
          prison, Never more than a few hours sleep
          and flogged when drunken idleness drives
          them to....

                     JACK (forcefully)
          ...Stephen! I warn you that friend or no
          I will not have you talk of the service
          like that.

                    STEPHEN
          I am stating plain facts

                    JACK
              (finally explodes)
          Well I will not hear them! From you or
          anyone. You understand! Things are as
          they are for good or bad whether or not
          they have a place in your damned papist
          philosophy. If you are here to make music
          then sit down and play. If not be gone,
          for you have come
          to the wrong shop for anarchy!

In stony silence Stephen puts down his cello bow and leaves
past Killick, who is lurking as always by the door.

186.        SCUTTLEBUTT - DUSK

Something disturbs the dark surface of the water as HOLLOM
dips the ladle and fills his cup.

A sense of someone moving up behind him. HOLLOM turns
abruptly. It's the marine sentry, moving in the shadows. He
stares at HOLLOM as he backs away toward the ladder and
hurries below.

187.        BERTH DECK - DUSK
To reach his quarters he is obliged to walk the length of the
berth deck, past HOWARD obsessively cleaning his pistol,
another man whittling with a knife, DAVIES adding another
link in the tattooed chain about BECKETT's middle.

No-one speaks as HOLLOM runs the gauntlet of their stares,
acutely aware of his own breathing. It now seems universally
to be held that he is the author of all the ship's
misfortune.

Nagle pointedly turns his back, the scars from the flogging
gleaming wetly in the lamplight

Hollom's breath quickens. He stumbles on someone's dunnage,
almost trips but is caught before he falls. It's one of
NAGEL's mates.

                    NAGEL's MATE
          Careful, sir.

188.        MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - DUSK

HOLLOM comes in, wild-eyed and goes to his berth, breathing
hard. CALAMY, BLAKENEY & BOYLE look up from a tense game of
cards.

                    BLAKENEY
          Are you all right, Hollom?

HOLLOM shakes his head miserably, hyperventilating.

                    CALAMY
          He's not sick. He's useless. He's just
          dodging work.

                    BLAKENEY (angrily)
          Oh shut up Calamay. What do you know
          about anything?

CALAMY glares at BLAKENEY.

189.   INT STEPHEN'S ROOM - DUSK

A shot from the deck above.

STEPHEN looks up from his book "Di Consolazione Philosophae".
Then the sound of bare feet approaching, followed by a knock
at the door.

Its Joe Plaice, looking agitated.
                    PLAICE
          Beg your pardon, your honour, but Mr.
          Howard just shot a sea-monster!

190.        GANGWAY - DUSK

STEPHEN and PLAICE stride along to where the marine captain,
HOWARD, peers down into the water with one of his men.

                    HOWARD
          Doctor! The very man.

STEPHEN moves to the rail, looks out.

                    HOWARD (CONT'D)
          [   ] I wished you'd seen it for
          yourself, Doctor. The crew never seen
          anything like it.

On the glassy sea, a smudge of blood and some ripples

                    HOWARD (CONT'D)
          It was prodigious like a human, though
          bigger, might have been a sea-elephant,
          it had a calf with it - I didn't mean to
          hit the calf, I missed my mark.

                    STEPHEN
          Mr. Howard, let me beg you, if the men
          can't eat it or I can't dissect it,
          please do not shoot every creature you
          see.

STEPHEN stares back down at the ripples spreading over the
glassy sea.

191.        THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Wide, on the troubled ship, small yellow patches of light
visible from the gun-ports.

192.        BELOW DECKS - NIGHT

The men are lying in their hammocks when, from somewhere
outside, there comes an ungodly howling. It stops, then comes
again, exactly human in its pitch.

The crew look at one another. This is like no sound they've
ever heard.
The howling stops then comes again, from another direction.

193.          THE GREAT CABIN, EXTERIOR - NIGHT

KILLICK and BLACK BILLY listening.

                    KILLICK
          What did I tell you? The ship's accursed.

194.          QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

JACK comes up from below.

                    JACK
          What is that abominable noise, for God's
          sake?

                    PULLINGS
          I have no idea, Sir.

                    MOWETT
          You don't think it's the Acheron, Sir?

                    JACK
              (untypically cutting)
          The enemy cannot come on us without a
          wind, Mr. Mowett.

He looks about at the terrified faces of the crew. The
wailing sound now rises to a shriek, as STEPHEN joins the
group.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What do you make of it, Doctor?

                    STEPHEN
          I'm sure I've never heard the like.

The crew overhear this and pass it among themselves as
another anguished howl fills the night.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Perhaps it's the mother of the creature
          Mr. Howard shot.

                     JACK
          [    ] Creature?

                    STEPHEN
          [ ] A manatee. A sea-elephant possibly.
          Though I have never known one with a cry
          like this.

A glance along at HOWARD on the gangway, as terrified as
anyone.

                    JACK
          Bosun. Fire off some flares.

195.        WIDE ON THE SHIP - NIGHT

Three flares soar and burst with a ghostly glow, making a
pool of blue light around the ship, the sound continuing to
echo and re-echo from somewhere beyond.

196.        QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

The light illuminates the half-hour glass, its top-half empty
of sand. Like everyone else, the duty sergeant stands frozen
to the spot. Jack rounds on him.

                    JACK
          Sergeant, what the devil are you thinking
          of? Turn the glass and strike the bell.

Roused, the duty sergeant turns the glass and time resumes
its flow.

Two bells are hesitantly rung and the crew regain the power
of motion, their limbs still spastic with fear. And when the
sound comes once more they all freeze.

JACK joins MOWETT at the taffrail. The thing is somewhere out
there, whatever it is.

                    MOWETT
          Perhaps some poor shipwreck?

He shouts, a slight nervous catch to his voice.

                    MOWETT (CONT'D)
          Ahoy! Is anyone there?

Part of him knows it's crazy and of course there's no reply.
The sound constantly shifting position, now in the water, now
in the sky.

JACK turns to see a white face, frighteningly close to his
own. It's PADEEN, mouth agape, face unnaturally white,
staring into the gloom as though drawn to whatever horror
lies out there.
                    JACK
          Padeen. What are you doing on the
          quarterdeck?

He looks down at the press of men who have gathered at the
bottom of the ladder, some with weapons.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Below! All of you men below!
              (to MOWETT)
          Tell the bosun those off-duty may sleep
          with their lamps on.

197.        LOWER DECK - NIGHT

Several crewmen huddle close together their faces lit by a
battle-lantern. Joe Plaice grim. Doudle wide-eyed. Higgins
with his alcoholic tremor more pronounced than ever.

                    BLACK BILL
          Duppies make that noise.

                    KILLICK (indicating BILL)
          See. They know all about this in Africa.

                    DOUDLE
          What's a duppie?

                    BLACK BILL
          That Warley. Swallow by a fish. Spirit
          can't get out. Him duppie now.

                    SLADE
          Captain don't even know what that noise
          be.

General nods of agreement.

                    DOUDLE
          Doctor neither, and he knows everything.

                    KILLICK
          Joe here's got the most experience in
          these matters, and new brains to boot,
          let's hear it from Joe.

All eyes on JOE PLAICE. He speaks from the shadows.

                    PLAICE
          It's the Jonah causing it. That howling
          thing is a signal to the Phantom-Ship.
          He's calling it up, don't you see? Every
          time he's on watch the ship appears. You
          wait and see, the ghost-ship will appear
          any time tonight, and take us all
          straight to the hot-place.

Another shriek, closer now, seems to confirm JOE's bizarre
theory.

198.        MIDSHIPMEN'S BERTH - NIGHT

The boys sit together. None of them look at HOLLOM, who sits
pale and wretched in a corner of the room, clutching his
stomach.

199.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

As the howling continues, STEPHEN looks through a number of
books on sea-creatures searching for a reference to what
they're experiencing.

As JACK looks over his shoulder, his eye is caught by a
picture in one of STEPHEN's books.

He picks it up.

Close on the picture - it's an engraving of a giant squid,
its tentacles wrapped around a ship.

Back on JACK holding the picture up to STEPHEN.

                    JACK
          You don't think...?

There is a knock on the cabin door and BLAKENEY enters,
agitated.

                    BLAKENEY (to STEPHEN)
          It's Mr. Hollom, sir, you better come
          quick.

200.   MIDSHIPMEN'S BERTH

HOLLOM writhing in agony on the floor, STEPHEN trying to calm
him, shouting for assistance from the midshipmen and then
from PADEEN.

                    STEPHEN
          Mr Hollom. Sir. Try to contain yourself.
          Hold his head. Mr Hollom. Padeen
201.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT.

Stephen is writing some case notes in his journal, when Jack
puts his head around the door.

Stephens POV: The lamp, lighting his face from below and to
one side, gives a strange lopsided twist to Jacks smile

                    JACK
          Well?

                    STEPHEN
          There's nothing physically wrong with
          him. He thinks he's been cursed by the
          0men.

                    JACK
          Then he probably has been. Sailors will
          abide a great deal, but never a Jonah.
          It's like a white crow - the others peck
          it to death.

                    STEPHEN
          A 'Jonah'? My God, you believe it too.

                    JACK
          I desired to save you the trouble of
          looking for a cure. No doubt it will all
          be sorted by the morning.


202      FORECASTLE, LATER - NIGHT

BLAKENEY stands near the bows peering out into the night. A
figure approaches from behind and lays a hand in his
shoulder.

BLAKENEY nearly jumps out of his skin.

                    BLAKENEY
          Mr. Hollom! You gave me such a start. Are
          you better now?

HOLLOM's breathing does indeed seem easier.

                    HOLLOM
          Much better, thank you.

                    BLAKENEY
          I think the creature is going away.
                    HOLLOM
          I am sure of it.

He reaches down, picks up a 12 pound cannonball.

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)
          You've always been very kind to me.
          Goodbye, Blakeney.

With a sudden movement he's on the gunwale, then he jumps
over the side the cannonball in his arms.

BLAKENEY looks down with shock to see HOLLOM's pale face
receding from him into the depths. It's a moment before he
gathers his wits to shout -

                    BLAKENEY
          Man overboard!

203.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

The ship's company are mustered on deck. JACK stands at the
sword rack lectern. KILLICK hands him a Bible open at the
story of Jonah.

JACK looks, then hands it back to KILLICK.

                    JACK
          The fact is, [   ] not all of us become
          the men we once hoped we might be. But we
          are all God's creatures. If some of us
          thought ill of Mr. Hollom, or spoke ill
          of him, or failed him in respect of
          fellowship, then we ask your forgiveness,
          Lord, and we ask for his.

Close on the faces of the crew - KILLICK, HIGGINS, NAGEL,
CALAMY, BLAKENEY and finally Stephen who is staring oddly at
Jack, as though holding him partly responsible for this
latest tragedy.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Amen.

                    CREW (mumble ashamedly)
          Amen.

The men on deck remain standing, heads bowed, observing a
minute's silence, as the sky begins to pale, and the white
disc of the sun appears above them.
FASTER DOUDLE is the first to look up, followed by others -
the terrible sound has gone and a small puff of wind is
stirring the mainsail.

204. HOUR GLASS

The sand runs out of the half-hour glass.

                    BONDEN
          Strike eight bells.

                    QUARTERMASTER (to the marine sentry)
          Turn the glass and strike the bell.

The glass is inverted. The bell tolls.

205.        SURPRISE AT SEA - DAY

The ship moves through a tropical squall. Men rig a sail to
catch the water, others appear with barrels and tubs,
anything to catch the precious rain.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO -

206.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Sea birds swarming over a shoal of fish in the foreground as
the cry of the distant lookout carries faintly across the
sea.

                     LOOKOUT (O.S.)
          Land-ho!

207.        GANGWAY - DAY

BLAKENEY runs along the gangway, past STEPHEN, en route to
the quarterdeck.

                     BLAKENEY
          Give you joy, sir! We have raised the
          Galapagos!

208.     MONTAGE oF TELESCOPE VIEWS, GALAPAGOS - DAY

There's a primeval quality to the landscape, a feeling of a
world just born. The wild creatures that inhabit the lava
flows and coral beaches confirm this - the giant tortoises,
iguanas, sea-lions and penguins, a teeming profusion of
exotic animals and plants.
209.        QUARTERDECK/FORECASTLE/TOPS - DAY

The ship fairly bristles with telescopes.

210.   FORECASTLE

A small group of familiar faces share a pocket telescope.

                    HIGGINS (looking)
          Can't see any wimmun. Just lots of ducks
          and lizards.

DOUDLE takes the telescope.

                    DOUDLE
          Wot? There must be wimmun. T'ain't
          natural.

211.   QUARTERDECK

STEPHEN and BLAKENEY side by side. From both their faces we
sense their wonder at seeing these remarkable creatures for
the first time.

                    STEPHEN
          How extraordinary.

                       BLAKENEY
          What, sir?

                    STEPHEN
          Those birds!

He's looking at a group of unremarkable black seabirds
waddling about on a rock, flapping short, stumpy wings.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          A species of cormorant. But apparently
          flightless, by all that's Holy. I believe
          that is unknown to science.

BLAKENEY dwells briefly on the strange rock-climbing birds
then drifts back to the iguanas.

                    BLAKENEY
          The dragons don't seem to bother 'em.

                    STEPHEN
          They are a type of iguana I should think,
          and therefore vegetarian.
His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. BLAKENEY is
wholly absorbed in the iguanas.

                    BLAKENEY
          Will you catch one?

                    STEPHEN
          Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some
          eggs.

                    BLAKENEY
          I mean the great lizards.

                    STEPHEN
          Oh!

Recognizing how superficially dull the birds are to
BLAKENEY's untutored eye, by contrast with giant lizards.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          I should think a pair of them. Then you
          can present one of their offspring to the
          king.

                    BONDEN
          Ha! There's one going for a swim.

                    STEPHEN
          No. Iguanas are land animals.

                    BONDEN
          Not these ones.

The prehistoric-looking creatures, as if suddenly awakened,
begin diving into the water.

                    STEPHEN (O.S.)
          By Jove Bonden you are right! Two new
          species in as many minutes.

He breaks off, suddenly aware of a shouted exchange between
the lookout and the quarterdeck.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          What is all that confounded bellowing?

                    JACK
          All hands about ship!

BLAKENEY dashes off and STEPHEN is elbowed out of the way by
hands rushing to get at the sails.

                    NEHEMIAH SLADE
          By your leave sir, by your leave.

                    HOLLAR (distant)
          Helms a'lee - off tacks and sheets -
          mainsail haul!

As the ship turns a distant whaleboat appears with six men
aboard, pulling out from one of the neighboring islands.

212.        IN THE LEE OF THE SHIP'S HULL (TIME-LAPSE) - DAY

The whaleboat has come alongside.

Men swarm down the boarding nets and the whalers are helped
aboard, hoarse and exhausted from rowing and shouting.

                    HOGG
          God bless you. Thank you, shipmates.

213.        QUARTERDECK - LATER, DAY

HOGG, the senior whaler, sits with his mates, relating his
story to JACK and the officers.

                    HOGG
          We was coming back for fresh lines, hid
          in that inlet, yonder. Black-three
          master. Bit beamy and raised in the
          stern.

Meaningful looks among Jack and his men. Its definitely the
Acheron he's describing [   ]

Hogg meanwhile takes a pint mug of water, gulps it down, and
passes it back to BLAKENEY for a refill.

                    HOGG (CONT'D)
          Hundred thousand pound of good whale oil
          they stole. Then the bastards...

                    ALLEN
              (cuffs him)
          No swearing on the quarterdeck.

                    JACK
              (waves ALLEN away)
          Go on.
                     HOGG
           ...Then they burnt our bloody ship and
           headed off, bunch of fugging pirates.

Looking pointedly at Allen

                     [      ]

                     JACK
           And her course?

                     HOGG
           Maybe a point south of west. Following
           the rest of the whaling fleet.

                     JACK (rising)
           Mr. Mowett, these men to be entered on
           the ship's books. Mr. Allen, lay a course
           west sou'west.

As ALLEN hurries away shouting orders -

                     PULLINGS
           Should we not take on fresh supplies,
           Sir? Those tortoises...

                     JACK (overlapping, impatient)
           There's not a moment to lose, Mr.
           Pullings.

He leaves the quarterdeck and goes below, STEPHEN following.

214.   IN THE GREAT CABIN

JACK has taken his jacket off and is already unfurling his
charts. STEPHEN hurries in.

                     STEPHEN
           Have you forgotten your promise?

                     JACK
               (not looking up)
           Subject to the requirements of the
           service, Stephen. I could not in all
           conscience delay for the sake of an
           iguano or a... giant peccary -
           interesting no doubt, but of no immediate
           application.

                     STEPHEN (overlap)
          How can you dismiss, out of hand, the
          bounty of nature? Knowledge that... that
          will help to progress...

                    JACK (overlap)
          I can see nothing on shore that will
          progress our mission.

                    STEPHEN (overlap)
          But how can we possibly know what lies
          [ ] on these islands, perhaps some
          knowledge that may save life, that...

                    JACK (overlap)
          I will tell you how to save lives
          Stephen. Inform me how to guide this
          ship, undetected, under the nose of a 40
          gun frigate. That is the job in hand sir.

STEPHEN swallows his indignation and tries for a compromise.

                    STEPHEN
          Well perhaps there's an opportunity to
          serve both our objectives. As I
          understand it you mean to go round the
          end of this long island, then start your
          voyage. I could walk across it, be on the
          other side long before...

JACK shakes his head.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          I would walk briskly, pausing only for
          important measurements and almost
          certainly making valuable discoveries...

                    JACK (interrupts)
          If wind and tide had been against us I
          should have said yes. They are not and I
          am obliged to say no.
              (with finality)
          No.

STEPHEN is livid. Betrayed.

                    STEPHEN
          I see. So after all this time in your
          service I must simply be content to form
          part of this belligerent expedition,
          hurry past inestimable wonders, bent
          solely on destruction...
                    JACK
          ...you forget yourself, sir.

                    STEPHEN
          No Jack, You have forgotten your self.
          You once believed in the rights of each
          individual man no matter how useless or
          lowly. But it seems to me now that the
          long exercise of power has brought you to
          the point where even a solemn promise...

                    JACK
          The promise was conditional.

                    STEPHEN
          ...a promise to a friend of ten years
          standing who has stood by you and
          supported you....

                    JACK (overlapping)
          I command a King's ship, not a private
          yacht...

                    STEPHEN
          ...across half the worlds oceans often at
          risk to his own life

                    JACK
          ...and we have no time for your damned
          hobbies, sir!

"Hobbies". So that is JACK's honest view of STEPHEN's
lifetime of work in science. He bows slightly, then leaves.

215         QUARTERDECK - DUSK

STEPHEN stands alone at the taffrail watching as the islands
recede in the distance.

News of the violent argument has spread and there is many a
sympathetic glance, which further humiliates STEPHEN.

BLAKENEY approaches him carrying something carefully in the
palm of his hand.

                    BLAKENEY
          Sir, I found a curious beetle walking on
          the deck.

He opens his hand - close, on a very plain little brown
beetle.

                      BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
            I think it's a Galapagos Beetle, sir.

                      STEPHEN
            I'm sure of it.

                      BLAKENEY
            Were you to have walked all day on the
            island, you might never have come across
            it.

                      STEPHEN
            That is more than likely, sure.

BLAKENEY passes it to STEPHEN.

                      BLAKENEY
            You can have it.

                      STEPHEN
            Thank you, Mr. Blakeney.

BLAKENEY hovers for a moment, unsure of further conversation,
then retreats.

216       IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

JACK sits alone at the table. KILLICK enters with toasted
cheese for two.

                      KILLICK
            No music? That's a shame

He sets down the toasted cheese.

                      KILLICK (CONT'D)
            I'll just leave the one plate then, if
            himself won't be joining.

                      JACK
            Yes, Killick. Just the one.

JACK cuts himself a portion, scowling at STEPHEN's cello
which seems to watch him reproachfully as he eats.

217.      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN takes a dropper, carefully measures twenty drops of
laudanum to a glass of water, and drinks.
218.        LOOKOUT - DAY

The lookout leaning out from the cross-trees.

                    DOUDLE (shouting)
          On deck there. Object fine on the
          starboard bow.

219.        THE SHIP LYING STATIONARY - DAY

A barrel is being lifted aboard from the skiff and passed up
the side of the ship.

220.   IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP

JACK comes down, accompanied by ALLEN, the acknowledged
expert in these matters.

Others gather round, including HOGG the whaler, inspecting
the stencilled markings.

                    ALLEN
          Martha's vineyard.

                    HOGG
          No, this here's from Boston. I was
          married there once.

                    ALLEN
          Any road, it's a Yankee barrel.

                    HOGG
          What they call a Bedford Hog in New
          England.

                    MOWETT (to JACK)
          The Acheron touched at Boston.

                    HOGG
          And it's not been in the water more than
          a week.

                    ALLEN
          One can't say with any accuracy but...

                    HOGG
          Yes you can. There's no sea chummer on
          it, and the dowels is sound.

221.        ON THE QUARTERDECK - DAY
JACK returns to his post.

                    JACK
          Continue due west, Mr. Bonden.

TOM PULLINGS watches him. There has been a change amongst the
officers and crew toward JACK. His relentless driving after
the Acheron has reached the point of obsession, an obsession
not shared by his exhausted men.

He is a lonely, haunted figure as he now steps up on the
gunwale, one hand on the ratlines, scanning the empty sea,
sensing his enemy is out there, just beyond the curve of the
earth.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO -

222.        LADDER (TIME LAPSE) - DAY

A wild wind humming through the rigging as STEPHEN goes
topside.

223.        FORECASTLE - DAY

He finds various hands making the boats secure.

                    PLAICE
          Have you seen the bird, doctor?

                    STEPHEN
          I have not - no bird these many days.
          What kind of a bird?

                    PLAICE
          A sort of albatross I believe, or perhaps
          a prodigious great mew. He has been
          following the ship since... there he is,
          crossing our wake!

224.        ON THE GANGWAY - DAY

STEPHEN runs along the gangway to get a clearer view,
checking himself when he sees JACK on the quarterdeck.

Their eyes meet. The quarterdeck is JACK's domain now, and
STEPHEN avoids it.

Then, behind JACK, the great bird suddenly appears.

It's huge, with at least a fourteen foot wing-span, and
flying very close to the ship, drifting and soaring on the
gusting wind, appearing and disappearing between the sails.

STEPHEN is mesmerized by it. He lets go of the rail, leaning
forward to get a better view.

At the same time across from STEPHEN on the opposite gangway,
HOWARD and two or three marines open fire on the bird. The
bird drops low, flying right by STEPHEN.

Again a crackle of gunfire, but the bird is apparently
uninjured, and it banks away, skimming the surface of the
water.

STEPHEN sags to the deck. A shout. People running. Blood
spreading across the white of his shirt. HOWARD there by his
side.

                    HOWARD
          My God, man! I'm so sorry. The bird
          dropped low. I didn't see you there!

JACK is there, shouting -

                    JACK
          Calamy! Get Higgins!
              (then turning to BONDEN)
          Padeen, Davies, carry the Doctor below.

STEPHEN gets slowly up, hands reaching to help him, HOWARD in
the background distraught, explaining to anyone who'll listen
what happened.

                    STEPHEN
          It's all right, I am quite capable of
          walking.

He tries to stand, crumples.

225.        STEPHEN's CABIN - DAY

HIGGINS presses clumsily around the wound as STEPHEN lies on
the bed, his abdomen rigid, his breathing laboured. JACK
watches from the door.

                    STEPHEN
          You will just make it worse... by
          prodding, Mr. Higgins, it cannot be got
          at... except by opening me up.

A violent pitching of the ship makes it obvious how
impossible this will be under sail.

As STEPHEN lapses into unconsciousness, HIGGINS looking
alarmed, approaches JACK.

                     HIGGINS (a whisper)
           The bullet took a piece of shirt in with
           it. Unless it is removed it will
           suppurate and fester.

                     JACK
           Are you equal to the task?

                     HIGGINS
           I'll need to read up on the Doctor's
           books, like. Study some pictures he has,
           get my bearings. Be better on land, but
           I'll manage somehow.

JACK looks away from the alcoholic HIGGINS back to STEPHEN.

226.   OUTSIDE THE CABIN

JACK passes an anxious crowd of the ship's company: BLAKENEY,
JOE PLAICE, KILLICK and HOWARD.

                     JACK
           You men get about your business.

There are dark looks in JACK's direction as he retreats to
his cabin.

227.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

JACK throws a chart on the table.

With his protractor he marches out great strides west into
the Pacific from the Galapagos Islands and marks the ship's
position - they are maybe a hundred miles from the Galapagos,
ahead, open sea until the Marquesas.

228.       INT. STEPHEN'S CABIN - DUSK

Lying on his bed, in some pain, STEPHEN hears thudding feet,
shouted orders.

In his weakened state, the sounds tend to merge. His
pitching cabin keeps swimming out of focus.

There's a knock on the door and JEMMY DUCKS appears with a
mug of soup and some biscuit.
                    JEMMY DUCKS
          ...sail on the horizon, sir. Hull down,
          running west. It may be a couple of days
          before we can catch her.

STEPHEN nods, all he wants is quiet.

JEMMY DUCKS retreats, as STEPHEN swigs from a little bottle
of laudanum, which for a moment brings peace, effectively
blocking out the noise from above.

A smile to PADEEN, like a farewell, and he closes his eyes.

229.        FORECASTLE - DUSK

JACK, telescope to his eye, studies the distant ship as
PULLINGS jumps down from the ratlines to the deck.

                     PULLINGS
          It might be the Acheron. If we put on
          more sail we'd come up with her before
          nightfall.

JACK lowers the telescope, turns his back on PULLINGS,
strangely abstracted.

                     PULLINGS (CONT'D)
               (to his back)
          Do you wish me to set the topgallants?
               (no reply)
          Sir?

A long silence. Then JACK walks away.

PULLINGS stares perplexed from JACK's retreating figure to
the distant chase.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO -

230.        INTERIOR STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAWN

Early morning light on the interior of the cabin. PADEEN is
asleep, holding a Bible, in the doctor's chair.

STEPHEN himself lies motionless with his eyes closed and his
mouth open, no colour in his face.

The sea is relatively calm. From outside the sound of the
bosun's orders, over rattling blocks and pulleys.
                    HOLLAR (O.S.)
          ...Clap on now! Every rope an end...
          Jolly-boat away... Slowly, Jenks! You
          grass-combing lubber!

MOWETT comes in, sees STEPHEN, and takes him for dead.

                    MOWETT
              (shouts outside)
          Davies! Slade!

Two big men come in behind him. PADEEN wakes, confused and
pushes them away, moving protectively to the doctor's side.

The commotion disturbs STEPHEN. His eyes open. Like a dead
man just come back to life.

                    MOWETT (CONT'D)
          Doctor. You're still with us. Can we move
          you onto a stretcher?

STEPHEN swallows uncomfortably and tries to make sense of
things.

231.        A GALAPAGOS ISLAND - DAY

A giant iguana watches as a small procession trudges up the
stony beach.

At its head, STEPHEN is carried in a litter up to where a
tent has been set up above the high-water mark.

His P.O.V. as JACK appears in the blue sky above him.

                    STEPHEN
          Tell me this wasn't on my account?

                     JACK
              (dead pan)
          No. It was because of Higgins.
              (beat)
          Can't have him poking around in your
          belly without a solid platform to work
          on.

He ducks as they enter -

232.        THE HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

In the creamy light, they lay STEPHEN down on a recently-
constructed wooden operating table.

HIGGINS squats on the ground, rummaging through various large
sharp surgical instruments which he has emptied onto a piece
of Hessian.

                    JACK
          All set, Higgins?

STEPHEN grabs JACK's sleeve.

                    STEPHEN
          Not Higgins. I do this with my own hand.

Jack frowns, unsure what he means by this.

EXT. THE TENT - NIGHT

PADEEN stands, arms crossed at the closed tent-flap, keeping
at bay a crowd of well-wishers, and the merely curious.

INT. THE TENT - NIGHT

STEPHEN sits pale and sweaty, propped up on a series of
chests, his back against a coil of rope. In front of him,
suspended by pulleys, LAMB and NAGEL have set up a large
gilt-framed mirror.

Beside him, on a white tablecloth, some small scissors and
scalpels.

                    STEPHEN
              (To Jack)
          [ ] You are sure you have a head and a
          stomach for this kind of thing?

                    JACK (smiles)
          My dear Doctor, I have seen blood and
          wounds since I was a little boy.

                    STEPHEN
          Then hold my belly, pressing firmly when
          I give the word.


STEPHEN begins first with the knife, then the probe - the
grind of metal on living bone.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          You will have to raise the rib, Higgins.
          Take a good grip with the square
          retractor. Up. Harder, harder.
              (to himself)
          Snip the cartilage.

The metallic clash of instruments, perpetual swabbing.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Now, Jack, a steady downward pressure.
          Good. Keep it so. Give me the davier.
          Swab, Higgins. Press, Jack, press.

JACK closes his eyes. STEPHEN draws in his breath, arches his
back, and it's done.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          There she is.

He pulls out the bullet, and with it, a fragment of his
shirt.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Is that all of it?

The bloody piece of shirt is handed to HIGGINS who matches it
to the hole in STEPHEN's old shirt.

                    HIGGINS
          Aye, she'll patch up nicely, sir.

                    STEPHEN
          Easy away, Jack. Handsomely with the
          retractor. Higgins, look to the Captain,
          while I swab.

HIGGINS helps JACK into a chair, pressing his head down
between his knees. After a moment, and a few deep breaths,
JACK looks up. STEPHEN smiles at him. A hint of surly
triumph.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                                                   FADE UP ON -

235.        STEPHEN'S TENT - DAY

Through a gap in the door of his tent STEPHEN can see the
distant ship at anchor. Repairs are underway, guns being
unloaded, stores and fresh water being ferried aboard.

BLAKENEY comes in, followed by PADEEN with a some numbered
boxes hung round his neck.
                    STEPHEN
          My goodness, what is this?

BLAKENEY starts rolling up the sides of the tent as PADEEN
unloads his boxes, each with a beetle and a piece of
vegetation in it.

                    BLAKENEY
          Well sir, Padeen and I have been doing
          some collecting for you. The beetles each
          come with a specimen of plant they were
          found on. Ooops. Catch him, Padeen! There
          he goes.

He finishes rolling up the tent sides to reveal a collection
of cages, with native wildfowl in them, being fed by the
poulterer, JEMMY DUCKS.

                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
          The birds were snared by Jemmy Ducks.
          Captain says we can keep them in the
          chicken coop.

Then, producing a notebook -

                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
          And I made a few notes if you want to see
          them.

STEPHEN flips the pages:

No 22. Large square black beetle with pincers. Found under
rock. Eats earthworms.

                    STEPHEN
          'Pon my word you have the makings of a
          true naturalist.

BLAKENEY is flattered but unsure.

                    BLAKENEY
          Well sir, perhaps I could combine them,
          and be a kind of Fighting-Naturalist,
          like yourself?

                                    [   ]

Stephen smiles at this description as he levers himself into
a sitting position.
                    STEPHEN
          Shall we take a tour of your aviary?

BLAKENEY looks doubtfully at the doctor's bandaged abdomen.

                    BLAKENEY
          Should you really be up?

                    STEPHEN
          Yes. Padeen!

PADEEN puts the escaped beetle in his mouth for safe keeping
and offers STEPHEN a hand. STEPHEN pulls himself painfully to
his feet and starts buttoning his shirt.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
              (To Blakeney)
          How long does the Captain intend that we
          stay here, do you know?

ON THE BEACH - DAY

JACK is watching those of the crew not on duty play cricket
on the shore, with a canvas ball and stumps made of
driftwood.

                    JACK
          Oh, a week perhaps. There is no great
          hurry.

                     STEPHEN
          But surely, we must make haste for the
          Marquesas?

                    JACK
          It may not have been the Acheron that we
          sighted. Nor can we be sure of her
          destination.
              (looks away)
          No, I think we shall go home now, before
          peace breaks out with France, God forbid.

He's making light of what has been a huge and far-reaching
decision.

                    STEPHEN
          But how will it sit with the Admiralty?
          To have spent six months in a fruitless
          pursuit and then come home empty-handed?
                    JACK
          "Empty-handed"? Not a bit of it. What
          about these plants and animals which
          Blakeney has been collecting? The British
          museum will need an entire new wing for
          'em.

STEPHEN regards him gravely, shaking his head.

                    STEPHEN
          I fear, Jack, you have burdened me with a
          debt I can never repay.

He is absolutely sincere about this, to JACK's great
embarrassment.

                    JACK
          Tosh. Name a shrub after me. Something
          prickly and hard to eradicate.

                    STEPHEN
          A shrub? I shall name a giant tortoise:
          Testudo Aubreii!

237.        SURPRISE CAMP - DAWN

STEPHEN, BLAKENEY and PADEEN leave the camp on STEPHEN's
first day of exploration. They are armed with nets, baskets
and a day's supply of food and water.

STEPHEN walks slightly stooped, leaning on a walking stick.

238.        COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

A strange and wonderful landscape lies before them, with its
organically-shaped lava flows and alien-looking flora and
fauna.

Everywhere STEPHEN looks there are creatures unique to the
islands. He is in his element, collecting specimens which
PADEEN carefully stores in the baskets.

BLAKENEY has his telescope trained on some distant humps.

                    BLAKENEY
          Doctor, would you think it very
          unscientific of me to ride on the back of
          one of those tortoises.

                    STEPHEN
          No, Mr. Blakeney. I would think it an
          experiment of absolutely vital
          importance. But afterwards, I do desire
          to find that flightless cormorant,
          assuming that is what it is, and that I
          still have strength enough to catch it.

239.        A VALLEY - DAY

BLAKENEY gets astride a giant tortoise and burns his bottom
on its scorching hot shell.

240.        LAVA BEDS - DAY

STEPHEN with his telescope taking notes on bird-life.

241.        LOW SCRUB - DAY

The huge, strangely balletic figure of PADEEN chasing after a
butterfly in evening light.

242.        A HEADLAND - DAY

Wide to see another aspect of the countryside - a hint of
distant sea, a rocky headland rising from the plain.

The group is widely scattered. STEPHEN at the base of the
headland, BLAKENEY half a mile further inland. PADEEN coming
up slowly behind, laden with the fruits of their expedition.

243.        BASE OF THE HEADLAND - DAY

STEPHEN rests a moment. Some stones rattle down from the
hillside. He looks up to see a flash of black feathers near
the crest - the cormorant.

On his shirt a red smudge has appeared. His wound has begun
to bleed again.

Ignoring this, Stephen pushes on after his quarry.

244.   THE ROCKY SLOPE

Near the top, STEPHEN pauses to catch his breath and glances
above him.

Again the bird, moving higher, as if leading him on.

STEPHEN gets down on all fours, crawling cautiously to the
crest just above him.
245.   TOP OF THE HEADLAND

A clearing. There is movement in the bushes.

STEPHEN slowly rises, climbs the few paces to the hilltop and
enters a clearing.

He searches amongst the bushes. Nothing.

He turns and looks back down the hillside to see BLAKENEY and
PADEEN far below, then sits to get his breath back again.

STEPHEN'S P.O.V: on the ground between his feet, a beetle. He
picks it up.

Close, on his hand. It is the same type of beetle BLAKENEY
gave him aboard the Surprise.

Smiling at the coincidence STEPHEN raises the tiny creature
to eye level.

His P.O.V.: the beetle, the creature in sharp focus, behind
it the sea, and on the sea, a black shape.

The focus shifts to the background - a ship at anchor in a
bay.

The beetle flies away as STEPHEN stares out at the ship. It's
the Acheron, and they are weighing anchor.

246.         COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK

BLAKENEY urging STEPHEN to hurry as they make their way
through the darkening landscape. All kinds of creatures are
appearing around them, and every few yards STEPHEN pauses to
examine something.

                     BLAKENEY
           Sir, you must hurry!

                     STEPHEN
           A moment! You're a worse tyrant than any
           ship's captain.

He's breathing hard, exhausted.

                     BLAKENEY
           You must carry him, Padeen!

PADEEN looks at the collection of baskets he carries.
                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
          Leave them! We must get back to the ship.

STEPHEN raises his hand in protest, but BLAKENEY is already
divesting PADEEN of his load.

247.        COUNTRYSIDE - LAST LIGHT

PADEEN carrying STEPHEN 'piggy-back', BLAKENEY out ahead
urging them on.

247a   THE DISCARDED COLLECTING BOXES

A variety of small bugs and animals crawling free

248      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN gingerly lowers himself into his 'elbow-chair',
gripping the table and BLAKENEY's good arm for support.
Sighing, he begins emptying his pockets of various small
items collected during the day - some leaves, rocks and
insects - and places them in ordered piles around his
microscope.

All about them can be heard the urgent sounds of departure -
the anchor rattling up, shouted orders and the drumming of
bare feet on the deck above.

He holds up a stick in a specimen-jar, and is examining it
with his magnifying glass when JACK enters.

                    JACK
          I forgot to ask you - did you see your
          bird?

STEPHEN's eye grossly enlarged through the lens.

                    STEPHEN
          I did not. My greatest discovery was your
          phantom.

                    JACK
          Indeed it was, I'm sorry...

                    STEPHEN
              (waving the magnifying glass)
          Not a bit of it. William and I made a
          unique discovery.

Handing JACK the jar and magnifying glass.
                     STEPHEN (CONT'D)
           Tell him, Mr. Blakeney.

                     BLAKENEY (beaming)
           It's a rare phasmid, Sir.

JACK inspects the stick. It winks at him.

                        JACK
           A phasmid?

                     BLAKENEY
           It's an insect disguised as a stick.

JACK stares at the creature.

                     BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
           In order to confuse a predator.

JACK looks up at STEPHEN.

249.   BAY, GALAPAGOS - NIGHT

The Surprise alive with crewmen on the deck and in the
rigging. Shouts and commands drift across the water as she
turns and heads out from the bay.

249a         GANGWAY - SAME TIME

JACK strides along the quarterdeck towards the forecastle
issuing a stream of orders -

                     JACK
           Mr. Hollar, rouse up all the yellow paint
           we have. I want six men with brushes
           slung over the side.
               (moving on)
           Doudle!

                        DOUDLE
           Yessir.

JACK hands him a piece of paper with a sketch on it.

                     JACK
           Get your sail makers working on this.
           Sixty yards by five yards with an eyelet
           every seven feet.

                        DOUDLE
            Aye, Sir.

He shouts to HOGG who, with a few men, is manhandling a large
metal cauldron from the ballast to the gun-deck.

                      JACK
                (to HOGG)
            Have Nagel patch it up and light a fire
            in it.
                (shouts)
            Mr. Calamy!

                         CALAMY
            Aye, Sir.

                      JACK
            Once we're underway, replace some of the
            sails with the oldest, most patched set
            we have.

                      CALAMY
            They'll be in the afterhold, Sir. I'll
            need some men to move all the clutter.

                      JACK
            Good. Spread it around the foredeck. The
            more mess the better.

249B.    SIDE OF THE SHIP,. NIGHT

The ship powers ahead as men swing in harnesses above the
racing water, painting out the Nelson chequer.

249C.    ON DECK.   NIGHT

NAGEL positions the great cauldron amidships as men come up
from below with old barrels and bits of rope.

                         CALAMY
            Haul away!

On the gangway, Men under CALAMY's instructions haul on
ropes, pulling up the old patched sails.

The sails lead us up to

250.    CROSSTREES - NIGHT

JACK, PULLINGS and the whaler HOGG scan the dark horizon.

                         HOGG
          There, Sir. A mainmast toplight.

JACK has to use a telescope.

                    JACK
          You've got good eyes, Hogg.

Shouts down to the helm -

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Mr. Bonden, set a course west-south-west.
              (to PULLINGS)
          We'll drop below the horizon and come up
          on the other side of him, let him think
          he's seen us first.

251.        SURPRISE - DAWN

First light reveals the results of an overnight
transformation - from a naval warship to a shambolic-looking
Portuguese whaler.

The gunwales are painted an untidy ochre and the gun-ports
hidden behind broad strips of canvas.

The sails are patched and ragged, the forecastle cluttered
with barrels. Smoke billows from a cauldron amidships.

On deck and in the rigging, there's a quarter of the normal
complement of men, all of them dressed in purser's slops.

252.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

A bemused STEPHEN looks about him as he approaches JACK.

                    STEPHEN
          I see. A wolf in sheep in sheep's
          clothing

                    JACK
          A phasmid, doctor. It was you what gave
          me the idea.

                    STEPHEN
          I'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator.

                    JACK
          No? Well this one is.

253.        BERTH DECK - DAWN
HOWARD and his marines change out of their smart uniforms,
into the oldest most ragged clothes on board the ship, much
to the amusement of the passing sailors.

                    CREW MEN AD LIB
          Very fancy. Blue to match your eyes. Is
          there a skirt comes with it?

254.        GUN-DECK - DAWN

Men are checking the breechings of the great guns and
chipping cannonballs to make them more perfectly spherical,
more deadly.

The armourer is at his grindstone sending out showers of
sparks, a group of seamen round him relaying one another at
the crank, stacking newly honed cutlasses and boarding axes
at their feet.

Another team check and load pistols by the score.

254.        MIDSHIPMEN'S QUARTERS - DAWN

Alone, BLAKENEY awkwardly draws his dirk, left-handed from
its scabbard. It glints momentarily in the lamp-light.

CALAMY enters, face aglow, abruptly trying to cover his joy
when he sees BLAKENEY.

                    BLAKENEY [ ]
          It's all right. Permission to boast.
          You're to lead the boarders from the
          forecastle. Congratulations.

                          CALAMY
          Thank you.

                    BLAKENEY
          You'll make lieutenant out of this.

The others come in.

                    BOYLE
          He already has. 'Acting' 3rd Lieutenant
          Peter Calamy.

Oohs and aahs from all.

                          BLAKENEY
              [       ]
          Then I'll see you at the forecastle,
          'Lieutenant'.

                    CALAMY
          That's not your station.

BLAKENEY looks from CALAMY to the others, who avoid his eye.

                    BLAKENEY
          But naturally I'll board with you?

                    CALAMY
          I'm sorry, Will. Captain's orders.

BLAKENEY is devastated.

Rye bursts in, in a state of high excitement.

                    RYE
          She's seen us!

256.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

JACK raises his glass, focuses on the Acheron, plainly
visible in the distance, with a line of signal flags running
up her backstay.

                     MOWETT
          She's asking us to heave to. Shall I give
          the order?

                    JACK
          No, make a show of fleeing upwind, but
          panicky and disorganized, like a whaler
          might do.

Allen smiles at this unintended slight

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          No offence, Mr. Hogg.

257.        WIDE ON THE SHIPS - DAY

A show of chaos on deck as the Surprise veers upwind, away
from the Acheron. As she presents her stern we see her new
name: Malacca.

258.        QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

Through his telescope, JACK looks back at the Acheron in
pursuit, a dark figure on her foredeck.
                    JACK
              (to Mowett)
          Run up Portuguese colours.
              (then down to the gun-deck)
          Load, Mr. Pullings. Triple shot 'em.

BLAKENEY comes onto the quarterdeck and salutes, looking
flushed and angry.

                    BLAKENEY
          May I speak with you, Sir.

                    JACK
          No saluting, Mr. Blakeney, we're whalers
          here.

                    BLAKENEY
          Mr. Calamy says I am not in the boarding
          party, I wanted to say -

                    JACK
              (interrupts)
          I know what you want to say and my answer
          is no. I promised your mother I would
          return you in one piece and I have
          already failed her on that score. You
          will command a gun and then retire to
          defend the quarterdeck here with Dr.
          Maturin.

                      BLAKENEY
          But sir -

                    JACK (cutting in)
          Go to your station, Mr. Blakeney.

BLAKENEY begins to salute, doesn't, and retires, tears
burning his eyes.

A moment later there's a flash of orange astern as the
Acheron opens up with her bow-chasers. An 18 pound shot
screams past the side of the Surprise to land with a column
of spray just off their bows.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Good shooting. Remind me to press her bow
          gunner, Mr. Pullings.

The second ball takes down some rigging.
                     JACK (CONT'D)
          Start the water and throw some barrels
          overboard.

He goes below.

259.   WAIST - DAY

Barrels go overboard and pumps spout streams of water over
the side as JACK runs down to

260.   THE GUN-DECK

The great majority of men are gathered here, more than a
hundred of them crammed together with their muskets and
sabres, listening to the odd thump from topsides as another
ball from the Acheron hits home.

CALAMY and his gang of young tykes are squashed in there
somewhere, BOYLE, WILLIAMS, ADDISON and the rest, eyes
shining with nervousness and wild anticipation, as JACK
addresses his men, who shout encouragement, ad lib, in every
pause.

                    JACK
              (plus the men ad lib)
          We're a long way from home. (Right you
          are, Captain!) A long way from anywhere,
          (Too true!) But if Britain rules the
          waves she rules these waves too. (Right
          she does!) And the blow we shall deal for
          his Majesty here will be felt just as
          keenly (I'll say it will) aye - and
          cheered just as loudly ('specially by the
          wimmin!) - as any dealt at Trafalgar or
          Cape St. Vincent.


The camera moves over the upturned faces, PLAICE, NAGEL,
DOUDLE, KILLICK, the midshipmen, the powder-monkeys, the
whole fellowship of the ship. And finally STEPHEN watching
JACK doing what he does best: transmitting his own
fearlessness into other men - the total warrior, the
consummate leader.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I don't say it will be easy. She's twice
          the men we have and they'll sell their
          lives dearly. But every man here is worth
          three of Boney's privateers, and I know
          there's not a faint heart among you.
CALAMY pipes up -

                    CALAMY
          Three cheers for the Captain.

                    MEN (deafening)
          Huzzah huzzah huzzah!

On CALAMY, cheering like a kid at a football match as...

261.          QUARTERDECK - DAY

Another well-placed shot from the Acheron smashes through the
rigging, sending down a shower of rope and cordage.

JACK is back at his station by the wheel, the Acheron little
more than a half a mile astern, the figure of the captain in
his black coat clearly visible.

JACK studies the looming black vessel, then turns and crosses
to BONDEN at the helm. BONDEN nods, lifting his hands from
the wheel as JACK grips the curved timber decisively, taking
the strain.

He feels the pulse of the ship through his fingers, looks up
to the sails then back to the Acheron. STEPHEN appears beside
him, casually smoking a cigar. He offers one to Jack, who
declines

                     [   ]

Another shot pierces the mizzen foresail above them, but
neither man flinches. KILLICK appears with two cups of
coffee, and in his belt a brace of pistols.

                    KILLICK
          I took the liberty, Doctor.

                     STEPHEN
          [    ] Thank you, Killick.

JACK steers one-handed as he sips his coffee.

                    JACK
          Mr. Mowett? [  ] A poem might be in
          order.

Another shot through the sails.

                     MOWETT
           A poem, Sir?
                             [   ]
               (after a moment's reflection)
           'Oh were it mine with sacred Maro's art,
           To wake to sympathy the feeling heart,

A ball goes howling past the ship, MOWETT winces.

                     MOWETT (CONT'D)
           Then might I, with unrivalled strains,
           deplore,
           Th'impervious horrors of a leeward
           shore.'

JACK smiles, nods.

                     MOWETT (CONT'D)
           'Transfixed with terror at th'approaching
           doom...'

                        JACK
           What!

                     MOWETT
               (apologetic)
           ...they were only people of the merchant
           service, of-course, Sir.

262.   P.O.V. ACHERON

She's now less than five hundred yards from their stern, and
gaining.

263.    QUARTERDECK

JACK turns back to MOWETT.

                     JACK
           We have her Mr. Mowett. Strike the
           Portuguese colours and run up the Jack...
           Mr. Pullings. Canvas off the gun-ports,
           and run 'em out. Mr. Howard? Marines away
           aloft.

The British Jack rises to the masthead replacing the
Portuguese colours, as PULLINGS descends to the gun-deck.

264. SHIP'S SIDE -

The black muzzles appear with a low rumbling sound, as
265.   QUARTERDECK

JACK, with a wink to MOWETT, yells at the top of his voice

                       JACK
             Helm's a lee!

....and spins the wheel hard to starboard.

266.   THE SURPRISE

Wide, to see her swinging broadside on, across the path of
the oncoming Acheron.

267.   POV ACHERON DAY

Confused shouts from the enemy's deck, chaos on her
forecastle, somewhere a drum beating.

270.   THE SURPRISE QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK hands the wheel to BONDEN.

                       JACK
             Run us down her larboard side then cut
             across her wake!
                 (shouts down to the gun deck)
             Hold fire Mr Pullings! Hold till we're
             broadside on!

271. - THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

Wide, to see the Surprise turning downwind, back towards the
Acheron, so they will pass broadside to broadside [   ] no
more than thirty yards apart.

272. QUARTERDECK/ GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

Through a furious exchange of musket fire JACK runs down the
ladder to the gun-deck-

                       JACK
             Fire as she bears! Every gun to
             concentrate on her mainmast!

Through the gunports the Acheron's great hull becomes
visible. Some of the Acheron's guns have run out, but the
crews are unprepared and disorganized.
                      PULLINGS
            On the uproll! Fire for the mainmast as
            you sight her!

As the Surprise rolls and the upper deck of the Acheron
becomes visible.

273. THE SURPRISE GUNS

Barking, leaping back one by one, great tongues of flame
spitting from their barrels, dense clouds of smoke rising.

274.    VIEW OF THE ACHERON

With an almighty splitting sound their mainmast falls,
dragging yards and rigging with it, the whole mass falling
over their side, obscuring many of their gun-ports.

275. GUNDECK/QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE -

Cheers from the crew. Jack yelling up the companionway

                      JACK
            Now Mr Bonden! Hard a'starboard!

276.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

The Acheron wallows, bought to a standstill by the enormous
dragging weight of their mainmast.

BONDEN wheels the ship across the enemy's wake, past the
exposed, vulnerable stern.

277.    DELETED

277A.   GUNDECK, SURPRISE

                      JACK
            Fire at will!

278.    GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

In random sequence the Surprise's gunners pound it into the
Acheron's stern. Casement windows vanish in a cloud of wood
and glass, exposing the Acheron's terrified gun-crews, now
open to devastating fire as the Surprise glides past.

279.    QUARTERDECK

JACK climbs up on the gunwales, shouting to BONDEN -
                      JACK
            Lay me alongside!

280.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

The bow of the Surprise lurches into the Acheron mid-ships,
spars interlocking, the Surprise guns firing into her at
point-blank range.

The crew throw grappling hooks.

281..   QUARTERDECK

                      JACK
            Boarders away!

And he leaps to the enemy deck, a great tide of men following
after him.

282.    FORECASTLE

CALAMY leads his own children's crusade from the bows and
forecastle: youthful but terrifying, screaming and swinging
their blades.

283.    QUARTERDECK

An agonized BLAKENEY watches from where he stands beside
STEPHEN. JOE PLAICE is close by with some of the older men,
ready to ferry the wounded below.

284.    ON THE ACHERON

As the Surprises pour onto the quarterdeck they face
withering fire from the enemy. A dozen men go down, some of
them fatally wounded. Among them are DOUDLE, BOYLE, ALLEN and
HORNER in quick succession.

The attack momentarily falters, and the Acherons surge back
at them.

JACK rallies his men and they charge again - the marine,
TROLLOPE, and NAGEL are blown backwards by grapeshot.

LAMB, enraged, surges past NAGEL's body, swinging his axe to
devastating effect, with HOLLAR by his side and JEMMY DUCKS
protecting their rear, a pistol in each hand, firing from the
hip.

JACK keeps pushing onwards, the centre of the milling,
swirling, hacking crowd, stabbing and pistolling each other
with barely room to fall.

The Acherons are gradually forced back across their
quarterdeck and down into the waist of the ship.

285.   WAIST OF THE ACHERON

JACK crosses swords with a man in front of him, as an enemy
pikeman drives his blade into his left arm, tearing through
the sleeve. BONDEN fires a pistol by his ear, deafening JACK
and killing the pikeman.

To either side, privateers are trying to reach them,
shouting, swearing in English, French and Spanish.

Bullets and missiles rain down from above, killing friend and
foe alike.

KILLICK is in the thick of it, a pistol in either hand, and
from his lips a high-pitched blood-curdling scream.

AWKWARD DAVIES is foaming at the mouth as he swings a meat-
cleaver right and left.

286.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

A commander of the privateers notes the poorly defended
Surprise, and leads a counter-attack over onto her
quarterdeck.

                     CALAMY
           Look to our quarter-deck!

287. QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

BLAKENEY, dirk in hand, turns to face them, as does HOWARD
and his men, but they are gravely outnumbered.

288.   FORECASTLE, ACHERON

CALAMY sees the danger and leads his gang back onto the
Surprise, calling for others to follow.

                     Calamy
           This way! Follow me!

289. QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

STEPHEN, PADEEN and JOE PLAICE appear from below. STEPHEN
picks up a pistol and with deadly accuracy shoots a privateer
lunging at CAPTAIN HOWARD. The man drops, a neat hole in his
forehead. A moment's astonishment from HOWARD at the Doctor's
surprising skill.

CALAMY fights his way to BLAKENEY who is down on his knees
stabbing at the legs of the attackers.

290.   WAIST, ACHERON

JACK, BONDEN and DAVIES are driving a wedge toward the stern,
the defenders falling back in disarray.

291.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON

PULLINGS and MOWETT fight side-by-side.

A swivel-gun mounted on the taff-rail is swung to face them.

The gunner is about to fire when a perfectly-aimed musket
ball hits him, again fired by STEPHEN.

292.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE/ACHERON

CALAMY, BLAKENEY and their group force the counter-attack
back onto the deck of the Acheron. The two boys fight as a
team as they move toward the stern.

292.   SIDE OF THE ACHERON

Some Acherons jump overboard to escape the furious attack.
Others are thrown, grasping at woodwork as they fall.

293.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON

JEMMY DUCKS turns the swivel on a group of Acherons, the
grapeshot blasting them up against the gunwale.

294.   IN THE WATER

Oil burns. Men drown, others struggle to stay afloat,
clinging to the mass of wreckage floating by the hull.

295.   WAIST OF THE SHIP

Cheering from the Surprises, demands to surrender in many
languages, some beg for mercy, others fight on.

296.   BELOW DECKS

JACK moves alone, down to the berth deck. He smashes the
chain off a locked-door, releasing a dozen or more prisoners.

Everywhere signs of the lethal blast through the ship's
stern, bodies, guns upended, shattered timbers.

He makes his way through to the Great Cabin.

297.   GREAT CABIN, ACHERON

Four privateers look up as JACK bursts in.

They have been looting their own ship's valuables, two of
them are too drunk to be scared.

                      JACK
           Where is your captain? Ou est votre
           capitaine?

One man leaps out through the shattered windows. A couple of
others raise their hands and start jabbering in French and
Spanish.

298.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

It's all over for the Acherons as a French officer hauls down
their colours.

A cheer from the Surprises - a few last shots fired. CALAMY
and BLAKENEY cheering, BLAKENEY holding aloft the captured
flag.

A dying Frenchman suddenly lunges at CALAMY with a sabre.
BLAKENEY steps in front of him and takes the blow.

299.   IN THE SICK-BERTH, ACHERON

A doctor is working here, a callow-faced man in a bloody
apron, red-eyed from fatigue.

JACK enters, a fearsome sight, with his singed yellow hair
and blood-stained cutlass.

                     JACK
           Le Capitaine? Where is he?

The doctor points at a body on the operating table.

JACK approaches, looks down at the dead man. He's [ ]
somewhere about JACK's age, fine-featured, with his black
coat draped over his body.
                     DOCTOR
           Il mávait prie de vous donner ceci.

Passing JACK the captain's sword.

300.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

JACK picks his way through the dead and wounded to where
CALAMY sits nursing BLAKENEY.

                     CALAMY
           He's dead, sir.

Gently, JACK picks up the lifeless body and walks slowly back
down the quarterdeck, the boy draped across his arms.

Friend and foe part silently in front of him as he crosses
the gangway to...

301.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

...then with CALAMY following, he goes below.

302.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

JACK in wide shot, sitting alone on the bench running under
the stern windows. His hunched posture and red tear-stained
eyes give a glimpse of his familiar post-battle mood - a mix
of grief and depression, the old question, "Was it worth the
price?".

                                                 FADE TO BLACK

                                                 FADE UP ON -

303.         ACHERON AND SURPRISE - DAWN

The two ships anchored close together on the ocean.

304.         QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAWN

As eight bells are rung for the change of watch we see a row
of canvas hammocks each containing the body of a fallen
crewman.

DAVIES and PLAICE stitch the bodies into their hammocks,
BLAKENEY the last body in the line. As the men approach -

                     CALAMY
           I'll do it.
JOE passes him the needle and twine, then they leave him
alone.

As CALAMY sews up the hammock, HOLLAR's voice is heard
distinctly from below.

                    HOLLAR (O.S.)
          Rise and shine, show a leg there. Tumble
          up! Tumble up!

In close-up: the peaceful face of BLAKENEY

                    HOLLAR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Sleepers awake!

...as CALAMY's hands stitch the canvas closed.

305.        WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - DAWN

The small figures of the crew assembled on the quarterdeck.
JACK's voice drifting across the water.

                    JACK
          John Henry ALLEN...
          Joseph NAGEL...
          William Horner...
          Stephen Winston Boyle...
          and Lieutenant William Blakeney

          We therefore commit their bodies to the
          deep, looking for the resurrection of the
          body, when the sea shall give up her
          dead...
          Amen.

                    ALL
          Amen.

The bodies in their weighted hammocks slide into the sea.

306.        BOW OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

Wide on STEPHEN and BLAKENEY as they sit watching two
dolphins surfing the bow-wave, STEPHEN pointing out various
features of these magnificent creatures, doing his best to
take the boy's mind off the loss of his friend.

307.   THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON - DAY

The two ships sail abreast - the Acheron, her shattered masts
jury-rigged.

308.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAY

JACK stands with LIEUTENANT MOWETT and the signals
midshipman, WILLIAMSON. They look across at the Acheron.

                    JACK
          Signal... 'Parole prisoners
          Valparaiso'...

                    WILLIAMSON
          You mean Lieutenant Pullings, Sir?

                    JACK
          No. Captain Pullings.

WILLIAMSON hurries to the signals locker, the signal book and
JACK's message in his hand.

309.   TELESCOPE POV   DAY

The line of colored signal-flags run up to the mast-head of
the Surprise.

309A   QUARTERDECK ACHERON

Midshipman Rye is reading the signal for Pullings

                    RYE
          ....then 'Rendezvous Portsmouth. God-
          speed, Captain Pullings.'

A contented smile on Pullings face as his promotion is
confirmed. He waves across to JACK as the Acheron makes a
sharp turn away from the Surprise.

311.   ABOUT THE SHIP - DUSK

Slowly the crew come back to life as old familiar habits and
routines reassert themselves.

· Acting First Lieutenant MOWETT walks the quarterdeck
composing a poem in memory of the battle.

· JOE PLAICE tells a story of witchcraft and haunted ships to
a small attentive audience.

· While AWKWARD DAVIES works further on the tattoo about
BECKETT's waist. The chain begun off BRAZIL now winds its way
around most of his torso.

· BLAKENEY and JEMMY DUCKS are feeding the assorted creatures
collected at the Galapagos, as...

Stephen Maturin, his brow furrowed, his lips moving silently.

313.   INTERIOR, GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN plays a note on his cello [      ]

                    STEPHEN
          Shall we begin?

JACK pauses, gazing into space.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Jack, brother, you're gathering wool.

                    JACK (smiles)
          Thinking about their captain. A great
          seaman, whatever you may say of him. The
          doctor said he was killed by our first
          broadside. I'd have liked to talk to him,
          face to face.

                    STEPHEN
          Maybe you did.

                      JACK
          What?

                    STEPHEN
          While I was tending the prisoners they
          told me their doctor died of fever, two
          weeks ago. There was no doctor on that
          ship when we boarded it. And I doubt you
          will find one there now.

JACK goes very still. A silence broken only by the sound of
water flowing gently past the hull.

He looks down at the captain's sword on the table, the
thought of a possible final deception flooding through him.

                      STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Shall we?
He starts to play, the deep booming sound of the cello
carrying through to ....

312.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK, wearing an ostentatious bandage about his head, is
preparing toasted cheese with BLACK BILL.

                     KILLICK
           That's the last of the cheese and like as
           not they'll leave it seizing to their
           plates with their tweedly tweedly
           tweedly.

                     JACK (O.S.)
           Killick? KILLICK THERE!

                     KILLICK (projecting)
           Which it will be ready when it's ready!

In the cabin, the violin joins with the cello. Rolling,
undeniable music, the music of the waves, resonating through
the great ship and filling the night. Stephens mind is far
away. Jack breaks off abruptly:

                      JACK

          You're still missing your cormorant...
          flightless eh...well then. It will still
          be there when we come back

And he breaks into a merry jig

313.   SURPRISE, EXTERIOR - NIGHT

Wide, to see the stern of the ship and a patch of surrounding
water lit by the great stern lantern. Through the casement
windows the two men can be seen playing.

Wider, to the vast dark sky and the heaving ocean all around,
with the stern cabin, a tiny orange light, still faintly
visible in the darkness.

314.   FURTHER BACK

And further still. Until we see the curve of the earth, and
the planet spinning on its journey through space.

                                                         April 8, 1999

FADE IN ON:

Dark clouds below the inky remnants of the scorched sky. We hear  wind
as we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere.

We DIVE DOWN into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darker
world of  the dead  surface of  Earth, the  desert of  the real.   The
rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. We  approach
a fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasing
buzz of multiple hovercraft  engines. Blue flashes grow  in  intensity
from the fissure. Radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   as
we approach the fissure.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)

           "Six o'clock, 300 meters. We can't outrun 'em."

                              MAN (V.O.)

    "I know. Can't tow this crate fast enough! We gotta ditch it!"

We hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a  police
scanner. The woman is NIOBE, the captain of the lead ship, Sephora.

                             NIOBE (V.O.)

     "Can't, the core is still good. And they've got 'The One.'"

                              MAN (V.O.)

             "Oooh, our savior. Hed better be worth it."

                             NIOBE (V.O.)

                "Shut up and make the exit. Hold on!"

The azure glow  from the  fissure  is suddenly overwhelming.  A  tight
convoy  of  three  HOVERCRAFT  explode  from  the  fissure,  traveling
nearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   into
the sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables.  The  blue
glow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   the
first and third hovercrafts.  Between them, suspended by  tow  cables,
is the dark, scorched,  and sliced NEBACHANEZZER. They  rocket upward,
slowing as they reach the top of the arc.

                             NIOBE (V.O.)

                             "Woo-hoooh!"

The rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second. The NEB  flails
wildly between them.

                              MAN (V.O.)

                        "They're still on us!"

More vehicles fly from the fissure. A massive army of SQUIDDIES  pours
up onto the surface.


INT. NEBACHANEZZER COCKPIT

The NEB is slung between the two HOVERCRAFT, with the cockpit   facing
backwards.  TRINITY,  MORPHEUS,  TANK,  and  NEO,  the  former  Thomas
Anderson, crowd the cockpit. Helpless, the landscape speeds away  from
them, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them.

It's been a mere TWO DAYS  since the realization of NEOS POWERS   and
the defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into  the
interior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   and
stressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  their
knocked-out ship.

                      MORPHEUS is on a headset.

                               MORPHEUS

                      "Niobe, theyre closing."

                                NIOBE

                             "How many?"

                               MORPHEUS

              "Just a few. Maybe two or three. Hundred."


INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT

NIOBE, as regal as she is beautiful, sits at the controls of her  ship
with her co-pilot, a younger female. All visible dials are redlined as
they streak over the dark surface.

                                NIOBE

               "Youve got a gift for understatement."


INT. FREEDOM COCKPIT

THE  FREEDOMS CAPTAIN,  a silhouette  in a  dark cockpit,  is flying
blind. His cockpit is awash in the blue flares from NIOBES ship.

His lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen.
As she does, we see her  bare shoulder fall into view, a  WHITE RABBIT
tattoo is conspicuous.

They switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass.

                                 MAN

       "Oh shit, were screwed. We gotta set down and EMP em."

                             NIOBE (V.O.)

                             "Too many!"


EXT. FREEDOM HULL

A racing SQUIDDIES  reaches the hull  and latches on,  striking up its
cutting laser and ripping into the hull.


INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT

                              MAN (V.O.)

                 "Theyre on me! Shit! Losing power!"

NIOBES Lieutenant, a muscular Asian woman, Circa, notes something  on
a console.

                                CIRCA

                      "Multiple bogies closing!"

                                NIOBE

                              "No shit."

                                CIRCA

                          "From the front!"

Niobe is grim faced as she peers into the sky ahead. Several  objects
are closing in fast.

                                CIRCA

                            "Are they - "

She doesn't have time to finish the question, as the oncoming fighters
launch a massive  volley of missiles.  From afar, they  look like dark
irises  surrounded by  a corona  of flame.  At first,  we can't   tell
exactly what they  are, until their  fiery trails rip  straight at the
SEPHORA cockpit.

CIRCA DUCKS as the missiles harmlessly streak by.


INT. NEB COCKPIT

A massive  swarm off  missiles blasts  by the  cockpit. The individual
warheads  swerve  at  the last  second,  blowing  SQUIDDIES apart,  or
casting them to the ground aflame.


INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT

Niobe breathes a sigh of relief. Her lieutenant looks back up to see a
wing of HOVER FIGHTERS - 'DEFENDERS' fly past their ship. Sleek,  with
huge blue flares from their engines, they're gunship fighters armed to
the teeth with missiles and laser turrets studding the fuselage.

                                NIOBE

                           "They're ours."

                         DEFENDER ONE (V.O.)

          "Hold on, folks, you're in for a little cleaning."


EXT. THE SURFACE

The wing  of DEFENDERS  makes short  work of  the squiddies.  The half
dozen clinging to FREEDOM'S hull  are picked off by well-placed  laser
shots  that  turn  the  squiddies into  curdling  balls  of  slag. The
squiddies that survive turn tail and run.


INT. NEB COCKPIT

The crew of the Neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they  leave
the scene of aerial carnage behind them.

NEO has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. He
relaxes his grip as their escape is clear. Their ship suddenly  enters
a cave, and starts  to descend. The blue  wash of the ship  shows rock
walls and pipes. The ships are slowing down as they descend back  into
the earth.

TANK'S shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair.

                                 TANK

                            "We're home."

                               TRINITY

          "Well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen."

                                 NEO

                            "What's that?"

                               MORPHEUS

 "A concentric ring of defenses that shields Zion. The fighters that
              just saved us constitute the first ring."

                             NIOBE (V.O.)

                    "Neb crew, you can relax now."

                               MORPHEUS

       "For the moment, perhaps. Its still a long drive home."

                                                              FADE OUT

and

FADE INTO:

TRINITY'S  CABIN.  At  first  we  see  only  stars  twinkling, faraway
diamonds on a black velvet background. The camera descends through the
darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. The artwork
terminates in the metal ring going  around her room. It's a much  more
hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The  articles
she's collected during  her time in  the resistance dot  the cabin. An
unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits  of
loved ones.

Softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO  is
sitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside  him
with her head on his lap.

Neo cant sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a   photo
of the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling,   laughing
as they are  seated around the  table. Morpeus, Tank,  Dozer,  Switch,
Epoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's   an
unknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely.

Gently,  placing  Trinity's head  down,  NEO stands  and  examines the
photo.

                             She awakens.

                               TRINITY

           "I'll have to take that one down now. Cypher..."

                                 NEO

                          "Who is this guy?"

                               TRINITY

                                "Who?"

                    NEO points to the mystery man.

                               TRINITY

                  "That was... I... forgot his name."

                                 NEO

                       "What happened to him?"

                          TRINITY is sullen.

                         "He didnt make it."

  NEO returns to the bed and sits down, disturbed. Trinity sits up,
                              awakening.

                                 NEO

                          "Was he like me?"

                            TRINITY nods.

                               TRINITY

      "Not you, though. Like you. There have been others, Neo."

                         "Aren't you tired?"

                                 NEO

                 "No. I've never been a big sleeper."

                               TRINITY

   "I know. I used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days."

               He turns to her, questions in his eyes.

                                 NEO

                  "How many 'ones' have there been?"

                               TRINITY

                       "That's not the point."

                        NEO may not think so.



                               TRINITY

                     "You are him. Youre mine."

                                 NEO

               "But what does it mean, to be The One?"

                               TRINITY

          "I don't know, Neo. Our mission was to find you."

                                 NEO

                           "So, now what?"

                               TRINITY

               "Now, Zion will give us a new mission."

              The hatch swings open. MORPHEUS peers in.

                               MORPHEUS

       "We're almost home. We'll need a detail. Five minutes."

                 HE closes the hatch and disappears.

                                 NEO

                        "Does he ever knock?"

                               TRINITY

                          "Not on his ship."

                                                               CUT TO:

INT. MAIN DECK, NEB

The crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes  to
a rest. Outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away. Tank   unlocks
the main hatch, then jumps as it drops, unpowered, slamming into   the
tarmac with a resounding smash.

                                                               CUT TO:

EXT. ZION TARMAC

The tarmac  is a  busy, crowded  military airport,  with hovercraft of
different  sizes  spread  across  the  lot.  Its  housed  poorly  lit,
houses in a cave so huge  the ceiling is out of site.  Crewpersons run
around,  servicing  battle-damaged   vehicles.  Munitions  are  carted
across the tarmac on   robot rolling racks. No  one  pays the NEB  and
its battered crew any mind.

Nearby, the SEPHORA and FREEDOM  are parked. Their engines shut  down,
and their powered hatches are open. The crewmembers are spilling out.

NIOBE hurries to MORPHEUS' side, and he steps toward her, smiling, but
their  military manner  is quickly  restored, though  they can  barely
contain their grins.

                               MORPHEUS

                              "Niobe..."

              SHE shakes his hand, the shake slows down.

                                 "M."

                               MORPHEUS

                       "Thanks for the rescue."

   THEY close for a kiss, when the FREEDOM'S captain suddenly jumps
                            between them.

    It's CHOI - the NEO's supposed neighbor and hacking financier.
    Exhuberant and oblivious, he joyfully gets in MORPHEUS' face.

                                 CHOI

 "Brough, you us your asses! We saved you so hard core you don't even
                                know!"

   NIOBE smiles at Morpheus and fades back as BOOTH shouts his own
           praises. Morpheus turns to his less-mature peer.

                                 CHOI

     "So, you think you finally found The One, huh? Another One?"

  DUJOUR, CHOI'S LIEUTENANT, pushes into their conversation, looking
                              offscreen.

                                DUJOUR

          "Idiot, we helped him find him. Hello, Morpheus."

                                 CHOI

                                "Huh?"

      He looks at what she's seeing. His gaze halts on NEO. He's
  concentrating on TANK and his apparent girlfriend, who seems to be
 consoling him. He turns to see CHOI and DUJOUR, does a double-take,
                       and his jaw drops open.

                                 NEO

                                "You?"

                  CHOI is quick to resume his cool.

                                 CHOI

                     "In the flesh, so to speak."

                                DUJOUR

       "Welcome to the real world, Neo. I'm glad you're here."

                                 CHOI

       "What do you think, Dujour? Should we take him with us?"

                                DUJOUR

                            "Definitely."

                                 CHOI

                             "Morpheus?"

 MORPHEUS turns from Niobe and  a Zion officer. He addresses  Trinity,
 glancing at the others.

                               MORPHEUS

"Go on ship's liberty. Meet me in the Dead Duck at 21:00 hours, drunk
                              or sober."


EXT. ZION STREET

It's like a  valley floor running  between two gigantic  walls of rock
that are  nearly vertical,  coming together  in an  elongated archway.
Carved into the street level  are innumerable stores and shops,  above
them,  apartments and  balconies that  rise to  the top  of the  arch.
People  flow  through the  street.  Their clothes  are  homespun wool,
denim, and leather. Dyes and  color are absent. Carved into  the solid
granite  walls,  between  homes  and  around  windows  and  doors, are
intricate and beautiful carvings.

NEO is lead down  the street by CHOI,  DUJOUR, and TRINITY, and  a few
other rebels. The push through a mult-culti crowd of people,  humanity
melting into one race.

                                 CHOI

"See, man? This is home. This is the main street. One of em, anyway.
       Almost everyone is a fighter. Sometimes, even the kids.

 THEY pass an outdoor workshop where youngsters are assembling small
                              machines.

                                 CHOI

 "Our energy as a people is directed toward liberation. Check it out,
                      here are some newcomers."

  A group of frail, buzz-cut androgonites pass by them. They look at
          NEO, recognizing him as one of them, a new comer.

                                 NEO

                     "Where did they come from?"

                                 CHOI

     "Energy plant we raided on our last mission. There were some
                             survivors."

                                 NEO

             "How are their minds freed from the Matrix?"

                               TRINITY

                          "With difficulty."

                                DUJOUR

                             "If at all."

They step into a club, Dead  Duck. Its a sailor joint. Lots  of wood,
beer on tap, and rum. Crewmembers of other ships recognize the rebels,
greeting them, as they eye Neo.  They take a booth in the  corner. The
waitress arrives.

                               WAITRESS

        "Welcome home, brothers and sisters. First day back?"

                                 CHOI

                            "Yes, lovely."

                               WAITRESS

                   "On the house, then. Four rums?"

                               TRINITY

                           "Make it eight."

        The waitress smirks and leaves. TRINITY turns to CHOI.

                               TRINITY

                          "Any casualties?"

                   CHOI lights up and takes a drag.

                                 CHOI

                  "Two. Sidewinder and Left-right."

                                DUJOUR

              "I cant believe Cypher turned. Bastard."



                                 CHOI

                        "He who loses faith..."

                                DUJOUR

  "Neo, we monitored your fight. Did you really gain enlightenment?"

                             NEO shrugs.

                                 NEO

                "All I know is I kicked Smiths ass."

                                 CHOI

"Fuckin finally, Jesus Christ. Its about time we iced that bastard."

                                DUJOUR

               "Yeah, we finally won against an agent?"

                                 CHOI

             "I guess 1 n 298 isnt a bed record, huh?"

               The drinks arrive. Tall glasses of rum.

    CHOI holds his glass aloft. They raise their glasses to toast.

                                 CHOI

                         "Live free or die."

                            ALL (save NEO)

                             "Live free."

They slam the rum back, and  slam empty glasses on the table.  NEO can
barely manage to sip his.

                                 NEO

                      "God, how do you do that?"

                               TRINITY

                     "Youve never drank before."

                                DUJOUR

                           "Not for real."

                                 CHOI

             "You want to know what being The One means?"

                                 NEO

                               "What?"

                                 CHOI

                    "One drink and youre toast."

                                DUJOUR


             "Neo, you know what else youve never done?"

She glances at  Trinity, who falls  back against the  seat, turning to
suppress a smile. Choi cracks up.

                                 NEO

                               "Yeah."

                                DUJOUR

                    "Yeah, youve never done it."

                                 CHOI

       "And virtual doesnt count, man, doesnt fucking count."

                                 NEO

                     "Well. Ill drink to that."

                                 CHOI

                            "Here, here."

This time, NEO follows the others and slams back the entire glass.  He
coughs and sputters as his friends and bar patrons cheer him on."


EXT. MAIN STREET, ZION

The lights are dim, and only a few late night revelers stagger through
the  streets  on their  way  back home.  Walking  straight and  calmly
through the stragglers are MORPHEUS and NIOBE.

                               MORPHEUS

            "So, how do you like having your own command?"

                                NIOBE

             "Its good. But trying. The responsibility..."

           THEY stop before the entrance to the DEAD DUCK.

                               MORPHEUS

          "You must be both mother and father to your crew."

NIOBE nods, and looks into the bar. Inside, the crews are raging drunk
and loud.

                                NIOBE

          "Who will you be now? The mother, or the father?"

              MORPHEUS peers in on the scene and grins.

                               MORPHEUS

   "As long as they dont get out of line, Ill just be a brother."


INT. DEAD DUCK

NEO is out of it, while the others are merely comfortably in the  bag.
Hes acting like a kid who broke into his fathers liquor cabinet.

                                 CHOI

        "So, you went back in, and you two pulled him out?"

TRINITY nods,  herself in  disbelief. NEO  picks his  head up  off the
table.

                                 NEO

                    "Kicked... kicked Smiths ass."

           CHOI eyes MORPHES and NIOBE coming toward them.

                                 CHOI

     "Hey, did you kick anybody elses ass, Neo? Like Morpheus?"

                                 NEO

             "Morpheus? Yeah, I smacked him around, too."

MORPHEUS arrives just  in time to  hear the last  part. He stands  and
grins down at NEO.

                               MORPHEUS

                 "So, you can smack me around, Neo?"

                                 NEO

                         "Oh yeah. Anytime."

MORPHEUS taps him on the forehead. NEO blinks and falls back into  the
booth. He stands before them.

                               TRINITY

                            "Hows Tank?"

                               MORPHEUS

 "Hes on bereavement leave with his mother. Dozer was the second son
                       shes lost in this war."

                    His comments set a sober tone.

                               MORPHEUS

  "The Nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month. But,
                    thats not giving us a rest."

                               TRINITY

         "Let me guess. Weve been ordered back out anyway."

                               MORPHEUS

 "Yes. This is another special op. Im in command, Niobe and Trinity
             are team leaders. Neo is our secret weapon."

     FLASH TO: NEO, passed out with his mouth open on the couch.

                               MORPHEUS

 "We dont know exactly what hes capable of. He may be just tapping
his potential, or he may have already reached it. We are to learn from
                      him, as he does from us."

                                 CHOI

"Why are we always getting screwed? Not only do I have to go straight
           back into the shit, but I lose my command, too?"

                               MORPHEUS

"Youve been assigned to this mission because youre the best, Choi."

                                DUJOUR

 "Yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents
                              to death."

                                 CHOI

 "Oh my God thats so funny. My point is, dont we need some r-and-r?
Unwind a little? We lost two crew on the last one, you lost like five,
   right? Shit. Im glad we found Mr. Invincible, here, but Jesus..."

                               MORPHEUS

            "You dont have to go, Choi. Volunteers only."

                               TRINITY

        "Hes got a point, M. I have faith, but why so quick?"

                               MORPHEUS

 "We have a chance, here, but the window of opportunity is brief. Our
 ships say the Matrix is already upgrading and re-coding to block our
                          entry. And Neos."

                                 CHOI

"Fuck. Every fucking time we get another one, this is what they do."

                               MORPHEUS

                         "He is the One."

                                DUJOUR

             "You havent lost the faith, have you Choi?"

        CHOI grabs a half-filled rum glass and swigs it down.

                                 CHOI

 "Well, these are the times that try mens souls. Heres to victory."


EXT. TUNNEL

The FREEDOM hovers  slowly, silently, like  a submarine as  it cruises
through  the murky  depths. It  suddenly comes  to a  quiet stop,  and
descends. The engines fade out, and the vessel rests, darkened, on the
cave.

A quartet of  SQUIDDIES slips by.  We follow as  they worm their  ways
through  the  twisted passageway,  watching  as they  pass  the bubble
cockpit by mere feet.

FREEZE on the cockpit. Within the shadows we see Morpheus and Choi  at
the controls.


INT. FREEDOM COCKPIT

           They watch the SQUIDDIES fade into the distance.

                               MORPHEUS

                       "Power up. Sleep mode."

                                 CHOI

                         "Aye aye, capitano."

MINIMAL cockpit displays turn on, and the cabin remains dark.


INT. MAIN DECK

The ships OPERATOR, a lean Asian  kid with a gaze like a  laser scan,
sits behind  NEO, whos  sitting at  the operators  console with  his
hands on the abbreviated keyboard. Trinity sits with them, her feet up
as she observes.

NEO  stares  at  the  screen. Its  a  huge  syllabus  of Matrix  code
characters. He struggles to learn the complex code.

                                 NEO

          "Ka equals 9. But reverse Ka is point-nine, right?

                             RAZOR nods.

                                RAZOR

                      "You catch on quick, man."

                                 NEO

"I know these symbols from the hacking trainer. But how come its so
                 hard to find them on the keyboard?"

                               TRINITY

"Your brain knows what to do. But it has to associate characters with
                             your body."

                                RAZOR

"Its muscle memory, Neo. Think of the space bar and your thumbs nail
it. Because your thumbs have hit the space bar millions of times. But
think about reverse ka, and your fingers dont hit automatically hit
            the reverse key and the ka key in one shot."

                                 NEO

             "Where did these symbols come from, anyway?"

                                RAZOR

"Most of it is from the old Japanese. Its Katakana. See, the machines
 arent binary. No zero and one. Theyre quantum-based, so instead of
   an open-close base of zero or one, open or closed, they use all
                    numbers between zero and one."

                                 NEO

"All numbers between zero and one. That could be an infinite number of
                              numbers."

                                RAZOR

                        "Not could be, it is."

                          NEO is astounded.

                                 NEO

            "Holy shit. How many calculations per second?"

                                RAZOR

"How many CPS? Well, thats kind of hard to estimate. Put it this way:
 picture all the particles in the known universe. Not just atoms, but
              sub-atomic particles that compose atoms."

                                 NEO

"OK. At last count that was what, a gazillion, right? Two gazillion?"

                   RAZOR barely smiles at the joke.

                                RAZOR

  "Well, its up there. In any case, the number of calculations per
second the Matrix can perform is greater than the estimated number of
                  particles in the known universe."

                                 NEO

                               "Woah."

                               TRINITY

  "Thats how they have the operating power to create entire worlds
                          within their PCs."

                                 NEO

 "OK. Thats why it looks like reality. They have the computing power
                      to create entire worlds."

                                RAZOR

                               "Right."

                                 NEO

  "So, if we hack into the Matrix, why cant we just change the code
                         while were at it?"

                                RAZOR

 "No, no. See, its not that simple. The machines, the programs that
 code, create, and maintain the Matrix, the agents, they are code.
    There are different types of agents, many work unseen with no
interaction in the matrix. Then, there are the enforcers, the ones we
                         know all too well."

                                 NEO

                               "Right."

                                RAZOR

 "Well, my point is, the machines code and recode the Matrix by pure
will. Interaction with the Matrix, the physical act of being there,
 by default, allows people to change their environment - the Matrix.
            They move objects, make sound, affect cause."

                                 NEO

                           "Like reality."

                               TRINITY

  "Almost. Reality is unalterable. But the fabric of reality in the
   Matrix can be rewoven. Some can reach beyond normal cause. Their
 affects on the Matrix are deeper than average. They have learned to
change it according to their needs. But they dont have total control.
Thats why we need operators like Razor here. But you, you go further
                         than any of us can."

                                 NEO


                                "How?"

RAZOR stands  and taps  Neos skull.  He stretches,  grabs a  Japanese
style  wooden  sword, and,  out  of boredom,  starts  performing slow,
precise Kendo moves around the main deck as he talks.

                                RAZOR

"The equipment you carry up here. Youre a freak. A good freak. Youre
  neural kinetics blast past those of average humans. This, combined
   with your ability to suspend disbelief, allow you to change the
                       reality of the Matrix."

                                 NEO

                   "How did I end up as... a freak?"

             RAZOR practices the same strike a few times.

                                RAZOR

  "Good question. The Machines create people through cloning, since,
obviously, no coppertops have physical sex. Theoretically, all clones
  in the Matrix are exactly the same as when the first clones. They
         shouldnt be any different from normal, homegrowns."

                                 NEO

                   "OK, so how do you explain me?"

                               TRINITY

      "Not just you. Morpheus, myself. We were all born inside.

                                 NEO

                "Well, what separates us from others?"

                               TRINITY

"For the past 50 years or so, something has been happening to children
 in the Matrix. Theyve been mutating, changing in ways the machines
   never predicted. Some seem to gain faster reflexes and strength.
                 Others seem to have psychic powers."

RAZOR looks up to see MORPHEUS,  hanging back as he listens. He  comes
forward.

                               MORPHEUS

  "And others are able to change the reality of the Matrix itself."

                          HE points to Neo.

                               MORPHEUS

                    "Discussing history, are we?"

                        RAZOR shakes his head.

                                RAZOR

 "Im trying to teach this fool some programming, man. Hes stuck in
     the 20^th century. Hes got no skills, man. Without us, hes
                              helpless."

                               MORPHEUS

            "In the Matrix, without him, were helpless."

                               TRINITY

         "Morpheus, can you tell us what the mission is now?"

                               MORPHEUS

  "Not until we reach broadcast depth. Its slow going out there. I
guess they know were coming back, so theyre patrolling. We have time
                         to rest and ready."


EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP, LATE DAY (CONSTRUCT)

TRINITY sits alone on the tip of an impossibly high finger of rock. It
looks like it sits on the rooftop of the world. All around her, as far
as the eye can see, lie mountains. Their snow-capped peaks are pink in
the sunset light.

She looks into the sunset. Heavy thoughts weigh on her mind.

A hand appears on her shoulder. Its NEO. How he got on the finger  of
rock is anyones guess.

                                 NEO

                                "Boo."

TRINITY grins slightly and pulls on his arm. There is only enough room
for one on the end of the rock, so he sits down behind her.

                               TRINITY

                      "Dont lose your balance."

                                 NEO

                     "It doesnt matter if I do."

                               TRINITY

                          "So, you can fly."

                                 NEO

                                "Yes."

                               TRINITY

                        "Do you think I can?"

                                 NEO

       "I think you can do anything you want, if you believe."

                               TRINITY

                             "Like you?"

                                 NEO

         "I dont know. I dont know exactly what I can do."

                         TRINITY half turns.

                               TRINITY

                     "Will you teach me to fly?"

                                 NEO

                       "I dont know if I can."

                               TRINITY

                      "Free your mind of doubt."

NEO stands, and steps in front of TRINITY. Hes on the very, very edge
of the rock.  He extends his  hand down to  her. She grabs  it, and he
hauls her up. Her eyes dart to the ground, thousands of feet below the
finger.

                               TRINITY

          "In this construct program, the ground can kill."

                                 NEO

                    "I wont let you fall. Ever."

THEY look  into each  others eyes.  Despite the  trauma theyve  been
through, and not even truly knowing one another, theres a connection.

NEO suddenly backs away. He walks on the air with perfect traction, as
though hes on an invisible plane of glass. He leaves TRINITY standing
precariously on  the edge,  wobbling a  bit as  she maintains  balance
against  nerves.  She  breathes  deep,  and  looks  back  up  at  NEO,
maintaining her cool even as she eyes the spectacle.

NEO stands a few  feet away from her,  completely at ease as  the high
altitude winds ruffle his hair.

NEO extends a hand to her.

                                 NEO

"Its not real, Trinity. Youre not standing there. Step out. I can do
                          it. You can, too."


With one last  glance at the  infinite drop, she  steadies herself and
stares straight into his eyes. Blue meet brown. Breathless, she  steps
straight out.

She takes one step in the  air. For a breathless second, as  she steps
off the edge,  she is stable.  When she takes  her foot off  the edge,
though, she sways,  and her foot  slips, as though  shes on a  greasy
surface bobbing up and down. She corrects herself, tries another step,
sags further.

                               TRINITY

                               "Shit."

SHE glances down, then locks eyes with NEO. Then drops like an anvil.



                                 NEO

                              "Whoops."

HE  dives down,  shooting like  a missile.  TRINITY is  calm, falling
backwards, watching NEO  come for her.  The rocky ground  looms behind
her. She makes no effort to reach for NEO as he draws close to her. HE
reaches for her with all his might.

                                 NEO

                              "Grab me!"

TRINITY makes no effort to save herself, even as collision is  seconds
away. She stares at him intently.

                                 NEO

                           "Grab on to me!"

SEEING she is doing  nothing, he goes beneath  her and scoops her  up,
Superman  style.  He  barely accomplishes  this  before  he slows  and
settles onto the rocky ground.

They are in a twilight glade shaded by the mountains.

                                 NEO

                   "What the hell were you doing?"

         TRINITY smiles slightly. Her madness has a purpose.

                               TRINITY

                         "Showing you, Neo."

                                 NEO

        "Showing me what? You nearly gave me a heart attack."

                               TRINITY

          "I want you to know how much faith I have in you."

                                 NEO

              "Oh. And this requires acts of insanity?"

TRINITY smiles. She looks him up and down. She moves intimately close.

                    "So, you really are Superman."

                                 NEO

                     "Only when Im plugged in."

 TRINITY steps away. NEO grabs her shoulder and turns her to him. He
                              attempts a

     kiss, but she turns her face, letting it land on her cheek.

                                 NEO

                               "What?"

              TRINITY looks at him, then up at the sky.

                               TRINITY

                   "Its not you. Just, not here."

           NEO doesnt understand. TRINITY rolls her eyes.

                               TRINITY

  "Theyre watching us, you big dope. Do you know how horny computer
                             geeks get?"


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

CHOI,  RAZOR,  DUJOUR, and  CIRCA  are sitting  around  the operators
console, feet up, eating. On the screens are patchy images of  TRINITY
and NEO standing together in  the GLADE. Its like theyre  watching a
soap opera.

TRINITY and NEO are looking in their direction.

ON THE interface chairs, the bodies of TRINITY and NEO lay supine.


EXT. GLADE (CONSTRUCT)

                    TRINITY grabs NEO by the arm.

                               TRINITY

                             "Over here."

                   SHE leads him into the shadows.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

THE VOYEURISTIC crewmembers collectively groan as the lovers disappear
off the screen and into the darkness.

RAZOR puts his hand on CIRCAS shoulder and sighs.

                                RAZOR

                            "So romantic."

CIRCA calmly pats his hand and removes it, holding it in front of him.

                                CIRCA

    "Im sure Mary Palmer will appreciate your mood more than I."


EXT. GLADE (CONSTRUCT)

IN the blue twilight shade, NEO and TRINITY kiss tentatively,  slowly,
then quicker as  they give in  to their feelings  for one another.  WE
move around them slowly, then pan into the shadows, a natural fadeout.


INT. OFFICE (MATRIX)

AGENTS  JONES and  BROWN sit  across from  each other,  a steel  table
between them.  They stare  at each  other for  what seems  like a long
time. There is a speaker phone in the middle of the table amidst  neat
stacks of file folders.

                             AGENT JONES

                      "Our defeat is worrisome."

                             AGENT BROWN

                  "As is the loss of our colleague."

  THEY ARE BOTH seething with anger. AGENT JONES grinds his molars.

                                JONES

            "We cant defeat them. You saw what happened."

                                JONES

              "We have a backup copy of Agent Smith..."

 JONES stands and walks toward the massive panoramic window. The city
                         spreads before him.

                                JONES

"A backup is not good enough. We need to upgrade ourselves to meet the
                             new threat."

                   BROWN opens a large file folder.

                                BROWN

   "Hes being rebuilt. But I have an alternate plan. Why fight the
             humans, when we can let them fight for us?"

                                JONES

 "The terrorists have learned to bend our reality in ways we cannot.
                  This was the cause of our defeat."

                                BROWN

 "Mr. Thomas J. Anderson is not unique. Over the decades, many humans
 have developed... techniques for manipulating the Matrix. Techniques
     too primitive for us to understand. Most never realize their
potential, but all the ones weve noticed exhibiting these talents are
                           recorded here."

ANGLE ON the book as BROWN flips through. Street shots of people  from
all walks of life. Young rebels, corporate suits, junkies, housewives.

                     JONES turns on AGENT BROWN.

                                JONES

                    "Do you have anyone in mind?"

ANGLE ON the book. It stops  on a page dedicated to someone  who looks
like NEO, but with long hair and an extremely bad attitude. There  are
photos of him on  a motorcycle with a  blonde, photos of him  drinking
with his gang friends.

                                BROWN

  "Gregory Lowfield. He exhibits the traits we saw in Mr. Anderson."

                          MANS VOICE (O.S.)

  "Mr. Anderson no longer exists. Our enemy now is the one called...
                               NEO."

                          ANGLE ON: THE DOOR

AGENT SMITH walks in, grinning. There  is a new swag to his  walk, and
his hair is longer, tied back.

                                BROWN

                       "Youve been recreated."

SMITH flexes his arm, examines his hands, and feels his hair.

                                JONES

                      "And you have more hair."

SMITH turns to him, examines the photos on the table. They lock  eyes.
On  the same  wavelength, they  transfer knowledge  without speaking.
SMITH looks at the photo on the table.

                                SMITH

    "I know what youre thinking. What we need is our own Neo..."

                                JONES

                         "If its possible."

                                SMITH

                       "Ill make it possible."

WE ZOOM in on the grainy photo of NEOs doppledanger. Quiet at  first,
growing  louder as  it grows  dark, we  here the  rumble and  roar of
motorcycles.


EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY (NIGHT)

FAR OFF  in the  distance, the  glow of  motorcycle headlights  racing
toward us. As we zoom out and focus in, they are already too close  to
avoid.  They  rip  by  us, thundering  explosions  and  men  and women
cheering.

THE pack of about ten bikers and their women dont wear helmets.  They
fly down the highway using both lanes, drinking and driving with total
abandon.


ANGLE ON the lead  motorcycle, a massive, custom-made  Harley. GREGORY
LOWFIELD, Thomas J. Anderson without  a desk job, without cares,  revs
his bike and locks  the accelerator. He hands  his beer to the  blonde
who rides behind him, then, in one swift motion, jumps up on his seat,
leaning into the slipstream.

                       The feat is IMPOSSIBLE.

HIS GIRLFRIEND,  CHANDRA, screams  at him  as she  grasps the seat and
lowers herself to the bike.

                               CHANDRA

                    "Greg, are you fucking crazy?"

                                 GREG

                       "Yes. But dont worry."

She clings to  his legs as  they barrel down  the highway. They  blast
pass a darkened cruiser.


INT. CRUISER

The cop sets his paper down just long enough to catch a glimpse of the
pack exploding down the highway, with GREGORY surfing his bike.

ANGLE ON: the radar gun. Its flashing 125 MPH

                                 COP

                    "Holy shit. Drunk ass punks."


EXT. HIGHWAY

GREGORY is facing us as he  drops back into his seat, taking  his beer
on cue from CHANDRA. Behind them, the cops lights flare up.

                               GREGORY

              "Oh boy. Stop, stop, lets have some fun."


INT. COP CAR

WE look  through the  windshield as  the cop  drives down the highway,
calling in his  stop-vehicle report. He  suddenly sees something  that
makes him slam on the brakes.

                                 COP

                             "Holy shit!"

ANGLE THROUGH the  cops windshield. The  ten bikers, with  GREGORY at
their center, are  parked in the  middle of the  road, looking at  him
casually."


EXT. ROAD

THE cruiser comes to  a stop mere inches  from GREGORYS leg. The  COP
bursts out of the door.

                                 COP

                    "What the hell are you doing?"

                               GREGORY

 "Well tell you when to stop, little man. Not the other way around."

                                 COP

                               "Fuck."

HE DIVES back into his cruiser, reaching for the radio. GREGORY  pulls
a huge silver .44 from his jacket and FIRES. The cruisers antenna  is
blown off at the  base, and the nine-foot  whip flips onto the  ground
with a metallic clang.


INT. CRUISER

The COP is  lying half-on the  seat, taking cover.  The handset relays
only static. He reaches for his gun, but is frozen by Gregorys voice.

                               GREGORY

  "Dont try anything stupid, man. I gotta bead on your donut-eating
                                ass."


EXT. CRUISER

                 The cop comes out with his hands up.

                                 COP

                       "Whaddya want with me?"

                               GREGORY

"I dont know. I just thought Id find out what you wanted without you
                shooting at me. So, what do you want?"

THE COP is a tough one. Far taller than GREGORY, muscular and serious.

                                 COP

                      "Youre all under arrest."

THE PACK explodes with laughter. GREGORY walks up to the policeman and
circles him, keeping the gun pointed in the business direction.

                               GREGORY

 "This is your lucky day, officer. Were gonna give you a night off."

CHANDRA walks up to him. Seductively, she hands him the bottle of hard
liquour.

                               CHANDRA

                               "Drink."

WHEN  he  pauses,   GREGORY  places  the   gun  against  his   temple.
Reluctantly, the big cop starts to gulp down the alcohol.

GREGORY lowers the gun. He and CHANDRA return to their motorcycle.

                               GREGORY

                    "You never even saw us, man."

                               CHANDRA

                          "Keep the bottle."

THEY start their bikes and are gone, like ghosts, into the shadows  of
the road.

                                                               CUT TO:


EXT. BEACH

A CAMPFIRE blazes only a few  feet away from the high tide.  A billion
stars shine overhead as GREGORY and his biker gang, including the cop,
sit or  lie around  the fire.  A few  people are  still awake, and one
picks drunkenly at a guitar.

GREGORY stands,  throws a  blanket over  his shoulder,  and scoops  up
CHANDRA. They make their way into the dunes.


EXT. DUNES

GREGORY  and  CHANDRA  lie  on  the  blanket,  staring  at  the   sky.
Inexplicably, GREGROY holds a hand toward the sky.

                               GREGORY

                       "Which one do you want?"

                               CHANDRA

                    "Any one. It doesnt matter."

WITH his hand pointed lazily at the sky, a single star starts  glowing
stronger  and stronger.  It vibrates,  then fades  suddenly and  comes
loose from the sky, and becomes a meteorite, burning across the sky.

        CHANDRA draws closer to him, enraptured by his power.

                               CHANDRA

                     "How do you do it, Gregory?"

                               GREGORY

   "I dont know. Sometimes it feels like... Im reaching beyond the
                               world."

HIS hand drops and his head turns. He sits up, startled by something.

                               CHANDRA

                            "What is it?"

            GREGORY holds up a hand for her to be silent.

                               GREGORY

                 "They found us. Cant you hear it?"

                               CHANDRA

                    "What? I dont hear anything."

                               GREGORY

  "We can only rebel so long. We can only push until they will hit
                                back."

                               CHANDRA

                     "They? The Men in Black?"

CU on GREGORY. In the distance, the faintest sound of a helicopter can
                      be heard, growing louder.

                               GREGORY

                      "Fuck! Get to the bikes."


EXT. CAMPFIRE

GREGORY bursts over the hill, holding hands with CHANDRA as they  run.
Hes only had  time to through  on his boots  and boxers and  grab his
.44. Chandra is  dressed only in  her underwear and  Gregorys leather
jacket.

                               GREGORY

            "Wake up! Get on your bikes and fucking ride!"

HIS gang burst to their feet. They scramble through the dunes, heading
for their bikes.

A HELICOPTER, seen only by its massively strong search lamp, and  the
wind from its  rotors blowing sand  everywhere, flies up  and over the
dunes, buzzing the running pack, blowing some off their feet.

GREGORY mounts his bike and CHANDRA jumps on back. WITH A WAVE OF  HIS
HAND, all  the bikes,  his included,  drop into  neutral and  rev into
start. Their  headlights blaze  as the  helicopter returns,  joined by
another.

                         CHOPPER LOUDSPEAKER

       "THIS IS THE POLICE, STOP YOUR VEHICLES AND SURRENDER!"

SUDDENLY, automatic fire sparks from the unseen helicopters. A  bullet
trail stitches its way  across a pair of  bikers, sending them to  the
ground as the helicopters fly overhead.

GREGORY cranks down on the throttle and his bike explodes ahead.


EXT. HIGHWAY

THE pack splits  up in two  directions as the  distant choppers circle
back. GREGORY cuts the lights on  his bike and follows the highway  by
starlight.


INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT

TINNY RADIO chatter fills the  red-lit cockpit over the steady  hum of
the  engines. The  nose of  the chopper  points to  the ground  as  it
focuses on GREGORY and CHANDRA, who are ripping down the highway.

CU on the cockpit instruments, centered on the airspeed indicator. The
needle is pushing to the max, going through 150 knots.

                             PILOT (V.O.)

                   "Holy shit, hes outrunning us."

                                                               CUT TO:


EXT. HIGHWAY

GREGORY is pasted down to the  tank of his bike with CHANDRA  gripping
him for her life. The slipstream pulls his lips open and tears  streak
from his eyes as his bike redlines in fifth gear. The helicopters grow
smaller behind them. They break chase.

CHANDRA looks back and sees the lights turn away. She screams over the
wind and the roar.

                               CHANDRA

                           "Theyre gone!"

               GREGORY is staring down a dark highway.

                               GREGORY

                          "Cant see shit."

HE turns the headlights  back on, just in  time to see a  ROADBLOCK of
heavy duty military trucks. In front  of the trucks is a sandbag  wall
manned by soldiers. The trucks are flanked by police cars. And if  one
looks closely enough, they  can see a pair  of AGENTS standing to  the
side.

THE stunned soldiers have time to fire off a couple shots as they  run
frantically to get  out of the  way of the  bike, 800 pounds  of metal
flying at 150 miles per hour.

GREGORY  plows  into the  sandbag  wall, directly  between  two parked
trucks. The wall parts in  an explosion of sand and  sandbags. THEYRE
THROUGH, but the bike scissors  uncontrollably, until it rolls and  we
drop into bullet-time.

AS the bike goes  over, we watch from  the side as GREGORY  dismounts,
grabbing CHANDRA as he  steps over onto the  safe side of the  bike. A

massive shower of sparks bursts and trails the bike. It tumbles like a
bullet  falling  through syrup,  and  GREGORY keeps  walking  over the
rotating surface, using  the bike to  protect him and  CHANDRA against
the flesh-ripping concrete.

THE bike is coming apart  as its bashed against the  concrete. Pieces
rise slowly into the air -  the front wheel, the forks, the  mufflers,
and a million flakes  of metal, until the  body bounces into the  air,
carrying GREGORY  and CHANDRA  up. Holding  her to  him - shes barely
conscious of the lightning-fast  crash, GREGORY rides the  flying body
with one hand on the frame. It comes crashing down and back into  real
time.


THE  bikes body  streaks along  the highway.  The sparks  fade as  it
slows, and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them.
They  stop,  crouching  atop the  body,  with  GREGORY crouching  over
CHANDRA. The disembodied front wheel rolls past them.

STUNNED,  not quite  understanding how  or what  he just  did, he  and
CHANDRA stand and start running. BEHIND  them is a blurry wall of  red
and blue lights. POLICE SIRENS grow louder.

THEY start running down the  highway, then GREGORY yanks CHANDRA  to a
stop.

                               GREGORY

                   "Split up, into the desert, go!"

                             THEY split.

CU on CHANDRA. In bare feet, she sprints for the side of the road. The
highway is  littered with  pieces of  the bike,  and she  stomps on  a
twisted piece of metal  that impales her bare  foot. She falls to  the
asphalt with a scream.

GREGORY turns  and rushes  back to  her, even  as a  police cruiser is
bearing down on them, its V-8 roaring and the siren IMPOSSIBLY LOUD.

GREGORY drops  to her  side, only  to look  up into  the blinding high
beams. He  drops over  CHANDRA, ducks  his head  and extends  his hand
toward the oncoming cruiser and we drop back into BULLET TIME.

THE CRUISER  runs into  his hand  and stops  as though  it hit a steel
post. The hood crumples  in the center, pushing  the grill in even  as
the front quarter  panels of the  unibody continue around  GREGORY and
CHANDRA.


INT. CRUISER

THE ENGINE smashes in through  the console, pushing the cops  apart as
the glass windshield explodes and  their seats slide forward into  the
console, smashing them like jelly.


CU: GREGORY AND CHANDRA

WITH  HIS  HAND  still  on  the  grille,  CHANDRA  AND  GREGORY remain
untouched, even as the entire police cruiser rips around them. WE drop
back into REAL  time and see  the cruisers body  rip over and  around
them. The grille and engine block and part of the mangled transmission
remain still against  GREGORYS HAND. The  cruiser was gutted,  like a
banana shot down the center from top to bottom. It speeds beyond them,
silent now, flips and explodes.

THE ENGINE block is suspended a few  feet in the air. It drops to  the
ground with a thud.

GREGORY and CHANDRA get to their  feet and run into the early  morning
desert.


CU: GUTTED CRUISER

UNBELIEVABLY, the driver is still alive... barely. The steering  wheel
is smashed deep  into his mouth,  splitting his jaw  open. Wet, broken
chokes emanate from his blood-filled mouth. His eyes flicker, and just
before they close forever, his body is seized by pain as he MORPHS.


EXT. GUTTED CRUISER

THE CRUMPLED DOOR is knocked out  of the frame. WE SEE a  black loafer
step from the vehicle and a man in an immaculate black suit steps  out
slowly.

WE rise  up from  the loafer.  As the  other cruisers  catch up to the
scene of the accident, AGENT BROWN watches. He looks into the desert.

                A POLICE lieutenant approaches BROWN.

                              LIEUTENANT

                       "Sir, should we pursue?"

                             AGENT BROWN

 "Withdraw your men and pursue the others. We have our own plans for
                              this one."


INT. MAIN BRIDGE (NIGHT)

The ship is  quiet. RAZOR sits  at the operator  console, smashing the
keyboard as he forces Tetris pieces into place.


INT. COCKPIT

CHOI is sipping coffee as he nudges the ship to a stop. He speaks into
his headphones.

                                 CHOI

                          "OK, try it here."


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

RAZOR halts his video game playing and flashes to a different  screen.
Lines of code come pouring down the screen as he types, then hits  the
ENTER key with a flourish. The screen flashes, and the familiar scroll
of the MATRIX cascades down the screens.

                                RAZOR

                             "Holy shit."

                                                               CUT TO:

INT. MAIN BRIDGE

                                 CHOI

                   "What? Tell me you got signal."

                             RAZOR (V.O.)

      "No fucking shit I got signal. Dude, theyre changing it."

                           CHOI is annoyed.

                                 CHOI

                "Are you using the right pulse wave?"

                                                               CUT TO:

INT. MAIN BRIDGE

                                RAZOR

                "Shut the fuck up and get back here."

THE  MATRIX  scroll  pours  down  at  a  streaking  pace.  Its almost
impossible to make out the individual characters.

                      CHOI comes up behind RAZOR

                                 CHOI

                    "Oh my God. What are they - "

                                RAZOR

                    "Theyre changing the Matrix."

                                 CHOI

                           "Call Morpheus."

RAZOR patches into MORPHEUS cabin through the headset.


INT. MORPHEUS CABIN

ITS dark, but  quiet classical music  can be heard.  Hes not in  bed
alone. NIOBES shaded form can be made out behind him.

MORPHEUS sounds awake,  but looks anything  but. He grabs  the buzzing
handset only an arms length from him.

                               MORPHEUS

                             "Im here."

                                RAZOR

                   "Sir, you gotta get down here."

MORPHEUS starts  dressing as  he talks.  He puts  a reasurring hand on
NIOBES shoulder.

                               MORPHEUS

                          "Proximity alarm?"

                                RAZOR

             "The Matrix, sir. The coding is going nuts."

                               MORPHEUS

                          "Be right there."

MORPHEUS hangs  up the  phone and  jumps into  his boots.  He turns to
NIOBE as he works.

                               MORPHEUS

    "It sounds bad. Theyre readjusting quicker than we thought."

                 NIOBE jumps up and dresses quickly.

                                NIOBE

                              "Already?"

                               MORPHEUS

          "It appears that they are learning their lessons."

                        NIOBE shakes her head.

           "Morpheus, how much are you going to tell him?"

                           MORPHEUS pauses.

                               MORPHEUS

            "Tell Neo? About his predecessors, I suppose?"

                        NIOBE, dressed, nods.

                               MORPHEUS

                           "He is the -"

                   NIOBE puts a finger to his lips.

                                NIOBE

                   "Six came before him, Morpheus."

                   MORPHEUS shakes his head slowly.

                               MORPHEUS

"To me, none came before him. The Oracle told me I would find the one.
          It is prophecy. You havent seen what he can do."

                                NIOBE

       "What if they toughen the Matrix code, like last time?"

                               MORPHEUS

 "There are lots of ifs. How about this one: What if we lose faith in
                             our cause?"

  HE disappears through the door, leaving Niobe standing in the dim
                                light.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

                 MORPHEUS leans over RAZOR and CHOI.

                               MORPHEUS

                            "Talk to me."

                                RAZOR

         "Not good, boss, I gotta compile a new descrambler."



                            MORPHEUS nods.

                               MORPHEUS

                  "Do it. Were at broadcast depth?"

                                 CHOI

                              "Yes sir."

                               MORPHEUS

"We have to download our mission specs. Move aside, I have to log into
                           the mainframe."

MORPHEUS  takes  over  RAZORS  seat.  The  scrolling  code disappears,
replaced by the small words: ZION.dtr1.mnfr4m3 LOGON.

MORPHEUS pushes  the keyboard  under the  console so  its hidden  from
view. He taps at the  keyboard. Hidden password appears on  the screen
in the form of: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

              SCREEN: LOGON ACCEPTED. WELCOME, MORPHEUS.

                     MISSION SPECS DOWNLOADING...

                              DOWNLOADED

                           LOGOUT COMPLETE

               MISSION TYPE: INFILTRATION / DESTRUCTION

                       TARGET: MATRIX MAINFRAME

MORPHEUS eyes open slightly when he reads the screen, but he  regains
his  composure  quickly. RAZORS  mouth  drops open,  and  CHOI starts
cracking up.

                                 CHOI

"The mainframe? Haha. Its a joke, right Morpheus? Is today April 1^st
                                  ?"

                      NIOBE appears behind them.

                                NIOBE

        "Its not a joke. We have The One. We must do it now."

                                RAZOR

  "But theyre altering the code already. I cant even read it yet."

                    MORPHEUS turns and faces them.

                               MORPHEUS

 "We have our mission, but its up to us to interperate how well do
                                 it."

                                RAZOR

 "Morpheus, theres more ice in front of that mainframe than there is
           in Antarctica. Well never cut through it all."

                               MORPHEUS

                "You havent seen The One in action."

            RAZOR looks dubious, and turns to the screens.

                               MORPHEUS

                          "Can you hack in?"

RAZOR pounds the keys. The Matrix disappears, replaced by his program.

                                RAZOR

   "Getting you in is no problem. Maintaining the input/output and
helping you is the problem. Thats how they killed savior number four,
 if I remember right. They cut the signal and trapped him in there."

MORPHEUS spins the chair, then stops it. Their faces are inches apart.

                               MORPHEUS

                    "We dont speak of the past."

                                RAZOR


          "Excuse me for dragging up painful memories, sir."

HE turns the chair back to the screen and continues coding.


CUT TO: NEO

Hes standing at  the edge of  some equipment on  the Main Deck.  Hes
heard every word. He rounds the corner. The others catch sight of him.
The same thought is on everyone's mind: How much had he heard.

                               MORPHEUS

"Morning. Niobe, wake the rest of the crew. Razor, whats the ETA for
                        getting us in there?"

                        RAZOR shakes his head.

                                RAZOR

 "I dunno. Just gimme an hour, Ill probably have caught up to them."

                      MORPHEUS walks up to NEO.

                               MORPHEUS

                           "Come with me."


                                                               CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT (DAY)

FROM FAR AWAY, we see GREGORY and CHANDRA hiding under the only bit of
shade available for miles, a tiny outcropping of rock. We sail in  and
cut to a panning shot, scanning over the harsh ground, onto  CHANDRAS
feet, clad in Gregorys boots, up her sun-scorched and scratched legs.
Shes collapsed onto Gregory. Hes in equally bad shape. Gregory leans
with his back against the rock, eyes opening and closing as he  drifts
in and out of sleep.

                             GREGORY POV

He  stars at  the horizon  and the  mirages of  water reflecting  the
jaundiced yellow sky. In the  shimmering distance, a man appears,  but
Gregorys lids  shut and  we see  darkness. When  he reopens them, the
figure is more clear. Its a man, dressed in a black suit. Even in the
distance we can recognize him. We want it to be him.


EXT. DESERT ROCK

GREGORY  can  barely come  to  his senses  as  the figure  approaches.
CHANDRA doesnt even wake.


EXT. DESERT

We follow the figure at waist heigh as it approaches GREGORY. It comes
to a stop just in front of him.


EXT. DESERT ROCK

GREGORY is fully  awake, but he  thinks hes dreaming.  He reaches out
and pokes the black-clad leg of the immaculate man standing before him
- a man who doesnt sweat even in the sauna heat. He looks up, but the
glaring sun obscures the face.

           GREGORYs voice is raspy as he starts to speak.

                               GREGORY

                     "Oh my God. Its... The Man."

                             MAN IN BLACK

      "Ive been searching for you for a long time, my friend."

                       GREGORY lowers his head.

                             MAN IN BLACK

                       "We need you, Gregory."

                               GREGORY

                             "What for?"

                             MAN IN BLACK

                         "To save our world."

GREGORYS FACE  RAISES, THE  MAN IN  BLACK eclipses  the sun  with his
head, making a hallo of hazy sunlight around an all-too familiar face:
AGENT SMITH.

GREGORYS head drops back down. He strokes CHANDRAS hair.

                               GREGORY

                     "Its too late. Were dead."

                             AGENT SMITH

                        "Do you want to live?"

                               GREGORY

                             "What for?"

                             AGENT SMITH

   "A better life for all. Life for her. And for you, a chance for
                              revenge."

                       GREGORY raises his head.



AGENT SMITH grins. He turns away, and the desert landscape before them
turns into a soothing, cool,  crystal forest lake. Smith takes  a step
toward it, then turns and extends his hand.

                             AGENT SMITH

                            "Interested?"

GREGORY  is  mystified.  Speechless, he  drags  himself  to his  feet,
hoisting Chandra, and steps toward the lake.

                               GREGORY

                        "This cant be real."

           HE steps forward, only to have the image recede.

                             AGENT SMITH

                        "You this, dont you?"

                               GREGORY

                                "Yes."

                             AGENT SMITH

                         "Will you help us?"

                               GREGORY

                             "Anything."

CU:  SMITH  extends his  hand.  GREGORY grasps  it.  He lets  go,  and
collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake edge.


EXT. LAKE SHORE

THE  DESERT  is  gone,  replaced by  forest,  though  still  under the
poisoned sky of the Matrix.

GREGORY laps  the water  up, and  pulls CHANDRA  in, rubbing the water
over her face. Calmly, AGENT SMITH stands on the lake shore.

CU:  AGENT SMITH.  The humans  are reflected  in his  perfectly still
glasses.

CHANDRA  stirs and  awakens, though  she doesnt  seem to  see  SMITH.
GREGORY,  revitalized, looks  around at  the miracle,  and up  at the
mystery man.

                               GREGORY

                       "Who the fuck are you?"

                       SMITH grins devilishly.

                             AGENT SMITH

  "Im nobody. A Smith. Whats more important, is you. We need you,
                              Gregory."

GREGORY stares. He pulls CHANDRA ashore and stands to look AGENT SMITH
in the eyes.

                               GREGORY

             "First you try to kill me. Now you need me."

                             AGENT SMITH

   "Two years ago, Gregory, your parents were killed in a terrorist
                  attack in the heart of the city."

             THE words spark something nasty in GREGORY.

                               GREGORY

                              "So what?"

                             AGENT SMITH

          "The terrorists were led by a certain individual."

                               GREGORY

                         "I know who it was."

                             AGENT SMITH

                      "We need you to kill him."

GREGORY laughs he turns to CHANDRA  to check on her. Shes passed  out
on the smooth grass.

                               GREGORY

"What a bunch of bullshit. The whole government cant kill him, so how
                               can I?"

                             AGENT SMITH

           "No one in the government can do what you can."

                               GREGORY

                             "Fuck you."

                             AGENT SMITH

                     "I believe we have a deal."

           GREGORY stands and puts his face next to SMITHS

 "You know, Ive always wanted to fuck the devil on a deal. And this
     looks like a once-in-a lifetime opportunity. So, FUCK YOU!"

SMITH frowns. GREGORY looks him up and down. Hes got a few inches and
pounds on the smaller agent.

                               GREGORY

  "What are you gonna do, little man? You looking for a trip to the
fucking hospital? Fuck with me and youll be looking for some plastic
                           surgery, you - "

SMITH delivers a  chest punch that  sends GREGORY sailing  back twenty
feet. He tumbles to a stop, coughs, and stares in disbelief at  SMITH,
standing calmly at what seems like an impossible distance away.

CU: SMITH. HE removes his glasses calmly.

CU: GREGORY. He was stunned, but hes  not out of the fight. Not by  a
long shot.

                               GREGORY

                        "No man can beat me."

                                SMITH

                        "Bring it on, pussy."

                    Pull back as he CHARGES SMITH

SMITH is ready to deflect the  blow, but GREGORY dodges and bowls  him
over, barroom style.  With SMITH pinned  below him, he  slams his palm
downward. SMITHS head dodges the blow that pummels the ground.

GREGORY is  screaming as  he smashes  downward with  the palms  of his
heels. Every blow misses the mark.

                               GREGORY

                   "Mother fucker, what the fu -?"

SMITH bucks up, throwing GREGORY into the air. He flips onto his  back
as GREGORY returns. The  sheer force of his  street-forged roundhouses
knock SMITH around  as he blocks.  Growing irritated at  the untrained
attack, SMITH turns a block into a palm-heel that hits GREGORY in  the
forehead with  the force  of a  cannon blast.  Momentarily stunned, he
steps back enough for SMITH to perform a roundhouse kick. Its like  a
helicopter blade, smashing into GREGORYS head and sending him to  the
ground in a heap.

                                SMITH

                     "Ready to change your mind?"

CU: GREGORY

HE cant  respond very  well. Blood  fills his  mouth and  his face is
mashed. A huge welt grows under  the loafer mark left by SMITH  on the
right side of his face.

                    SMITH crouches down by GREGORY

                                SMITH

               "I can teach you to beat me, you know."

                       THIS interests GREGORY.

                                SMITH

       "Help us, and both you and her will be free afterward."

GREGORY  stares  at the  ground,  then gazes  past  SMITH at  CHANDRA.
Finally, he starts to rise. SMITH offers a hand, and GREGORY takes it.

                                SMITH

"You know it, dont you? That theres more to your world than what you
              can see, what you can rationally explain?"

                               GREGORY

                               "Yeah."

                                SMITH

"Im going to teach you how to use the powers you cant even imagine.
               But first, you need to learn to fight."

SMITH puts his hand to his earpiece. GREGORYS eyes close and his body
SPASMS. He falls to the ground, breathless, and when his eyes open, he
stares up at SMITH.

                               GREGORY

                       "Holy shit. What the -"

HE stares at his hands. He sits up, and watches his hands, amazed,  as
he goes through a series of  block-punches. He stops and stares up  at
SMITH.

                               GREGORY

                           I know Kung-Fu."

                             SMITH grins.


INT. COCKPIT (NIGHT)

MORPHEUS and  NEO sit  together. The  cockpit lights  are dimmed down,
only the EMP pulse button glows.  Outside the ship, in the dark  mists
of the underworld,  patches of eerie  phosphorescent moss glow  on the
walls. Occasionally, a squiddie will pass over the darkened ship.

           The two of them watch the deadly outside world.

                               MORPHEUS

                   "Were deep in their territory."

                                 NEO

                            "I see that."

 MORPHEUS stares out at the night, deep in thought. He turns to NEO.

                               MORPHEUS

                          "Are you rested?"

                                 NEO

                                "Yes."

                               MORPHEUS

              "You know now, that you had predecessors."

                                 NEO

                      "Yes. Ive heard things."

                               MORPHEUS

                       "What types of things?"

                                 NEO

  "That there were others, like me, who you thought were going to be
                  special. But they ended up dead."

                        MORPHEUS nods slowly.

                               MORPHEUS

   "Its true. There were others. And I didnt tell you right away.
                     Because you were not ready."

                              NEO nods.

                               MORPHEUS

                        "Does this anger you?"

                                 NEO

 "I dont know yet. So much has happened so fast, that I cant decide
 whether or not Im angry, or dissappointed, or even if I should be."

                               MORPHEUS

  "You shouldnt be, Neo. You are the key in the Oracles prophecy.
     Everything forseen to come to pass, has, except one thing."

                                 NEO

                               "What?"

                               MORPHEUS

                   "The destruction of The Matrix."

                MORPHEUS looks out into the darkness.

                               MORPHEUS

 "Your coming was heralded, and it is my destiny to prepare the world
  for you, and to baptize you by fire. But from here on out, no one
                               knows."

                                 NEO

                       "Can we ask The Oracle."

                               MORPHEUS

                         "Not in this life."

                           NEO is confused.

                               MORPHEUS

  "No one has heard from her or her priestesses since the day Cypher
                            turned on us."

                         NEO is taken aback.

                                 NEO

           "But she must have known, if they came to her."

                               MORPHEUS

                          "Perhaps she did."

                         NEO shakes his head.

                                 NEO

"I cant believe it. I dont know, Morpheus, if Im prepared for this
        war. Im not a soldier. How, how are we going to win?"

                               MORPHUES

   "For decades, we have fought force-on-force, in the real world,
 without a conclusion. Now, after nearly a century of war, were at a
standstill. The only way that we can see to win is by destroying their
source of energy. We have to pull the plug on them. We must crash the
                               Matrix."

                        MORPHEUS grins slyly.

                               MORPHEUS

  "Remember, when I told you, that Ill show you how deep the rabbit
                             hole goes?"

                                 NEO

                                "Yes."

                               MORPHEUS

 "I brought you deep, yet I no longer know the way. No one does. With
 every second we sink deeper than before. You are our guiding light,
now. Your powers exceed mine a millionfold. I have shown you the path
                  to victory, Neo. Lead us down it."


INT. MAIN DECK

MORPHEUS, NEO, TRINITY, CHOI, and  NIOBE are on the chairs  as theyre
being JACKED IN by CIRCA and RAZOR.

CUT TO: RAZOR jumps in the  operators chair, his hands blur over  the
touchscreens and keyboard as he drops his crewmates into the Matrix.

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

            "Were going straight for the throat, people."

ANGLE ON: RAZOR and CIRCA  typing like made at their  keyboards. RAZOR
hits the ENTER  key. They look  on, transfixed with  anticipation. The
screaming Matrix code grinds to a readable halt. The slap each others
hands and continue hacking.

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

"We have the advantage of surprise. They wont expect us to return so
                                soon."


INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

THE FIVE  of them  stand, immobile,  around a  ringing phone  as their
minds filter in to their body images. They are dressed practically  in
denim  and leather,  like blue  collar workers.  Their dress  wouldnt
attract the slightest  bit of attention,  except for the  padded coats
and tote bags filled with firepower.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

                                CIRCA

 "Keep your eyes out for changes, theyre modifying things. Dial 0
                            for operator."


INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

                 MORPHEUS holds his celly to his ear.

                             CIRCA (O.S.)

                        "And have a nice day."

        HE drops the phone into his pocket. They turn to him.

                               MORPHEUS

"Niobe, youre the liasion to our operators. Neo, what do you have for
                            a game plan?"

                                 NEO

                      "Where is the mainframe?"

                               MORPHEUS

                      "The Metacortex building."

                           NEOs jaw drops.

                                 NEO

               "What the fuck? Thats where I worked."

                                 CHOI

 "And what do you think you were doing there, writing code for video
                games? You were working for The Man."

                               TRINITY

   "Its true, Neo. Metacortex employs humans to write code for the
                               Matrix."

                                 NEO

           "I thought I was working on a fucking database."

                               MORPHEUS

  "They keep the left hand from seeing what the right hand is doing.
 Thats how an evil system can be made by innocent people. But, that
                           doesnt matter."

                            NEO recovers.

                                 NEO

"How bout this? I just walk up to the Metacortex building and blow it
                                 up?"

                             CHOI laughs.

                                 CHOI

                      "What, by power of will?"

        NEO nods. CHOIS smile fades. He looks to the others.

                                 CHOI

                         "Hes joking right?"

                      MORPHEUS shakes his head.

                               MORPHEUS

"Well fan out around the city, keeping an eye out for you. If youre
able to accomplish this mission, well phase back into the ship. Stay
 in contact. If you lose your cell, contact an operator immediately."


EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

THE five  of them  exit. They  blend into  the crowds  on the  street,
anonymous and  quiet. MORPHEUS  looks back  as NEO,  taller than most,
heads down the street.

                      NIOBE pauses next to him.

                                NIOBE

                            "What is it?"

                      MORPHEUS shakes his head.

                               MORPHEUS

     "Whats going to happen? If this is it, right now? The end?"

                                NIOBE

                       "I cant even imagine."

HE grins  and starts  to turn.  As he  does, his  profile matches  the
profile on  a WANTED  poster stuck  to the  wall. Its  a dark, grainy
picture of him, alongside photos of Neo, and Trinity.

                   POSTER: INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS

              MORPHEUS glances at it, and continues on.


EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET

NEO walks  calmly, observing  the people  that filter  by. Men, women,
children, all oblivious to their true nature.

A dirty homeless whino, nose  explosion red with burst blood  vessels,
is  staggering  along  the  edge of  the  crowd,  unseen  and ignored.
Somehow, he catches NEOs eye.

                               HOMELESS

                      "Spare a quarter, buddy?"

                NEO shakes his head, but still stares.

ANGLE on  the HOMELESS.  He mutters  something, and  reaches into  his
shopping cart to  open a garbage  bag. Its filled  with twenty dollar
bills, thousands of them.

                                 NEO

                      "How bout a quarter mil?"

THE homeless  man is  astounded. As  he stands,  speechless, NEO fades
back into the crowd.


EXT. FOREST GLADE

SMITH and GREGORY fight in the glade. SMITH is always one step  ahead.
HE is a cruel  sensei, and doesnt pull  punches. But with every  blow
GREGORY takes, he rebounds and attacks again.

FINALLY, just as  he seems to  be gaining on  SMITH, he takes  a rapid
fire series  of blows,  and collapses  to the  ground, breathless  and
beaten.

                               GREGORY

                               "Fuck."

                          SMITH circles him.

                                SMITH

 "Pain is only weakness leaving your body. When you are sufficiently
                   strong, you will feel no pain."

                               GREGORY

   "Tell me about what is happening. Whats wrong with the world?"

                                SMITH

                         "Get up and fight."

GREGORY gets to his feet and takes a stance. SMITH stares at him  from
a relaxed poise. He slaps at GREGORY, who deflects the blow and  takes
a jab, nearly hitting SMITH on the chin. They circle.

                                SMITH

                     "The world is not for you."

              HE slaps, has it deflected, dodges a blow.

                               GREGORY

                         "What do you mean?"

                                SMITH

 "Youre not human, Gregory. Thats why you dont fit in. Thats why
                      you have certain powers."

    GREGORY takes a swipe. They engage, then push off one another.

                               GREGORY

                  "What, am I from planet Krypton?"

                                SMITH

  "Not quite. But as humans continue to evolve, some are developing
    capabilities beyond those of the average man. Reality-altering
 abilities. I have them. Others in the Agency have them. And you have
    them, too. Were all that stands between law and order, and a
       terrorist dictatorship lead by the one called Morpheus."

                   THEY stop fighting for a moment.

                                SMITH

   "We need you to stop the terror. We need you to save our world."



             IT sinks in. GREGORY is starting to believe.

                                SMITH

   "We need you, because youre better than me. Now push past your
 abilities. You can turn you imagination into reality. See your hands
        striking me, see yourself overcoming me. Fight, boy!"

SMITH comes at him, and GREGORY responds. Their fists and kicks are  a
fast, then turn  into a blur.  GREGORY cant believe  his own actions.
SMITH misses  a block,  and GREGORY  blows him  backward with  a chest
punch.

SMITH, recovering, looks up. GREGORY looks around. CHANDRA is gone.

                               GREGORY

                           "Where is she?"

SMITH stands. From behind his back he produces a baseball sized  glass
ball. He tosses it to GREGORY.

                                SMITH

                               "Here."

GREGORY looks in the ball.  Its a window to an  apartment overlooking
the city. Chandra is in bed, waking up.

                                SMITH

    "She doesnt remember our encounter. Shes fine. Dont worry."

                         THE BALL disappears.

                 SMITH puts his hand to his earpiece.


INT. OFFICE BUILDING

AGENT BROWN is staring down at  the ground. ACROSS THE STREET, NEO  is
walking toward his building.

                                BROWN

                             "Hes back."


EXT. FOREST GLADE

                                SMITH

              "Ill be there. Execute the defense plan."

                       SMITH turns to GREGORY.

                                SMITH

 "Come with me. But only watch. Youre not ready to engage in a fight
                           with the enemy."

                               GREGORY

                              "Why not?"

                                SMITH

   "Because if you havent defeated me yet, you wont defeat them."

                       SMITH snaps his fingers.


EXT. ROOFTOP

GREGORY  finds  himself  alone  on  the  top  of  the  MAKARAO  hotel,
overlooking METACORTEX PLAZA.


EXT. STREET

The METACORTEX building stands across  the street. NEO has been  along
this road a thousand times, but in another lifetime.

NEO raises one hand, palm pointed toward the building.

CUT TO:  NEOS  POV:  The  building  is  a  massive  tower of  glowing
shimmering energy, no more real than a three-dimensional polygon.


EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP

MORPHEUS and NIOBE  stand atop a  building a few  blocks away, looking
toward the Metacortex building.

                             ANGLE on NEO

HE FIXES his gaze on the building, then lowers his head and closes his
eyes.

THE building tremors slightly, like  a heat mirage. Slowly, it  starts
moving downward.

ANGLE ON: the first  level. The exterior glass  disappears, vaporizing
in a million crystal shards that melt into the air, exposing the  hive
of office cubicles and corridors within.

The walls, desks and cubicles vaporize, leaving a few hundred  people
- office  workers, security,  maintenance men,  standing with  nothing
between them.

              The massive LOAD BEARING MEMBERS vaporize.

CUT TO: the bottom of the building. One can look straight through  the
entire  building.  WE go  through  the empty  building,  passing dazed
people, until we pass out the other side, and come to NEO.

HE looks up. The office  building is supported by nothing.  Slowly, it
descends on the stunned people. They rush, screaming, some laughing in
hysteria, before the ceiling can come down on them. The last few  flee
just before  the ceiling  touches the  ground. The  second floor melts
away just like the first.


EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP

NIOBE and MORPHEUS  stare on in  amazement as the  building collapses,
floor by floor.

                                NIOBE

                           "Hes doing it."

                               MORPHEUS

                             "I knew it."


EXT. STREET

CHOI and  TRINITY look  up in  the air  at the  roof of the METACORTEX
building, standing beyond  a block of  buildings. It sinks  toward the
ground as a flood of people come screaming around the corner.

                                 CHOI

                       "It cant be this easy."

                               TRINITY

                         "Its not over yet."



                          MANS VOICE (O.S.)

                        "Not by a long shot."

CU: TRINITYS FACE. SOMEONE plants the barrel of a silver Desert Eagle
.45 against her temple. TRINITY  whips her head backward as  it fires.
We drop into BULLET TIME as the flame and concussion blossoms in front
of her face, ripping her sunglasses off as she drops backward, pulling
a pair of MAC-10 Uzis from under her jacket.

                THE MANS VOICE belongs to AGENT BROWN

CHOI turns,  pulling a  short weapon  from under  his coat. Its boxy,
with a short barrel the size of a soda can. He plants it in the  small
of BROWNS back and pulls the trigger.

A CONE  OF FIRE  burns straight  through brown,  blowing steam, flame,
smoke, vertebrae, and viscera out a massive hole in his stomach.

CU on the weapon. It recoils on tension coils, discharging a shell the
size of a 12-ounce soda can.

                              REAL TIME

What remains  of BROWN  flies forward.  CHOI helps  TRINITY up and the
retreat into the building and  take cover under a window.  Through the
window, we see military trucks, filled with troops, charging down  the
street, toward the Metacortex  plaza. After the trucks  come rumbling,
black-painted M1A2 ABRAMS tanks. A black APACHE HELICOPTER flies  over
the convoy.

CHOI looks through the window as he reloads his hand cannon.

                                 CHOI

                         "Holy fucking shit."

                               TRINITY

              "Weve stirred up the hornets nest now."


INT. METACORTEX OFFICE

AGENT SMITH and JONES stare  down into the plaza. The  building shakes
slightly as it descends.

FROM the three  streets that enter  the plaza, military  vehicles pour
in. Hundreds  of troops  discharge and  form a  L-shaped circle around
NEO. Tanks  rumble in,  and the  Apaches whirl  to a  hover. Panicking
civilians rush out of the kill zone.

NEO stands calmly, continuing his work.


EXT. ROOFTOP

MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare from the rooftop.


EXT. METACORTEX PLAZA

The air rumbles as the building continues to gently collapse. The  sky
flashes, and massive streaks of  lighting blast across it like  cracks
in reality.

CU: SOLDIERS

           They line their weapons on NEO. They are nervous

                               PRIVATE

                "This is impossible. Whats going on?"

                               SERGEANT

               "Just keep him in your sites, soldier."


INT. TANK TURRET

                           CU: TANK GUNNER

HIS eye is glued to the tank  site and his trigger finger on the  fire
button.

                            POV: TANK SITE

               The green crosshairs sit on NEOS chest.

                               CU: NEO

His eyes open, but the building continues to collapse. He stares up at
a mirrored window, and somehow, straight into the eyes of:

                           CU: AGENT SMITH

                                SMITH

                             "Open fire."

A WALL of flame and fingers of tracers bursts from the skirmish lines.
The tracers grow into a cone of orange flame bearing down on NEO as we
drop into bullet time.

THE bullets sizzle  as tracers burn  off their backs.  The draw toward
him like  slugs. Thousands  of bullets  fired at  perpendicular angles
close  in on  him. As  they draw  close to  one another  along almost
perpendicular paths, they tinkle and chime and bounce.

The bullets come to a stop, glowing as their tracers backs continue to
burn.  The world  is in  stop motion  as the  bullets stop,  turn 180
degrees, and  suddenly accelerate  back at  their origins.  Faster and
fast they fly, until we drop back into REAL TIME.

THE SKIRMISH line  of troops is  ripped apart by  a hail of  their own
bullets.

CU: MACHINE GUNNER. With an M-249 SAW, he blazes away at NEO, only  to
be shredded by his own bullets. A  private takes a shot at NEO, and  a
bullet slaps into his  shoulder. REALIZING whats happening,  he drops
his weapon.

THE SOLDIERS are dropping like flies. The firing quickly subsides.

NEO stands  alone in  the center,  unharmed. He  turns to the skirmish
lines.  THE  surviving soldiers  drop  their weapons,  and  run. Panic
ensues. Only a few officers, NCOs, and soldiers too amazed to think of
running remain.


INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT

                  NEO is targeted on an LCD screen.

                                PILOT

                              "Fox One."


EXT. HELICOPTER WING

              CU: AGM-65 HELLFIRE GROUND-TO-AIR-MISSILE

The missile drops from its release claws and ignites, accelerating off
screen.

                        POV: HELLFIRE NOSE CAM

The missile flies  horizontally over the  plaza, then pitches  up, and
back down at NEO. He looks at it, and at the last second the nose goes
back up.


EXT. PLAZA

The missile swoops up over him, leaving him in its exhaust smoke.

                        POV: HELLFIRE NOSE CAM

THE missile banks,  panning across the  city, until it  locks onto the
helicopter from which it originated.


INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT

THE missile bears down the chopper.

CU: PILOT

HES TOO stunned to move. Mouth agape, he can only watch as:


EXT. HELICOPTER

ITS BLOWN to  fiery pieces, and  comes tumbling down,  landing on the
street as soldiers and civilians flee.


INT. TANK TURRET

                            TANK COMMANDER

                               "Fire!"

                    THE GUNNER pulls the trigger.


EXT. M1A2 ABRAMS

WE drop into bullet time as a cone of fire - bigger than the tank  and
the shape of a  pine tree, blows out  of the barrel, pushing  the tank
back. From the fire streaks a  HEAT round, white hot, leaving a  laser
like tracer as it bears down on NEO.

                              REAL TIME

 THE TRACER stops in front of NEO, and out of the air the HEAT round
  appears. Suspended in air, it shakes with violence. It accelerates
        backwards, flying straight back into the tank barrel.


INT. TANK TURRET

THE gunner screams as the BREECH explodes, blocking our view.


EXT. TANK

The tanks explodes like a  60-ton hand grenade, plowing soldiers  onto
their faces, consuming the unlucky ones close to it, and throwing  the
30-ton turret straight up, 10 yards into the air. It rotates,  aflame,
and comes crashing down on a nearby commander and his radio man.


INT. METACORTEX OFFICE

THE  EXPLOSION shakes  the building.  The scene  below is  a complete
route. Black smoke billows up  from the flaming wrecks. The  remaining
tanks arent retreating  - the crews  are piling out  and running. The
Apache helicopters turn tail and run.

                             AGENT JONES

                      "The plan is not working."

                             AGENT SMITH

                              "No shit."

                     AGENT BROWN enters the room.

                             AGENT BROWN

                      "What about your protégé?"

                             AGENT SMITH

          "Hes not ready yet. Ill deal with this myself."

                             AGENT JONES

                        "You cant beat him."

                             AGENT SMITH

                 "Ive been altered. Im Smith, 2.0."

             AGENTS BROWN and JONES look at one another.

                              CU: SMITH

 HE clenches his teeth, as though hes girding himself for something.

                                SMITH

              "Kill the others. Ill take care of this."

RAZOR is at  his operator chair,  surrounded by consoles.  Some of the

THE GHOST program  is loaded. We  see 3-D images  of Morpheus and  the

INT. OFFICE BUILDING

SMITH STANDS alone, his comrades have disappeared.

THE glass before him shimmers.


EXT. OFFICE

THE mirrored glass of Smiths office wavers, then explodes towards us.
SMITH jumps, and we pan down to follow his descent. He smacks into the
pavement on his feet in front of NEO.


EXT. METACORTEX PLAZA


SMITH STANDS, facing NEO, about two fighting distances away.

NEOs  concentration is  broken. The  METACORTEX building  comes to  a
shuddering halt.

                                 NEO

                            "Youre back."

CU: SMITH

                               He nods.

                                 NEO

                    "And you have a ponytail now."

AS we concentrate  on NEO, and  he concentrates on  SMITH, we can  see
more black suits marching up behind him.

NEO attacks SMITH. SMITH backs away slowly, blocking against a  losing
battle and taking hits. Meanwhile,  the MEN IN BLACK converge  on NEO.
Just as NEO  lands a smashing  blow on SMITHS  chin, three voices  at
once shout:

                                "HEY!"

NEO turns,  and SMITH  pushes him  hard in  the opposite  direction to
face:

THREE SMITHS! They attack at once, one going low and hard with a  knee
breaking sweep kick, the other punching NEO in the face, and the third
breaking to the  side and putting  his toe into  NEOs stomach with  a
vicious side-kick.

They attack  is in  perfect synch,  eight arms  and eight legs working
like clockwork, striking  their target without  getting in the  way of
each other. The attack slams NEO back, right into the first,  bloodied
SMITH. NEO slams into his shoving arms, and stops as though he  backed
into a  brick wall.  AGENT SMITH  grabs him  and holds  him in  a FULL
NELSON, exposing him  to his three  copies. The copies  shift position
and attack again. Two stand together, left shoulder to right, and with
their combined arms slam NEO in the face, then step apart as the third
comes in. The THIRD  grabs the shoulders of  the other two and  flips,
walking his loafers up NEOs  body, and kicking him from  below, right
up into  the chin  of his  jaw! It  snaps NEOs  back with  a spray of
blood.


EXT. ROOFTOP

MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare on as the fight rages.



MORPHEUS grips  the edge  of the  brick wall  edge. The stone crumbles
under the tension.

                               MORPHEUS

                         "We can only watch."

THE ASSAULT on NEO continues. He struggles, unable to concentrate long
enough to find a way to fight back.

A  BIRD flying  by NIOBE  and MORPHEUS  slows its  flight, slows  its

Near the  plaza, panicked  civilians slow,  and fall  to the ground as

  "All processing power is being re-diverted to the agent program."

      NIOBE stands at the edge of the building and points down.

                                NIOBE

                          "Morpheus, look!"

    DOWN on the ground below them, theres a swarm of AGENT Smiths


EXT. STREET

The passed-out people stand, and one by one, MORPH into AGENT  SMITHS.
It happens over, and over,  until dozens, then hundreds, are  marching
on the plaza.


EXT. PLAZA

NEO reaches back and puts his hands on either side of SMITHS head. As
hes  being pummeled  from the  front, he  squeezes and  screams. His
screams are mixed with SMITHS. The agents head deforms as were hear
a sickening  crack. Suddenly,  the body  reverts back  to that  of the
original owner, a security guard, and the head simply EXPLODES.

THE  hold broken,  NEO stumbles  back over  the body,  with the  three
SMITHS in pursuit. He somersaults, comes up on his feet, and jumps  to
the left, putting one Smith in front of the other two. He attacks, his
killing blows destroying SMITH, smashing through his blocks. He falls,
and NEO takes on the other two, giving a kick jump that knocks both of
them away in one shot.

As he comes  down, a wall  of Smiths converges  from all sides.  They
stop, leaving a circle around him.

WE PAN BACK to view a sea of black-suited SMITHS flooding the plaza.

CU: NEO

AS  his hand  passes over  his face,  it is  refreshed, anew,  perfect
again. He surveys the wall-to-wall SMITHS.

SMITH talks with his voice, times a thousand.

                                SMITH

       "NEO, leave the Matrix. You know not what youre doing."

                                 NEO

                        "Well, is that right?"

HE turns  to the  METACORTEX building.  Its repairing,  growing steel
girders and concrete skin.

                         NEOs face darkens.

                                 NEO

                                "No!"

REALITY SHIMMERS as  his anger strikes  out at the  building. The tops
floors burn, and then explode.  The explosion rips down the  building,
slowing, slowing, then stopping.

THOUSANDS of SMITHS  are gazing up  at the building,  concentrating on
combating NEOs attack.


EXT. ROOF

GREGORY sees the building exploding,  and runs. He smashes through  an
access door.

INT. STAIRWAY

GREGORY hurtles down the stairs, one at a time.


EXT. METACORTEX BUILDING

THE building is frozen, mid-explosion.  TONS of pieces hanging in  the
air, suspended only by frozen tendrils  of fire and arms of smoke  and
debris.

THE SMITHS attack NEO. They fight  in a massive melee, dying in  mass.
Meanwhile, the METACORTEX building pulls back together, the damage and
flame disappearing as time/space around it is reversed.

                                                               CUT TO:

With  his hand  on his  ear piece,  he comes  out the  elevator door,
slowly. Pistol drawn, he looks around the corner.

MORPHEUS and NIOBE stand there, their backs to him.

Without hesitating, he advances on them, blasting away with impunity.

THE BODIES of MORPHEUS and  NIOBE are wracked by gunfire  and collapse
in a heap of bullet-ravaged flesh.

BROWN  walks  up  to the  corpses  and  kicks one  with  his  shoe. It
shimmers, and then disappears, followed by the other.

              RAZOR dials the phone. MORPHEUS picks up.

                           MORPHEUS (V.O.)

                                "Yes."

                                RAZOR

                    "Theyre hitting your ghosts."

             MASSIVE attack of STATIC bursts on the line.

                                RAZOR

                            "What the - "

                         THE LINE goes dead.


EXT. ROOFTOP

MORPHEUS looks  at the  phone and  redials. RAZOR  comes through,  his
voice digitized and distorted.

                                RAZOR

     "Theyre cutting comes, get to the access point on Laxe - "

                         THE line goes dead.

MORPHEUS signals to NIOBE. They exit the roof as he dials TRINITY


INT. EMPTY BUILDING

CHOI and TRINITY hide  in the shadows of  an empty room, watching  the
battle. TRINITYS cell rings. She answers silently.

                           MORPHEUS (V.O.)

                       "Lets go. Laxe Three."

                               TRINITY

                          "What about Neo?"

                           MORPHEUS (V.O.)

     "We can do nothing to help him. Well only get in his way."

                         THEY leave the room.


INT. LOBBY

GREGORY stumbles  into the  lobby. Slumbering  bodies lie  everywhere,
slumped over desks, half-in chairs, on the ground.


EXT. PLAZA

HE exits into the street. The scene is one from HELL.

UNDER the neon  sky, fires are  frozen and smoke  columns hang in  the
air, still, like massive tree trunks.

The battle rages and surges,  a thousand SMITHS pouring onto  one NEO.
All around, nearly covering the ground, are corpses, destroyed  bodies
abandoned  by the  agent. Men  and women,  of all  ages and  designs,
smashed, decapitated and broken.

CU: NEO

THE SMITHS overwhelm him  with sheer numbers. NEO  is a blur, a  human
chainsaw now,  crushing or  smashing them  all, but  they crowd on all
sides. The bodies pile up as they fall, and NEO finds himself stepping
up the rubbery mass of corpses. A few more smashed SMITHS fall,  morph
back into their stolen forms, and NEO is KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEAD.

He cant take it. Choking, NEO struggles to free himself. SMITHS climb
up the corpse pile and drop onto him, pounding viciously. NEO  stalls,
in shock, his eyes  locked with the lifeless  blue eyes of a  woman he
just killed. She looks amazingly like TRINITY.

Perhaps for the first time, he is confronted with the consequences  of
this war, and his mind seizes as the Smiths pummel him.

NEO goes  berzerk! SCREAMING  and fighting,  he claws  his way out and
surges into the wall of agents. They throw him back, and he cant kill
them fast  enough. HE  leaps upward,  trying to  fly away,  but Smiths
cling on to him, and cling on to each other.


EXT. PLAZA

NEO struggles to  fly, and as  he does, hes  pulling a stalagtite  of
black suits, clinging like iron filings on a magnet.

CU: NEO


HIS face  is wide  with fear  and shock.  He cant  climb anymore, and
looks back down at the mountain  of agents hes pulling into the  air.
His face  clenches shut  as a  scream wells  from deep  within him. He
starts to glow, and we jump back to see:

A MASSIVE orange, spherical shock  wave blasts away from his  body. It
rebounds on the plaza and throws bodies upward, even as it blasts  the
Smiths away, leaving him clean.

EVERYTHING slows down  as NEO, exhausted,  tumbles out of  the sky. On
his way down  through the neon  light, he passes  bodies flying upward
from the  concussion. NEO  hits the  ground, bounces,  and lies still,
sprawled,  as people  drop all  around him,  piling up,  like Satans
snowfall.


EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) DAY

THE sky and Matrix are still  frozen. TRINITY and CHOI make their  way
along cautiously, leapfrogging from cover to cover. They pause  behind
a dumpster, and  just before looking  out, theres the  sound of metal
tapping metal, twice.

TRINITY looks in  the direction of  the sound. MORPHEUS  and NIOBE are
standing still in the shadows, near the end of the alley. TRINITY  AND
CHOI make their way to them.

TRINITY peeks  cautiously around  the edge.  On the  other side of the
street is a phone booth.

                               TRINITY

                            "Is it clear?"

                               MORPHEUS

                         "I smell an ambush."

                                NIOBE

                         "Me too. Too quiet."

                   CHOI grips his gun and grimaces.

                                 CHOI

           "Too quiet? The world is frozen. Ill go first."

                        NO one likes the idea.

REAL-TIME suddenly returns.  The lightning bolts  in the sky  suddenly
re-animate, thundering out of existence, making the four of them  jump
out of their skulls. The sounds of the city suddenly flood back.

ON THE street, people stir to  their feet. Everyone is confused as  to
what happened.


EXT. PLAZA

ITS a sea of the dead. From its center, NEO emerges, soaked in blood,
gagging and  gasping for  breath. He  stumbles over  them. Shocked and
crazed, he glimpses the Metacortex building. Its in one piece  again,
unharmed.

He falls against  a smashed corporate  art sculpture. He  picks a cell
phone up from the ground and dials.

                                 NEO

                         "Morpheus, pick up."

We hear nothing but static.  Disgusted, NEO throws the phone  away. He
falls against the sculpture and looks up. Coming around the corner  of
the building is a group of agents and soldiers.

NEO  sinks down,  staring at  his hands.  He catches  his breath  and
concentrates.  The  blood  disappears,  and he  dons  the  suit  of an
anonymous soldier in black. His face, too, seems to change.

HE stands and walks away. We only see his back.


EXT. ALLEY - DAY

THEY weigh their options. Finally, MORPHUES gives the nod to CHOI.



                               MORPHEUS

                                "Go."

CHOI checks his ammo and puts his guns under his coat. There are  lots
of people on the streets now. Everyones in shock over what  happened,
and the columns of smoke rising from the center of the city.

                                 CHOI

"And remember, kids, when youre in a war, never volunteer yourself!"

HE walks out  onto the street,  eyeing the phone  booth and everything
else. A  gorgeous Asian  businesswoman stumbles  into him. Recognition
lights up her face and she stops him.

                                WOMAN

          "Choi? Oh my God, I havent seen you for months."

       CHOI keeps looking around, making his way to the booth.

                     "Oh yeah, sorry about that."

                           SHE turns angry.

         "Sorry about that? What kind of an asshole are you?"


EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY

TRINITY is looking around the corner. She pulls back into the alley.

                               TRINITY

                "Casanova just ran into an old flame."


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

                                WOMAN

   "No. Fuck you, Choi, you just think you can come and go when you
                               please?"

CHOI is ignoring her now, walking straight for the phone booth as  she
is having a fit. Tears are welling in her enraged face.

"Choi, if you have one shred of decency, if you even care about me - "

Inexplicably, CHOI  hangs his  trench coat  on the  side of the booth.
Standing behind it, he reaches  around with his arm, keeping  the coat
between his body and the phone. The WOMAN doesnt even notice the  web
of gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering  the
inside of the jacket.

                                WOMAN

  " - youll tell me why you dont call, why you, you, what are you
                               doing?"

                                 CHOI

"The jacket stops fragmentation. Sometimes they bomb the phones. Kiss
                            me for luck."

HE grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers.

CU: PHONE

His hand grabs the phone. We hear the dialtone, and he mashes down one
of the  numbers of  the keypad.  The number  tone rises  in pitch to a
crescendo. WE pull back and:

THE BOOTH EXPLODES. CHOI and the woman are bowled over by the flame.


EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY

They take  cover from  the blast  as people  all over  the street  are
knocked flat.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

THE PHONE BOOTH is obliterated.  Miraculously, CHOI and the woman  are
still under the cover of  the jacket. THROWING the smoking  jacket off
them, CHOI screams in agony as  he grasps the smoldering stump of  his
right shoulder. The arm is history.

THE WOMAN looks on,  her eyes as wide  as dinner plates. Shaking,  she
falls back, still staring.

                                 CHOI

                         "You werent lucky."

MORPHEUS, NIOBE, and TRINITY rush to him, picking him up on his  feet.
CHOI is  screaming and  laughing. Someone  grabs his  smoldering coat,
dragging it along. CHOI stares at the ex-flame as they cart him  away.
His eyes are crazy.

                                 CHOI

              "You still want me to call you? Ha ha ha!"

AS they struggle down the street, CHOI starts to walk more on his own.
PEOPLE run from the scene, screaming.

                        CU - the four of them.

MORPHUES looks  at something  off-screen and  frowns. HE  pulls to the
left.

                               MORPHEUS

                             "This way."

TANKS and  TROOPS are  filling into  the street  ahead of them, coming
from around the corner.

THEY turn onto a different  street. This street, too, is  filling with
troops. Worse, its being lead by AGENT BROWN.

                                NIOBE

                         "Tanks, or agents?"

                               TRINITY

                               "Tanks."

                                 CHOI

                         "Yeah, tanks a lot."

They break. CHOI stands on his own, and they run back onto the  street
with the tanks.

CU: TANKS

THREE ABRAMS stop in the  street. Their turrets swing into  place with
terrifying quickness and precision.

AT ONCE,  they open  fire with  their main  cannons and machines guns.
FIRE FLOWERS blaze from the death machines, sending a typhoon of  lead
down the street.  Troops filed between  the tanks pull  their triggers
and dont let go. Everything in the street is shredded and blown away,
as though it was hit by a high-power pressure hose.

WITH UNEARTHLY  SPEED, EVERYONE  BREAKS for  the sides  of the street,
except for CHOI. He stands amid  it all as the tracers come  closer to
his body. He raises his machine  gun with his good arm, and  lays into
the enemy.

TRACER rounds kick away from  his gun, ripping straight back  into the
wall  of soldiers.  His rounds  deflect off  the sloped  armor of  the
tanks, recoils pile into the flesh  of troops. He rakes his fire  into
the enemy bodies.

CU: CHOI

TRACERS zoom in on  him. A tank round  blasts by, and the  wall of air
kicks him to his side. He continues to fire even as a bullet, followed
by  another, blasts  through the  middle of  his body.  More and  more
bullets smack into  him, blasting chunks  of meat and  viscera out the
back.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) DAY

TRINITY and NIOBE  take one side  of the street,  running and shooting
simultaneously. THEY reach  the buildings on  the side and  NIOBE goes
STRAIGHT UP THE FAÇADE OF THE BUILDING, as TRINITY jumps from cover to
cover, cart wheeling through tracer fire and bullets.

ON  THE  OTHER side  of  the street,  MORPHEUS  goes straight  up  the
building  façade  and  starts  running  sideways,  completely  defying
gravity, firing downward at the soldiers.

CU: CHOI

HE WILL NOT FALL, and a hose of lead drills into him, taking his  body
apart piece by piece. Bullets take away pieces of his head, neck,  and
torso, and in one final wave of fire, he is disintegrated, leaving his
machine gun, barrel  smoking, spinning in  the air, firing  still. The
arm is still attached and finger  clenching on the trigger. It is  the
last piece of CHOI to fall.

MORPHEUS climbs  as he  runs. In  mid-stride he  changes magazines and
stops, standing on the wall, his body parallel to the ground.

On the other side of the street, NIOBE stands on the wall, blazing  at
the mass of troops with two  guns that never cease. THERE is  no cover
and  no reprieve  from the  DOUBLE DEATH  from above.  Most are  still
firing down the street, or over toward TRINITY.

TRINITY runs  up the  side of  the street.  Her guns  go empty and she
dives behind a stoop as a squad of soldiers blazes away at her.

CU: SOLDIER

In slow motion, he  pulls a spoon from  a grenade. Somehow, the  metal
ring reaches TRINITYS ears.

CU: TRINITY

She slaps a magazine into her  pistol, pulls the action and comes  out
from under cover just enough to see the soldier releasing the grenade.
She fires, hitting the grenade. IT explodes directly over the group of
soldiers, flattening them to the ground.

A  BULLET smacks  through TRINITYS  wrist, and  the hand  comes off,
popping like the head off  a dandelion. Blood spurts from  the severed
arteries, spraying the hand, with the pistol still in its grip.

ABOVE THE STREET, MORPHEU AND  NIOBE leap for one another.  They catch
each others arms, fifty feet  above the surviving enemy, and  spin in
place, firing away. The tank commanders in their copulas blast  upward
with their  machine guns,  but the  rounds miss  the spinning  couple.
MORPHUES and NIOBE concentrate on the commanders, and cut them down.

THEY land amidst  the carnage. TRINITY  emerges, shaken, pressing  her
coat to her arm.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

The other end of the street fills with soldiers, and AGENT BROWN.

CU: AGENT BROWN

HE surveys the  scene, and immediately  draws and fires,  running full
bore for the rebels.

MORPHEUS, Niobe and TRINITY are too close to the tanks to be fired on,
but the nearest one lunges at them. They climb up over concrete stoops
and over  the side  of the  tank. They  sprint down  the street as the
tanks turn their turrets behind them, searching.

                               MORPHEUS

                         "The garage, hurry!"

THEY dive behind a corner as  a tank fires. Morpheus throws the  woman
forward as the tank round hits  the edge of the building, blowing  the
concrete and brick wall into a massive cloud of powder. Perhaps a  ton
of rubble falls on Morpheus legs. He drags himself forward. Niobe and
Trinity grab his arms and haul him out of the rubble. Niobe shoots the
lock off a steel door, and they pile into the building.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

AGENT BROWN  and his  men rush  into position  around the building the
rebels are hiding in.


Suddenly, an unimaginably powerful engine  starts, and as we stare  at
the  garage door,  it explodes  outward. A  jet-black, hyped  COUNTACH
explodes out onto the street, tires literally on fire as they throw up
smoke. It cuts through a few  soldiers, hitting them in the knees,  as
it rips up the street, the throttle going way too high.


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - DAY

THE street scene spins before them. TRINITY is at the wheel, a  broken
and dusty MORPHEUS sitting next to  her. The tach is redlining as  the
car rips up the street. Pedestrians dive for cover.

TRINITY holds her wounded hand to her chest and drives one-handed.

                               "Shift."

MORPHEUS does so,  and the tires  squeal again when  she releases into
second, then  third. In  a few  seconds theyre  over 60  on the  busy
street.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

Soldiers pick themselves up  just in time to  hear another engine -  a
super powerful track bike, emerges from the burnt rubber smoke screen.
A wheely bar on the back of the bike keeps it from flipping around the
rear tire as it accelerates like a bullet out of a barrel. There isnt
even time to take a shot until shes gone.


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - DAY

THEY rocket up the entry to a highway, ripping past cars by driving up
the breakdown lane.  Once they hit  a straightaway Trinity  floors it,
and the speedo creeps up past 130 as they dodge in and out of cars.

MORPHEUS grabs his twisted, folded legs. He was literally poured  into
the seat. Concentrating, his face knotting in pain, he straightens the
broken, fractured legs. He closes his eyes and concentrates.

             The legs reform into straight, strong limbs.

                      MORPHEUS grabs the wheel.

                               MORPHEUS

              "Keep your foot on the gas. Heal thyself."

TRINITY pulls her bleeding wound from her arm. Her face tightens,  and
she closes her eyes, fervently concentrating, shutting the world  out,
which  is  good,  as  they suffer  constant  close  calls  as Morpheus
controls the wheel from his awkward spot.

When she opens her eyes again, she grabs the wheel. With BOTH hands.

MORPHEUS pulls out  his cell and  tries the line.  Its still full  of
static.

                               TRINITY

                             "Any luck?"

                               MORPHEUS

               "None. Theyve killed city-wide comms."

                               TRINITY

         "Then the agents are out of touch with each other."

                               MORPHEUS

  "They cant track us, but that gives them more time to destroy our
exits, and find the Neb. Well try the desert. Communications might be
                        working there still."

                               TRINITY

                         "What about Niobe?"

                               MORPHEUS

                    "She knows to meet us there."




EXT. HIGHWAY (MATRIX) - DAY

NIOBEs bike sizzles down the highway, insanely lane splitting at over
100 miles  per hour.  The wheely  bar is  folded up  against the  rear
wheel. A dual  stream of vehicles  spit by her  like giant machine-gun
bullets. She zooms out of view.


EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

GREGORY slows from a run. He looks back as police cars and  ambulances
race toward  the Metacortex  building. He  cant shake  what hes just
witnessed. He looks forward, only to run into:

                             AGENT SMITH

             GREGORY freezes, then bursts into questions.

                               GREGORY

                    "What the fuck just happened?"

                                SMITH

         "We need you, Gregory. Will you help us stop this?"

          GREGORY is perplexed. Resolve comes over his face.

                               GREGORY

                          "I can stop this?"

                                SMITH

                                "Yes."

                               GREGORY

                 "Alright. But how can I fight him?"

                                SMITH

                "I will give you the power you need."


INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (MATRIX) - DAY

THE building is old, crumbling, and inside painted a horrid green that
no sane person could find attractive. The humble place is home to  THE
ORACLE.

NEO exits an  elevator. Recomposed and  dressed normally, he  walks up
and down the hall, trying to remember which apartment she lived in.

A tall black woman, one of the Oracles priestesses, comes out of  the
stairwell and recognizes NEO.

                              PRIESTESS

                                "Neo."

HE turns  and looks  at her.  She smiles,  but as  Neo looks at her, a
flash of uncertainty, and maybe hate, flies across her face before the
smile returns.

                              PRIESTESS

                 "The Oracle is anxious to see you."

NEO follows her into the familiar apartment. The windows are  covered,
and NEO and the priestess are the only ones there. The Priestess moves
into the dark kitchen.

NEOs eyes  adjust to  the darkness.  He hears  something squish as he
steps, and looks down.

The tattered rug  is a swamp  of dark, congealing  liquid. NEO reaches
down and touches it with his fingertips. Its half-dried blood.

He stands, his eyes adjusted to  the dark now. The walls are  chipped,
covered in bullet holes.

In slow-motion, the entry door to the apartment opens. In walks  AGENT
BROWN. NEO turns to the  kitchen. AGENTS SMITH and JONES  appear. They
all draw their .45s.

NEO stands  still as  they walk  up to  him and  put their guns to his
head.

                         AGENT SMITH scoffs.

                                 NEO

 "I was on to you the whole time. I only came in here to isolate you,
                           to destroy you."

                             AGENT JONES

                     "What are you waiting for?"

                                 NEO

              "I realized, that I cant destroy you - "

                           HE nods at SMITH

                                 NEO

              " - without destroying the Matrix itself."

                                SMITH

                 "You killed me too easy last time."

                                BROWN

                       "And if you kill us - "

                           HE nods at JONES

                                BROWN

                   "Well only come back like him."

                         BROWN nods to SMITH.

                                 NEO

                              "I know."

   SMITH breathes deep, and drops his gun. The others follow suit.

                                SMITH

                "So, why dont you take it all down?"

                                 NEO

                            "The Matrix?"

                                SMITH

                                "Yes."

                                 NEO

  "I can. But if I destroy the Matrix, everyone within it will die."

                            SMITH snorts.

                                SMITH

        "I take it the great Morpheus failed to mention this?"

       NEO looks up at him, but his expression doesnt change.

                                 NEO

                     "How many people are in it?"

        SMITH holsters his weapon. He speaks matter-of-factly.

                                SMITH

                      "Six and a half billion."

            FOR NEO, the numbers are too huge to imagine.

                            BROWN scoffs.

                                BROWN

                      "Could you destroy us?"

ITS a serious question for Neo. But he nods. He knows his potential.

                                 NEO

                              "I could."

                                SMITH

              "What does that make you feel like? God?"

                      HE is amused by the idea.

                                JONES

        "This is getting tiresome. Where do we go from here?"

                                 NEO

 "IF you cut the power that the Matrix supplies to your armies, Ill
                            let you live."

                                SMITH

      "Idiot. We dont care about life, we care about victory."

                                 NEO

                                "Why?"

                                JONES


                       "So our kind... prevails."

                                 NEO

                          "You mean, lives."

                                SMITH

 "Who do you think started this war, boy? Your kind tried to kill us
                               first."

                                BROWN

         "But you didnt. Youre not as tough as you think."

                                 NEO

                             "Well see."

THE three agents, helpless to stop him, watch as he walks for the door
of the apartment. NEO opens it,  and stops, his face meeting a  flying
FIST. His vision  FLASHES with the  impact, and he  staggers back into
the room, falling on his ass and rolling back onto his feet.

              GREGOR steps into the room, tall and BAD.

                         NEO holds up a hand.

                                 NEO

           "Stop! I dont want to fight you! Youre human!"

GREGORY  doesnt  answer.  He  smashes  a  side-kick  into  NEOs gut,
doubling him over.

THE kick carries  such an impact  that a pale  concussion wave flashes
past Gregor. It sends NEO crashing out the window.

GREGORY stands upright and moves to the window, followed by the  three
agents. Theres nothing on the street, twenty stories below.

The building  starts trembling.  We hear  rapid-fire impacts,  growing
louder and coming faster.

THE FLOOR EXPLODES  as NEO crashes  up through the  concrete, throwing
the agents away as  he embraces GREGORY in  a bear hug. THEY  blast up
through the ceiling. WE follow them up through three more floors, bam,
bam, bam. Each concrete floor smashes GREGORY in the head.


EXT. ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

NEO and GREGORY SMASH through the roof, flying upward, like a missile,
past us.


EXT. SKY (MATRIX) - DAY

CU: NEO

HIS FACE is contorted in rage as he rockets upward. GREGORY is  barely
conscious. Seeing this, NEO stops, and flings Gregorys body violently
earthward.

NEO looks down as  the body falls toward  the city, thousands of  feet
below. He turns away,  just as the distant  GREGORY is falling out  of
sight. Just before he does, the speck of a person PULLS up, and  grows
larger and larger as  it returns. A contrail  streaks behind him as  a
rips through  the air.  FISTS FORWARD,  GREGORY is  like an MX missile
bearing on NEO.

NEO turns just in  time to catch BOTH  FISTS in his chest.  Like a cue
ball striking another billiard,  all Gregors momentum is  transferred
into Neo. Gregor stops dead in the air as Neo is hurtled out of view.

CU: GREGOR

HE is in  shock somehow as  he sees NEO  flying away. He  clenches his
fists and flexes his body, then looks down.

WE see the ground, thousands of feet below.

                               GREGORY

                             "Holy shit!"

FOR some  reason, he  starts to  fall. Even  as he  claws to  maintain
altitude, his  rational mind  has caught  up with  him and  is somehow
denying the fact that he can fly.

As hes  facing the  ground, NEO  slams into  him from above. Gripping
Gregor by the neck and his  belt, he drives straight down. The  ground
rushes, it takes  one second to  drop past a  50-story skyscraper. Neo
slams  Gregor,  front first,  into  the concrete  sidewalk.  They bust
through the sidewalk, into the sewer below.


INT. SEWER (MATRIX) - DAY

NEO stands. Offscreen,  we can here  choking breaths. Neo  looks down.
Gregor lies twisted on a concrete slab, impaled multiple times through
the chest by snapped, rusty rebar.  He takes one last breath, and  his
eyes half-close.

NEO checks the pulse. Finding nothing, he leaps out of the hole.

CU: GREGORY

HIS eyes  blink, and  he follows  NEOs departure.  Choking, unable to
breath with the rebar through him, he writhes. Theres nothing for him
to grab to pull himself off the steel.

His eyes clenched  shut, Gregor levitates,  by force of  will, pulling
his body off the rebar.  The corrugated bars make wet,  sucking sounds
as the pull through his body.  Finally, he gets to a twisted  piece of
bar, and cant make it over. Hes losing all his breath, all his  life
force, over one piece of twisted steel protruding from his chest.

WITH one  last, wiggling  effort, he  works it  through him. HIS mouth
opens wide, but no sounds emit, lest he recall Neo. Just as the end of
the steel bar enters his body and we cant take any more,

                                                               CUT TO:


EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY (MATRIX) - SUNSET

THE Countach and bike  zip down a long,  perfectly flat empty road.  A
brown sunset plagues the horizon. There is no civilization in sight.


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - SUNSET

MORPHEUS tries his cell again. This time, it reaches the Neb.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

RAZOR and CIRCA are both operating the consoles.

                                RAZOR

                             "Operator."

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

                  "Good to hear youre still there."

                                RAZOR

              "Jesus, you too. Where the fuck are you?"

                               MORPHEUS

"About two hundred miles east of the city, on highway 315. We need an
                                exit."

                                RAZOR

          "Coming up on your left, ten miles, a rest stop."


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - SUNSET

                               MORPHEUS

                  "I dont remember an exit there."

                                RAZOR

                        "Gimme five minutes."

                               MORPHEUS

                                "Out."


INT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT)

RAZOR clears the  screen in front  of him and  cracks his fingers.  He
looks at Circa.

                                CIRCA

                            "Theyre OK?"

                                RAZOR

           "Gotta get em out. They need an exit program."

CU: Keyboard.  RAZORS fingers  fly at  inhuman speeds  over the keys.
Data  pours down  the console  as he  blazes away.  Finally, he  hits
enter so hard it rocks the station.

RAZOR  turns to  Circa as  Matrix code  resumes its  cascade down  the
screens.

                                RAZOR

                      "Yes! Did you like that?"

                      CIRCA just rolls her eyes.


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) SUNSET

            MORPHEUS phone rings. He answers. Its Razor.

                                RAZOR

                          "Exit ready sir."

                               MORPHEUS

                     "Check the phone for bombs."


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

           CIRCA looks over some data and shakes her head.

                                CIRCA

                            "Its clear."


INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - SUNSET

                             RAZOR (O.S.)

   "Its all set. Theres a pair of cops at the rest stop, though."

                               MORPHEUS

                           "Not a problem."

THE Countach pulls into  the meager rest stop,  not more than a  water
fountain, toilet house and phone booth.

A police cruiser sits, lights off, waiting to intercept speeders.


EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - SUNSET

THE Countach skids  to a stop,  kicking up a  massive dust cloud  that
hides the  car. We  hear the  door slide,  and the  massive black-clad
figure of MORPHEUS emerges from the dust.

                 An Uzi in each hand, pointed at US.

THE COP behind the wheel is too slow to draw, call for backup, or even
duck for cover. The safety glass is destroyed as gunfire rips  through
it, chewing the cop to pieces. His body thrashes in the seat.

MORPHEUS turns away. NIOBE pulls up on her bike and gets off,  slowly,
obviously the ride had been  a long one. Trinity joins  them. Morpheus
stops.

                               MORPHEUS

             "I thought Razor said their were two cops."


INT. BATHROOM HOUSE (MATRIX) - SUNSET

A ROOKIE cop, his  face to young for  a razor, is shaking  as he peeks
through a crack in the door, through which he sees the terrorists  who
just wasted his partner. He finishes buckling his pants, and draws his
service pistol, only to shake in pain as his body morphs.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

RAZOR and CIRCA see the agent morph as the code flies down the screen.

                                RAZOR

                          "Fuck, fuck fuck!"


EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - SUNSET

THEY smell somethings wrong. They  move, back to back in  a triangle,
for the  phone booth,  weapons draw  and looking  in all  direction at
once.

                               MORPHEUS

                         "Niobe, you first."

                               TRINITY

                      "Bullshit, its my turn."

                                NIOBE

                     "Junior ranks leave first."

TRINITY enters the booth as the phone starts ringing.

Its the moment Smith was waiting for.

HE BURSTS  out of  the door,  gun firing  at the  booth. Inside, glass
shatters, and blood sprays as  Trinity is riddled with bullets.  Smith
doesnt stop. He sprays for an eternity, even firing as she collapses,
phone still ringing. Her body slumps, smearing blood against the booth
door as it shuts from her weight.


INT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT)

TRINITYS body spasms violently against her harness as her life  signs
go berserk.  Shes not  dead, but  death is  only seconds  away. Circa
screams, but Razor is locked, staring at the screen with the intensity
from which he derived his name.


EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - NIGHT

MORPHEUS and NIOBE open fire. Smith shudders, flickers violently, his
body moving too fast to follow as the two rebels empty their clips at
 him. The actions of the guns stop in the open position, barrels and
empty chambers smoking, as the last empty shells patter to the ground.

MORPHEUS throws the guns down and turns to Niobe.

                               MORPHEUS

                            "Get her out."

NIOBE dives for  the shattered booth,  kicking away the  starred glass
and  answering  the  ringing  phone.  She  pulls  it  down,  and hauls
Trinitys destroyed body up, placing the phone to her ear.

TRINITYS head merely sags lifelessly to one side.

                                NIOBE

      "Come on! Go through, Trinity! God damnit dont give up!"

TRINITYS  eyes   flicker.  She   focuses  on   Niobe,  summoning  her
consciousness enough to make the  phase back into the real  world. She
starts to fade as we cut to:


INT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT)

CIRCA stands over  Trinity as the  rebels blue eyes  flutter open. Her
whole body goes into a seizure and she chokes and screams as she grabs
Circa.

                                CIRCA

                     "Youre safe, youre safe!"


EXT. REST STOP

MORPHEUS charges SMITH.  Smith ignores reloads  him, and sights  in on
the exposed back of Niobe as she is reaching up to put the phone  back
on the  hook. As  the sights  rest right  between her shoulder blades,
Morpheus grabs his gun with both hands. He squeezes off one shot,  the
action freeze  back on  an empty  chamber, before  Morpheus throws his
hands up in the air

The shot ricochets clips Niobes ear and ricochets off the booth.  She
hangs up the phone and touches the blood of her ear. The phone  rings.
She looks at it, then back at Morpheus and Smith, raising dust as they
fight.

She leaves the ringing phone and runs to join the fight.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

RAZOR pounds the edge of the console as he watches the screen.

                                RAZOR

                           "Crazy mothers!"

CIRCA has  removed Trinitys  interface, but  shes having  a seizure.
Circa can barely hold her down as she uses her teeth to rip the  cover
off a wicked hypo.

                                RAZOR

                       "Whats wrong with her?"

                                CIRCA

             "Her bodys dying but her mind wont quit."

CIRCA straddles her and plunges the massive needle into her chest.


EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX)

Morpheus and  Smith clash  in the  dust -  punches, kicks,  and blocks
coming too  fast to  see. Smith  is wailing  on Morpheus, but Morpheus
sneaks in a  kick that separates  them. They take  stances a good  two
distances away. Theyre about to go at it again when:

NIOBE sprints  into the  fight. Performing  a flying  leap kick, Smith
grabs her  and swings  her down,  crashing her  body into the concrete
with a sickening crack-thud. She rolls, fighting the pain, as Morpheus
flies  back into  action, catching  the agent  with a  furious ass  of
swinging kicks.

Niobe grits back the pain and rejoins her love. Together they  assault
the agent, their speed almost, almost equaling his, their will  capped
by the limits of their Matrix-bending powers. Finally, Smith resurges.
He  lands  a punch  into  Niobes stomach,  and  her body  folds  over
unnaturally, as if her back is broken. She crumples to the deck, blood
pouring from her mouth.

MORPHEUS screams and brings a hammer blow down on the back of  Smiths
neck,  smashing  the  agents  face  down  and  imprinting  it  in the
concrete. For a  moment, Smith is  still. Morpheus collects  Niobe and
runs for the phone booth, which is still ringing.

ITS too far. Smith grabs him around the knees, spilling him  forward.
Man handling him like he weighs nothing, Smith gets on top of him  and
starts smashing his fists down into Morpheus face.

                                SMITH

          "I should have killed you the first chance I had."

Like an enraged silverback, he raises his fists together for one final
blow. But  instead of  striking, his  eyes catch  something. He  flips
back, jumping, as a silver streak cuts through the air, a split second
too  slow to  cut the  agents head  off. Instead,  it slices  cleanly
through the triceps of the raised arms, leaving nick on the throat.

RAZOR, dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas, steps  over
Morpheus as  he pursues  the agent.  Smith rolls  backwards, gains his
footing, and retreats from the  swirling blades of death. He  turns to
Morpheus:

                                RAZOR

                                "Go!"


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

RAZOR is strapped into one of the interface chairs, his eyes closed.


EXT. REST STOP

HALF-DEAD MORPHEUS drags NIOBE to the booth.

Behind them, Agent Smith backs away from RAZORS dual blades, on long,
one short. Whenever Razor attacks,  Smith backs away. They circle  one
another.

                MORPHEUS puts Niobe through the phone.

                      RAZOR forces Smith around.

                                RAZOR

              "Come on, tough guy, come got some Razor."

SMITH frowns  and moves  forward, but  the whistling  edge of  a blade
makes him  think twice.  RAZOR holds  the short  sword parallel to the
ground, the long sword straight up. He hides his eyes behind the short
sword.

SMITHs back is against the sunset. The sun drops below a cloud.

RAZOR flashes  the light  off his  short blade,  directly into Smiths
eyes, blinding him as he strikes with the long sword.

SMITH, blinded, turns and backs away. RAZOR attacks.

IN the  booth, Niobe  is gone.  MORPHEUS hangs  up the  phone. He  can
barely stand up enough to reach the handset. When it rings he picks it
up. But he doesnt disappear.

                               MORPHEUS

                             "Reload me."


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

                                CIRCA

                             "All right."

SHE punches  some keys.  MORPHEUS 3-D  avatar flashes  on a  console,
along with a massive array of weapons.


EXT. BOOTH (MATRIX) - SUNSET

MORPHEUS disappears for a second, then reappears. Now he is  perfectly
clean, and immaculately dressed. He replaces his sunglasses and  kicks
through  the remains  of the  booth, walking  toward the  fight as  he
produces new weapons, heavy with ammo, from his long coat.

RAZOR keeps  swinging at  SMITH -  and missing.  Seeing his chance, he
runs back for the ringing  phone. SMITH pursues, almost on  RAZOR when
the neo-samurai jumps in the  air and pirouhettes, swinging one  sword
after another, like a helicopter blade from Hell.

IN the liquid  world of slo-mo,  the short sword  cuts through Smiths
outstretched fingers, sending them  flying. The long sword  grazes his
forearm, cutting through the fabric  and taking off a slice  of flesh.
The tip of  the sword slices  through his suit,  cutting his tie  off,
digging about an inch into his torso.

SMITH collapses into the dust, his  face a mask of blood and  dust. He
doesnt try to get up.

RAZOR passes MORPHEUS, who backs up to the ringing phone booth.  Razor
goes  through first.  MORPHEUS keeps  his eyes  and weapon  locked on
SMITH, who  makes no  attempt to  pursue. He  stands calmly,  and in a
dignified manner, wipes dust off  his clothing as he watches  Morpheus
step into the booth, and replace the phone.

It rings. One hand on the receiver, Morpheus stares back at Smith.

SMITH stands there, not attempting to pursue. Morpheus pauses,  taking
advantage of the chance to observe his deadly enemy.

SMITH stares at the booth for a second. Emotion twists his face, first
anger,  then  perhaps  sadness.  Hes lost.  Hell  be  in  the Matrix
forever.

With a quicksilver flash,  his body reverts back  to the shape of  the
rookie cop.

THE young  man is  left standing  there. He  is filthy,  bloody, badly
sliced up, and the fingers of one hand are missing. He looks around at
the carnage  as his  mouth simply  opens and  closes, reflexively,  in
shock. He focuses on Morpheus.

The rebel answers the phone and disappears, leaving the cop, his  body
broken and his mind blown.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

CIRCA helps MORPHEUS off the interface chair. Razor is triumphant.

                                RAZOR

   "Did you see that? We beat him! A fucking agent! He gave up!"

MORPHEUS, unflappable, rises and rushes to the operations consoles.

                               MORPHEUS

                           "Where is Neo?"

                                CIRCA

 "Havent heard from him. The city is still cut off from the rest of
                             the Matrix."

   MORPHEUS appears enraged. He looks at Neo, supine on his chair.

                               MORPHEUS

      "Why does it still exist? Why hasnt he destroyed it yet?"

                                RAZOR

                          "Maybe he cant."

 TRINITY is sitting on the edge of her interface chair, looking like
                                hell.

                               TRINITY

                 "Is he even alive? Is he captured?"

                                RAZOR

  "Last we saw he was trying to blow up the building. Havent locked
                           onto him since."

                               MORPHEUS

                           "What? Why not?"

                                CIRCA

    "Call me crazy, but I think hes masking his own displacement
                             signature."

                                RAZOR

"His carrier signal just goes nowhere. But there is data going back
                             and forth."

MORPHEUS  stares at  the data  on the  screens. The  Matrix lives.  He
pushes Razor out of the way, and starts hacking at the keyboard at  an
incredible rate. Its obvious Morpheus can handle computers.

                               MORPHEUS

               "I found him once. Ill find him again."

We  go deeper  into the  miasma of  green symbols,  swallowed by  the
blackness of the screen, and emerge into:


INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT (MATRIX) - NIGHT

The apartment is luxuriously laid out and furnished. Gregory sits on a
leather couch, watching  whatever on the  tube with the  sound off. He
absentmindedly  manipulates a  quarter over  and around  his fingers.
Finally, he stops and looks at the quarter.

Holding it between his  thumb and forefinger, he  folds it in half  as
though it was a disk of bubble  gum. He folds it again, then rools  it
as though its a musket ball.

Chandra enters the living room and collapses on the couch. She reaches
points the remote at the TV, but Gregory puts his hand over it to  get
her attention.

                               GREGORY

        "So, you really dont have any idea how you got here?"

                               CHANDRA

               "No. I only remember being on the bike."

                            GREGORY sighs.

                               GREGORY

 "Yeah, you took a pretty good knock on the head. Do you know how we
                           got this place?"

                      She looks at him, annoyed.

                               CHANDRA

            "Duh. We broke in. We dont own a penthouse."

                               GREGORY

                       "What if I said we did?"

                               CHANDRA

                       "Id say youre insane."

She finally gets the remote and changes the channel. The volume  comes
on, louder and  infinitely more tinny  and obnoxious than  anything in
life. Chandra laughs at the images as Gregory stares into space.



INT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT

NEO sits with his back against a blackened brick wall, staring  ahead.
Hes  in the  belfry of  an ancient,  destroyed cathedral,  among the
pigeon nests, soot, and bird crap.

FROM here, in  downtown, we can  see the modern,  uptown section, with
its  gleaming  skyscrapers. METACORTEX  still  stands, illuminated  by
searchlights.

NEO sits and broods. Isolated, his world turned upside down and  right
side out in less than a week, his mind and spirit are a blank.

Again, he tries his cell phone.  Static. He collapses it and puts  it.
Just as it leaves his mind, it rings. The face flips open.

NEO puts it to his ear without speaking.

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

                                "Neo."

              NEOS grim expression is melted by relief.

                                 NEO

       "Morpheus! Holy shit! You wont believe what happened."

                               MORPHEUS

                              "I know."

                                 NEO

           "I couldnt do it. Morpheus, theres a problem."


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

       MORPHEUS has the headset on. He stands and surveys NEO.

                               MORPHEUS

            "Yes, there is a problem. The Matrix exists."


EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT

                  NEOS relief fades into confusion.

                                 NEO

                         "I know. Im sorry."

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

                        "And the problem is..."

                                 NEO

 "Uh, its impossible. If the Matrix is destroyed, the people within
the system will die. They will all die. There has to be a different
                                way."

                      MORPHEUS doesnt respond.

                                 NEO

                    "Morpheus? Did you know this?"

We  hear  nothing. NEO  can  hear his  own  heart beating.  Anger  and
confusion add to the already heavy mental burden he carries.



                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

              "I didnt say things would be easy, Neo."

        NEO sinks to the ground, shocked. He shakes his head.

                                 NEO

                                "No."


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

MORPHEUS isnt happy about what he has to tell his protégé, but  there
is no bending his will. The others look on soberly.

                               MORPHEUS

   "Neo, the Matrix... its not real. And its up to you to end it."




EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT

NEO cant stand the reality of the situation. Hes coming apart.

                                 NEO

  "No, Morpheus, this cant be! We cant do this! We have to get the
                             people out."

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

 "Even if we could somehow get to them without cutting through their
defenses, theres no way we can rehabilitate billions of people. They
                 wouldnt even want to be woken up."

                            Neo is silent.

                           MORPHEUS (O.S.)

                  "You can do it. You can free us."

                                 NEO

             "Why me? Why the fuck do I have to do this?"

                 MORPHEUS is silent for a long while.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

Everyone is watching  Morpheus, and no  one can quite  believe what is
happening.

                               MORPHEUS

"You know what needs to be done. Time is short. Make up your mind. The
only way youre getting out of the Matrix is through its destruction."

                    Morpheus kills the connection.


EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT

Neo hears the line click dead. He cant believe what has happened.


INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

MORPHEUS drops the headset on  the operations console. He types  a few
commands on the keyboard, then addresses the crew.

                               MORPHEUS

                  "No one goes in. Hes on his own."

                       He leaves the main deck.

Trinity stares at Neo for a moment, her face fighting for composure No
one looks at her. She walks away, then leans against the bulkhead, her
body shaking.


EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT

Neo closes the cell  phone. He reaches to  tuck it away, then  pauses,
looking at it. He drops it to the ground and walks on.

He stands out on   a finger of crumbling   church, the night air   all
around him.  The  city  lights are   alive below.  He  focuses  on the
Metacortex building. Leaving  him there, we  rush to it  until we dive
into the dark  shadows  of the  very building,  going  microscopically
close, until the  darkness gives way  to the glowing  green miasma  of
quantum  code.  It  fills  the  screen  before  we  bust  through into
darkness again.


TO BE CONTINUED...
THE MATRIX

	FADE IN ON:

	COMPUTER SCREEN

	So close it has no boundaries.

	A blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a
	heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath
	the derma of black-neon glass.

	A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were 
	making the call.  The cursor continues to throb,
	relentlessly patient, until --

					MAN (V.O.)
			Hello?

	Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing
	faster than we read.

					SCREEN
			Call trans opt:  received.
			2-19-96  13:24:18  REC:Log>

					WOMAN (V.O.)
			I'm inside.  Anything to report?

	We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on
	a third line.  The man's name is CYPHER.  The woman, 
	TRINITY.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Let's see.  Target left work at
			5:01 PM.

					SCREEN
			Trace program:  running.

	The entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers.
	Shimmering like green-electric rivets, they rush at a 10-
	digit phone number in the top corner.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			He caught the northbound Howard 
			line. Got off at Sheridan.  
			Stopped at 7-11.  Purchased six-
			pack of beer and a box of Captain 
			Crunch.  Returned home.

	The area code is identified.  The first three numbers
	suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.

	We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each 
	digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like
	the wheels of a slot machine.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			All right, you're relieved.  Use
			the usual exit.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Do you know when we're going to
			make contact?

					TRINITY
			Soon.

	Only two thin digits left.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Just between you and me, you don't 
			believe it, do you?  You don't 
			believe this guy is the one?

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I think Morpheus believes he is.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			I know.  But what about you?

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I think Morpheus knows things that
			I don't.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Yeah, but if he's wrong --

	The final number pops into place --

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Did you hear that?

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Hear what?

					SCREEN
			Trace complete.  Call origin:
			#312-555-0690

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Are you sure this line is clean?

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Yeah, course I'm sure.

	We MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green 
	numbers GROWING INTO an OMINOUS ROAR.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I better go.

					CYPHER (V.O.) 
			Yeah.  Right.  See you on the other side.

	She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the
	netherworld of the computer screen.

	Where gradually the sound of a police radio grows around 
	us.

					RADIO (V.O.)
			Attention all units.  Attention
			all units.

	Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find
	ourselves in --


	INT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT

	The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way 
	across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms 
	as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving 
	patterns of permanent shadow.

	We FOLLOW four armed POLICE officers using flashlights as 
	they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves
	on either side of room 303.

	The biggest of them violently kicks in the door --

	The other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before
	them.

					BIG COP
			Police!  Freeze!

	The room is almost devoid of furniture.  There is a fold-
	up table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook 
	computer.  The only light in the room is the glow of the
	computer.

	Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is 
	TRINITY; a woman in black leather.

					BIG COP
			Get your hands behind your head!

	Trinity rises.

					BIG COP
			Hands behind your head!  Now!  Do
			it!

	She slowly puts her hands behind her head.


	EXT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT

	A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the 
	police cruisers.

	AGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN get out of the car.

	They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.  They 
	are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones 
	in one ear, its cord coiling back into their shirt
	collars.

					AGENT SMITH
			Lieutenant?

					LIEUTENANT
			Oh shit.

					AGENT SMITH 
			Lieutenant, you were given 
			specific orders --

					LIEUTENANT
			I'm just doing my job.  You gimme 
			that Juris-my dick-tion and you 
			can cran it up your ass.

					AGENT SMITH
			The orders were for your protection.

	The Lieutenant laughs.

					LIEUTENANT
			I think we can handle one little
			girl.

	Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the
	hotel.

					LIEUTENANT
			I sent two units.  They're 
			bringing her down now.

					AGENT SMITH
			No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.


	INT.  CHASE HOTEL

	The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding 
	a bead.  They've done this a hundred times, they know 
	they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuff 
	and Trinity moves --

	It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly 
	fast.

	The eye blinks and Trinity's palm. snaps up and the nose 
	explodes, blood erupting.  The cop is dead before he
	begins to fall.

	And Trinity is moving again --

	Seizing a wrist, misdirecting a gun, as a startled cop 
	FIRES --

	A head explodes.

	In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed 
	black hole --

	And FIRES --

	Trinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she 
	reverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.

	The cop begins to scream when a jump kick crushes his 
	windpipe, killing the scream as he falls to the ground.

	She looks at the four bodies.

					TRINITY
			Shit.


	EXT.  CHASE HOTEL

	Agent Brown enters the hotel, while Agent Smith heads for 
	the alley.


	INT.  CHASE HOTEL

	Trinity is on the phone, pacing.  The other end is 
	answered.

					MAN (V.O.)
			Operator.

					TRINITY
			Morpheus!  The link was traced!  I
			don't know how.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I know.  Stay calm.

					TRINITY
			Are there any agents?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.

					TRINITY
			Goddamnit!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			You have to focus.  There is a 
			phone.  Wells and Laxe.  You can
			make it.

	She takes a deep breath, centering herself.

					TRINITY
			All right --

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Go.

	She drops the phone.


	INT.  HALL

	She bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the hall,
	leading another unit of police.  Trinity races to the 
	opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto the 
	fire escape.


	EXT.  FIRE E5CAPE

	In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at 
	her.  She can only go up.


	EXT.  ROOF

	On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over 
	the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.

	Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her 
	moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,
	contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.

	Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.

	The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity 
	turns to it, racing for the back of the building.

	The edge falls away into a wide back alley.  The next 
	building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is 
	perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other 
	roof.

	The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something 
	ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself 
	into the air.

	From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she 
	hangs in flight

	Then hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.

					COP
			Motherfucker -- that's impossible!

	They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the 
	move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto 
	one knee.

	Just below the building are the runbling tracks of 
	riveted steel.  The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a 
	rattling blur of gray metal.  Trinity junps, landing
	easily.

	She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air 
	barely reaching the last car

	Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.

	Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.

	Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point 
	where the train has begun to turn, there is --

	A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick
	building.

	Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her 
	speed compounded by the train.  The SCREAM of the STEEL 
	rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the
	turn.

	Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body 
	leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head
	as --

	The whole world seems to spin on its axis --

	And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then 
	falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down
	stairs bleeding, broken --

	But still alive.

	Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,
	still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the
	wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train 
	slides him past the window.

	Trinity tries to move.  Everything hurts.

					TRINITY
			Get up, Trinity.  You're fine.
			Get up -- just get up!

	She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.


	EXT.  STREET

	Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the 
	end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she
	sees it.

	The telephone booth.

	Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,
	focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE
	begins to RING.

	Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its 
	TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.

	Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the
	telephone booth as if taking aim.

	Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --

	Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly
	bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --

	She answers the phone.

	There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking 
	mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --

	Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick
	wall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp.

	After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of 
	the garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.
	There is no body.  Trinity is gone.

	His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.
	AGENT JONES walks up behind him.

					AGENT SMITH
			Did you get anything from the
			room?

					AGENT JONES
			Their next target.  The name is
			Neo.

	The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground,
	separated in the crash like a severed limb.

					AGENT SMITH
			We'll need a search running.

					AGENT JONES
			It's already begun.

	We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER 
	and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out 
	like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall
	through one --

	Swallowed by the darkness that becomes --

	A computer screen.

	We are on-line, inside a chat room called "The Matrix." 
	It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.

					SCREEN
			JACKON:  I heard Morpheus has been
			on this board.
			SUPERASTIC:  Morpheus doesn't even
			exist and the Matrix is nothing 
			but an advertising gimmick 4 a new
			game.
			TIMAXE:  All I want to know is
			Trinity really a girl?
			LODIII:  87% of all women on line
			are really men.
			QUARK:  The Matrix is a euphemism 
			for the government.
			SUPERASTIC:  No, The Matrix is the
			system controlling our lives.
			TIMAXE:  You mean MTV.
			SUPERASTIC:  I mean Sega.
			FOS4:  ALL HAIL SEGA!!!

	We drift back from the electric conversation entering --


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	It is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with
	technology.

	Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into
	thickets that wind up and around the legs of several
	desks.

	Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay
	open like an autopsied corpse.

	We turn towards the center of this rat-nest of
	technology, following the slurping and crunching of
	cereal.  We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find --

	NEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a 
	computer than living outside one.

					NEO
			Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.

	He finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an 
	anonynous message slices onto the screen.

					SCREEN
			Do you want to know what the
			Matrix is, Neo?

	Neo is frozen when he reads his name.

					SCREEN
			SUPERASTIC:  Who said that?
			JACKON:  Who's Neo?
			GIBSON:  This is a private board.

			If you want to know, follow the
			white rabbit.

					NEO
			What the hell...

					SCREEN
			TIMAXE:  Someone is hacking the
			hackers!
			FOS4:  It's Morpheus!!!!!
			JACKON:  Identify yourself.

			Knock, knock, Neo.

	A chill runs down his spine and when someone KNOCKS on
	his door he almost jumps out of his chair.

	He looks at the door, then back at the computer but the
	message is gone.

	He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.
	Again, someone knocks.

	Cautiously, Neo approaches the door.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Hey, Tommy-boy!  You in there?

	Recognizing the voice, he relaxes and opens it.  ANTHONY,
	who lives down the hall, is standing outside with a group
	of friends.

					NEO
			What do you want, Anthony?

					ANTHONY
			I need your help, man.  Desperate.
			They got me, man.  The shackles of 
			fascism.

	He holds up the red notice that accompanies the Denver
	boot.

					NEO
			You got the money this time?

	He holds up two hundred dollars and Neo opens the door.
	Anthony's girlfriend, DUJOUR, stops in front of Neo.

					DUJOUR
			You can really get that thing off,
			right now?

					ANTHONY
			I told you, honey, he may look 
			like just another geek but this 
			here is all we got left standing 
			between Big Brother and the New
			World Order.


	EXT.  STREET

	A police officer unlocks a yellow metal boot from the
	wheel of an enormous oldsmobile.


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	They watch from the window as the cops, silently,
	robotically, climb into their van.

					ANTHONY
			Look at 'em.  Automatons.  Don't 
			think about what they're- doing or
			why.  Computer tells 'em what to
			do and they do it.

					FRIEND #l
			Thc banality of evil.

	He slaps the money in Neo's hand.

					ANTHONY
			Thanks, neighbor.

					DUJOUR
			Why don't you come to the party
			with us?

					NEO
			I don't know.  I have to work
			tomorrow.

					DUJOUR
			Come on.  It'll be fun.

	He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
	leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins:  bands,
	symbols, slogans, military medals and --

	A small white rabbit.

	The ROOM TILTS.

					NEO
			Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.


	INT.  APARTMENT

	An older Chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a 
	chain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy
	casements.

	Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there 
	are.

	Dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,
	gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like
	jungle cats around a tree.

	Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle
	of beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to
	leave when he notices a woman staring at him.

	The woman is Trinity.  She walks straight up to him.

	In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against
	each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.

					TRINITY
			Hello, Neo.

					NEO
			How did you know that --

					TRINITY
			I know a lot about you.  I've been
			wanting to meet you for some time.

					NEO
			Who are you?

					TRINITY
			My name is Trinity.

					NEO
			Trinity?  The Trinity?  The
			Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.
			Kansas City D-Base?

					TRINITY
			That was a long time ago.

					NEO
			Gee-zus.

					TRINITY
			What?

					NEO
			I just thought... you were a guy.

					TRINITY
			Most guys do.

	Neo is a little embarrassed.

					NEO
			Do you want to go sorewhere and
			talk?

					TRINITY
			No.  It's safe here and I don't
			have much time.

	The MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking
	directly into each other's ear.

					NEO
			That was you on the board tonight.
			That was your note, wasn't it?

					TRINITY
			I had to gamble that you would see
			and they wouldn't.

					NEO
			Who wouldn't?

					TRINITY
			I can't explain everything to you.
			I'm sure that it's all going to
			seem very strange, but I brought
			you here to warn you, Neo.  You
			are in a lot of danger.

					NEO
			What?  Why?

					TRINITY
			They're watching you.  Something
			happened and they found out about
			you.  Normally, if our target is
			exposed we let it go.  But this
			time, we can't do that.

					NEO
			I don't understand --

					TRINITY
			You came here because you wanted
			to know the answer to a hacker's
			question.

					NEO
			The Matrix.  What is the Matrix?

					TRINITY
			Twelve years ago I met a man, a
			great man, who said that no one
			could be told the answer to that
			question.  That they had to see
			it, to believe it.

	Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.

					TRINITY
			He told me that no one should look
			for the answer unless they have to
			because once you see it,
			everything changes.  Your life and
			the world you live in will never
			be the same.  It's as if you wake
			up one morning and the sky is
			falling.

	There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels
	the words like a drug, seeping into him.

					TRINITY
			The truth is out there, Neo.  It's
			looking for you and it will find
			you, if you want it to.

	She takes hold of him with her eyes.

					TRINITY
			That's all I can tell you right
			now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good
			luck.

					NEO
			Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the
			man?

	She leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she
	whispers.

					TRINITY
			You know who.

	She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
	of bodies.

	A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music,
	pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --

							CUT TO:


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to
	consciousness.  He strains to read the clock face:
	9:15 A.M.

					NEO
			Shitshitshit.


	EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

	The downtown office of CorTechs, a software development
	company.


	INT.  CORTECHS OFFICE

	The main offices are along each wall, the windows
	overlooking downtown Chicago.

	RHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo
	without looking at him, typing at his computer
	continuously.

	Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
	outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the
	surface of the glass.

					RHINEHEART
			You have a problem, Mr. Anderson.
			You think that you're special.
			You believe that somehow the rules
			do not apply to you.

	He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in
	time.

					RHINEHEART
			Obviously, you are mistaken.

	His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.

					RHINEHEART
			This company is one of the top
			software companies in the world
			because every single employee
			understands that they are a part
			of a whole.  Thus, if an employee
			has a problem, the company has a
			problem.

	He turns again.

					RHINEHEART
			The time has come to make a 
			choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you
			choose to be at your desk on time
			from this day forth, or you choose
			to find yourself another job.  Do
			I make myself clear?

					NEO
			Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly
			clear.

	INT.  NEO'S CUBICLE

	The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a
	labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
	elevators.

	Neo slumps down into his chair.  A TALL EMPLOYEE stands
	up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.

					TALL EMPLOYEE
			What did he say?

					NEO
			If I was late again, I'm going to
			be fired.

	He smirks.

					TALL EMPLOYEE
			Well, it was nice working with
			you.

	Neo glares at him, as he sinks down.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Thomas Anderson?

	Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle
	door.

					NEO
			Yeah.  That's me.

	Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him
	the softpak.

					FEDEX
			Have a nice day.

	He opens the bag.  Inside is a CELLULAR PHONE.  It seems
	the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS.  Unnerved, he
	flips it open.

					NEO
			Hello?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Hello, Neo.  This is Morpheus.

	Neo's knees give and he falls into his chair.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I had hoped for this conversation
			to take place under less adverse
			conditions, but you can never
			count on hope, can you, Neo?

					NEO
			... no.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I've been watching you, Neo, and I
			want to meet you.  I don't know if
			you're ready to see what I want to
			show you, but unfortunately, we
			have run out of time.  They're
			coming for you, Neo.  And I'm not
			sure what they're going to do.

					NEO
			Who's coming for me?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Stand up and see for yourself.

					NEO
			Right now?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.  Now.

	Neo starts to stand.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Do it slowly.  Slowly.  The elevator.

	His head slowly peeks up over the partition.

	At the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones
	leading a group of cops.  A female employee turns and
	points out Neo's cubicle.

	Neo ducks.

					NEO
			Holy fuckin' shit!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.

	One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the
	agents.

					NEO
			What the fuck do they want with
			me?!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I'm not sure.  But, if you don't
			want to find out, you better get
			out of there.

					NEO
			How?!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I can guide you out, but you have
			to do exactly what I say.

	The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			The cubicle across from you is
			empty.

					NEO
			But what if...?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Go!  Now!

	Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle
	just as the agents turn into his row.

	Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone
	tightly to him.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Stay here for a moment.

	The agents enter Neo's empty cubicle.  A cop is sent to
	search the bathroom.

	Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			A little longer...

	Brown is talking to the tall employee.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			When I tell you, go to the end of
			the row to the first office on the
			left, stay.as low as you can.

	Sweat trickles down his forehead.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Now.

	Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he
	freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.

	Staying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING
	across the opening to the first office on the left.

	The room is empty.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Good.  Now there is a window.
			Open it.

					NEO
			How do you know all this?

	Morpheus laughs quietly.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			The answer is coming, Neo.

	He opens the window.  The window howls into the room.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Outside, there's a scaffold.  You
			can use it to get to the roof.

	Leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is
	several offices away.

					NEO
			No! It's too far away.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			There's a small ledge.  It's a
			short climb.  You can make it.

	Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a
	concrete chasm.

					NEO
			No way, no way, this is crazy.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Don't be controlled by your fear,
			Neo.  There are only two ways out
			of this building.  One is that
			scaffold.  The other is in their
			custody.  You take a chance either
			way.  I leave it to you.

	CLICK.  He hangs up.  Neo looks at the door, then back at
	the scaffold.

					NEO
			This is insane!  Why is this
			happening to me?  What did I do?
			I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything.
			Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck!

	He climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the
	frame, he steps onto the small ledge.

	The scaffold seems even farther away.

					NEO
			I'm going to die.

	The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,
	knocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to
	the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.

	He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.

					NEO
			This is insane.  I can't do this!
			Forget it!

	He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the
	door.

					NEO
			I didn't do anything!


	EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

	The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving
	doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the
	dark sedan.

	Trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her
	motorcycle.

					TRINITY
			Shit.

	INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA MONITOR

	A wide angle view of a white roon, where Neo is sitting at
	a table alone.

	We MOVE INTO the monitor, ENTERING the room as if the
	monitor were a window.

	At the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter.

	Smith sits down across from Neo.  A thick manila envelope
	slaps down on the table between them.

	Neo glances at the name on the file: "Anderson, Thomas 
	A."

					AGENT SMITH
			As you can see, we've had our eye
			on you for some time now, Mr.
			Anderson.

	He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he
	flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at
	the file or at him.

					AGENT SMITH
			It seems that you have been living
			two lives.  In one life, you are
			Thomas A. Anderson, program writer
			for a respectable software
			company.  You have a social
			security number, you pay your
			taxes and you help your land lady
			carry out her garbage.

	The pages continue to turn.

					AGENT SMITH
			The other life is lived in
			computers where you go by the
			hacker alias Neo, and are guilty
			of virtually every computer crime
			we have a law for, including the
			unauthorized use of the D.M.V.
			system for the removal of
			automobile boots.

	Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.

					AGENT SMITH
			One of these,lives has a future.
			One of them does not.

	He closes the file.

					AGENT SMITH
			I'm going to be as forthcoming as
			I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are
			here because we need your help.

	He removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice-
	blue.

					AGENT SMITH
			We know that you have been
			contacted by a certain individual.
			A man who calls himself Morpheus.
			Whatever you think you know about
			this man is irrelevant to the fact
			that he is wanted for acts of
			terrorism in more countries than
			any other man in the world.  He is
			considered by many authorities to
			be the most dangerous man alive.

	He leans closer.

					AGENT SMITH
			My colleagues believe that I am
			wasting my time with you, but I
			believe you want to do the right
			thing.  It is obvious that you are
			an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,
			and that you are interested in the
			future.  That is why I believe you
			are ready to put your past
			mistakes behind you and get on
			with your life.

	Neo tries to match his stare.

					AGENT SMITH
			We are willing to wipe the slate
			clean, to give you a fresh start
			and all we are asking in return is
			your cooperation in bringing a
			known terrorist to justice.

	Neo nods to himself.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a
			real good deal.  But I think I
			have a better one.  How about I
			give you the finger --

	He does.

					NEO
			And you can cram that file up your
			Secret Service sphincter.

	Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.

					AGENT SMITH
			You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.

					NEO
			You ain't seen nothing yet.

					AGENT SMITH
			The irony of your situation is
			that you have no choice.

					NEO
			You can't scare me with this
			gestapo crap.  I know my rights.
			I want my phone call.

	Agent Smith smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what
			good is a phone call iy you are
			unable to speak?

	The question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to
	feel the muscles in his jaw tighten.

	The standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion
	grow into panic.

	Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
	seal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his
	mouth is gone.

	Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents
	restrain him holding him in the chair.

					AGENT SMITH
			You are going to help us, Mr.
			Anderson, whether you want to or
			not.

	Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.

	From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a
	long, fiber-optic wire tap.

	Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over
	his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the
	electronic device animates, become an organic creature
	that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.

	Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into
	Neo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature
	which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --

	Before it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it
	worms its way inside.


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Screaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.

	He realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth
	is normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a
	deep, everything-is-okay breath, when --

	The PHONE RINGS.

	It almost stops his heart.  It CONTINUES RINGING,
	building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed,
	sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.

	He answers it, saying nothing.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.).
			This line is tapped, so I must be
			brief.

					NEO
			The agents --

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			They got to you first, but they've
			underestimated how important you
			are.  If they knew what I know,
			you would probably be dead.

	Neo feels sick.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I don't know what you are thinking
			right now but I want you to
			understand that I will not give up
			on you until you give up on me.

	Neo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Do you still want to meet?

					NEO
			... Yes.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Take the Howard line south.

	CLICK.  He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.


	EXT.  EL TRAIN

	An EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails.


	INT.  TRAIN

	It is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban
	night crawlers.  Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching
	everything nervously.

	There is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as
	the door is opened.

	Neo turns and sees a large man enter.  He is wearing
	sunglasses and a black leather jacket.  His name is APOC
	and he walks straight at Neo.

					APOC
			Come with me.

	Neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and
	two police officers rush in, drawing their guns.

	Apoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit.  There
	is no upcoming station.

	Apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles
	against its own speed.  The cops are thrown back.  Neo
	slams against the metal rail.

	The doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his
	balance, Apoc shoves him backwards --

	He flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls
	from, the raised tracks --

	Hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere,
	a truck races under him and --

	He crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty
	boxes.


	INT.  TRUCK BED

	Still shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone.  A
	man named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him.  Trinity is
	next to him, talking into a cellular phone.

					TRINITY
			We got him.  Call the chop-shop.

	She hangs up.

					TRINITY
			Listen to me, Neo.  You have to,
			trust us.

	She tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches
	for his face.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					TRINITY
			This has to be done for your
			protection and ours.

	She seals his eyes shut with the tape.

					TRINITY
			You can't understand right now,
			but if you're not one of us,
			you're one of them.


	EXT.  LOWER WACKER

	A featureless black van glides up to a staircase that
	curls down from the city's surface.

	trinity guides the blind Neo down the steps.  The back of
	the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who
	looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is
	a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.

	His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity,
	exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking
	braces.

					GIZMO
			Va va va voom.  Still the hottest
			software around.

					TRINITY
			Hello, Gizmo.

	Neo hears the voices around him.

					GIZMO
			This is really the guy?  The guy
			that Morpheus thinks --

					TRINITY
			Yeah.

					GIZMO
			But he's so old.

					TRINITY
			Are you going to help us or aren't
			you?

					GIZMO
			Hacksaw.  Load up the copper-top
			and let's get the hell outta here.

	Hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron.  He
	shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.

	A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve
	over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the
	underworld.


	INT.  VAN

	The chop-shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to
	meters and monitors.  There are shelves lined with
	medical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives,
	cleavers, and stainless steel clamps.

	Neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening
	nervously as Gizmo gets to work.

					GIZMO
			Okay, first we take a little look
			under the hood.

	He pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they
	blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising
	to varying levels of magnification.

					GIZMO
			You're going to feel a little
			prick.

	He inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower
	abdomen.  The needles are wired to video monitors.
	Hacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					TRINITY
			We think you're bugged.  We can't
			take you to Morpheus until you're
			clean.

					GIZMO
			There it is.

	On a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large
	intestines.

					GIZMO
			Hit him with 10 ccs of local.

	Hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic
	around Neols navel.

	Using a device that looks like a miniature speculum,
	Gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick.  Typing into a
	calculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the
	tip.

	On the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end
	separate into a tiny hooked, metal claw.

					GIZMO
			Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

	The claw snags hold of the bug.

					GIZMO
			Gotcha!

	But the bug reacts violently.  Neo screams as it wraps
	itself around the soft tissue web of intestine.

					GIZMO
			Shit.

					TRINITY
			What's happening?

					GIZMO
			I don't know.  They've never done
			that before.

	Neo writhes in pain.

					GIZMO
			Hold him down.

					NEO
			Jesus!  God!

					TRINITY
			Do something!

					GIZMO
			I got it!  Maybe we can stun it.

					TRINITY
			Are you crazy?  That will kill
			him.

	We watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about.

					GIZMO
			It'll work.  Come on, do it or
			Hacksaw will.

					NEO
			Do what?

	The instant he hears the word, he knows.

					TRINITY
			Clear.

					NEO
			Oh, shit --

	The cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his
	chest.  Gizmo wrestles with the bug.

					GIZMO
			Hit him again!

	Again, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo
	yanks the speculum out.

					GIZMO
			Got it!

	Trinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe.
	She eases the tape off his eyes.

					TRINITY
			Neo, are you okay?

	He nods.

					TRINITY
			It's over.  We got it.

	Hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire-
	tap.

					GIZMO
			Nasty little bugger, ain't it?


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

	The van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten
	hotel.  The doors open and Trinity helps Neo get out.

					TRINITY
			Thanks for your help, Gizmo.

					GIZMO
			I just hope the man knows what
			he's doing.

	She nods then climbs out of the van.  Gizmo ogles the
	tight leather pants.

					GIZMO
			Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for
			a copy of that software.

	Trinity turns around.

					TRINITY
			Gizmo, you don't have the hardware
			to handle this software.

	He howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away.
	Trinity turns to Neo.

					TRINITY
			Let's go.  He's waiting.


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

	It is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of
	urban maggotry.

	Trinity leads Neo from the stairwell down the hall of the
	thirteenth floor.  They stop outside room 1313.

					TRINITY
			This is it.

	Neo can hear his own heart pounding.

					TRINITY
			Let me give one piece of advice.
			Be honest.  He knows more than you
			can possibly imagine.


	INT.  ROOM 1313

	Across the room, a dark figure stares out the tall
	windows veiled with decaying lace.  He turns and his
	smile lights up the room.

					MORPHEUS
			At last.

	He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible
	behind circular mirrored glasses.

	He strides to Neo and they shake hands.

					MORPHEUS
			Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt
			have guessed, I am Morpheus.

					NEO
			It's an honor.

					MORPHEUS
			Please.  Come.  Sit.

	He nods to Trinity.

					MORPHEUS
			Thank you, Trinity.

	She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an
	adjacent room.

	They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-
	leather chairs.

					MORPHEUS
			I imagine, right now, you must be
			feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling
			down the rabbit hole?

					NEO
			You could say that.

					MORPHEUS
			I can see it in your eyes.  You
			have the look of a man who accepts
			what he sees because he is
			expecting to wake up.

	A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.

					MORPHEUS
			Ironically, this is not far from
			the truth.  But I'm getting ahead
			of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,
			why are you here?

					NEO
			You're Morpheus, you're a legend.
			Most hackers would die to meet
			you.

					MORPHEUS
			Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we
			both know there's more to it than 
			that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?

					NEO
			No.

					MORPHEUS
			Why not?

					NEO
			Because I don't like the idea that
			I'm not in control of my life.

					MORPHEUS
			I know exactly what you mean.

	Again, that smile that could cut glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Let me tell you why you are here.
			You are here because you have the
			gift.

					NEO
			What gift?

					MORPHEUS
			I've watched you, Neo.  You do not
			use a computer like a tool.  You
			use it like it was part of
			yourself.  What you can do inside
			a computer is not normal.  I know.
			I've seen it.  What you do is
			magic.

	Neo shrugs.

					NEO
			It's not magic.

					MORPHEUS
			But it is, Neo.  It is.  How else
			would you describe what has been
			happening to you?

	He leans forward.

					MORPHEUS
			We are trained in this world to
			accept only what is rational and
			logical.  Have you ever wondered
			why?

	Neo shakes his head.

					MORPHEUS
			As children, we do not separate
			the possible from the impossible
			which is why the younger a mind is
			the easier it is to free while a
			mind like yours can be very
			difficult.

					NEO
			Free from what?

					MORPHEUS
			From the Matrix.

	Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of
	himself.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you want to know what it is,
			Neo?

	Neo swallows and nods his head.

					MORPHEUS
			It's that feeling you have had all
			your life.  That feeling that
			something was wrong with the
			world.  You don't know what it is
			but it's there, like a splinter in
			your mind, driving you mad,
			driving you to me.  But what is
			it?

	The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.

					MORPHEUS
			The Matrix is everywhere, it's all
			around us, here even in this room.
			You can see it out your window, or
			on your television.  You feel it
			when you go to work, or go to
			church or pay your taxes.  It is
			the world that has been pulled
			over your eyes to blind you from
			the truth.

					NEO
			What truth?

					MORPHEUS
			That you are a slave, Neo.  That
			you, like everyone else, was born
			into bondage...
			... kept inside a prison that you
			cannot smell, taste, or touch.  A
			prison for your mind.

	Outside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Unfortunately, no one can be told
			what the Matrix is.  You have to
			see it for yourself.

					NEO
			How?

					MORPHEUS
			Hold out your hands.

	In Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.

					MORPHEUS
			This is your last chance.  After
			this, there is no going back.

	In his left, a blue pill.

					MORPHEUS
			You take the blue pill and the
			story ends.  You wake in your bed
			and you believe whatever you want
			to believe.

	The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.

					MORPHEUS
			You take the red pill and you stay
			in Wonderland and I show you how
			deep the rabbit-hole goes.

	Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the
	moisture growing in his palms.

					MORPHEUS
			Remember that all I am offering is
			the truth.  Nothing more.

	Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The
	Cheshire smile returns.

					MORPHEUS
			Follow me.

	He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with
	high-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green
	from the racks of monitors.

	Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.

					CYPHER
			Shit.

					TRINITY
			I knew he would.

	Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone
	away from, Neo.

					CYPHER
			Morpheus, I know what you believe
			but I think this is a mistake.
			We're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm
			afraid he might pop.

					MORPHEUS
			Haven't I always told you, Cypher,
			not to let fear control your life.
			Apoc, are we on-line?

	Neo recognizes the large man from the El train.

					APOC
			Almost.

	He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex
	system of monitors, modules and drives.

					NEO
			Apoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen
			Virus.

					APOC
			That's right.

					MORPHEUS
			Neo, time is always against us.
			Will you take a seat there?

	In the center of the room sits a chair.  Near the chair
	is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.

					MORPHEUS
			I imagine you know sonething about
			virtual reality.

	Neo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode
	disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.

					NEO
			A little.

					MORPHEUS
			Tell me about it.

					NEO
			Essentially, it's a hardware
			system that uses an apparatus;
			headgear, gloves and whatever to
			make you feel that you are in a
			computer program.

					MORPHEUS
			If the virtual reality apparatus,
			as you called it, was wired to all
			of your senses and controlled them
			completely, would you be able to
			tell the difference between the
			virtual world and the real world?

					NEO
			You might not, no.

					MORPHEUS
			No, you wouldn't.

	Neo whispers to Trinity.

					NEO
			You did all this?

	She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.
	They are wired to an old hotel phone.

					MORPHEUS
			The pill you took is part of a
			trace program.  It's going to make
			things feel a bit strange.

	Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING
	on a KEYBOARD.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and
	twitch when he notices the mirror.

	Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a
	webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
	mirror were becoming liquid.

					NEO
			Shit...

	Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent
	data.  Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.

	Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers
	disappear beneath the rippling surface.

	Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
	stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy
	stuck to his fingertips.

					NEO
			What is this?  Mescaline?

					MORPHEUS
			Just relax, Neo.

	The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,
	until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.

	With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes
	of electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and
	fade.

	He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored
	icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running
	like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms
	where he sees his face reflected.

					NEO
			Uh-oh...

					TRINITY
			It's going into replication.

					MORPHEUS
			Apoc?

					APOC
			Still nothing.

	Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.

					MORPHEUS
			Tank, we're going to need the
			signal soon.  Stay calm, Neo.

	The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up
	his arns like hundreds of insects.

					NEO
			It's cold.

	The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,
	tipping his head as though he were sinking into the
	mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.

					NEO
			It's all over me --

	Morpheus is right next to him, with the phone.

					TRINITY
			I got a fibrillation!

					CYPHER
			I knew it, I knew it...

					MORPHEUS
			Shit!  Apoc?

	Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.

					APOC
			Targeting... almost there.

	An ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.

					TRINITY
			He's going into arrest!

					CYPHER
			He's gonna pop!

					APOC
			Lock!  I got him!

					MORPHEUS
			Now, Tank now!

	His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a
	high-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --

	It is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to
	another computer --

	Neo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were
	pulled into the holes of the phone

	Sucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.


	INT.  POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MAN'S BODY

	Floating in a womb-red amnion.

	His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.

	Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure
	his face.  Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs
	and cover his genitals.

	He is struggling desperately now.  Air bubbles into the
	Jell-O but does not break the surface.

	Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red
	rubber coccon.

	Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at
	the thinning elastic shroud --

	Until it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he
	sucks for air.  Tearing himself free, he emerges from the
	cell.

	It is Neo.

	He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin.
	Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.

	He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled
	with red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified
	like curdled milk.

	The IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear
	to be grafted to his flesh.

	He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the
	back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial
	plugged and locked into the base of his skull.

	He tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull
	off a finger.

	To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with
	red gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and
	motionless, he sees other human beings.

	Fanning out in a circle, there are more.  All connected
	to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing
	petal attached to a black metal stem.

	Above him, level after, level, the stem rises seemingly
	forever.  He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks
	out.

	The image assaults his mind.

	Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible
	heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an
	underwater abyss.

	His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the
	intensity of the vision.  The sound of the PLANT is like
	the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of
	Leviathan.

	Below Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away
	the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a
	new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space.

	Inside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and
	pinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby.

	From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo.

	He swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him.

	It is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful
	housings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems
	of hard and soft polymers.

	A black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain
	as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired
	to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex.

	At the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens,
	disengaging.

	The cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle
	and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull
	with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid.  The other
	connective hoses snap free and snake away as --

	The back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like
	an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo
	into a black hole.


	INT.  WASTE LINE

	The pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls,
	sliding with the clot of gelatin.

	Banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up
	through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of
	cellulite.

	Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the
	flow of waste.

	The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the
	belly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside
	the sewer main line.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	The metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo
	onto the floor.

	Human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself
	looking straight at Morpheus.

	Trinity and Apoc.  And others, dressed in bizarre, high-
	tech combat gear.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			Welcome to the real world, Neo.

	Neo passes out.

									FADE TO BLACK.

	We have no sense of time.  We hear VOICES whispering.

					MAN (O.S.)
			Do you think Morpheus is right?
			Do you think he could be the One?

					WOMAN (O.S.)
			It doesn't matter now.  But if
			he's wrong...

	FADE IN:

	NEO'S POV

	Neo's eyes flutter open.  We see Trinity's face above us,
	angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick.


	ANGLE ON NEO

					NEO
			... am I dead?

					TRINITY
			Far from it.

									FADE TO BLACK.


	FADE IN:


	ANGLE ON NEO

	He opens his eyes again, something tingling through him.
	He focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of
	acupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device.

					DOZER
			He needs a lot of work.

					MORPHEUS
			I know.

	Dozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					MORPHEUS
			Your muscles have atrophied.
			We're rebuilding them.

	Fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright.

					NEO
			Why do my eyes hurt?

					MORPHEUS
			You've never used them before.

	Morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo.
	Neo lays back.

					MORPHEUS
			Rest, Neo.  The answers are
			coming.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Neo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better.  He is
	wearing a black tank top and shorts.

	He begins to examine himself.  There is a futuristic IV
	plugged into the jack in his forearm.  He pulls it out,
	staring at the grafted outlet.

	He feels his bald head.  His fingers find and explore the
	large outlet in the base of his skull.

	Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the
	door.

					NEO
			Morpheus, what's happened to me?
			What is this place?

					MORPHEUS
			More important than what is when?

					NEO
			When?

					MORPHEUS
			You believe the year is 1997 when
			in fact it is much closer to 2197.
			I can't say for certain what year
			it is because we honestly do not
			know.

	The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.

					NEO
			That's not possible.

					MORPHEUS
			I promised you the truth, Neo, and
			the truth is that the world you
			were living in was a lie.

					NEO
			How?

					MORPHEUS
			I'll show you.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Like a sleepwalker, Neo follows Morpheus through the ship.

					MORPHEUS
			This is my ship, the
			Nebuchadnezzar.  It's a
			hovercraft.  Small like a
			submarine.  It's dark.  It's
			cramped and cold.  But it's home.

	They climb a ladder up to the main deck.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Everyone is there.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the main deck.  You know
			most of my crew.

	Trinity smiles and nods.

					MORPHEUS
			The ones you don't know.  That's
			Mouse and Switch.  The two big
			guys are Tank and Dozer.

	The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.

					MORPHEUS
			And this, this is the Core.  This
			is where we broadcast our pirate
			signal and hack into the Matrix.

	It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  Vines of
	coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic
	battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks
	of little systems and computer monitors.

	At the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton
	chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.

	Near the circle of chairs is the control console and
	operator's station where the network is monitored.

					MORPHEUS
			Help him, Trinity.

	Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you remember when I asked you
			about an apparatus that could turn
			a virtual reality into reality?

	Neo nods.

					MORPHEUS
			It's right here.

	He touches Neo's head.

					MORPHEUS
			And it's accessed here.

	Neo feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack
	at the back of his neck.  The cable has the same kind of
	cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant.

					MORPHEUS
			This will feel a little weird.

	There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the
	needle in.

	We MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens
	into a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop
	like when you equalize them underwater.

	He relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling
	of weightlessness inside another place --


	INT.  CONSTRUCT

	Neo is standing in an empty, blank-white space.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the Construct.

	Startled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the
	room with him.

					MORPHEUS
			It is our loading program.  We can
			load anything from clothes, to
			weapons, to training simulations.
			Anything we need.

	Morpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the
	two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a
	large-screen television.

					MORPHEUS
			Sit down.

	Neo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits.

					NEO
			Right now, we're inside a computer
			program?

					MORPHEUS
			Wild, isn't it?

	Neo's hands run over the cracked leather.

					NEO
			This isn't real?

					MORPHEUS
			What is real?  How do you define
			real?  If you're talking about
			your senses, what you feel, taste,
			smell, or see, then all you're
			talking about are electrical
			signals interpreted by your brain.

	He picks up a remote control and clicks ON the
	TELEVISION.  We drift through the Windy City circa 1996.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the Chicago you know.
			Chicago as it was at the end of
			the twentieth century.  This
			Chicago exists only as part of a
			neural-interactive simulation that
			we call the Matrix.

	We GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel.

					MORPHEUS
			You have been living inside
			Baulliaurd's vision, inside the
			map, not the territory.  This is
			Chicago as it exists today.

	The sky is an endless sea of black and green bile.  The
	earth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out
	beneath us as we ENTER the television.

					MORPHEUS
			'The desert of the real.'

	In the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago
	protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of
	a long-dead corpse.

					MORPHEUS
			We are, right now, miles below the
			earth's surface.  The only place
			humans can survive outside the
			Matrix is underground.

	Still MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the
	chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert.
	Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.

					NEO
			What happened?

					MORPHEUS
			It started early in the twenty-
			first century, with the birth of
			artificial intelligence, a
			singular consciousness that
			spawned an entire race of
			machines.

	In his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.

					MORPHEUS
			At first all they wanted was to be
			treated as equals, entitled to the
			same human inalienable rights.
			Whatever they were given, it was
			not enough.

	In the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light
	up a bloody battle field.

					MORPHEUS
			We don't know who struck first.
			Us or them.  But sometime at the
			end of the twenty-first century
			the battle was joined.

	We MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.

					MORPHEUS
			The war raged for generations and
			turned the face of our planet from
			green and blue to black and red.

	At last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are
	at once terrifying and beautiful.  They have an organic
	architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is
	perpetually in motion.

	The Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier,
	splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.

					MORPHEUS
			It scorched and burned the sky.
			Without the sun, the machines
			sought out a new energy source to
			survive.

	The Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink
	bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud
	of stain.

					MORPHEUS
			They discovered a new form of
			fusion.  All that was required to
			initiate the reaction was a small
			electric charge.  Throughout human
			history we have been dependent on
			machines to survive.  Fate, it
			seems, is not without a sense of
			irony.

	We return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where
	we see human beings looking almost blissful in their
	gelatin cocoons.

					MORPHEUS
			The human body generates more bio-
			electricity than a 120-volt
			battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s
			of body heat.

	Outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a
	breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.

					MORPHEUS
			We are, as an energy source,
			easily renewable and completely
			recyclable, the dead liquified and
			fed intravenously to the living.

	Huge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.

					MORPHEUS
			All they needed to control this
			new battery was something to
			occupy our mind.

	We see inside a clear tubular husk.  Floating in viscous
	fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already
	growing around the brain-jack.

					MORPHEUS
			And so they built a prison out of
			our past, wired it to our brains
			and turned us into slaves.

	We PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television
	and we are again inside the white space of the Construct.

					NEO
			No!  I don't believe it!  It's not
			possible!

					MORPHEUS
			I didn't say that it would be
			easy, Neo.  I just said that it
			would be the truth.

	The room without walls begins to spin.

					NEO
			Stop!  Let me out!  I want out!


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	His eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair,
	trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck.

					NEO
			Get this thing out of me!

					TRINITY
			Easy, Neo.  Easy.

	Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it.  Once it's out,
	he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the
	harness.

					NEO
			Don't touch me!  Get away from me!

	On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins.
	Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull
	as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge.

					CYPHER
			He's going to pop!

	Vomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	He blinks, regaining consciousness.  The room is dark.
	Neo is stretched out on his bed.

					NEO
			I can't go back, can I?

	Morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far
	corner.

					MORPHEUS
			No.  But if you could, would you
			really want to?

	Neo isn't sure of that answer.

					MORPHEUS
			I feel that I owe you an apology.
			There is a rule that we do not
			free a mind once it reaches a
			certain age.  It is dangerous.
			They have trouble letting go..
			Their mind turns against them.
			I've seen it happen.  I broke the
			rule because I had to.

	He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to
	himself as Neo.

					MORPHEUS
			When the Matrix was first built
			there was a man born inside that
			had the ability to change what he
			wanted, to remake the Matrix as he
			saw fit.  It was this man that
			freed the first of us and taught
			us the secret of the war; control
			the Matrix and you control the
			future.

	He pauses.

					MORPHEUS
			When he died, the Oracle at the
			temple of Zion prophesied his
			return and envisioned an end to
			the war and freedom for our
			people.  That is why there are
			those of us that have spent our
			entire lives searching the Matrix,
			looking for him.

	Neo can feel his eyes on him.

					MORPHEUS
			I did what I did, because I
			believe we have been brought here
			for a reason, Neo.  You are here
			to serve a purpose, just as I am
			here to serve mine.

					NEO
			I told you I don't believe in
			fate.

	Morpheus smiles, leaning towards hin.

					MORPHEUS
			But I do, Neo.  I do.

	He stands up.

					MORPHEUS
			Get some rest.  You're going to
			need it.

					NEO
			For what?

					MORPHEUS
			Your training.



	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	There is no morning; there is only darkness and then the
	fluorescent light sticks flicker on.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights.  The
	door opens and TA.NK steps inside.

					TANK
			Morning.  Did you sleep?

					NEO
			No.

					TANK
			You will tonight.  I guarantee it.
			I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.

	He offers his hand and Neo shakes it.  He notices that
	Tank doesn't have any jacks.

					NEO
			You don't have...

					TANK
			Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my
			brother Dozer, we are 100 percent
			pure, old fashioned, home-grown
			human.  Born free.  Right here in
			the real world.  Genuine child of
			Zion.

					NEO
			Zion?

					TANK
			Zion is the place, man.  You'll
			see it one day.  Last human city.
			All we got left.

	Tank smiles.

					TANK
			Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm
			fairly excited to see what you are
			capable of.  I mean if Morpheus is
			right and all.  We're not supposed
			to talk.about any of that, but if
			you are, well then this is an
			exciting time.  We got a lot to do
			so let's get to it.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Neo is plugged in, hanging in one of the suspension
	chairs.

					TANK
			We're supposed to load all these
			operations programs first, but
			this is some major boring shit.
			Why don't we start something a
			little fun?

	Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair.  He
	begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro
	discs.

					TANK
			How about sore combat training?

	Neo reads the label on the disk.

					NEO
			Jiujitsu?  I'm going to learn
			jujitsu?

	Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.

					NEO
			No way.

	Smiling, Tank punches the "load" code.

	His body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp
	shut.  The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds,
	adrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles.

	An instant later his eyes snap open.

					NEO
			Holy shit!

					TANK
			Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready
			for more?

					NEO
			Hell yes!


	INT.  MAIN DECK - CLOSE ON COMPUTER MONITOR - LATER

	as grey pixels slowly fill a small, half-empty box.  It
	is a meter displaying how much download time is left.

	The title bar reads:  "Combat Series 10 of 12," file
	categories flashing beneath it:  Savate, Jujitsu, Ken Po,
	Drunken Boxing...

	Morpheus walks in.

					MORPHEUS
			How is he?

	Tank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes.

					TANK
			Ten hours straight.  He's a
			machine.

	Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath
	hissing from his lips.  He looks like he just orgasmed.

	He locks at Morpheus.

					NEO
			This is incredible.  I know Kung
			Fu.

	Morpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin.  He nods to
	Tank.

					MORPHEUS
			Show me.


	INT.  DOJO

	They are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo.

					MORPHEUS
			This is a sparring program,
			similar to the programmed reality
			of the Matrix.  Consider this your
			first lesson.

	He assumes a fighting stance.

					MORPHEUS
			Attack me.

	Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until
	he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.

	It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and
	feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack
	--

	But each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	While their minds battle in the programmed reality, the
	two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive
	chairs.

	Tank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is
	wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and
	steady rhythm of Morpheus.


	INT.  MESS HALL

	Dinner is up.  Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell
	protein.  It has a cottage cheese consistency.

	MOUSE bursts in the room.

					MOUSE
			Morpheus is fighting Neo!

	All at once they bolt for the door.


	INT.  DOJO

	Neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls
	himself at Morpheus.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.  Adaption.  Improvisation.
			But your weakness isn't your
			technique.

	Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen.
	His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart.  For
	every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --

	Neo falls.

	Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his
	mouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo.

					MORPHEUS
			How did I beat you?

					NEO
			You -- You're too fast.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you think my being faster,
			stronger has anything to do with
			my muscles in this place?

	Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you believe that's air you are
			breathing now?

	Neo squints at him.

					MORPHEUS
			If you can free your mind, the
			body will follow.

	Neo stands, nodding.

					MORPHEUS
			Again.

	Their fists fly with  pneumatic speed.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Everyone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight,
	like watching a game of Mortal Combat.

					CABLE
			Jeezus Keerist!  That boy is fast!

					MOUSE
			You ever seen anyone that fast
			that soon, Tank?

					TANK
			Never.

					APOC
			Morpheus is right.  He's got to be
			the one.


	INT.  DOJO

	The speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems
	impossible to sustain.  Neo's face sheds its mask of calm
	with a scream.

	He wants to beat Morpheus bad.

	Finally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the
	head, knocking his glasses off.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	There are several gasps.

					MOUSE
			I don't believe it!


	INT.  DOJO

	Morpheus rubs his face.

					MORPHEUS
			You are angry with me.

	Neo pants.

					NEO
			I, uh... maybe.

					MORPHEUS
			It's all right.  It's natural.

					NEO
			I feel better.

					MORPHEUS
			Good, good.  Anger is a gift, Neo,
			but it's a heavy one.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			Tank, load the jump program.

	Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain
	lifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building
	rooftop in a city skyline.

					MORPHEUS
			You have to learn to let go of
			that anger.  You must let go of
			everything.

	A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side.

					MORPHEUS
			You must empty yourself to free
			your mind.

	Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop.
	And jumps.  He sails through the air, his coat billowing
	out behind him like a cape --

	Somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the
	street.

					NEO
			Shit.

	Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at
	Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.

					NEO
			Okie dokie.

	He takes a deep breath.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No
			problem.

	He concentrates.  Runs.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	They are transfixed.

					CABLE
			He's gonna make it.

					APOC
			No way.  Not possible.

					MOUSE
			No one's ever made their first
			jump.

					SWITCH
			What if he does?

					APOC
			He won't.

					TANK
			It's never been done.

	Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she
	whispers.

					TRINITY
			Come on.


	EXT.  ROOFTOP

	Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo
	launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek
	--

	But comes up drastically short.

	His eyes widen as he plummets.  Stories fly by, the
	ground rushing up at him, but as he hits --

	The ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net.

	He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on
	his back.

	He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from
	his face.

	Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet.

					MORPHEUS
			Everyone falls the first time.

	Neo nods quietly.

					MORPHEUS
			If you never know failure, how can
			you know success?


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	They break up.

					MOUSE
			What does it mean?

					CABLE
			It doesn't mean anything.

					CYPHER
			Everyone falls, right, Trinity?

	But Trinity has left.

	Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out.  He tries to
	move and groans, cradling his ribs.

	While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.

					NEO
			I thought it wasn't real.

	Neo stares at the blood.

					NEO
			If you are killed in the Matrix,
			you die here?

					MORPHEUS
			The body cannot live without the
			mind.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Trinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food.

					TRINITY
			Neo, I saved you some dinner --

	She sees him passed out on the bed.  She sets the tray
	down and pulls the blanket over him.

	She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly,
	breathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away.

	It seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a
	start, unsure of where he is.  After a moment, he gets
	out of bed.


	INT.  HALL

	The ship is quiet and dark.  Everyone is asleep.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The core glows with monitor light.  Cypher is in the
	operator's chair as Neo cones up behind him.

					CYPHER
			Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the
			bejeezus out of ne.

					NEO
			Sorry.

					CYPHER
			No, it's all right.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					CYPHER
			Midnight watch.

	Neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens
	that seem alive with a constant flow of data.

					NEO
			Is that... ?

					CYPHER
			The Matrix?  Yeah.

	The monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.

					CYPHER
			You want a drink?

	He pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug.

					CYPHER
			I'll tell you, I feel for you,
			man.  I really do.  Most of us
			were still young, just punks, when
			Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you
			had a real life.

	Neo takes a sip and it almost kills him.  Cypher pounds
	on his back.

					CYPHER
			Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it.
			It's good for two things:
			degreasing engines and killing
			brain cells.

	Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.

					CYPHER
			Did he tell you why he did it?

	Neo nods.

					CYPHER,
			I'll be the didn't tell you that
			this wasn't the first time he
			thought he found the One.

	Neo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.

					CYPHER
			Let me give you a piece of advice.
			Between you and me, if Morpheus
			says you can fly, I wouldn't go
			jumping out any windows to find
			out if he's right.  Understand?

	Cypher raises his drink.  Neo swallows another throat-
	scorching mouthful.

					CYPHER
			Welcome to the real world!


	INT.  RESTAURANT (MATRIX) - NIGHT

	CHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as
	we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous
	steak.

					CYPHER
			That's what he said to me nine
			years ago.

	The meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing
	red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.

					CYPHER
			The real world.  Ha, what a joke.

	We recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.

					CYPHER
			You know what real is?  I'll tell
			you what real is.

	A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the
	face of Cypher.

					CYPHER
			Real is just another four-letter
			word.

	He laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth.

	The restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago
	skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu
	has no prices.

	Sitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.

					AGENT SMITH
			Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

	Cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his
	teeth.

					CYPHER
			Mmm, so, so fucking good.

	Smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his
	mouth.

					CYPHER
			You know, I know that this steak
			doesn't exist.  I know when I put
			it in my mouth, the Matrix is
			telling my brain that it is juicy
			and delicious.  After nine years,
			do you know what I've realized?

	Pausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork.  He
	pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef
	melting in his mouth.

					CYPHER
			Ignorance is bliss.

					AGENT SMITH
			Then we have a deal?

					CYPHER
			I don't want to remember nothing.
			Nothing!  You understand?  And I
			want to be rich.  Someone
			important.  Like an actor.  You
			can do that, right?

					AGENT SMITH
			Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

	Cypher takes a deep drink of wine.

					CYPHER
			All right.  You get my body back
			in a power plant, reinsert me into
			the Matrix and I'll get you what
			you want.

					AGENT SMITH
			Access codes to Zion.

					CYPHER
			I told you, I don't know them.
			But I can give you the man who
			does.

					AGENT SMITH
			Morpheus.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Sweat dapples his lip as Neo snaps out of the construct
	coma.

					NEO
			Jeez, I was wondering about that.

					TANK
			What?

					NEO
			Why I was bald here but not in the
			Matrix.

					TANK
			R.S.I.

					NEO
			Residual self image.

					TANK
			Good.  Now what's this?

	He points to one of Neo's monitors.

					NEO
			Life systems monitor, glucose
			levels.

					TANK
			What's that?

					NEO
			Main power supply to the core.

	He follows Tank to the operator's station where he points
	to a red key-switch.

					TANK
			How about this?

					NEO
			Mainframe self-destruct.  Uses all
			remaining power to generate an...
			E.M.P?

					TANK
			Electromagnetic pulse.  Our best
			weapon against the machines.  The
			problem is if someone is still in
			the Matrix when that thing goes
			off, they're not coming back.

	Neo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them.

					MORPHEUS
			How's he doing?

					TANK
			We just finished the operation
			programs and he's showing great
			retention.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.  I want everyone alerted to
			12-hour stand-by.  We're going in.
			Neo, it's time for you to know why
			you're here.

	Morpheus walks away.

					NEO
			What's he talking about?

					TANK
			He's taking you into the Matrix to
			see her.

					NEO
			See who?

					TANK
			The Oracle.

	Neo looks down at the monitor teeming with Matrix data
	that seems to coalesce, equations giving way to images as
	a METAL SCREAM RISES BECOMING --


	EXT.  CHICAGO (MATRIX) - DAY

	An El train.


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The room is empty, heavy curtains covering windows.  It
	looks as if it hasn't been touched in years.  In the
	bedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black PHONE
	begins to RING.

	In the mirror, we first glimpse them and as we keep
	TURNING, the room fills with equipment and the team.

	Morpheus answers the phone.

					MORPHEUS
			We're in.

	He hangs up.

					MORPHEUS
			Mouse and Cable hold the exit.
			Let's go.


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo follows the others down the stairwell that winds
	around an antique elevator shaft.

					NEO
			Did you have to do this?

					TRINITY
			Yeah.

					NEO
			What did she tell you?

					TRINITY
			Lots of things.

					NEO
			Any of them true?

	Trinity looks at him, then looks away.

					TRINITY
			Some of them.

					GIZMO
			Were they good or bad?

					TRINITY
			There's no point in worrylng.
			Whatever is going to happen is
			going to happen.

	They cross the old lobby.  Switch and Apoc stop at the
	doors.

					MORPHEUS
			We should be back in an hour.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright.
	He is the only one without sunglasses.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you now understand what it
			means when we say, if you're not
			one of us, you're one of them?

					NEO
			The agents.  They're sentient
			programs.  They can commandeer any
			software hardwired to the
			mainframe.

					MORPHEUS
			Anyone that is still in a power
			plant.  That is why we try to be
			invisible in the Matrix.

					NEO
			The best hacking is always
			traceless.

	Cypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the
	perimeter.  As Cypher passes a garbage can, he
	surreptitiously drops something inside.

	It is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as
	the LINE CONNECTS.

	An early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a
	corrugated roll-up garage.  Morpheus and Neo get in.


	INT.  LINCOLN CONTINENTAL (MATRIX) - DAY

	An enormous man is waiting for them.  A wad of chewing
	tobacco bulges his cheek.  He spits into a Coke can.

					MOJO
			Morpheus, been a long time coming.

					MORPHEUS
			You're looking well, Mojo.

	Mojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his
	chin and shirt.  He stares at Neo.

					MOJO
			You bringing us geriatrics now.
			Morpheus?

	He spits and laughs again.

					MOJO
			Guess you are locking for a
			miracle.


	EXT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of
	neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes.


	INT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	A lightless, lower-class bar.  No one enters that is not
	expected.

	The front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as
	Mojo leads Morpheus and Neo inside.  Neo looks around,
	his eyes adjusting to the darkness.

	Mojo talks to the bartender, then looks over.

					MOJO
			All right, it's cool.  Go on back.

	They weave their way to the back of the bar, the STICKY
	FLOOR SNAPPING under their FEET.

	A monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up.

					REX
			You're late.

	He moves to the side, opening the heavy iron door behind
	him.  They descend the basement staircase toward the
	single bare bulb at the bottom, hanging above the only
	door.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	A high-tech laptop and modem are set up on a stack of
	milk crates.  Neo waits as Morpheus types in a series of
	access codes.  After a moment the screen blinks, "Welcome
	Morpheus."

	Morpheus walks back to the same door they entered, but it
	now leads into --


	INT.  TEMPLE OF ZION (MATRIX) - DAY

	The walls and floors are polished marble.  Neo follows,
	his mouth agape.

					NEO
			What -- what happened?

					MORPHEUS
			This is the temple.  It is a part
			of Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden
			inside the Matrix so that we can
			access it.

	Two PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber.

					PRIESTESS
			Hello, Morpheus.  We've been
			expecting you.

					MORPHEUS
			Okay, you're on your own.  Go with
			them.

	They take Neo by the arm, leading him down a hall into
	another room.

					PRIESTESS
			Wait here.  Among the other
			Potentials.


	INT.  ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to
	his age.  The Potentials are all little children.

	The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a
	kindergarten class.  The children's heads are either
	shaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing,
	others meditating or practicing their gift.

	Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
	blocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a
	blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.

	Neo crosses to him, sits.

	The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to
	imitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make
	it bend.

					SPOON BOY
			Your spoon does not bend because
			it is just that, a spoon.  Mine 
			bends because there is no spoon,
			just my mind.

	Neo watches as it curls into a knot.

					SPOON BOY
			Link yourself to the spoon.
			Become the spoon and bend
			yourself.

	Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.

					NEO
			There is no spoon.  Right.

	He concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the
	Priestess touches his shoulder.

					PRIESTESS
			The Oracle will see you now.

	Spoon Boy smiles.


	INT.  SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo enters nervously.  Beneath his feet is a path of the
	zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and
	a three-legged throne.

	The throne is empty.

					NEO
			Hello?

	A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up
	the stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something
	cooking.

	Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he
	finds an open door.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Just come on in.

	He walks through a vestibule where he sees a fabulous
	moonstone headdress and velvet robes.  A second door
	leads into --


	INT.  ORACLE'S CHAMBERS (MATRIX) - DAY

	It looks like a suburban tract house.

	There is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch
	filled with china, shelves and tables crowded with
	doilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack.

	Neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen.

	A WOMAN is huddled beside the oven, peering inside
	through the cracked door.

					NEO
			Hello?

					ORACLE (WOMAN)
			I know.  You're Neo.  Be right
			with you.

					NEO
			You're the Oracle?

					ORACLE
			Bingo.  I got to say I love seeing
			you non-believers.  It's really a
			relief.  All that pomp and
			circumstances just plain tucker me
			out.  Almost done.  Smell good,
			don't they?

					NEO
			Yeah.

					ORACLE
			I'd ask you to sit down, but
			you're not going to anyway.  And
			don't worry about the vase.

					NEO
			What vase?

	He turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from
	the table.  It BREAKS against the linoleum floor.

					ORACLE
			The vase.

					NEO
			Shit, I'm sorry.

	She pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns.
	She is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts,
	comfortable slacks and a print blouse.  She looks like
	someone's grandma.

					ORACLE
			I said don't worry about it.  I'll
			get one of my kids to fix it.

					NEO
			How did you know...?

	She sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad.

					ORACLE
			What's really going to bake your
			noodle later on is, would you
			still have broken it if I hadn't
			said anything.

	Smiling, she lights a cigarette.

					ORACLE
			You're cuter than I thought.  I
			see why she likes you.

					NEO
			Who?

					ORACLE
			Not too bright, though.

	She winks.

					ORACLE
			You know why Morpheus brought you
			to see me?

					NEO
			I think so.

					ORACLE
			So? What do you think?  You think
			you're the one?

					NEO
			I don't know.

	She gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma
	has, except that the words are in Latin.

					ORACLE
			You know what that means?  It's
			Latin.  Means, 'Know thyself.'

	She puts her cigarette down.

					ORACLE
			Well, let's have a look at you.

	She widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the
	glands in his neck.

					ORACLE
			Open your mouth.  Say, 'ahhh.'

	She nods then looks at his palms.

					ORACLE
			Hmmm.  You sure got the gift, but
			it's tricky.  I'd say the bad news
			is, you're not the one.  Still got
			a lot to learn.  Maybe next life.

					NEO
			What's the good news?

					ORACLE
			Same as the bad news, you're not
			the one.

					NEO
			Is that it, then?

					ORACLE
			No.  Here.

	She picks up the tray of cooling cookies.

					ORACLE
			You better take a cookie.  Got a
			big day ahead of you.

	He eyes her, then takes a cookie.

					ORACLE
			Make a believer out of you yet.


	INT.  ANTECHAMBER (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus rises from a bench as the Priestess escorts Neo
	out.  When they are alone, Morpheus puts his hand on
	Neo's shoulder.

					MORPHEUS
			You don't have to tell me
			anything, Neo, because I already
			know what she said.

					NEO
			You do?

					MORPHEUS
			I brought you so that you could
			hear it for yourself.  I knew it
			would help.

	Neo finishes his cookie.

					MORPHEUS
			No one will ever ask you because
			it is a gift from her.  It is for
			you and you alone.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Storm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns
	jaundice.

	Cypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets.
	He notices several unmarked white vans.

	He mops the sweat from his forehead, when Trinity sees
	the black Lincoln.

					TRINITY
			Here they come.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	In the hovercraft, we see the sweat rolling down Cypher's
	face and neck.

	Tank is typing rapidly at the keyboard.

					TANK
			Weird.  This area never has this
			much activity.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Apoc opens the side door and they enter the hotel.


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Mouse's CELLULAR RINGS.

					MOUSE
			Welcome to Movie-Phone.

					TANK (V.O.)
			They're on their way.

					MOUSE
			Right.

	The phone flips shut as he jumps up.

					MOUSE
			Let's get to work.


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Light filters down the throat of the building through a
	caged skylight at the top of the open elevator shaft.
	Four figures glide up the dark stairs that wind around
	the antique elevator.

	Neo notices a black cat, a yellow-green-eyed shadow that
	slinks past them and pads quickly down the stairs.

	A moment later, Neo sees another black cat that looks and
	moves identically to the first one.

					NEO
			Whoa.  Deja vu.

	Those words stop the others dead in their tracks.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The monitors suddenly glitch as though the Matrix had an
	electronic seizure.

					TANK
			Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity turns around, her face tight.

					TRINITY
			What did you just say?

					NEO
			Nothing.  Just had a little deja
			vu.

					TRINITY
			What happened?  What did you see?

					NEO
			A black cat went past us and then
			I saw another that looked just
			like it.

					TRINITY
			How much like it?  Was it the same
			cat?

					NEO
			It might have been.  I'm not sure.

	Trinity looks at Morpheus, who listens quietly to the
	rasping breath of the old building.

					NEO
			What is it?

					TRINITY
			A deja vu is usually a glitch in
			the Matrix.  It happens when they
			change something.

	She also listens as the staccato BEAT of HELICOPTER
	BLADES GROW ominously LOUDER.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank sees what was changed.

					TANK
			It's a trap!


	INT.  STAIRCASE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus looks up the stairs as a helicopter shadow
	passes over the clouded glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Come on!


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cable goes to the draped windows.

					CABLE
			Did you just feel something weird?

					MOUSE
			Yeah...

	The CELLULAR RINGS.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Heavy bolt-cutters snap through the main phone cable.


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Mouse answers the phone.

					MOUSE
			What's going on?

					TANK (V.O.)
			They cut the hard-line!  It's a
			trap!  Get out!

	Cable yanks open the curtain.

					CABLE
			Oh, no.

	The windows are bricked up.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	The door to the roof explodes open as heavily-armed rnen
	rush towards room 1313.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank watches helplessly.

					TANK
			No, no, no.


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The door slams open and the police force pours in, dozens
	of assault rifles surrounding Mouse and Cable who are
	armed with only handguns.

					CABLE
			Morpheus!  It's a trap --


	INT.  STAIRS (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus stops as the scream is drowned by the REPORT of
	MACHINE GUNS filling the building with a terrible fury.

					TRINITY
			Oh, God.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Mouse's body thrashes against its harness as --


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	BULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick
	window.  Gun smoke thickens the room, Cable blasting and
	moving until --

	The HAMMER CLICKS empty.  He screams as a DOZEN GUNS OPEN
	FIRE, ripping him apart.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Blood spits from Cable's mouth, his body spasming, then
	lying perfectly still.

	The flat-line ALARM softly cries out from the life
	MONITORS of the two dead men.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	More police cars arrive as cops break open the lobby
	doors.


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Flying downstairs, Morpheus stops, hearing the police
	swarming below.  He turns and rushes down the hall of the
	eighth floor.  At the end of it, he finds the bricked-up
	windows.

					CYPHER
			That's what they changed.  We're
			trapped.  There's no way out.

	The sound of heavy BOOT-STEPS close around them with the
	mechanical sureness of a vice.

					MORPHEUS
			Give me your phone.

					TRINITY
			They'll be able to track it.

					MORPHEUS
			We have no choice.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank answers the call.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Tank, find a structural drawing of
			this building and find it fast.

	His fingers pound the keyboard.


	INT.  LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Flashlights probe the rotting darkness as the police
	search every floor.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The diagram windows onto the screen.

					TANK
			Got it.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I need the main wet-wall.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith pauses, his hand going to his earpiece.


	INT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus is guided by Tank.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Now left and that's it in front of
			you.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.

	He cuts off the phone.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith hears the LINE CLICK dead.

					AGENT SMITH
			Eighth floor.  They're on the
			eighth floor.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Brown hears Smith on his earphone.

					AGENT BROWTJ
			Eighth floor!  Move!


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cops flood the eighth floor, rushing everywhere.


	INT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Several cops sweep through the room.  It is empty.  As
	they pass the bathroom, we see a man-sized hole smashed
	through the plaster and lathe.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They are inside the main plumbing wall, slowly worming
	their way down the greasy, black stack pipes.

	Above them, light fills the hole they made to get inside.

	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Brown turns to Smith.

					AGENT BROWN
			Where are they?


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The cops search in silence, straining for a clue, when
	one hears SOMETHING STRANGE near the bathroom.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher has slipped and is wedged between the wall and
	several thick supply pipes.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Cop leans in, his ear almost against the thin
	membrane of plaster separating them.  He can hear
	WHISPERS, HISSES and a GRUNT when --

	The WALL suddenly bulges, SHATTER-CRACKING as the Cop
	realizes --

					COP
			They're in the walls!


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo pulls Cypher free just as the Cop OPENS FIRE --

	BULLETS PUNCHING shafts of light like swords into the box
	of soot-black space.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Cop keeps FIRING, his flashlight strapped to his gun
	barrel, lighting up the wall until --

	A BULLET spits out his forehead.  Agent Smith watches the
	BODY fall with a THUD.

					AGENT SMITH
			Are orders that hard to follow?
			I'll say it again.  Morpheus must
			be taken alive.  Understand?


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They're almost falling, they're climbing so fast.

	Above them, plaster is smashed open as crunbling bits
	shower down on them, filling the crawlway with dust.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith looks into the open wall, at the exposed
	intestines of the building, and realizes where they are
	going.

					AGENT SMITH
			How like a rodent.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Just below, a RIFLE-BUTT SMASHES open the WALL, light
	raking across the lathe.

					COP
			I got him!  I got him!

	Trinity finds her gun first.  BULLET-HOLES POP out the
	WALL as she STRAFES the room, sending cops diving for
	cover.

	They continue, Trinity exposed for a roment, when a
	creeping cop smashes a fist through and grabs a fistful
	of her hair.

	He starts to yank her out when Neo kicks, his boot
	bursting through plaster and splintering lathe, knocking
	the Cop out.

	They then quickly sink out of sight.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	This part of the basement, a dark concrete cavern, was
	the main mechanical room.  There are four enormous
	boilers, dinosaur-like technology that once pumped hot
	water like arteries.

	Black and bloody, they squeeze out from the ceiling into
	the tangled web of pipes.

	Their enemies are waiting for them.

	Blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas-masked
	figures FIRE GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

	Smoke blossoms from the green-metal canisters.

	Morpheus never stops moving.  Searching the floor, he
	finds what.he needs; the cover of the catch basin.

	Cypher watches him pry open the grate, when a gas can
	bounces near him.

					MORPHEUS
			Come on!

	Cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Cypher's body begins to shiver uncontrollably.

					TANK
			Nerve gas.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus watches Cypher disappear into the smoke then
	follows the others down the wet-black hole.


	INT.  CATCH BASIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	They crawl through greasy black water in a three foot
	diameter pipe that feeds into the sewer main.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Gas-masked apparitions find the open hole.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still
	shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose.  As he is led past
	Agent Smith, it almost seems that both men smile.

					AGENT SMITH
			We have them now.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo punches out the screen and then spills down into the
	main water trough.

	Oily water forms around them as they wade across the man-
	made underground river, towards the service catwalk.

	Neo is about to pull himself out when he sees them coming.

	Flashlights and laser sites sweep at them as cops in
	helmets and heavy armor, looking more nachine than human,
	fill both ends of the tunnel.

	There is a single manhole cover above them.

	Morpheus whispers to Trinity.

					MORPHEUS
			You have to get Neo out.
			Understand?  That's all that
			matters now.

					TRINITY
			Morpheus, don't --

					MORPHEUS
			He must get out.  Do you
			understand me?

	She nods.

	A font of water erupts as Morpheus leaps for the manhole
	ladder, his coat flying open like the wings of a manta
	ray.

					COPS
			There he is!  That's him!

	Pools of light wash over him as he hauls himself to the
	surface.

					COP
			He's heading for the street!

	Trinity urges the others to follow her.  Grabbing Neo,
	they wade quietly away from the chaos.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus shoots out of the sewer but the police are
	waiting for him.  The closest cop is armed with a
	tranquilized gun.  He fires --

	But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a
	shield, blocking the darts, then --

	Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him
	off his feet.

	The cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a
	deadly weapon moving with impossible speed.

	It seems he might fight his way out when he throws a
	spinning back fist that is caught by --

	Agent Smith.

					AGENT SMITH
			So, we meet at last.

					MORPHEUS
			And you are?

					AGENT SMITH
			Smith.  I am Agent Smith.

					MORPHEUS
			You all look the same to me.

					AGENT SMITH
			I've been waiting for this noment.

	Faster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a
	jaw-breaking right.

				MORPHEUS
			Oh, so have I.

	Agent Smith smiles.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity leads the others, fading into the darkness of the
	tunnel, lit only with shafts of lights streaming through
	the street drains as we RISE TOWARDS them --

	THROUGH a grate INTO the fight.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Smith and Morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows
	that is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding
	police.

	Agent Smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers
	Morpheus.

					AGENT SMITH
			You can't win.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			I already have.

	He stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his
	eyes.

					AGENT SMITH
			Take him.

	Cops swarm over Morpheus.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for
	Morpheus.

					TANK
			No!


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cuff ed and beaten, Morpheus is thrown into a caged
	transport vehicle.  The DOOR CLANGS shut.

	Agent Jones finds Agent Smith.

					AGENT JONES
			The others were lost.

					AGENT SMITH
			You've taken care of Reagan?

	Agent Jones nods.

					AGENT SMITH
			Then the others do not matter.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	A manhole cover cracks open.  Two eyes peek out just as a
	TRUCK RATTLES over it.  The THUNDER DOPPLERS AWAY and the
	cover opens.

	Neo, Trinity, Switch and Apoc climb out.  Trinity pulls a
	water-logged phone from her pocket.

					TRINITY
			We need a phone.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank is again at the monitors, searching the Matrix.

					TANK
			We gotta find the others.  They're
			still alive.

	The PHONE RINGS.

					TANK
			Operator.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			I need an exit!  Fast!

					TANK
			Cypher?  I thought they had you?


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher is standing at a public phone.  Across the street
	is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided
	witli an oncoming car.

					CYPHER
			There was an accident.  A fucking
			car accident.  All of a sudden.
			Boom.  They're all dead.  I still
			got the shakes but, Jesus,
			someone's going to make a believer
			out of me.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Dozer spots the wreck.

					DOZER
			There he is.

					TANK
			I got you.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Just get me outta here.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

					TANK (V.O.)
			Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie.
			An old appliance store.

	Cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive.

					CYPHER
			An actor.  Definitely.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The PHONE RINGS.  Tank answers.

					TANK
			Operator.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Tank, it's me.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	They are outside a pawn shop.  Trinity has a new cellular.

					TRINITY
			We need an exit!

					TANK (V.O.)
			Gotcha.  You're not far from
			Cypher.

					TRINITY
			Cypher, I thought --

					TANK (V.O.)
			So did we.  That boy's got nine
			lives.  I sent him to Franklin and
			Erie.

					TRINITY
			Got it.

	She hangs up.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Running, Cypher turns onto Erie.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on
	metal shelves like bodies in a morgue.

	Plywood covering a small window is ripped off and Cypher
	crawls inside.

	Deep in the back room, a PHONE that has not rung in years
	begins to RING.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank punches the emit command.

					TANK
			Got him.

	Cypher's body twitches in its harness, jerking itself
	awake.  His eyes blink open.  Dozer unplugs him.

					DOZER
			System check looks fine.

	Cypher stands, a raspy cough spewing from his lungs.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity sees the appliance shop.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Cypher holds his chest.

					DOZER
			You okay?

					CYPHER
			Goddamn gas.  My lungs are killing
			me.

	He crosses to an overhead bin.

					CYPHER
			We got any pain killers?

					DOZER
			The first aid kit's over here.

	As Dozer stoops for a cabinet, Cypher pulls back a heavy
	blanket exposing a plasma rifle.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo crawls through the window that Cypher opened.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank finishes loading the exit programs as Cypher rises
	behind him, swinging the weapon at his back.

	He looks over as Dozer turns with the first aid kit, a
	look of frozen disbelief crossing his face --

					DOZER
			No!

	Tank spins as red hot wads of PLASMA EXPLODE through his
	chair and into his back.  Diving, a second BURST tears up
	his side --

	As Dozer shoots a look at the monitor where Tank was
	working.  He stabs the enter command activating the exit
	sequence and ducks under a BARRAGE of PLASMA FIRE-


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The PHONE begins to RING as the others crawl in.

					SWITCH
			God, I love that sound.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Dozer rolls up, grabbing a heavy crowbar from a box of
	tools.

	Cypher circles the drive chairs as the sights of the
	plasma rifle find Dozer's face.

	Dozer charges, screaming, and the PLASMA RIFLE SCREAMS
	back.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The PHONE is still RINGING.

					TRINITY
			You first,.Neo.

	Neo answers the phone when there is a CLICK.  There is no
	signal.  Nothing but silence.

					TRINITY
			What happened?

					NEO
			I don't know.  It just went dead.

	Trinity listens to the dead line and takes out the
	cellular.


	INT. MAIN DECK

	The operator PHONE begins to RING- Cypher steps over the
	body of Tank and looks at the monitor.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity can almost feel him watching them.  Every
	unanswered RING wrings her gut a little tighter, until --

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Hello, Trinity.

					TRINITY
			Cypher?  Where's Tank?

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			He had an accident.

					TRINITY
			An accident?  What about Dozer?
			Is Dozer there?


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	He walks over to Trinity's body, staring down at it
	hanging in its coma-like stillness.

					CYPHER
			You know, for a long time, I
			thought I was in love with you,
			Trinity.  I used to dream about
			you...

	He nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of
	it.

					CYPHER
			You are a beautiful woman.  Too
			bad things had to work out like
			this.

	We INTERCUT BETWEEN the appliance store and the main
	deck.

					TRINITY
			You killed them.

					APOC
			What?!

					SWITCH
			Oh God.

	Wearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the
	silent bodies.

					CYPHER
			In a way you're very lucky.  Most
			people never know why they die.
			One minute they're alive, the next
			they're dead.  No warning.
			Nothing.  That's why I thought
			maybe I should tell you.  It
			seemed the least I could do.

	He stands over the body of Morpheus, as his anger boils
	up out of him.

					CYPHER
			You see, the truth, the real,truth
			is that the war is over.  It's
			been over for a long time.  And
			guess what?  We lost!  Did you
			hear that?  We lost the war!

					TRINITY
			What about Zion?

					CYPHER
			Zion?  Zion is a part of this
			delusion.  More of this madness.
			That's why this has to be done.
			It has to end.  Now and forever.

	She suddenly sees the entire dark plan.

					TRINITY
			Oh rny God.  This is abzut Zion.
			You gave them Morpheus for the
			access codes to Zion.

	Cypher walks away from Morpheus and bends down next to
	Apoc's body.

					CYPHER
			You see, Trinity, we humans have a
			place in the future.  But it's not
			here.  It's in the Matrix.

					TRINITY
			The Matrix isn't real!

					CYPHER
			Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I
			disagree.  I think the Matrix is
			more real than this world.  I
			mean, all I do is pull a plug
			here.  But there, you watch a man
			die.

	He grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and
	yanks it out.

					CYPHER
			You tell me which is more real.

	Apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in
	his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then
	falls dead.  Switch screams.

					CYPHER
			Welcome to the real world, right?

	He laughs.

					TRINITY
			Somehow, some way, you're going to
			pay for this.

					CYPHER
			Pay for it?  I'm not even going to
			remember it.  It'll be like it
			never happened.  The tree falling
			in the forest.  It doesn't make a
			sound.

	His hand slides around the neck of Switch as he takes
	hold of her plug.

	She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she
	is murdered.

					TRINITY
			Goddamn you, Cypher!

					CYPHER
			Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just
			the messenger.  And right now I'm
			going to prove that the message is
			true.

	He stands over Neo.

					CYPHER
			If Morpheus was right, then
			there's no way I can pull this
			plug, is there?

	She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is
	next.

					CYPHER
			If he is the One, then in the next
			few seconds there has to be some
			kind of miracle to stop me.
			Because if he dies like the others
			that means Morpheus was wrong.
			How can he be the One if he's
			dead?

	He takes hold of the cord when --

	She hears an EXPLOSION and a scream.

	Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the
	knee.  He rolls over and finds Tank on the ground, and
	the sights of the plasma rifle.

					TANK
			How's it feel, Cypher?  Knowing
			you're about to die?

					NEO
			It's Tank!  He's alive.

	Cypher lunges for Neo's plug just as Tank BLOWS his head
	off.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	They're both listening, trying to figure out what is
	happening when the store PHONE starts to RING.

	Trinity smiles, tears moistening her eyes as Neo throws
	his arms around her.  For a moment, it looks as if they
	might kiss before Trinity lets go.

					TRINITY
			We should, we should hurry.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Right.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Trinity's eyes open, a sense of relief surging through
	her at the sight of the ship.  As Tank unplugs her, she
	sees his charred wounds.

					TRINITY
			Tank, you're hurt.

					TANK
			I'll be all right.

					TRINITY
			Dozer?

	Tank's face tightens.

					TRINITY
			I'm sorry, Tank.


	EXT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	A Japanese luxury hotel in downtown Chicago.

	A military helicopter sets down on the roof.  Heavily
	armed Marines begin to deploy.

	Agent Jones gets out of the helicopter, flanked by
	columns of Marines.  They open the roof access door
	and enter the top-floor maintenance level of the hotel.


	INT.  TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY

	They get in the elevator.  At every door, at least two
	Marines stop and post guard.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They exit the elevator and walk to the Presidential
	suite; the final two Marines post guard.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Inside, he finds Agent Smith.

					AGENT JONES
			There is a problem.  Reagan has
			failed to secure the hardware.

	Agent Smith stares out the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			Never send a human to do a
			machine's job.

					AGENT JONES
			But if Reagan has failed, why
			haven't they pulled the plug?

					AGENT SMITH
			Haven't you learned by now, that
			it is impossible to understand why
			they do the things they do?

	He turns.

					AGENT SMITH
			Continue as planned.  Trace his
			signal to locate their position
			and deploy an extermination unit.

	Morpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist.
	He is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of
	serum, alternately shivering and sweating.  He is hooked
	up to various monitors with white disk electrodes.

	Agent Brown begins running a trace program.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Neo looks at Morpheus whose body is covered with a cold
	sweat.

					NEO
			What are they doing to him?

					TANK
			They're cracking his mind.

					NEO
			How?

					TANK
			They inject virus-like serums to
			break down the system.  It's like
			cracking a computer.  All it takes
			is time.

					NEO
			How much time?

					TANK
			Depends on the mind.  But
			eventually, it will crack and his
			alpha pattern will change from
			this to this.

	Tank punches several commands on Morpheus' personal unit.
	The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an
	orderly symmetrical one.

					TANK
			When it does, Morpheus will tell
			them anything they want to know.

					NEO
			The access codes to Zion.

					TANK
			If an agent got inside Zion's
			mainframe he could do anything.
			Disable the defense system. It
			would be the end of us.

	He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly.

					TANK
			We can't let that happen.  We have
			to do it, Trinity.  Zion has to be
			protected.

	Trinity sees Cypher's dead body.  Rage overtakes her and
	she starts kicking hin.

					TRINITY
			Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!

					TANK
			We have to pull the plug.

					TRINITY
			No!

					TANK
			We don't have any other choice.

	Those words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and
	we watch the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze.  She
	walks past him and gets into her chair.

					TANK
			Trinity, what are you doing?

					TRINITY
			I'm going in after him.

					TANK
			Morpheus could conform at any
			minute --

					TRINITY
			If he does I'm sure you'll do what
			has to be done.

					TANK
			You saw that place.  It's suicide.

	She glares at him.

					TANK
			I know what Morpheus means to
			you --

					TRINITY
			No.  No, I don't think you do.  If
			you did, then you would know that
			I'm not letting him go.  Not
			without a fight, Tank.

	She yanks her harness tight.

					TRINITY
			Not without a fight.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith stands in the bedroon of the enormous suite,
	staring out the windows at the city, below, shimmering
	with brilliant sunlight.

					AGENT SMITH
			Have you ever stood and stared at
			it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its
			beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of
			people just living out their 
			lives... oblivious.

	Agent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a
	hypodermic needle.

					AGENT SMITH
			Did you know that the first Matrix
			was designed to be a perfect human
			world?  Where none suffered, where
			everyone would be happy.  It was a
			disaster.  No one would accept the
			program.  Entire crops were lost.

	Agent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and
	plunges down.

					AGENT SMITH
			Some believed we lacked the
			programming language to describe
			your perfect world.  But I believe
			that, as a species, human beings
			define their reality through
			suffering and misery.

	Agent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react
	violently to the injection.

					AGENT SMITH
			The perfect world was a dream that
			your primitive cerebrum kept
			trying to wake up from.  Which is
			why the Matrix was re-designed to
			this:  the peak of your
			civilization.

	He turns from the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			I say 'your civilization' because
			as soon as we start thinking for
			you, it really becomes our
			civilization, which is, of course,
			what this is all about.

	He sits down directly in front of Morpheus.

					AGENT SMITH
			Evolution, Morpheus.  Evolution.

	He lifts Morpheus' head.

					AGENT SMITH
			Like the dinosaur.  Look out that
			window.  You had your time.

	Morpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the
	pain racking his mind.

					AGENT SMITH
			The future is our world, Morpheus.
			The future is our time.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Neo goes to his chair and begins strapping in.

					TRINITY
			What do you think you're doing?

					NEO
			You need help.  I'm coming with
			you.

					TRINITY
			No.  No way.  Morpheus sacrificed
			himself so you could escape.
			There's no way you're going back
			in.

					NEO
			Morpheus did what he did because
			he believed that I'm something
			that I'm not.

					TRINITY
			What?

					NEO
			I'm not the One, Trinity.  The
			Oracle told me.

	Trinity is stunned.

					NEO
			She said I had a gift but I still
			had a lot to learn.  She told me
			maybe next life.

					TRINITY
			Did you tell Morpheus?

					NEO
			Why?  It wouldn't mean anything.
			He'd still believe what he wanted
			to believe.  But Morpheus is the
			one that matters.  He's more
			important than me and we both know
			it.

	He straps in.

					NEO
			I may not be what Morpheus thinks
			I am, but if I don't try to help
			him, then I'm not even what I
			think I am.

					TRINITY
			What are you?

					NEO
			His friend.

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith sits casually across from Morpheus who is
	hunched over, his body leaking and twitching.

					AGENT SMITH
			I'd like to share a revelation
			that I've had during my time here.
			It came to me when I tried to
			classify your species.  I've
			realized that you are not actually
			mammals.

	The life signs continue their chaotic patterns.

					AGENT SMITH
			Every mammal on this planet
			instinctively develops a natural
			equilibrium with the surrounding
			environment.  But you humans do
			not.  You move to an area and you
			multiply and multiply until every
			natural resource is consumed and
			the only way you can survive is to
			spread to another area.

	He leans forward.

					AGENT SMITH
			There is another organism on this
			planet that follows the same
			pattern.  Do you know what it is?
			A virus.

	He smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			Human beings are a disease, a
			cancer of this planet.  You are a
			plague.  And we are... the cure.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Trinity and Neo hang motionless in the suspension unit.
	Tank is at the operations station.

					TANK
			Okay.  Store's open.  What do you
			need?

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Guns.  Lots of guns.

					TANK
			Coming right up.

	He loads the weapons disk.


	INT.  CONSTRUCT

	Racks of weapons appear and Neo and Trinity arm
	themselves.

					TRINITY
			No one has ever done anything like
			this.

					NEO
			Yeah?

	He snap cocks an Uzi.

					NEO
			That's why it's going to work.

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith is again at the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			Why isn't the serum working?

					AGENT BROWN
			Perhaps we are asking the wrong
			questions.

					AGENT JONES
			Or he doesn't know.

					AGENT SMITH
			Of course he knows.  He's
			resisting.

					AGENT BROWN
			How?

					AGENT SMITH
			I don't know.  If I knew...

	Agent Smith hides his knotting fist.  He is becoming
	angry.  It is something that isn't supposed to happen to
	agents.

					AGENT SMITH
			Leave me with him.

	Agent Brown and Jones look at each other.

					AGENT SMITH
			Now!

	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank sits down beside Morpheus whose face is ashen like
	someone near death.  He takes hold of his hand.

					TANK
			Hold on, Morpheus.  They're coming
			for you.  They're coming.


	EXT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	A dark wind blows.


	INT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	In long, black coats, Trinity and Neo push through the
	revolving doors.

	Neo is carrying a duffel bag.  Trinity has a large metal
	suitcase.  They cut across the lobby drawing nervous
	glances.

	Dark glasses, game faces.

	Several plainclothes cops try to stop them.  They are met
	by the MUTED SPIT of a SILENCED GUN and the RAZORED
	WHISTLE of THROWING STARS.

	The cops slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and
	Trinity do not even break stride.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith leans close to Morpheus, whispering to him.

					AGENT SMITH
			Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm
			going to be honest with you.

	He removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his
	shoulder.

					AGENT SMITH
			I hate this place.  This zoo.
			This prison.  This reality,
			whatever you want to call it, I
			can't stand it any longer.  It's
			the smell, if there is such a
			thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I
			can taste your stink and every
			time I do, I fear that I've
			somehow been infected by it.

	He wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips
	of his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.

					AGENT SMITH
			Repulsive, isn't it?

	He lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both
	hands.

					AGENT SMITH
			I must get out of here, I must get
			free.  In this mind is tlie key.
			My key.

	Morpheus sneers through his pain.

					AGENT SMITH
			Once Zion is gone, there's no
			need for me to be here.  Do you
			understand?  I need the codes.  I
			have to get inside Zion.  You have
			to tell me how.

	He begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.

					AGENT SMITH
			Tell me!  Tell me!

	The skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown
	burst into the room.  Agent Smith releases Morpheus.

					AGENT BROWN
			What were you doing?

	Agent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece.

					AGENT JONES
			You don't know.

					AGENT SMITH
			Know what?

	Agent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what
	he is hearing.


	INT.  ELEVATORS (MATRIX) - DAY

	They get in.  Trinity immediately drops and opens the
	suitcase, wiring a plastique and napalm bomb.

	Beneath their trench coats is an arsenal of weapons slung
	from climbing harnesses.

	Neo hits the emergency stop.  He pulls down part of the
	false ceiling and finds the elevator shaft access panel.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Jones looks at Morpheus.

					AGENT JONES
			I think they're trying to save
			him.


	INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable.  Both
	of them lock on.  He looks up the long, dark throat of
	the building and takes a deep breath.

					NEO
			There is no spoon.

	Neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower
	than where they attached themselves.

	BOOM!  The CABLE SNAPS.

	The counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up
	through the shaft as --

	The elevator falls away beneath them, distending space,
	filling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they soar
	to the top.


	INT.  LOBBY (MATRIX) - DAY

	The ELEVATOR hits the botton.

	BA-BOOM!

	The massive EXPLOSION blows open the doors, fire clouds
	engulfing the elevator section of the lobby.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Agents hear the BLAST AND FIRE ALARMS.

					AGENT JONES
			Lower level --

					AGENT BROWN
			They are actually attacking.


	INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Hanging by a rope, Trinity hot-wires the panel for the
	door.


	INT.  TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Nervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR "DINGS" softly
	and slides open.

	Black smoke rises out of the exposed shaft.

	The nearest Marine eases to the edge, peering down at the
	churning blaze engulfing the lower levels.

	He does not see Trinity and Neo above him until it is too
	late.

	Krack!  Neo kicks, knocking the Marine flying down into
	the shaft.

	Before the others can react, Trinity flips out into the
	hall, decking the nearest Marine.  Neo cracks another.

	The fight is over before it begins.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	An enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the
	building.  The ALARM SOUNDS, emergency sprinklers begin
	showering the room.

	Agent Smith smashes a table.

					AGENT SMITH
			Find them and destroy them!

	Agent Jones nods and touches his ear piece.


	EXT.  ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY

	The roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo
	and Trinity lay waste to a dozen more Marines.

	Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used
	with the same deadly precision as their feet and their
	fists.

	Across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter
	watches the ferocious onslaught.

					PILOT
			I repeat, we are under attack!

	Suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by
	spreading locust-like swarm, of STATIC as --

	Agent Jones emerges.

	Just as she drops the last Marine, Trinity sees what's
	coming.

	Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is
	behind him.

	Screaming, he whirls, GUNS filling his hands with
	thought-speed.

	Fingers PUMPING, SHELLS ejecting, dancing up and away, we
	look through the sights and gun smoke at --

	The Agent blurred with motion --

	Until the HAMMERS CLICK against empty metal.

					NEO
			Trinity!

	Agent Jones charges.

					NEO
			... help.

	His GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of --

	Bullet-time.

	The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead-like angry flies as Neo
	twists, bends, ducks just between them.

	Agent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS
	coming faster until --

	Neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a
	spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.

	He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across
	his thigh.

	He has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent
	Jones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final
	time.

	CLICK.  Empty.

	Neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house
	kick snaps his jaw.  Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels
	it at Neo.

					AGENT JONES
			Only human...

	Suddenly Agent Jones stops.  Something is wrong.  He
	scans the roof.  Trinity is gone.

	Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the
	muzzle of her .45 --

	Jammed right into his head.

					TRINITY
			Dodge this, motherfucker!

	BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The body flies back with a flash of
	mercurial light and when it hits the ground --

	It is the pilot.

	Trinity helps Neo up.

					NEO
			Thanks.

					TRINITY
			You're hit --

					NEO
			I'm fine.

	Neo is already looking at the helicopter.

					NEO
			Can you fly that thing?

					TRINITY
			Not yet.

	She pulls out a cellular phone.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank is back at the controls.

					TANK
			Operator.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Tank, I need a pilot program for a
			military M-109 helicopter.

	Tank is immediately searching the disk drawers.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Hurry!

	His fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks, finding
	one that he feeds into Trinityls supplement drive,
	punching the "load" cormands on her keyboard.


	EXT.  ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity's eyes flutter as information surges into her
	brain, all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed
	at light-speed.

					TRINITY
			Let's go.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Marines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof,
	are beginning to panic when Agent Jones comes around the
	corner.

					SERGEANT
			Sir!  Sir!  There was gunfire --
			we've lost communication with the
			roof!

					AGENT JONES
			Remain at your posts.

					SERGEANT
			But, sir -- the fire -- we should
			evacuate!

					AGENT JONES
			You will do as you are ordered!

					SERGEANT
			Yes, sir.

	Agent Jones marches into the Presidential Suite.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Jones throws open the bedroom door and enters,
	walking through the puddles pooling in the carpet.

	Over the RUSHING WATER and the ALARMS, Agent Smith hears
	a SOUND and understands the seriousness of the attack.

	He turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops
	INTO VIEW --

	Neo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted .50 machine
	gun.

					AGENT SMITH
			No.

	The GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a
	cacophony of CRASHING GLASS --

	As the Agents go for their weapons.

	But Neo is too close, the .50 CALIBER too fast and
	BULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room.

	Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back,
	blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --

	Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.

	And finally Agent Jones.

	Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.

					NEO
			Get up, Morpheus!  Get up!

	Morpheus sits unmoving, his head still down.

	Neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into
	the adjoining room.

	He attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN
	FIRE.

	Quickly he swings the GUN, SPRAYING the other room,
	WINDOWS SHATTERING, FURNITURE EXPLODING, marines diving
	for cover.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Just outside the Presidential Suite, three marines
	blister with snow-static.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.  His eyes,
	still white, begin to blink, twitch, then close.

	And when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing
	with fire.

	The Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's
	BULLET TRAILS chase them.

	Morpheus strains at his handcuffs.

	The Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD,
	RICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER.

	FIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping
	the handcuffs, starting for the window.

	Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open
	bedroom door.

					AGENT SMITH
			Nooo!

	He FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a
	perfect line.

	For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the
	WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of
	chalk.

	And as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet
	buries itself in his leg --

	Knocking him off balance.

					NEO
			He won't make it.

	Morpheus lunges, out of control --

	As Neo spins, every move a whip crack --

	Snapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar.

	Morpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the
	wide blue empty space --

	Flying for a moment.

	The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord
	attached to a machine.

	As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other
	on a seemingly magnetic course until --

	They collide.

	Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs,
	scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation,
	finding hold and clinging.

	Until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their
	fragile embrace.  Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over,
	falling down --

	The ground deliriously distant --

	As Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed
	wrist.

					NEO
			Gotcha!

	Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away.

	As Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine.

	He'll bring them all down.  Targeting the helicopter, he
	aims at something only he can see: the oil line.

	PONK.  PONK.  PONK.  The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of
	holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood.

					TRINITY
			Shit-shit-no!

	Neo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the
	HELICOPTER BEGIN TO DIE.

					NEO
			Oh fuck.

	Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the
	nearest building.

	Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the
	machine above them begin to fall.

	The ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow
	while --

	The Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching
	the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings.

	Carried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic
	fall over the nearest roof where --

	Neo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope
	goes slack.  Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach
	himself but --

	The helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof
	like a setting sun --

	The coils of slack snap taught --

	Yanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious
	speed towards the edge even as --

	Trinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand,
	grabbing for the rope with the other --

	Neo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling straight AT us,
	when his feet hit the rain gutter --

	A fulcrum that levers him up just as --

	Trinity FIRES, severing the cord from the HELICOPTER,
	falling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a 
	glass skyscraper.

	Holding onto the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who
	stands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath
	him as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --

	She bounces against a shatterproof window that spider-
	cracks out while FLAMES ERUPT behind her.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank stares at the screen, his mouth agape.

					TANK
			He's the One.  He's got to be...


	EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo pulls Trinity up into his arms.  Both shaking, they
	hold each other again.

					MORPHEUS
			I knew it!  I goddamn knew it!

					TRINITY
			Morpheus!

	She runs at him, throwing her arms around him.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you believe me now?  He's the
			One!  Who else could have done
			this?

					NEO
			Morpheus, I know you won't believe
			me but the Oracle told ne I'm not
			the One.

					MORPHEUS
			It doesn't matter if I don't
			believe you --

	His eyes light up.

					MORPHEUS
			What matters is that you don't
			believe her.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The PHONE RINGS.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Tank, get us out of here.

					TANK
			Got one ready.  An underground El
			station.  State and Balbo.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			See ya soon.

	LINE GOES DEAD.  Tank looks at the bodies and smiles.

					TANK
			See ya soon.


	EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

	The rope is all that remains.  Agent Smith can barely
	control his anger.

					AGENT BROWN
			The trace was completed.

					AGENT JONES
			We have their position.

					AGENT BROWN
			The extermination unit is in
			place.

					AGENT JONES
			Order the strike.

	Agent Smith can't stand listening to them.  He moves to
	the edge of the building, looking out at the surrounding
	city.

					AGENT SMITH
			They're not out yet.


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	A metal gate is locked, the sign reading, "Station
	Closed."  Neo looks around, takes out a GUN and BLOWS OFF
	the LOCK.

	In the moist underground distance they hear the MUTED
	RING of a TELEPHONE.

	The PHONE is RINGING inside a graffiti-covered booth.

	Across from it, sitting hunched against the red concrete
	wall, is an OLD MAN.  He stares at the RINGING PHONE,
	taking a final pull off his T-bird.  No one is around.
	It continues to RING.

	Determined, he stands and walks to the booth.  He is
	about to answer the phone, when Neo sees him.

					NEO
			Don't!

	The Old Man stops, Neo rushes at hin, gliding smoothly
	over the turnstiles.

					OLD MAN
			I'm sorry -- I didn't mean!

	The Old Man is shaking, terrified.  Neo looks at his gun.
	He glances over his shoulder, then eases back the hammer.

					NEO
			Get outta here.  Okay?  Run!  Go!

	The Old Man nods, turns and hurries deeper into the urban
	cave, disappearing into the shadows as Trinity and
	Morpheus arrive.

					TRINITY
			What happened?  Was that --

					NEO
			It was nobody.

	Neo turns to the RINGING BOOTH.

					NEO
			Let's go!  You first, Morpheus.

	Morpheus gets in and answers the phone.

	Lost in the shadow, the Old Man turns back and watches as
	Morpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its
	cord.

	His eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.


	EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith stares, his face twisted with hate.  He will
	never be free of the Matrix.

	He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he
	suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around,
	staring --


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	As the Old Man stares.

	Trinity hangs up the phone.  She turns to Neo, standing
	close enough to kiss him.

					TRINITY
			Morpheus is right, you know.  It
			doesn't matter what he believes or
			even what the Oracle believes.
			What matters is what you believe.

					NEO
			I believe...

	He stares at the fullness of her lips.

					NEO
			I want to kiss you.

	She smiles.

					TRINITY
			I want to kiss you too...

	The PHONE begins to RING.

					TRINITY
			But I want it to be real.

	She pulls herself away and gets into the booth when
	something catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old
	Man had been.

	She hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if
	formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of
	metal.

	The GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through
	the plastic WINDOW just as --

	Trinity disappears.

	The handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS,
	SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Trinity blinks, shivering as her conscious exits the
	Construct.

					TRINITY
			Neo!

					TANK
			What the hell just happened?

					TRINITY
			An Agent!  You have to send me
			back!

					TANK
			I can't!


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	GUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men
	BLASTING, moving at impossible speed.

	For a blinking noment we enter BULLET-TIME.

	Gun flash tongues curl from Neols gun, bullets float
	forward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges
	cartwheel into space.

	An instant later they are nearly on top of each other,
	rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored
	reflection of the other --

	Each jamming their gun tight to the other's head.

	They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting,
	Agent Smith machine-calm.

	Agent Smith smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			You're empty.

	Neo pulls the TRIGGER.  CLICK.

					NEO
			So are you.

	The smile falls.  Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER.

	CLICK.

	Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist
	flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo
	retreating as --

	A knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him
	slamming back against a steel column.

	Stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into
	the beam, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel.

	Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck-
	snapping reverse round-house.  Agent Smith's glasses fly
	off and he glares at Neo; his eyes, ice blue.

					AGENT SMITH
			You can't win.

					NEO
			I already have.

	He attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent
	seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening.

	And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an
	unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Trinity watches Neo as his body jerks, mouth coughing
	blood, his life signs going wild.

					TRINITY
			Jesus, he's killing him!


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air,
	hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel,
	where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail.

	The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack
	when he hears sonething.  From deep in the tunnel, like
	an animal cry; a burst of high-speed METAL GRINDING
	against METAL.

	The sound of an ON-COMING TRAIN.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank is trying to find another entrance.

					TRINITY
			Send me back, Tank!  Anywhere!

					TANK
			I'm looking, Trinity!  I'm

	From the cockpit, an ALARM sounds.  Morpheus hurries to
	the front console, typing, bringing up the radar.

	Trinity follows him.

					TRINITY
			What is it... oh no.

	In every pipe surrounding them, they see the
	Extermination Unit.

					TRINITY
			Sentinels.

	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo tries to get up.  Agent Smith jumps down onto the
	tracks and drop-kicks him in the face.

	The world begins to shake, RUMBLING as the TRAIN NEARS.

					AGENT SMITH
			Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?

	Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to
	look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a
	hole in the darkness.

					AGENT SMITH
			That is the sound of
			inevitability.

	Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight.

					AGENT SMITH
			It is the sound of your death.

	There is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as
	Agent Smith tightens his hold.  Neo is unable to breathe.

					AGENT SMITH
			Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

	The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words.

	The veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the
	pain.

	He is not ready to die.

					NEO
			My name is Neo.

	Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith
	against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.

	They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES
	INTO the station.

	Neo back-flips up off the tracks just as --

	The train barrels over Agent Smith.

	Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its
	emergency brake.  With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of
	TORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the
	station.

	Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the
	escalator --

	As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last
	car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his
	glasses again intact.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Morpheus checks the ship's self destruct key.

					TRINITY
			You can't use that until Neo is
			out!

					MORPHEUS
			I know.  Don't worry, he'll make
			it.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	A man sits in his Mercedes, talking on his car phone when
	his door is thrown open.  Neo yanks him out and jumps in.

	Further down the street, Agent Smith slows, calmly
	touching his ear-piece.

	Neo throws the car across traffic, rocketing down a side-
	street.


	INT.  CAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Driving like a demon with one hand, he grabs the car
	phone and dials long distance.

	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank answers.

					TANK
			Operator.

					NEO (V.O.)
			Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out
			of here!


	INT.  CAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Looking over his shoulder, watching the mirrors, Neo
	drives almost unconsciously.

					NEO
			Hurry, Tank!  I got some serious
			pursuit!


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	The keyboard clicking, Tank searches for an exit.
	Trinity screams into the headset.

					TRINITY
			Neo, you better get your ass back
			here!


	INT.  CAR

					NEO
			I'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying.

					TANK (V.O.)
			I got one!

	Neo glances to his right and sees Agent Brown, now
	driving the car beside his.  Agent Brown swerves,
	slamming into him.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Wabash and Lake.  A hotel.

	Neo fights the steering wheel as Agent Brown pushes the
	car up over the median.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Room 303.

	Neo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing
	lane --

	Directly into the charging path of an enormous truck
	driven by Agent Smith.

	Neo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it,
	rending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other
	cars, as it EXPLODES.

	Neo is up and running even as orange and black clouds
	billow up behind hin.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Three figures silhouette by the burning wreckage become
	the three agents.

	Further down the street, Neo hauls his broken, bleeding
	ass.

	Agents Brown and Smith slow, touching their ear-pieces as
	Agent Jones continues chasing full-bore.

	Neo spins around a corner, racing toward a hotel called:
	the Heart of Chicago Hotel.

	Only Agent Jones is behind him now.

	Neo dives into the alley.  At the far end he sees Agent
	Brown charging.  Neo leaps for the fire escape and begins
	to climb.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN

	Sentinels open and shift like killer kaleidoscopes as
	they ready their weapons, swarming around the
	Nebuchadnezzar.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	The hovercraft booms as machines drop onto it.

					TANK
			I'm going to make the call.

					MORPHEUS
			Do it!


	INT.  "HEART OF CHICAGO" HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Snith is in the elevator when he hears the DISTANT
	RING of a PHONE.


	EXT.  ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY

	The agents chase him, FIRING, BULLETS SPARKING and
	RICOCHETING even as Neo jumps for the third-floor
	platform.

	Neo kicks in the window, jumping into the hall.  The
	doors count backwards:  310...  309...


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Morpheus grabs the biggest gun he can find.  The lasers
	begin to slice through the hull.

					TRINITY
			Where is he?

					TANK
			Almost there.

					MORPHEUS
			He's going to make it.

					TRINITY
			Hurry, Neo.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo can hear the PHONE RINGING.

	305...  304...

	Agent Brown reaches the broken window behind him just as
	Neo grabs the handle of 303, throwing open the door to
	find --

	Agent Sniith, waiting, .45 cocked.

	Neo can't move -- can't think --

	BOOM.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Neo's body jerks, and everyone hears it as the life
	monitors snap flat-line.

	Trinity screams.  Morpheus is frozen in disbelief.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Three holes in his chest, Neo falls to the blue shag
	carpeting, blood smearing down the wallpaper.

	Agent Smith stands over him, still aiming, taking no
	chances.

					AGENT SMITH
			Check him.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Through the lasered opening, Morpheus screams, blasting
	away at the machines; comet-wads of plasma burning holes
	in their armored housings.

	Trinity collapses onto Neo's body.

					TRINITY
			No-no-no!  Neo, you're not dead!
			You can't be dead!


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Kneeling beside him, Agent Brown checks his vital signs.

					AGENT BROWN
			He's gone.

	Agent Smith smiles, standing over him.

					AGENT SMITH
			I told you, you couldn't win.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank is hit, a laser bolt knocking him to the ground.
	They can't hold them off any longer.  Morpheus lunges for
	the self destruct --

	As Trinity whispers in Neo's ear.

					TRINITY
			You're right here.  I'm holding 
			you, Neo.  I'm not letting you go.
			Do you hear me?  I won't let you
			go.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	The agents walk to the elevator, leaving Neo's body
	behind.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Morpheus flicks the Plexiglas shield of the self-
	destruct.

					TRINITY
			Goddamnit, Neo!  Don't give it up!
			Not now!

	She pounds on his chest.

					TRINITY
			Not now!


	INT.  HOTEL HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	The BLOW ECHOES deep in his mind.

	His eyes snap open.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Trinity screams as the monitors jump back to life.  Tank
	and Morpheus stare, unbelieving.

	It is a miracle.

					TRINITY
			Now get up!


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo struggles, holding his chest, sitting up.  Down the
	hall, he sees the elevator closing and --

	Agent Smith staring at him as if he were looking at a
	Cypher.

	Neo gives him the finger.

					AGENT SMITH
			Nooooo!

	Agent Smith pounds on the elevator door.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	A sentinel BLOWS a hole in Morpheus' right arm and he
	screams, refusing to let go of the detonator.

	INT.  ROOM 303 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo dives for the RINGING PHONE.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Machines split open the craft, pouring in, lasers
	targeting everywhere.

	A beat finds the center of Morpheus' forehead and he
	screams, ready to die.

					TRINITY
			Now!

	He turns the key.


	INT.  OVERFLOW PIT

	A blinding shock of white lights flood the chamber;
	sentinels blink and fall instantly dead, filling the pit
	with their cold, metal carcasses.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	In the still darkness, only the humans are alive.

					TRINITY
			Neo?

	His eyes open.  Tears pour from her smiling eyes as he
	reaches up to touch her.

	And she kisses hin; it seems like it might last forever.

									FADE TO BLACK.


	FADE IN:

	ON COMPUTER SCREEN

	as in the opening.  The cursor beating steadily, waiting.

	A PHONE begins to RING.

	It is answered and the screen fills instantly with the
	trace program.  After a long beat, we recognize Neo's
	voice.

					NEO (V.O.)
			Hi.  It's me.  I know you're out
			there.  I know you're working as
			fast as you can to catch me.

	We CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering
	across the screen.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I thought I should call and let
			you know how things stand.

	We DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the
	darkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I know you're real proud of this
			world you've built, the way it
			works, all the nice little rules
			and such, but I've got some bad
			news.

	We realize that the constellation is actually the holes
	in the mouthpiece of a phone.  Seen from inside.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I've decided to make a few
			changes.

	We SHOOT THROUGH the holes as Neo hangs up the phone.

	He steps out of the phone booth and starts walking,
	wearing a long black coat and dark glasses.  He passes a
	mother dragging her little BOY, who cranes his neck as --

	Neo takes off, flying up into the air.

					BOY
			Mommy!  Mommy!

					MOMMY
			What?

					BOY
			That man!  That man flies!

					MOMMY
			Don't be silly, honey.  Men don't
			fly.

	There is a RUSH of AIR as the Boy stares up as Neo shoots
	overhead.  His coat billowing like a black leather cape
	as he soars up, up, and away.

										FADE OUT.

                                MAX'S VOICE

                      I don't believe in heaven, but I have
                      this idea about it. Something I heard in
                      a song.
          
          FADE IN:
          
           White.
          
              pristine, empty frame.   Clean and peaceful.
          
                                 MAX'S VOICE
                      Heaven is a place where nothing ever
                      happens.
          
          There's gentle motion in the blank frame, like swirling 16mm
          grain. A RUMBLE starts to build, low but growing louder...
          
          The grain moves faster, big chunks fluttering, now a dirty
          dishwater grey. The RUMBLE becoming a HOWLING WIND.
          
          Churning black water LAPS at the bottom of the frame...
          
          EXT. HUDSON RIVER - DAWN
          
          A blizzard, at the peak of its power. Visibility zero, New
          York reduced to the hulking shapes of buildings on the banks.
          MAX PAYNE thrashes in the water, a long way from shore.
          
          
                                MAX'S VOICE
                      There's an army of bodies under this
                      river. Criminals, people who ran out of
                      time, out of friends.
          
          
          Chunks of ice float in the dirty water around him. Max's
          body freezing, skin turning blue. Heavy winter clothes
          saturating, like an anchor dragging him down...
          
                               MAX'S VOICE
                      The next time they drag this river,
                      they'll find me on the bottom with the
                      rest of them. And there won't be anybody
                      left to say I was different.
           
          Max's face sinks below the surface...
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Nothing to orient us to the location, the time. Just a flash
          of golden light filling the hall, warm as the river was cold.
          Around a closed door, sunlight streams through the gaps...
          
          BEDROOM
          
          A WOMAN sleeps on the bed, curled up around a bundled BABY.
          Is this the final, peaceful memory of a drowning man?
          
          Something's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural
          position, more thrown than laid across the bed. The crib
          tipped over, blankets scattered. Her eyes frozen open.
          
          Something BLACK flutters against the window pane, CRACKING
          into the glass. The sound of the BLIZZARD creeps in...
          
          RESUME - HUDSON RIVER
          
          Wind POUNDS the river where Max had once been, but there's no
          more thrashing in the water. Mixed in behind the falling
          snowflakes, BLACK SHAPES swirl and dive closer to the water.
          
                              MAX'S VOICE
                    I could feel the dead down there, just
                    below my feet. Reaching up to welcome me
                    as one of their own.
          
          Max breaks the surface - GASPING, STRUGGLING against the
          undertow. Not simply trying to breathe...trying to swim.
          
                              MAX'S VOICE
                    It was an easy mistake to make.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          EXT. STREET (NYC) - NIGHT
          
          Abruptly, the snow is gone. Just a bitter wind left in its
          place, whipping through desolate streets long after midnight.
          Shuffling up the littered sidewalk, three rough-looking MEN
          duck out of the wind by descending down to the subway...
          
          On the dark side of the street, a pair of BOOTS follows them.
          
          TITLE CARD:      ONE WEEK EARLIER
          
          INT. ROSCOE ST. STATION - DAY
          
          A filthy platform, empty except for the three Men huddled on
          a bench. A squeaking TURNSTILE catches their ear...
          
          The same boots grind towards the Men. We don't see the
          walker's face, distracted by something else: a gleaming gold
          wristwatch. As if to make certain the Men notice, he pulls
          back his sleeve to check the time. Quarter past three...
          
          The watch glints as it passes into a dark doorway marked
          `MEN'S.' The Men follow, exchanging wicked grins. Too easy.
          
          SUBWAY BATHROOM
          
          The Men slink into the bathroom, smirking at their oblivious
          prey at the sink. Steam rising, he sets the watch on the
          edge of the sink before washing his hands...
          
                                 MAN #1
                       Hey, that's a really nice watch.
          
          No answer. One of the Men LOCKS the door.       At the sound of
          the lock SNAPPING, he raises his head...
          
          Max Payne, but not yet the man struggling for life in the
          river: clean-shaven, skin like bleached bone. Haunted eyes.
          In the murky mirror, Max sees the Men circling closer...
          
                                 MAN #1
                           (drooling over the watch)
                       Kinda reminds me of one I lost--
          
                                 MAX
                       You didn't lose it. You pawned it up on
                       128th a few hours ago.
          
          Max shuts off the water and calmly turns to face them.
          
                                 MAX
                           (nodding to Man #2)
                       Ask Doug. He was there with you.
          
          Doug frowns, deeply confused about being called by his name.
          
                                 DOUG
                       You've been following us all night?
          
                                 MAX
                       No.
                            (pointing)
                       I'm only following you.
          
          While Doug digests that, PAWNSHOP pulls a pistol and trains
          it on Max's forehead. The third man - not much more than a
          KID, visibly frightened - backs towards the door.
          
                                                      
          
                                                                     4.
                     
          
          
                                 PAWNSHOP
                       You a cop, or something?
          
                                 MAX
                       Not tonight.
          
                                 PAWNSHOP
                       Too bad.
                           (to Doug)
                       Go get my watch.
          
          Distractedly eyeballing Max, Doug brushes the watch off of
          the sink. It hits the dirty tile, delicate crystal CRACKING.
          
          In a sudden blur of movement, Max has one hand on the pistol,
          the other one SMASHING into Pawnshop's windpipe...
          
          Doug steps forward to help... BOOM! The pistol goes off as
          Max pries it free. Max looks up at Doug. Nowhere to run, he
          races into the farthest stall and SLAMS the door.
          
          In the same instant, the Kid bolts for the door. Max has to
          pick: follow or stay with the man he's tracking...
          
          In the stall, Doug crawls on his stomach across the sticky
          floor, trying to squeeze under the divider. Max raises the
          pistol and BLASTS a hole through the door of the next stall.
          
                                 DOUG
                         (craving, eyes closed)
                       Watch over me, watch over me...
          
          The newly-perforated door flies open. Handcuffs SNAP,
          restraining a WHIMPERING Doug to the toilet pipe.
          
                                 MAX
                       Open your eyes, now.
          
          Doug finds himself staring at the pistol's front sight. Max
          reaches into his pocket and produces a tattered photograph...
          It's the woman from Max's golden vision in the river.
          
                                 MAX
                       Have you ever seen her before?
          
          Doug shakes his head violently, confusion and terror rising.
          
                                 MAX
                       You got busted robbing a house in New
                       Jersey with William Preston three--
          
                               DOUG
                     Bill's dead.
          
                               MAX
                     That's why I'm talking to you.
                         (moving the photo closer)
                     Did he ever say anything about this
                     woman? Did you ever hear anyone--
          
                               DOUG
                     Bill died because their wings couldn't
                     lift him up.
          
                               MAX
                     No, he got shot robbing a liquor store.
                     What are you talking about?
          
                               DOUG
                          (incoherent, rambling)
                     Their wings are golden, the feathers only
                     look black...
          
          Sighing, Max unlocks Doug from the pipe, hauling him up and
          slamming into the wall as he cuffs his hands behind his back.
          
          PLATFORM
          
          Max stalks out of the bathroom, pushing Doug ahead of him.
          Down on the tracks, the Kid shrinks into the shadows...
          
          SUBWAY TUNNEL
          
          The Kid runs down the dark tracks, nervously glancing back at
          the receding light of the platform.   He slows gradually,
          relaxing as escape seems certain.
          
          Down to a walk, he startles at movement in the tunnel ahead:
          FLAPPING WINGS - a bird, lost and trapped underground?
          
          The Kid freezes, his frightened BREATHS almost enough to
          drown the sound out. It grows, though, more WINGS joining...
          
          He turns to retreat up the tracks, but the WINGS suddenly
          seem to be echoing towards him from all directions.
          
          Panicked, the Kid becomes disoriented in the growing RACKET,
          the tunnel ahead begins to glow brighter as he spins...
          
          Visible now in the growing light, BLACK SHAPES flicker above
          the tracks - dozens becoming hundreds, swelling larger, their
          POUNDING wings joined by a train RUMBLING closer...
          
          
                                                                          
          
                                                                      6.
                     
          
          
          Frozen, the Kid can only squint into the headlights closing
          in, petrified by the dark wings SWIRLING around him...
          I
           NT. COLD CASE OFFICE - DAY
          
          The front room of the cold case department is a mess - desks
          piled high with paperwork and a week's worth of coffee cups.
          
          Halfway in the front door, a young DETECTIVE stands holding a
          box of his belongings. He looks around for signs of life.
          SERGEANT ADAMS wanders down the hall, frowning at the draft.
          
                                 SGT. ADAMS
                       You my new guy?
          
                                 DETECTIVE
                       I didn't think anybody was here.
          
                                 SGT. ADAMS
                       Everybody's usually a little late.
          
          HALLWAY
          
          Sgt. Adams leads the detective down a hall, giving the tour.
          
                                 SGT. ADAMS
                       All the cold investigations in the city
                       are collected and delivered over to us.
                       We call each witness to see if they can
                       add anything to their original statement.
          
                                 DETECTIVE
                       And if they can?
          
                                 SGT. ADAMS
                       We send the file back to the original
                       precinct for follow-up. Don't get your
                       hopes up, though.
          
          The Sergeant continues towards the center of the building,
          farther from the light of the windows. He stops at a door.
          
                                 SGT. ADAMS
                       Once you've gone through the file and
                       come up empty, bring it here...
          
          FILE ROOM/MAX'S OFFICE
          
          They enter a windowless cave, long rows of metal cabinets
          stretching on forever into the heart of the building. At a
          desk in the corner, Max slumps over a stack of files.
          
          
                                                                           
          
          D
          
          
          
          
          M
          
          
          
          
                                                                       7.
                     
          
          
                                 SGT. ADAMS
                       Max here handles our filing. Once it
                       hits his desk, a case is officially dead.
          
           ax looks up, dark circles from his long night in the subway.
          He nods, but the Detective is too busy making a note to see.
                               D
                                  ETECTIVE
                       What if there's no phone number for a
                       witness? Should I follow up in person?
          
                                 SGT. ADAMS
                       Nope, we don't do that down here.
          
           iscretely, Max slides his cut-up knuckles under the desk...
          
                                 DETECTIVE
                       I don't understand, then how--
          
                                 SGT. ADAMS
                       How do you solve that unsolvable murder
                       mystery and redeem yourself?
          
                                 DETECTIVE
                       The grand jury couldn't find--
          
                                 SGT. ADAMS
                       Stop. Trust me, there's a tragic story
                       behind why I'm here giving you this tour.
                       We all did something, so just save it.
                           (moving for the door)
                       Follow me to the break room...
          
          The Detective turns to Max, embarrassed after his reprimand.
          
                                 DETECTIVE
                       We should get a beer after work, or
                       something...
          
          Max smiles and nods, but his eyes give him away as a liar:
          
                                  MAX
                       Yeah.   Maybe so.
          
          HALLWAY
          
          The Detective steals a look at Max as Adams shuts his door.
          
                                 DETECTIVE
                       So what did he do?
          
          
          
                                                                            
          
          W
          
          
          
          
          M
          
          
          
          
                       J
          
          
          
          
                                                                       8.
                     
          
          
                                 SGT. ADAMS
                           (sharply)
                       Nothing.
          
          Naturally, this reaction piques the detective's curiosity.
          
                                  SGT. ADAMS
                       R
                        emember when you were a kid, and you'd
                       hold your breath when you went past a
                       graveyard?
          
          The detective nods.     Adams glances through the window at Max.
          
                                 SGT. ADAMS
                        ust...try to leave him alone.
          
          MAX'S OFFICE
          
          Max sneaks a sideways glance to the door, watching Adams lead
          the new Detective away. Once they're gone, Max reaches into
          his desk and removes a file... `PRESTON, WILLIAM A.'
          
           ax goes to a rusted cabinet and buries the file deep inside.
          
          INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          A lock POPS.     Max steps inside, only silence to greet him.
          
          Max lays his jacket across the back of a worn leather chair,
          footsteps REVERBERATING because there's little other
          furniture to absorb the sound. He keeps walking...
          
          KITCHEN
          
          ...past a table with one chair, past gleaming counters. Max
          fills a glass of water from the tap. Eyes blank, patient.
          
          LIVING ROOM
          
          Carefully, Max rests the full glass on the arm of the chair.
          Reaching underneath the chair, Max produces an artist's
          sketchbook and places it delicately on the table before him.
          
          Sith trembling hands, Max turns back the battered cover...
           uddenly, colors burst into the monochrome room: bright
          swirls of oil pastels sketch out a still life in Technicolor.
          
          Gradually, Max's eyes lose their hardness. His breaths come
          FASTER, ragged. Jaw clenched, he turns the page...
          
          
          
                                                                            
          
                                 V
          
          
          
          
          I
          
          
          
          
                                                                         9.
                     
          
          
          More flowing brush strokes, the artist's feminine initials...
          Max reaches up to turn the page, hands shaking severely...
          
          He takes hold of the corner of the page, but his muscles
          won't cooperate - as if the page ways more than Max can lift.
          
          Max's skin flushes red...tears almost welling...
          
          And then at once, Max slams the book shut and turns away.
          
          CLOSET
          
          The door swings open. Hanging inside, the battered coat we
          saw Max wear in the subway. A pistol on a hook by the door.
          Urban armor, scarred by countless nights of service.
          
          Max dresses himself for battle, eyes returning to stone.
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          Max climbs out of the subway into a neighborhood with a foot
          in two worlds: the buildings are old and crumbling, but the
          shops inside are sleek and expensive. A jarring combination.
          M
           ax walks up the street, brushing past HOMELESS PEOPLE and
          FASHIONISTAS jostling for the same space on the sidewalk.
          
           NT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY
          
          The hallway is ancient brick, but the doors are pristine
          steel. Pausing at one with a dozen locks, Max KNOCKS.
          
          The door cracks.    An EYE appears.   Squinting, evaluating.
          
                                  OICE (O.S.)
                       You can't come here anymore.
          
                                 MAX
                       William Preston was a dead end.
          
          The door cracks enough to reveal the speaker: TREVOR, skinny-
          fat in an sharp suit and sunglasses, shirt open a little far.
          
                                 TREVOR
                       You can't come here, I said. I'm done
                       helping you. I've already...
                           (lowering his voice)
                       ...paid my debt to society, you know?
                       I've cooperated enough.
          
                                 MAX
                       We need to talk.   Won't take long.

          TREVOR'S APARTMENT - ENTRANCE HALL
          
          Max follows Trevor inside. The narrow brick entry opens into
          a cutting-edge loft beyond, filled with modern art and a
          gathering of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE milling around enjoying it.
          
                              TREVOR
                    I thought you found Bill's partner.
          
                              MAX
                    I did, but Doug only wanted to talk about
                    pigeons, or something. I need a new
                    name, someone robbing houses to feed a
                    habit around that same time.
                              T
                               REVOR
                    Three years is a lifetime for guys like
                    that. One way or the other, they're
                    probably all gone now.
                        (a little self-satisfied)
                    Either way, I'm not the one to ask
                    anymore. I cater to a better class, now.
          
          One of the guests catches Max's eye: NATASHA, young and
          beautiful, returns his gaze for an extra moment and smiles.
          
                              MAX
                    I can see that.
          
                              TREVOR
                    This is a party. These are my friends.
                    You remember friends?
          
                               AX
                    I need another name, or I start frisking
                    your friends.
          
          Trevor stands his ground, not flinching at Max's threat.
          
                               TREVOR
                      don't have one to give you, Max. Look,
                    you've gone through all your living
                    leads, now you're running out of dead
                    ones...
                        (beat)
                    I don't think this guy's out there.
          
          Max nods, fatigue fighting the determination in his eyes.
          
                              TREVOR
                     ry sleeping at night every now and then,
                    you'd see that for yourself.

          Max doesn't answer. His eyes have drifted back to Natasha.
          She plucks a drink from a passing tray, revealing a dark
          smudge across the inside of her wrist as she does.
          
                                 TREVOR
                       I'd invite you in, but...
          
          Suddenly intent, Max pushes past Trevor and into the loft.
          
                                 MAX
                        hanks.
          
          LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Max weaves through the party towards Natasha, out of place in
          his utilitarian clothes. She looks up as he gets closer...
                               N
                                  ATASHA
                        ou decided to stay for a while.
          
          She speaks with a Russian accent - smiling, a little nervous.
          Rather than answering, Max's eyes drop to her wrist.
          
                                 NATASHA
                        ow it's your turn to say something...
          
           ax takes her hand, gently turning it to reveal her tattoo: a
          black wing, stylized feathers tracing faint blue veins.
          
                                 MAX
                       That's interesting.
          
                                 NATASHA
                       Thank you. It's...
                           (glancing past Max)
                       Shit.
          
          Max follows her gaze to the front door, where Trevor is
          nervously greeting another new arrival: MONA SAX. She's
          striking, beautiful but also a little frightening. It
          doesn't hurt that she's flanked by BODYGUARDS. Russian Mob.
          
          Seeing Natasha standing with Max, Mona barrels across the
          room towards them. People stand aside to let her pass.
          
           ithout preamble, Mona begins YELLING at Natasha in Russian.
          Natasha RESPONDS in kind, clearly intimidated by Mona.
          
          Abruptly, Mona grabs Natasha's arm, jerking her off balance.
          
                                 MAX
                       Why don't you let go--
          
                                                                           
          
          S
          
          
          
          
                                                                     12.
                     
          
          
                                 MONA
                           (in perfect English)
                       Mind your business.
          
          Mona returns to Natasha, dragging her towards the door.
          Natasha's tone becomes PLEADING, physically no match for
          Mona. Max steps in, reaching up to touch Mona's shoulder...
          I
           t happens in a flash: Mona spins and takes hold of Max's
          arm. Incredibly, he's just as fast, slipping free of the
          grip that would surely have snapped his wrist...
          
          For a moment, Max and Mona stare each other down. Surprised,
          reevaluating each other. Natasha continues to TALK, her
          Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd.
          
          Mona's eyes drop to Max's chest, where the tussle pulled his
          coat open to reveal a low-pro holster and tarnished badge.
          
          With the flick of her wrist, Mona stops her guards' advance.
          
          The crowd begins to notice the altercation. Natasha keeps
          TALKING, trying desperately to make peace and reassure Mona
          of something. Mona's eyes cut between Natasha and Max...
          
           till apprehensive, Mona shakes her head and walks away.
          
                                  NATASHA
                       My sister.
                           (beat)
                       Sort of a bitch.
          
          As Max nods at the understatement, Trevor rushes over,
          forcing a broad smile to reassure his guests. He pulls Max's
          coat closed over the badge and ushers him towards the door.
          
                                 TREVOR
                       You have to go. Now.
          
                                 MAX
                           (pulling free)
                       Fine. I just want to ask her something
                       first...
          
          Max turns to the spot where Natasha had been.   She's gone.
          
          HALLWAY - LATER
          
          The party has grown more crowded. Max fights his way down a
          dark hall, searching the shadowed faces he passes. Back
          here, the music is nothing but GROWLING BASS.
          
          
                                                                           
          
                                 N
          
          
          
          
          S
          
          
          
          
          A
          
          
          
          
                                                                    13.
                     
          
          
          A flickering glow escapes the gaps around one door...
          
          DARK ROOM
          
          A ring of candles in the center of the floor provides the
          only light. It's not enough to really see the PEOPLE inside.
          We hear them CHANTING, low voices MURMURING in unison...
          
          Quick glimpses in the candle light, bare flesh writhing.
          Cast on the walls, corresponding shadows twist and shift...
          
          A black feather billows across the floor between candles.
          Spreading up the wall, a new shadow rises above the rest...
          
              pair of wings - long and distorted in the candle light.
          
          Max appears in the doorway as the shadows loose their shape -
          Max only catching a glimpse, not sure what he's seeing...
          
          HALLWAY
          
          As Max strains to see detail in the dark room, a face
          materializes in the haze: cheeks laced with tattoos, eyes
          twinkling flames sunk in deep shadow. JACK LUPINO.
          
           uddenly, Max turns and sees Natasha standing beside him.     We
          immediately notice something different about her: staring
          boldly into Max's eyes, all her earlier shyness vanished.
                               N
                                  ATASHA
                       Looking for me?
          
          Natasha glances through the door at the shifting shadows,
          smiling at what she sees. Max follows her eyes...
          
                                 MAX
                       Were you in there?
          
                                  ATASHA
                           (shrugging, coy)
                       Take me somewhere, I'll tell you.
          
          INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Max leads Natasha inside. Before he can even shut the door,
          Natasha pounces - kissing, hands running over his body. As
          he pushes back, Natasha's hands slip into Max's pockets...
          
          Abruptly, Natasha breaks away and looks around the apartment.
          
                                 NATASHA
                       You just move in?

          Not really interested, Natasha walks deeper into the room.
          
                                  AX
                        hree years ago. So we're somewhere,
                       now: who was that guy--
          
          In response, Natasha unbuckles her pants and lets them drop.
          Still walking, opening her shirt on her way out of the room.
          
          HALLWAY
          
          Max moves down the hallway, following a trail of clothing.
          From inside a room, we hear the faint sound of CHANTING...
          
          BEDROOM
          
          In Max's bed, a thin sheet barely covers Natasha's body. Her
          lips tremble with a slurred SONG. With predatory eyes, she
          watches Max stop in the doorway, something holding him back.
                               N
                                  ATASHA
                           (frustrated sigh)
                       Fine. What was her name?
          
                                 MAX
                       Who?
          
                                 NATASHA
                       The girl from the boring story you want
                       tell me. The one that ends with you
                       living here. Very sad.
          
          Caught off guard, Max tries to figure out how much he'll say.
          Natasha resumes CHANTING as she waits - a stream of frantic
          SYLLABLES rattling off, nothing recognizable as words.
          
                                 NATASHA
                         tell you what...
                           (beat, evil smile)
                       Call me by her name.
          
                                 MAX
                           (startled)
                       What?
          
          Natasha grins, legs spreading, sheet starting to fall away...
          
                                 NATASHA
                       That way you can make love to her again,
                       just like she never left you.
                           (shrill, mocking voice)
                       Oh, Max, I miss you...

          Like a switch, Max's face closes off again.
          
                                  AX
                       You should go.
          
                                    NATASHA
                       Excuse me?
          
                                 MAX
                           (exhausted, to himself)
                       There's nothing you can tell me.
          
          Natasha explodes out of the bed, springing up naked in front
          of Max - shoulders heaving with rage, eyes wild black holes.
                               N
                                  ATASHA
                        ou're kicking me out of your bed?
          
          For a moment, it seems like Natasha is about to attack.    Not
          physically intimidated, Max stares at her in disbelief.
          
                                    MAX
                       Yeah.
          
          Natasha stomps into the hall, gathering her clothes. She
          pulls a cell phone from her crumpled pants and dials...
          
                                 NATASHA
                           (on phone)
                       Owen, pick up if you're awake...
          
          Max watches her disappear down the hall, front door SLAMMING
          a moment later. He looks around, silence returning again.
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          Natasha walks down a dark, desolate block, the sound of her
          HEELS echoing off of the crumbling buildings around her. Her
          eyes are still wild, her stride quick and aggressive.
          
          A group of MEN huddle in a stairway to avoid the wind. As
          Natasha passes, they look up at her with equally wild eyes.
          
           atasha steps off the sidewalk and into an alley, plunging
          into the darkness like she's been there many times before.
          In the distance, faint MUSIC rumbles through the street.
          
              moment later, the few working lamps on the street dim...
          
                      N

          ALLEY
          
          Natasha barrels down the alley, squinting to see ahead.        The
          music is a little louder, BASS shaking the dumpsters.
          A
              wind picks up, garbage blowing...
          
          Suddenly unsettled by something, Natasha's pace slows.      She
          tenses, all her swagger vanishing before our eyes...
          
              can RATTLES in the alley behind her.    Natasha spins...
          
          Nothing - just the FLICKERING of moths swarming the alley's
          only light, their shadows black shapes against the bricks.
          
          The sound of much larger BEATING WINGS fills the alley...
          
          Eyes wide with terror, Natasha searches for something in the
          shapes cast by the moths, dread deepening as she finds it:
          
           eal winged shapes mix with the shadows, FLAPPING wildly...
          
          Natasha CRIES OUT, stumbling back.      She turns, running...
          
                                 NATASHA
                       ot yet!   Please, just let me...
          
          Natasha's SCREAMS seem lost in the chaos of wind and WINGS
          and distant MUSIC. She suddenly stops running...
          
          More SHADOWS assemble ahead of her, their black wings open.
          
          INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Max hurriedly dresses, wearing the same suit from yesterday.
          He picks up his keys, searching around for something else -
          feeling the pockets of his jacket, down in the cushions...
          
          OFFICE
          
          Max moves up the sidewalk, nearly at the steps of his office.
          A rough-running ENGINE idles up the street, getting closer.
          Slowly, Max realizes that he's being followed. He turns...
          A
           LEX HILLMAN sits behind the wheel - about Max's age, but in
          much rougher condition, everything about him a little ashen.
          He watches Max turn away from the office and move closer.
          
          Max returns Alex's stare. We don't know if they're about to
          smile or open fire. They don't seem to know, either.
          
          Alex slides over and throws the passenger side door open.
          
                    S

          INT. ALEX'S CAR - DAY
          
          Alex and Max ride in silence, a palpable tension in the car.
          
           lex pulls a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and shakes
          one out. He holds the pack out to Max, who shakes his head.
          
          Alex nods, smiling, using his lighter and then laying it with
          the pack within Max's reach. Max doesn't even glance down.
          After a silent moment, Alex looks over at Max and frowns.
          
                              ALEX
                    You're not serious, are you?
          
          Shaking his head in disbelief, Alex pulls to the curb.
          T
           hey've parked at a crime scene - the alley in front of them
          sealed with police tape, COPS posted to keep onlookers away.
          
                              MAX
                    What's this?
          
          Alex pulls a flask from under his seat, taking a quick pull.
          
                              ALEX
                    I need you to look at something.
          
          EXT. ALLEY - DAY
          
          Alex approaches the alley, pulling on a leather jacket and
          snapping a badge onto his belt. The cops let him pass.
          
          Max follows Alex, slowing as he crosses the police tape. By
          the crowd of CSI TECHS, what started here didn't end well.
          There's blood everywhere, a dozen white sheets on the ground.
          
                              MAX
                    What happened to them?
          
                                 ALEX
                    Her.     Just one.
          
          Confused, Max studies the sheets. On second look, they
          aren't covering anything quite big enough to be a whole body.
          
                              ALEX
                     omebody found her leg near the sidewalk,
                    called it in a few hours later. We found
                    the other one in the dumpster over there.

          Max and Alex turn to see that they've attracted spectators,
          the other DETECTIVES D the alley watching them intently.
                               in

                       Only that it didn't happen here. Beyond
                       that, I don't even know how to describe
                       it in my report. `Disassembled,' that's
                       the word we came up with.
          
          The Detective grins, proud of his wit. Alex and Max move on
          without comment. Max looks at the sheets, shaking his head.
          
                                 MAX
                       Why are you showing me this?
          
          Alex pulls out a plastic evidence bag, holding it out...
          
          Max's wallet.
          
                                 ALEX
                       We found it here, by her heart.
          
          Inside the clear bag, Max's ID picture is smeared with blood.
          
                                 ALEX
                       As far as we know, the victim--

                       Natasha.
          
           ax kneels down over a tarp. The edge is pulled back,
          revealing a pale forearm with a delicate tattoo of a wing.
          
                                 MAX
                           (remembering)
                       They couldn't lift him up...
          
                                 ALEX
                       What did you just say?
          
          Max looks up at Alex, who is suddenly quite agitated. He
          glances back at the other detectives - they're staring at
          Alex and Max, whispering something amongst themselves.

                    We need to talk, Max. Tonight.
                        (writing something)
                    Here's my address...
          
                              MAX
                    For God's sake, I know where you--
          
                              ALEX
                        (somber)
                    No, I moved out.
          
          Alex hands over the address and hurries away, leaving Max
          standing in the alley, surrounded by Natasha's remains.
          
          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Max steps out of his car, moving up the sidewalk to a
          surprisingly nice apartment building: uniformed doorman, the
          works. Double-checking the address, Max steps inside...
          
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Near the end of the hall, Max stops at an apartment door.
          The wood is splintered, pieces of the frame hanging loose...
          
           orced open.
          
          Max checks the hall in both directions, drawing his pistol...
          
          ALEX'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
          
          Careful not to make a sound, Max steps into a living room so
          messy that it's hard to say for sure if it's been ransacked.
          Max flips a switch by the door, but no lights come on.
          
                               MAX
                    Alex?   Are you in here?
          
          Max pauses so his eyes can adjust to the traces of
          streetlight sneaking through the blinds. He moves deeper...
          
          KITCHEN
          
          Pistol ready, Max moves into the kitchen. Dirty dishes,
          flies swarming around the necks of countless liquor bottles.
          U
           nseen behind Max's back, the front door pushes closed...
          
          HALLWAY
          
          Max creeps down a hallway.   His shoes CRUNCH in something:
          
                                                                        
          
          A
          
          M
          
          
          
          
                                                                     20.
                     
          
          
          A broken mirror scattered in the hallway, the pieces growing
          more concentrated towards the dark end of the hall.
          
          Max reaches an open doorway.   Cautiously, he sweeps inside...
          
          In the hallway behind Max, SOMETHING moves in the shadows.
          
           ax moves deeper into the darkness, gleaming shards of mirror
          grinding underfoot. Something lies in the floor ahead...
          
            BODY - legs stretched across the hall, upper torso not
          visible inside a room. A badge on the belt, a service
          revolver limp in it's fingers, tattered leather jacket.
          
          Alex.
          
          At the moment that registers, a NOISE in the hallway behind
          him sends Max ducking for cover in the doorway beside him.
          Max crouches, gun raised, staring at Alex's motionless body.
          
                               MAX
                       Alex!
          
          FOOTSTEPS grow closer...slow, steady...
          
          Max uses the fragments of mirror scattered around Alex's
          legs, each giving a tiny view of the hallway...
          
          One piece shows a FIGURE moving closer, shrouded in darkness.
          A
           nother reflection shows a set of eyes. Frozen. Frantic.
          It's Alex, staring at Max, seeming to silently beg for help.
          Max looks from the reflection to the legs. There's no way...
          
          There's no way Alex's head is still attached to his body.
          
          Thunderstruck, Max looses track of the shadows moving closer
          to his hiding spot, unable to pull his eyes away from Alex.
          The Figure lunges out of the shadows, slamming into Max...
          
          The Dark Shape's slashing blows glint in the moonlight, cold
          metal slicing the air faster than Max can fend off...
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          A RAPID SERIES OF IMAGES:
          
          Max drags himself up the hall, hands slicing on the shards.
          The air echoes with angry VOICES, LAUGHTER and SCREAMS.
          Blood drips down the walls, shadows teem with movement...

          The FLAPPING grows louder, gusting WIND scattering glass.
          Max SHOUTS, disoriented, instinctively pushing himself on.
          Alex's eyes, frozen wide, watch as Max crawls closer...
          
          Shadows in the air above Max roil with movement. Demonic
          HOWLS rattle the windows. Max reaches out to Alex...
          
          Above them, black wings POUND.

           NT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
          
          Max's eyes pop open.
          
          He lies in a hospital bed, surrounded by flashing machinery.
          Beyond the soft WHIR of equipment fans, the room is silent.
          
                                 BB (O.C.)
                       The E.R. doctor's old man was a patrolman
                       in the 45th. I got him to get you a
                       private room.
          
          In a chair by the bed, BB HENSLEY (50s) watches Max wake up.
          BB's face is weathered and hard, but his smile is kind.
          
                                 BB
                        our contact information was... pretty
                       out of date, you know, but one of the
                       dispatchers remembered me and your dad
                       riding together back in the day.
          
          Max nods groggily, struggling to find his bearings...
          
          Suddenly, something breaks through.
          
                                 MAX
                       Alex.
          
          BB nods, shivering at the mental image his name produces.
          
                                 BB
                        he first unit to respond must've scared
                       them away before they could do the same
                       thing to you. Pretty remarkable,
                       considering your luck.
          
                                 MAX
                       He was trying to tell me something.

                                  B
                       I hate to say it, but you need to come up
                       with something better than that. They've
                       got nothing for leads, so the whole force
                       has you pegged as the prime suspect.
          
                                  AX

                       No need.   The funeral starts in an hour.
          
          Max pops up, tangling the IV tubes running into his hand.
          
                                 BB
                        ust slow down.   You need to--
          
          Max wraps the clear tube around his hand and SNAPS it free.
          
                                  AX
                       What I need is to borrow some dress
                       blues. Can you help me out?
          
                                 BB
                           (reluctant)
                       Yeah. My office is on the way.
          
          As Max takes an unsteady step onto the cold tile floor, a
          concerned BB throws his overcoat across Max's shoulders.
          
          INT. BB'S CAR - DAY
          
          BB and Max ride in silence, RADIO overpowered by the blasting
          heater. Max closes the overcoat over his hospital gown.

          BB pulls against the curb on a block unfamiliar to Max.
          
          EXT. ASGARD BUILDING - DAY
          
          A massive stone structure, squat like a military fortress and
          black under the storm clouds. There have been updates over
          the years, but nothing could to hide the age of the building.

          BB starts across the sidewalk to the entrance. Max follows,
          giving a confused frown at the building they're approaching.
          
                                 MAX
                       You quit working for Aesir?
          
          BB leads Max through a wrought-iron gate, into a small
          courtyard leads back to the thick wood doors of the entrance.
          
                                   B
                       I didn't quit, they made me head of
                       security for the whole parent company.

                       that it is.

          A proud parent, BB points at a deep pit in the stone wall.
          
                                 MAX
                           (impatient)
                       It's a bullet hole.
          
                                 BB
                       Yeah, from a musket ball. The British
                       used this place as a military prison
                       during the Revolutionary War. Think
                       about that. It's older than St. Paul's.

           NT. ASGARD BUILDING - BB'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          The double doors fly open onto a massive office - dark wood
          panelling, a wall of windows glowing white from the snow.
          
          Max goes to the windows. Spreading out bellow him, the wide
          black expanse of the East River rolls past. Bridges arc up
          into the storm clouds and disappear before they hit Brooklyn.

                       this will fit.
          
          While BB roots around inside, Max absently scans his desk.
          
          A slick company newsletter - `AESIR PHARMACEUTICALS.' On
          the cover, NICOLE HORNE - 50's, dignified, not quite smiling.
          `A HOLIDAY MESSAGE FROM THE CEO' printed below her face.

                           (off Max's confusion)
                       Third page from the back.
          
          Max flips the pages - smiling scientists, sparkling labs...
          
           ICHELLE PAYNE, bright smile illuminating a bland corporate
          portrait. The same face in the photo Max showed the Junkie.
          
                                 BB
                        hey're going to set up some kind of
                       scholarship in her name.
          
          Taken by surprise, Max doesn't seem to hear BB's explanation.
          
                                   BB
                        hey kept coming to me for suggestions
                       over what she might want. I guess since

                       I said art. She liked art, right?
          
          Max nods, turning his eyes away from the photograph.
          
                                 BB
                        t's a nice thing, a scholarship.   Good
                       way to remember somebody.
          
           ax eagerly takes the old uniform from BB, happy to have
          something else to focus on. BB studies his body language.
          
                                 BB
                       You still haven't been out there, have
                       you?
          
          Max doesn't answer, slipping into a wrinkled dress shirt.
          
           XT. CEMETERY - DAY
          
          Cars line the drive leading into the cemetery. People leave
          their warmth and hurry through the iron gates - these
          mourners especially determined, a community out to honor a
          fallen brother. BB and Max follow them onto the...
          
          CEMETERY PATH
          
          Max's eyes are on the cemetery. BB follows his gaze...
          Two marble angels on the hill. One smaller than the other.

          Max shakes his head.
          
          Up ahead, a young mother tends to two little girls dressed in
          black, escorted through the cemetery gate by the HONOR GUARD.
          CHRISTA HILLMAN, Alex's widow. Face blank, still in shock.

                       I'll find us some seats...
          
           ax threads his way through the mass of UNIFORMED COPS
          waiting to enter the cemetery. One by one they notice Max,
          jaws clenching. Max doesn't realize the gauntlet he's in,
          distracted by a glance of BB slinking into the graves...
          
          ...where NICOLE HORNE watches the funeral from among the
          headstones, almost overdressed in head-to-toe black. Close
          at hand, JASON COLVIN holds Nicole's umbrella.
          
           B approaches Nicole, body language weak and deferential...
          
          Max glances back at the path and finds himself facing a wall
          of angry cops. He keeps walking, no sign of backing down.
          
                                 CHRISTA (O.C.)
                       Let him through.
          
          Even with the cops making way, the walk to Christa is hard -
          the heartbreak and grief on her face slowing Max's gait.

          Christa's eyes bore into Max with all the weight of a long
          and deep friendship, momentarily shaming him into silence.
          
                                 CHRISTA
                       Who did this to him, Max?
          
                                 MAX
                       We don't have a lot, yet...
          
          Christa steps towards Max, teeth gritted with powerless rage.

                                CHRISTA
                          (seething)
                      When everything happened to you, Alex
                      completely fell apart. He ruined his
                      life, he cared that much. So what are
                      you going to do for him, now?
          M
           ax could melt under those eyes, but Christa turns her back
          and continues up the path to Alex's waiting coffin.
          
          Shamed, Max turns away and starts back down the path alone.
          
                                BRAVURA
                      Detective Payne?
          
          Everyone turns to see JIM BRAVURA (40s) leaning on the fence.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       .A.   I need you to come with me.
          
           hough they'd been moments from brawling, there's a common
          reaction from the other cops: nobody likes this guy. Max
          looks around, humiliated.
          
                                 MAX
                       ow?
          
                                 BRAVURA
                      Now.
          
          GRAVESIDE
          
          The honor guard stands in formation by the flag-draped
          casket. The PRIEST waits, his bible ripping in the wind...
          
          Christa twists around in her chair, looking down at the
          cemetery gate. She sees the crowd, Max being escorted away.
          
                                CHRISTA
                          (sad, to the priest)
                      Okay.
          
          Above them all, Nicole Horne stands like a shadow between the
          graves, too far away to hear the words of the priest.
          
          INT. BRAVURA'S OFFICE
          
          A cramped office, packed with boxes - a civil servant's tomb.
          Wedged behind the desk, Bravura sorts through his notes. Max
          and BB sit across the desk, left on ice while Bravura reads.

          Bravura slides a folder over to Max - photographs of the
          alley, Natasha's covered body. Bravura watches his reaction.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                        ow'd the girl have your wallet?
          
                                 MAX
                       She stole it.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       Like...picked your pocket?
          
          Max shrugs.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       So you didn't know she was a prostitute?
          
          The slightest uncomfortable look passes between Max and BB.
          
                                 MAX
                       No, I didn't.    We met through a friend.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       Trevor Duncan. He's your friend?
          
                                  MAX
                       I guess.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       That's classy. You know what Trevor does
                       for a living, I assume?
          
                                 MAX
                       He used to snitch for me.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       T
                        ell me, Max, what's a glorified file
                       clerk still need a snitch for?
          
          Max stays stone-faced, burying any emotion Bravura could use.
          
                                  BRAVURA
                         see.   So you'd piss in a cup for us,
                       right?
          
                                 BB
                           (standing)
                       I think you just said the magic words.
                       Call once you hear from the union lawyer.
          
          Bravura replaces Natasha's pictures with a stack of shots
          taken in Alex's apartment. Despite himself, Max freezes.

                      (2)
          
          
                               BRAVURA
                      ou and Detective Hillman haven't worked
                     together since your reassignment. What
                     made you get back in touch?
          
          Max is distracted by the photographs: enormous blood stains
          in stark flash bulb light, no longer hidden by the shadows.
          
                               MAX
                     He wanted me to help him with something.
          
                                  BRAVURA
                            (making a note)
                     And?
          
          Max looks up from the picture, realizing he's been baited
          into saying more than he'd meant to. He starts for the door.
          
                               MAX
                     That's what I'm going to do.
          
           ravura gives Max a hard look.      Mad, but genuinely searching.
          
                               BRAVURA
                      ook at this from my perspective: I've
                     got two bodies in ten body bags. You
                               M
                     were the last person to see either one...
          
                                AX
                         (pointing to the photos)
                     And some of that blood is mine.     Good
                     luck with your case.
          
          As Max storms out, BB calmly stands and pulls on his jacket.
          
                               BB
                     Nice work, detective.
          
          As BB turns to leave, Bravura stands from behind his desk.
          
                               BRAVURA
                     You've been around long enough to know
                     I'm his only way out.
          
          BB looks back and sees the business card Bravura's holding
          out. After a conflicted moment, BB slips it into his pocket.
          
          ELEVATOR
          
          Still fuming from the encounter with Bravura, Max watches the
          numbers over the door fall. BB stands beside him, anxious.
          A car load of PEOPLE surround them, pressed tightly together.
          
                                                                           
          
          M

          A
          
          
          
          
                                                                       29.
                     
          
          
                                 BB
                       Well, I hope that felt good.
          
          Max doesn't respond, eyes drifting to the directory mounted
          above the buttons. `2ND FLOOR, TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS,' `5TH
          FLOOR, NARCOTICS....'
          
                                 BB
                       It makes you look guilty. You understand
                       that, right? Now it's not just Alex's
                       unit that thinks you're the guy...
          
          Max's eyes find `10TH FLOOR, HOMICIDE DIVISION.'
          
          The doors open with a CHIME, and the CROWD presses forward.
          H
           ALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          BB steps out with the other passengers, still talking to Max.
          
                                 BB
                       You need friends on the force right now.
                       There's only so much I can do outside...
          
          BB turns to see if his words are doing anything to reach Max.
          
          However, Max is still standing in the elevator, the only one
          left on the car. He presses the button for the tenth floor.
          
                                 BB
                       Where are you going?
          
          The doors LURCH shut.
          
          HOMICIDE OFFICE
          
          Max steps into the room.
          
           t once, you're struck by how this is the opposite of the
          cold case department: desks cluttered by labor instead of
          neglect, DETECTIVES engaged in their telephone conversations.
          
          Eyes start to find him.
          
           ax marches forward, ignoring the spreading wave of shock.
          
          Max stops at a door marked `ALEX HILLMAN.'    It's locked.
          
           ax JIGGLES the door knob.

                                                                       30.
                     
          
          
                                    DETECTIVE #1
                              (shouting)
                       Hey!
          
          Max doesn't look up.       He keeps SHAKING the handle, desperate.
          
                                 DETECTIVE #1 (cont'd)
                       Hey asshole, that door's locked for a
                       reason.
          
          One by one, the detectives climb to their feet, expressions
          showing outrage and anger. They close in on Max...
          
                                 DETECTIVE #2
                       God damn it, that means you need a--
          M
           ax gives the knob a final twist, and the door swings open.
          
                                 MAX
                           (to himself)
                       There wasn't ever a key.
          
          Max steps inside.       Enraged, the detectives start to follow...
          
           ut the door SLAMS again in their faces.
          
          ALEX'S OFFICE
          
          The doorknob RATTLES, no method this time. SHOUTS and BANGS
          ring through the door. Ignoring it, Max surveys the room...
          
          The office is bare, no decorations or personal touches. Max
          walks deeper into the room, opening a filing cabinet. Empty.
          
          Trying to remain calm while the door SHAKES violently, Max
          turns his attention to the desk. One drawer empty...
          
          Max tries another drawer, and finds this one locked.
          
           ax drives his boot into the drawer, AGAIN and AGAIN.
          
                                 DETECTIVE (O.C.)
                       What are you doing in there?
          
          Teeth gritted against the pain, Max delivers a final KICK.
          
          The drawer front shatters and collapses.       Max reaches inside.
          
           iles - not criminal jackets like the ones in Cold Case.
          More official, somehow. Max flips through one at random...
          
          `GREEN, OWEN A.'       Not a mug shot, but a military ID photo.

                                                                   31.
                     
          
          
          Out in the hall, the crowd of detectives seems to grow
          larger, the POUNDING on the door becoming more severe.
          T
           he SLAMMING sounds outside push Max deeper into the desk,
          frantically spilling the contents onto the floor...
          
          Michelle's face.
          
          Max's eyes go wide.
          
          Another photograph of Michelle.
          
           nother.
          
          Shaking, Max's hands dig deeper...
          
          An impact sends CRACKS splitting up the length of the door...
          
          HOMICIDE OFFICE
          
          Two detectives throw their shoulders into the door. The rest
          crowd around them, foaming at the mouth to get inside to Max.
          
          One more lunge...
          
          The door SHATTERS, sending the detectives tumbling inside...
          
          ALEX'S OFFICE
          
          Photos and documents are scattered across the floor, over
          Alex's desk, mixed in with the fragments of the broken desk.
          
          From an open window, the storm's first flurries drift inside.
          
          Max is gone.
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          The snowfall has picked up, flurries giving way to thick
          heavy flakes already sticking to the sidewalk. Max leans
          into the stinging wind, lost in the night's revelations.
          
          Hax slows abruptly, looking back at the street behind him...
           eavy shadows pool around the alleys, doorways and swelling
          cars. The streetlights seem to carry less in the snow.
          
          A FIGURE walks down the opposite sidewalk. With heavy snow
          filling the space between them, it's hard to make out much...
          
          ...but there's something flowing out from the figure's back.
          
          
                                                                       
          
                       W
          
          
          
          
          T
          
          
          
          
                                                                      32.
                     
          
          
          Max turns back to the sidewalk ahead, jaw clenching...
          
          ALLEY
          
          Abruptly, Max's ducks into the mouth of alley. Back pressed
          to the cold brick, he draws his pistol and CHAMBERS a round.
          Unseen by Max, something moves in the shadows behind him...
          
           he street lamps begin to sputter. In the strobing light,
          long black shadows billow from the Figure's shoulders...
          
          Max backs away from the corner, deeper into the dark alley
          where three SHAPES are surging forward to meet him...
          
          Max dodges, but his pistol's KNOCKED to the pavement. Max
          stumbles, bringing up his guard. The Man charges again. Max
          sidesteps, grabbing an arm as he does, SNAPPING the bone...
          O
           ut on the street, the Man's SCREAMS mix with the howling
          wind. The Figure steps into the street, towards the alley...
          
          Max is jumped from all sides, opponents finally coordinating
          to overwhelm him. The Figure steps out of the wind...
          
          ...and what seemed to be wings turns out to be a long coat.
          Mona Sax moves closer, opening that coat to reveal a thick
          metal chain. Max GROWLS as arms pull him upright.
          
                                 MAX
                       Lose your dog?
          
          Mona whips the chain into Max's face, CLANKING as it strikes
          bone. Instantly, blood begins streaming from his mouth...
          
                                 MONA
                       We need to talk about my sister.
          
          The chain CRACKS again, Max's teeth rattling from the blow.
          
                                 MAX
                        hoever killed your sister did the same
                       thing to my partner--
                           (louder)
                       It was the same person.
          
                                  MONA
                       Yeah.   You.
          
          Mona HITS Max again, this time in the shins.    Max CRIES OUT.

                       So stupid...
          
          Slowly at first, Mona WHIRLS the chain into a larger loop...
          
                                 MONA
                       You left your wallet lying beside her
                       body. Who's stupid?
          M
           ax slumps to the side, spitting out a stream of blood...
          
                                 MAX
                       Does that sound like something a Homicide
                       cop would get wrong?
          
          Mona whips the chain faster, CUTTING the air...thinking...
          Gasping at the pain, Max slowly straightens up again.
          
                                 MAX
                       You know somebody named Owen?
          
          Mona lets the chain's speed gradually slow again.
          
                                 MONA
                       Owen Green?
          
                                 MAX
                       Natasha called him on her way out of my
                       apartment. Give me one day to--
          
          Mona drops the chain with a CLANK.
          
                                     ONA
                       No.   Now.
          
          She motions for her men to haul Max to his feet.
          
          INT. OWEN'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Mona and Max storm down a dim apartment hallway in tense
          silence. Max wipes the blood from the cuts on his face.
          
                                 MAX
                       Who is this guy?
          
          Mona lets her coat fall open, revealing a machine gun.
          
                                 MONA
                       Somebody my sister used to hang around
                       with. Nice kid.

                       You better hope he backs your story up.
          
                                 MAX
                       I have things I need to ask him, myself.
          
          Mona flashes Max a look before POUNDING on a door.
          
                                 MONA
                           (calling through the door)
                       Owen, open up.
          
          A louder, longer KNOCK.
          
                                 MONA
                       Open--
          
          A muted SCREAM filters through the door, cutting her short.
          Max DRIVES his boot into the door, splintering the jam...
          
          INT. OWEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Max and Mona rush into the room, breath smoking from the
          cold. All of the windows are open. Gusts of snow blow
          inside, drifts of white powder extending into the room...
          
                                 MAX
                           (calling out)
                       Owen?
          
          He SCREAMS his response from the next room.    They rush...
          
          LIVING ROOM
          
          ...through the door, weapons drawn.    Both stop short:
          
          OWEN GREEN is all alone in the room. SCREAMING, swatting at
          empty air around him, each limb moving a different direction.
          M
           ax lowers his pistol - ready for anything, not for this.
          
          Owen's feet slip over the snow, toes curling desperately on
          the ice, searching for traction as they slide closer...
          
                                 OWEN
                           (breathless, to no one)
                       Help me.
          
          ...to an open window on the other side of the room.
          
                                 MONA
                       Owen?

          He doesn't seem to hear - sweat streams down his terrified
          face, snowflakes frosting the perspiration on his chest.
          Owen's eyes are instead drawn through the open windows...
          
           ..where SILHOUETTES flicker against the storm-darkened sky.
          
          Oblivious to the shapes outside, Max and Mona watch Owen's
          terror intensify, his dervish dance growing more frantic...
          
          Outside every window, BLACK SHAPES float closer in the air
          above the street - vaguely human, long wings POUNDING...
          
          ...sending gusts of wind ripping through the windows, kicking
          up snow and ice. Max and Mona shrink back, shielding their
          eyes at the blast as Owen's tortured SCREAMS fill the room...
          
          Twisting like he's trying to pull free from invisible hands,
          Owen reaches the window. As if trying to push back, his
          hands and feet fly up to the trim around the window...
          
                                 MAX
                       Owen, wait...
          
          Unable to turn around, Owen's eyes find the reflected images
          of Max and Mona in the window he's being pulled to...
          H
           is attention is torn from their reflections on top of the
          glass by the spectres looming beyond it outside. Their claws
          reach in, raking his body, pulling him closer...
          
          Realizing that Owen isn't stopping, Max rushes towards him.
          
                                 OWEN
                           (screaming)
                       Make them stop, tell them I can't fly...
          
          Max lunges forward, trying in vain to cover yards...
          
          ...when Owen only has inches.    He's ripped into the void...
          
          EXT. OWEN'S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
          
          Max throws himself forward into the window, looking down...
          
          ...where Owen falls, looking up at Max helplessly...
          
          ... then less terrified, as the wind keeps RUSHING past...
          
          ...and then, just before impact, relieved.
          
          Owen CRASHES into the sidewalk.

          Mona races up to join Max in the window. For a stunned beat
          they look down at the shattered body of Owen Green - his
          unblinking eyes frozen on the heavens, collecting snowflakes.
          
                                 MONA
                           (shaken)
                       What did we just see?
          
          No answer, Max studies Owen's twisted body. Long, finger-
          like bruises trace out from his neck, blending with the
          tattoos that lace his grey skin. Grinning skulls, the USMC
          eagle/globe/anchor...
          
          ...and a pair of wings, just like Natasha's.
          I
           NT. TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT
          
          Max drops a Polaroid of Owen's tattoo onto a glass counter.
          
           lue water ripples through translucent pipes in the walls and
          floor, the air of the small room glowing like the ocean. A
          mirrored ceiling repeats the tattoo parlor again above.
          
                                 MAX
                       You're sure this is the place?
          
                                 MONA
                       Natasha had all her work done here.
          
          An elderly TATTOO ARTIST moves up behind the counter.
          
                                 ARTIST
                       Something I can help you with?
          
          Max slides the photograph across to the Tattoo Artist.
          
                                 MAX
                       What if I wanted this tattoo?
          
                                 TATTOO ARTIST
                       Then you're probably in the Marine Corps.
          
                                 MAX
                           (pointing to the wings)
                       This one.
          
          The Artist stoops closer, tensing when he sees the design.
          Mona leans over the counter, locking onto the Artist's eyes.
          
                                 MONA
                       What is it?

          As encouragement, Mona lets her coat open to reveal her gun.

                           (intimidated)
                       It's a Norse superstition. The Vikings
                       used to wear them for protection.
          
                                 MONA
                       Trust me, my sister had all the guardian
                       angels she needed.
          
                                 TATTOO ARTIST
                       Not angels. Valkyries.
          T
           he Artist goes to a shelf bulging with old books - his
          reference library. He searches through dusty volumes...
          
          Just past the shelves, a doorway is cracked open. A young
          APPRENTICE artist hovers in the dark and listens in on the
          conversation unnoticed - sweating, his pupils drawing back...
          
          Returning with a book, the Artist finds the page: a winged
          woman led by a pack of wolves over a grizzly battlefield.
          
                                  TATTOO ARTIST
                       In Norse mythology, the only way you get
                       to go to heaven is to die in violence.
                       Die in your sleep, you go to hell.
                       Valkyries fly over the battlefields,
                       picking out the righteous dead. They
                       reward the people who draw first blood.
                           (beat)
                       A soldier's angel.
          
          Nodding, Mona lets her gun drift away from the Artist.
          
                                 TATTOO ARTIST
                       I'm generally thrilled to have referral
                       business, but I tell people looking for
                       those wings to find ink closer to home.
          
                                 MONA
                       Where's home?
          
                                 TATTOO ARTIST
                       Some club down in Alphabet City.
          
          Mona turns to leave, satisfied, but Max is stuck on the book -
          the valkyrie's empty eyes, bloody bodies at her feet...
          
                                 MAX
                       Protection from what?

                      (2)
          
          
          Suddenly, all the lights go out.
          T
           he pipes stop glowing, blackness replacing the blue lights.
          
          Out of the corner of his eye, Max sees a DARKER SHADOW race
          across the room towards them, almost too fast to be human...
          
          Max and Mona have time to duck; the Artist isn't so lucky. A
          CRACK of bone, the old man's skull taking the brutal force...
          
          Mona's weapon BARKS, a short burst RIPPING through the air.
          
           n the momentary fire, Max can see the Shape swinging a club.
          The bat CUTS through the air, SMASHING open glass pipes in
          the wall behind Max, the shards raining down over him...
          
          The Figure charges at Max again.   Max's pistol CRACKS.
          
          The room is abruptly silent.
          
          The lights flash on.   Mona steps out of the back room...
          
          Max is stunned to find himself standing over nothing more
          monstrous than the Apprentice - one hand over the hole in his
          chest, the other weakly swinging a shard of glass at Max.
                               A
                               PPRENTICE
                        (gurgling, to Max)
                    They see you...they see you...
          
                              MONA
                    Do you know this guy?
          
          Max shakes his head, struck mute by the look in the dying
          man's eyes.
          
          INT. MAX'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Max pushes the car over slick streets, clothes covered in the
          Artist's blood. Lost in thought, Mona looks out the window.
          
                              MONA
                        (without conviction)
                    Maybe it isn't anything new.   People get
                    strung out, act crazy...
          
                              MAX
                    You think they were both on something?

                       Crystal meth, maybe, some amphetamine
                       that raises your body temperature in an
                       overdose. Explains why they were both
                       sweating like that, trying to cool off.
                           (beat)
                       Of course, a junky won't usually jump out
                       the window if there's someone left in the
                       room to beg or rob.
          
           ax nods his agreement, replaying Owen's death in his mind.
          
                                 MAX
                       You were standing right beside me.
          
                                    MONA
                       And?
          
                                 MAX
                       Jumped is not the word I'd use.
          
          
          EXT. RAGNA ROK - DUSK
          
          In a block of abandoned storefronts, only one retains a spark
          of life, its red sign burning in the dying light: RAGNA ROK.
          T
           he streets are more crowded there, people shuffling towards
          that sign and the sounds of DARK MUSIC filtering from inside.
          
          INT. MAX'S CAR - DUSK
          
          Max's car turns onto the block, slowly approaching Ragna Rok.
          Max and Mona silently absorb the scene on the street. Even
          from halfway down the block, BASS from the club reaches them.
          
                                 MONA
                       They all look...
          
          Across the street, Max watches someone dragging a limp body
          by one leg. Nobody he walks past seems to notice.
          
                                    MAX
                       Like Owen.
          
          Max keeps his speed slow, idling away up the block.
          
                                 MAX
                       This isn't anything I've seen before.

          Ragna Rok recedes in the mirror, the block between it and the
          car studded with more smoldering cars and dead-eye faces,
          their numbers seeming to grow even as Mona watches.
          
                                  ONA (CONT'D)
                       You ever been to Rome?
          
          Max doesn't answer, the coming plague before him registering.
          Mona glances up at a passing street sign - "LITTLE ITALY."
          
                                 MONA (CONT'D)
                       Better cities than this one have fallen.
                           (pointing to the curb)
                       This is far enough.
          
          Mona opens her car door and climbs out, leaning back inside.
          
                                 MONA (CONT'D)
                       Sorry about the chain.
          
          Mona SLAMS the door and moves off down the sidewalk, blending
          into the crowd. Max drops the car into gear, giving one last
          glance to Ragna Rok before pulling away.
          T
           here's some flicker of movement on the rooftop...
          
          U
          EXT. RAGNA ROK - ROOFTOP - DUSK
          
           p on the roof, MUSIC inside the club RATTLES old pipes.
          Perched at the edge of the roof, a figure CHANTS along...
          
          Jack Lupino - the tattooed face we caught   a glimpse of in the
          candle light of Trevor's party, now fully   visible in the
          failing sun and no less frightening. His    colorless eyes
          absorb the street, the SCREAMS, Max's car   pulling away...
          
          On his back, the tattoos of two elaborate black wings. Steam
          rises from ink-blackened skin, snow melting before it lands.
          
          INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Max sits in his chair in the silent room, turning the pages
          of Michelle's book. There's more than grief on his cut and
          bruised face tonight, hands not trembling the way they were.
          
          Fruit bowls, delicate charcoal nudes flip past...
          
          Frustrated, Max lets the images drift by with less sentiment:
          images no longer speaking to the questions he needs answered.
          With an exasperated sigh, Max slams the book closed...
          
          A faint white sliver appears in the cover.
          
                                                                             
          
          T
          
          
          
          
                                                                    41.
                     
          
          
          Max leans closer. It's the corner of a piece of paper,
          protruding from a razor-thin cut in the spine of the
          sketchbook, invisible under all but the closest inspection.
          
          Max runs his thumbnail into the gap, spreading glue CRACKLING
          - he flinches, almost afraid to cause the book pain.
          F
           or a moment, Max is caught between his desire to protect the
          memento and to see what's hidden inside. A deep breath...
          
          With a sharp pull, the cover of the book SHEARS away.
          
          The pages wad and wrinkle, old paint flaking off. The cover
          he'd caressed RIPS. Fluttering to the floor, a sheaf of
          yellowed pages hidden in the cover flutter to the floor.
          
          Max opens the folded pages. The first is nearly identical to
          what we saw inside: a bouquet of flowers, unfinished. Max
          scrutinizes the pencil strokes...suddenly, his eyes go wide:
          
          A little pair of bat-like wings. In the corner of the page,
          having nothing to do with the rest of the still life.
          
          Max turns to the next page. There's a another drawing of
          wings - larger this time, pencil strokes more energetic.
          
          Horrified by what he's seeing, Max's hands tremble as they
          turn the page. On the next, the wings are the main drawing.
          
          On the next, they're scrawled in smeared ink.
          
                                 MAX
                           (nauseous, to himself)
                       No...
          
          The wings begin to lose their shape, overlapping.
          
          Growing together.
          
          The last page is completely black.
          
          INT. COP BAR - NIGHT
          
          Even with everybody out of uniform, the builds and body
          language mark this as a cop bar. BB rushes inside, hair
          giving him away as having been asleep shortly before.
          
           he bar is still decorated with plastic mistletoe and fake
          snow. BB looks at the BARTENDER, who motions to the back...
          
                                                                       42.
          
          
          
          BACK BOOTH
          
          BB fights his way to a corner booth, where Max is slumped
          over a beer and a shot. A matching set wait for BB across
          the table. BB pulls off his coat and sits, forced casual.
          
                                  BB
                       It was sitting at this very table that
                       your father told me I needed to retire.
                           (beat)
                       For about a minute, I just sat here
                       thinking about knocking him out of his
                       chair. The job was everything to me, to
                       the point that I couldn't see the writing
                       on the wall - what it was doing to my
                       marriage, my health. Your old man knew
                       if I was going to listen to reason, it
          B            could only happen in here.
          
           B stoops down to find Max's eyes, trying for a connection.
          
                                 BB
                       There's nothing you can't say in here.
                       It's like hallowed ground.
          
          For a long beat, Max works up the nerve to speak.
          
                                 MAX
                       I watched a guy throw himself out of a
                       window tonight. The things he was saying-
          
                                 BB
                       Any guy who throws himself out a window,
                       I wouldn't pay any attention to the
                       things he said.
          
                                 MAX
                       The problem is, I knew what he was
                       talking about.
          
          BB tries to nod his understanding, but concern creeps in.
          
                                 MAX
                       I haven't been really afraid of anything
                       since...that night.
          
                                 BB
                       And you are now?
          
                                 MAX
                       There's something going on, and I can't
                       find a rational explanation for it.

                       There's...something out there, hurting
                       people--
          
                                 BB
                       Okay, calm down.
          
                                    MAX
                       It's real.     I'm not crazy.
          
                                 BB
                       Then stop acting like it. Max, you're
                       breaking into offices, I.A. is all over
                       you, you won't even show up for work...
          
                                 MAX
                       The night Alex died, there was something
                       else in the room with us. I saw it.
          
                               B
           B goes a bit pale, smile fading as Max's words continue.
          
                                  B
                       It's really important that you be careful
                       how you talk to people about this, okay?
                       You're already under suspicion--
          
                                 MAX
                       It's the same thing these people are
                       seeing right before they die.
                           (beat, pained)
                       I think Michelle saw it, too.
          
                                 BB
                       For God's sake, don't drag her into this.
          
           ax stands up, storming towards the exit. BB pulls out a
          thick money clip and overpays before following...
          
          EXT. COP BAR - NIGHT
          
          BB rushes out, struggling to keep up with Max's longer legs.
          
                                 BB
                       What's really going on here?
          
                                 MAX
                       Alex found something out about what
                       happened to her. Something new.
          
                                  B
                       There's no way.    He would have told us.
          
                                 MAX
                       He was trying, right before he died...

                       Listen, okay? Why don't you come back
                       with me, let Beth make up the guest room
                       for you. Just for tonight.
          
          Max nods, but keeps moving away from BB.
          
                                 BB
                       You need to take some time. Get some
                       sleep, heal up. See if it still feels
                       real after that...
          
                                    MAX
                       It's real.
          
          Max crosses against the light, cutting through the driving
          snow. BB tries to follow, but traffic pushes him back.
          H
           elpless, BB can only bury his hands in his pockets and watch
          Max fade away. After a moment, he pulls something out...
          
          A business card: `J. BRAVURA, I.A.'
          
          EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT
          
          In a ticket booth, an elderly ATTENDANT shivers by a space
          heater, ticket windows plugged with make-shift insulation.
          
          The attendant looks up from his book and sees Max approaching
          through the snow. Max slows as he gets closer, looking up at
          the glowing threshold to the trains beyond. He stops.
          
                                 ATTENDANT
                           (via intercom)
                       You riding?
          
          Max holds for a moment. For all the danger he's faced, this
          is the most hesitation we've seen from him so far.
          
                                 ATTENDANT
                            via intercom)
                       If you're coming, you better come on.
                       Way it's looking, might be the last train
                       tonight.
          
          Max takes a step into the light of the ticket booth. The
          attendant opens the ticket slot, letting a gust of freezing
          air blow inside. Max slides a few bills through.
          
          Ticket in hand, Max starts his solitary march to the trains.

          INT. GOGNITTI'S HOTEL - BAR - NIGHT
          A
            dingy, dark bar on the first floor of an even sleazier
          hotel. It's nearly empty, only the dedicated DRUNKS
          venturing out in the storm. The front door swings open...
          
          The old men shiver at the stiff blast of wind rushing in,
          turning to look. Napkins flutter. Snowflakes blow inside.
          
          From a booth in the corner, VINNIE GOGNITTI (50s, pudgy)
          shoots a hard look at the open door, not immediately
          recognizing the SILHOUETTE in the passage...
          
                              VINNIE
                    In or out, asshole.
          
          Mona steps inside, boots heavy with ice. Her MEN follow.
          Flanked by MEN of his own, Vinnie freezes when he sees Mona.
          
                                 VINNIE (CONT'D)
                    So?
          
                               MONA
                    We need to talk.
                        (beat)
                    Talk.
          
          Gradually, Vinnie and his men relax.
          
                               VINNIE
                    Shut the door, then. You Ruskies may be
                    used to it, but I'm freezing my dick off
                    over here.
          
          BACK OFFICE
          
          They've packed into a tiny back office - Russian gunmen on
          one side of the desk, Italians on the other. Mona and Vinnie
          represent their different sides, the only people seated.
          
                                 VINNIE
                    Okay.     So talk.
          
                              MONA
                    Something was taken from me. It involves
                    a club in Italian territory, so I need
                    your blessing to go make it right.

          Mona looks Vinnie over, bored to death by the whole thing.
          
                                 MONA
                       I said `blessing.'
          
                                 VINNIE
                       Oh. Well, blessing might cost extra.
                       Which club are we talking about?
          
                                    MONA
                       Ragna Rok.
          
           innie tries to keep a poker face, but the name chills him.
          
                                 MONA (CONT'D)
                       Over on Avenue--
          
                                 VINNIE
                       Yeah, I know.
                           (beat, rattled)
                       Sure, fine. You have my
                       permission...blessing, whatever.
          
          Mona frowns, her wishes granted a little too easily.
          
                                 MONA
                       You do still control that block, right?
                       It's south of--
          
                                 VINNIE
                       The guy's name is Jack Lupino.
          
                                 MONA
                       Well, that sounds Italian to me.
          
                                 VINNIE
                       He's no kind of Italian I've ever seen.
                       Tattooed freak, a real sicko from what we
                       hear.

                                 VINNIE
                       When the club first opened, I sent
                       somebody down to collect the...you know,
                       fire insurance. A day goes by, and I
                       don't see him. Then I get two boxes
                       delivered to me. One box's got my guy's
                       hands and ears in it. The other box has
                       a quarter of a million dollars in cash.

                      This neighborhood has been your family's
                      forever. Two-fifty large is all it takes
                      to--
          
                                 VINNIE
                      What got my attention, Mona, was that the
                      boxes were delivered by a cop car. A guy
                      in uniform hands them to me in broad
                      daylight.
                          (beat)
                      I'm not scared of tattoos, or freaks, or
                      mouthy Russian bitches. But whoever's
                      watching over Lupino, whoever it is you
                      really need to bless you walking inside
                      Ragna Rok...him, I am scared of.
          
          EXT. SUBURBAN TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
          
          The platform is cleaner than the ones in the city - dressed
          up for the tastes of the COMMUTERS who step off of the train.
          
          Max threads his way through the handful of exhausted
          BUSINESSMEN arriving home, moving out into the darkness.
          
          EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
          
          The snow's driving just as hard out here, but peaceful houses
          with warm windows glowing make the storm feel comforting. In
          the yards, forgotten sleds disappear under new powder, gone
          for good by morning. Snowmen distort as they swell.
          
          Max Payne trudges up the center of the street, a black streak
          spoiling the peace of the evening. A trespasser.
          T
           HE HOUSE
          
          One house on the block stands out: there's no neatly shoveled
          driveway, no colorful Christmas lights flashing from the
          eaves. A black void behind every window, no life inside.
          
           ax stands in the street, looking up at the house.
          
                                BB (V.O.)
                      She was thirty-five. The daughter, two
                      months. From what we could tell, it
                      started out as a robbery.
          
           XT. HOUSE - BACK YARD
          
          A row of footprints lead around back.

                                 BB (V.O.)
                        oth of the men had records, mostly
                       bullshit - possession, petty theft.
          
          Hanging in the overgrown hedges, an overlooked scrap of
          yellow police tape shimmers in the wind.
          
                                 BB (V.O.)
                        ut that day...I don't know. They had
                       something else on their minds.
          
          Max stands at the back door. He touches the unpainted wood
          around the glass, repairs never fully complete.
          
                                 BB (V.O.)
                        ax was maybe ten minutes late.
          
          Max reaches for the handle...hesitant to actually touch...
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)
          
          A living room in the stillness of evening, golden air packed
          like amber around baby bottles and toys on the coffee table.
          The front door opens, and a man steps inside...
          
          Max Payne, different in every way: the malnourishment and
          neglect gone from his face, a fullness in his frame from
          M
          regular home-cooked meals. Shave and a haircut. Nice suit.
          
           ax picks up the mail from the floor and strolls inside...
          
          KITCHEN
          
          Tie loosened, Max gets a beer from the fridge. Unwinding, he
          takes a long sip and begins sorting through the mail.
          
           lancing up from the mail, Max sees the kitchen door...
          
          Glass smashed.    Blinds torn.   Standing open.
          
          STAIRWAY
          
          Max charges upstairs.    MEN'S VOICES echo down from above.
          
                                 MAX
                           (calling out)
                       Michelle!
          
          His eyes aren't hard yet. Rushing up the stairs, we see
          Max's faith in the world start to crack for the first time...
          
                        (
          
          
          
          
                                                                    49.
          
          
          
          HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Max turns the corner into a hallway bathed in golden
          afternoon light, the same one he saw in the river...
          
          Between Max and the end of the hall, two JUNKIES are huddled
          against a door. Twisting the handle, SMACKING the wood.
          
          Max pulls a pistol from a low-pro holster, stepping forward.
          
                              MAX
                        (calling out)
                    Michelle?
          
          The Junkies turn to Max, eyes black and glassy.    Sick smiles.
          
                              MAX
                         shouting to the door)
                    Michelle, I'm right here...
          
          Without a word, the Junkies charge.
          
          Max takes aim and BLASTS one of them in the forehead. The
          M
          other keeps rushing, swinging a long knife at Max's neck.
          
           ax ducks, a quarter-second and a quarter-inch from a slit
          throat. The swing throws the thin man off balance...
          
          He tries again - ropy muscles straining skin speckled with
          tracks. Max grabs his arm, throwing the thin man off
          balance. They go down to the hardwood floor together.
          
          Too close to line up a shot, Max drives the butt of the
          pistol into the man's nose, SPLITTING it across the bridge.
          Blood spatters his gaunt face, but those eyes never change...
          
                                 JUNKIE
                    It's okay.     They're angels, now.
          
          Straining, he moves the knife's tip closer to Max's belly...
          
          Max jams the barrel under the Junkie's leering jaw and PULLS
          THE TRIGGER. Blood atomizes into a hanging cloud around him.
          
          Max jumps up and races to the door.    Locked from the inside.
          
                              MAX
                        (calling, frantic)
                    Michelle!
          
          Max throws his shoulder into the door, SNAPPING the hinges...
          
                                 B

                                                                      50.
          
          
          
          BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          The momentum sends Max tumbling inside...
          
          A MAN slips out of the window, one leg still inside...
          
           ax OPENS FIRE at the retreating shape.
          
          Curtains billow in front of the open window, a summer sunset
          outside. Max lets the gun fall to his side, breathing hard.
          M
           ichelle huddles on the bed, baby wrapped tight in her arms.
          Max rushes over to her, reaching out to touch her shoulder.
          
                              MAX
                    Michelle...
          
          Her mouth is wide open, eyes unfocused.    Muscles slack.
          
          Michelle's not stunned.    She's not unconscious.
          
           he baby isn't just sleeping.
          
          The moment that hits him, the lights go out of Max's eyes.
          
                                                                UT TO:
          
          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Max stands at the door, seeing the room with those same eyes.
          
          The furniture is gone, all the carpet ripped out. One window
          is still open, no frilly curtains blocking the blackness
          outside. Snow gusts in, piling on the sill.
          
                              BB (V.O.)
                    We looked everywhere for the third guy,
                    but there was nothing to go on. Not a
                    hair of him left behind.
          
          Slowly marching across the room, Max SLAMS the window shut.
          
          INT. ASGARD BUILDING - BB'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          BB stands in the window, watching the storm.
          
                               B
                    I called in a favor before I retired, had
                    him transferred to Cold Case while he
                    dealt with the shock of it. I thought it
                    we were patient, gave him time, Max would
                    come back to his old self again.
          
                                                                         
          
                                                                      51.
                     
          
          
          Bravura sits in front of the desk, watching BB. When BB
          finally looks over, the weight of the story showing in his
          eyes, Bravura's face B
                               doesn't reveal any hint of emotion.
          
                                  B
                       Look, I called you because I thought I
                       recognized something in you. I thought
                       if we could talk off the record--
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       I'm listening.
          
                                 BB
                           (emotional)
                       This isn't just some job stress freak-
                       out. This is a man who lost everything,
                       and who deserves a little understanding
                       from the rest of us. If you'd known him
                       before...
                           (beat, pained)
                       You'd want to believe him, too.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       Believe him about what?
          
          Not expecting this turn in the conversation, Bravura sits up.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       Are you saying you think Max did have
                       something to do with Alex's murder?
          
                                 BB
                       Absolutely not. Alex was his partner,
                       they were like brothers...he couldn't
                       have. There's no way.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       Then what are we talking about?
          
                                 BB
                       Look, Max is like a son to me. Don't put
                       me in a position to have to hang him.
                           (beat, pained)
                       But you should hear the kinds of things
                       he's saying...hallucinations, none of it
                       makes any sense to me. I'm worried he's
                       going to get into another situation
                       before I can convince him to come in.
                                 B
                                  RAVURA
                       Are you telling me he was--

                               B
          
          
          
          
                               B
          
          
          
          
                                                                    52.
                      (2)
          
          
                              BB
                    I'm telling you to find him tonight,
                    before somebody else gets hurt.
          
          Bravura nods, reeling from the revelation of this new
          information. BB picks up his coat and starts for the door.
          
                              BB
                    Is there anything we can do to help you
                    bring him in? Unofficially, of course...
          
                              BRAVURA
                    Bringing him in won't be a problem.
                    Where I need your help will be his--
          
                               B
                    Why do you say that?
          
          Bravura stands, finishing a note.
          
                               RAVURA
                    A New Jersey unit ID'd him near his old
                    house. It shouldn't be long.
          
           B nods, somberly mulling this over.
          
                              BB
                    You have to find him first, protect him.
                    Some of the guys from Alex's unit beat
                    you to him, they won't wait for a trial.
          
          EXT. STORAGE SPACE - NIGHT
          
          At the edge of a strip mall, a ramshackle personal storage
          business sits behind a razor-wire fence. Inside the fence,
          rows of stalls for rent, covered by metal garage doors.
          
           here's the faint sound of METAL STRETCHING, and Max is over
          the fence. He moves through the rows, reading the numbers.
          
          A padlock hangs from the door, shining metal glazed over with
          a sheet of ice. Max finds a pristine key on a ring in his
          pocket. Hands shaking, he cracks the ice and tries...

          The garage door raises, cold metal RATTLING as it rolls up.
          
          Max stands silhouetted in the doorway, looking in on ragged
          stacks of cardboard boxes. His breath blooming around him.

          Max steps inside, pulling a box marked `GARAGE' out into the
          light. Opening it, he roots around and finds a flashlight.
          Switched on, a golden beam cuts through the blue shadows.
          
          Max walks deeper into the space, brushing the light over the
          boxes. He holds his hand over one, as if warming it...
          
          Max opens the box.
          
           aiting for him under the flaps, a stuffed animal stares up
          at Max from inside the box. Silly grin, frozen eyes shining.
          
          Hands trembling, Max pushes the toy aside. Deeper in the
          box, he finds a framed picture and pulls it into the light...
          
          The photograph is of Max - younger, cleaner, genuinely
          smiling. Posed along with him, Olan Mills-style, are
          Elizabeth and the baby. Gauzy backdrop, church clothes.
          
          Max studies it, haggard new face reflecting in the glass...
          
          Abruptly, Max jumps up and moves away from the box. Long
          strides, trying in vain to physically shake the memories, to
          block out the emotions with something productive...
          
          The flashlight beam keeps sweeping, deeper and deeper. Max
          chokes back tears, occasionally glancing at the baby box.
          
           he beam hits on a document box in the back row.   `OFFICE.'
          
          Max rushes over, nearly tipping the other boxes in his hurry
          to throw the lid off the document box. Rows of folders, all
          M
          neatly labeled with feminine script.
          
           ax brushes his fingers over the tabs, smiling sadly.    Each
          year numbered -- `1998,' `1999,' `2000'...
          
                                 MAX
                           (to himself)
                       Okay, Chelle. Help me, here...
          
          Max's fingers skim to the last file in the box, marked
          `2004.' Much thinner than the others. Her last year.
          
          Only one file in the final section. Max opens it, finding
          pages of handwritten notes, photocopies, drawings...
          
          Closing the file, he checks the name on the tab and frowns.

          EXT. STORAGE SPACE - NIGHT
          
          Max steps out of the storage locker. He tucks the manila
          folder inside his coat and pulls the metal door closed.
          
          He starts away, retracing his steps to the fence. Mind
          reeling with what he's just seen, the memories flooding back--
          
          There's a second set of footprints in the snow before him.
          
          Max freezes, their significance immediately registering.
          
                               OICE (O.S.)
                    Stay where you are!
          
          A YOUNG COP steps out of the shadows behind Max, pistol
          trained on the back of his head. The cop's eyes are wide
                               M
          with panic. He assumes an awkward, textbook firing position.
          
                               AX
                        (turning slowly)

                              YOUNG COP
                    Don't move! I know who you are.
          
           he gun stays trained on Max.    Slowly, he raises his hands.
          
                              MAX
                    Just relax. I need you to trust me for a
                    minute...
          
                             YOUNG COP
                    Yeah? Is that what you said to your
                    partner?
          
                              MAX
                    You don't understand.
          
                              YOUNG COP
                        (gesturing with the gun)
                    Lay down on your face.
          
          Max studies the cop - stiff legs unsteady on the deep snow,
          his frostbitten fingers wrapped around the trigger. Trapped
          between two rows of locked doors, Max has no cover to run.
          
          Peeking through the snow at Max's feet, an extension cord
          snakes under the shivering cop's legs and down the corridor.

                                 MAX
                           (bending down)
                       Okay, just take it easy.
          
          Max starts to lay down, causally laying his hand over the
          power cord. The cop edges closer, smirking as Max complies.
          
                                 YOUNG COP
                       Word's gotten around about the sick shit
                       you did to him, too. If I were you, I'd
                       get ready for sort of a long ride back
                       into the city...
          
          Max wraps his hand around the cord and whips it tight...
          
          The cop pitches backward, squeezing off a SHOT as he falls.
          Before he can fire again, Max pounces on the cop, driving a
          T
          knee into his chest and wrenching the pistol away.
          
           he cop twists in the extension cord, unplugging the lights.
          Max DRIVES the butt of the pistol into the side of his head.
          
           he cop goes limp. Max pulls the clip, clears the chamber
          and lets the gun fall in the snow beside the unconscious cop.
          
          Struggling to his feet, Max races down the corridor and
          scaling the icy chain link. He drops into the snow,
          immediately breaking into a dead run on the other side.
          
          INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
          
          An express elevator HISSES upwards at great speed, the sleek
          interior like a European sports car. Alone inside, Jason
          Colvin watches the blur of numbers with dread.
          
          A muted CHIME, and the doors draw back...
          
          INT. AESIR SKYSCRAPER - PENTHOUSE OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Thin steel beams loft through the air, three stories of open
          air encased by glass, a silent void projected into the heart
          of the storm. In the center of the room, a single black bar.
          
          It's a desk, obsidian, polished to a mirrored sheen. Aesir
          International's cool blue logo reflects across its surface.
          
          Jason Colvin approaches the desk, nervously watching the
          shadowed figure of Nicole Horne read through a document.
          Every hair, every stitch of clothing perfect.

           icole cuts her eyes to Colvin - withering, a current of fear
          passing through him. With great effort, she smiles.
          
          INT. TRAIN - NIGHT
          
          Max slumps in his seat, watching the black sky whip past.
          The manila folder closed in his hands, fingers tracing the
          edges. Slowly, carefully, he lets the folder fall open.
          
          Max's eyes skim across the handwritten notes, lingering over
          underscored phrases and circled words. Drinking it in.
          
          On the next page, a sketch of black wings pulls Max's
          attention. With dread, he reads a note below the drawing:
          
           SUBJECTS DESCRIBE DEMONIC VISIONS, HYSTERICAL RAGE...'
          
                                 MAX
                           (to himself)
                       Subjects?
          
          The hypnotic motion of the train begins to change, the rhythm
          of the RAILS faltering a little.
          
           ax turns the page. More wings, each in a slightly different
          style, each version surrounded by descriptive notes...
          
          Max skims, excited, as the train's HICCUPS grow worse...
          
          As the blue and black world sweeps past outside the window,
          Max's face softens almost into a smile...
          
          All the lights go out.    The train rapidly loses speed...
          S
           tartled voices MURMUR. Windows that had been black glow to
          life as the passengers' eyes adjust to the dark car...
          
           utside, the moonless night becomes a hazy expanse of blue
          snow, covering the embankments along the railroad tracks and
          the broken-down houses in the distance.
          
          The darkness changes Max, too, hardening his face again. He
          tucks the folder safely into his coat and zips it up tight.
          
          At the front of the car, the windows begin to fill with
          light. The door opens, a flashlight beam sweeps inside...
          
          Pistol between his knees, Max pulls the hammer back...

          An obese CONDUCTOR (40s) steps inside. Immediately, all of
          the other passengers begin to QUESTION HIM at once.
          
                                 CONDUCTOR
                           (shouting over)
                       Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm.
                       The storm's caused a power failure, but
                       it's absolutely nothing to worry about.
                       We'll be up and running again before
                       long.
          
          Movement outside catches Max's eye. A FIGURE in the shadows
          alongside the train. Gravel CRUNCHES. Voices WHISPER.
          
                                 CONDUCTOR (cont'd)
                       Our policy is to move everyone up to the
                       front car until the lights come on again.
                       It'll be a little warmer if we're all
                       together...
          M
           ax splits his attention between the other passengers and the
          window, watching for more movement outside...
          
          Suddenly, the Figure breaks in the opposite direction - no
          attempt at quiet, a POUNDING run away from the train.
          
           onfused, Max straightens up.    The temperature has changed...
          
          THREE MORE FIGURES, running in the opposite direction.    Away
          from the train, up the snowy tracks it's yet to cross.

                       Get out of the train.
          
          PASSENGERS fill the aisle. High school girls sneaking into
          the city... An old man going to work... Drunk yuppies in red
          and green scarves, on their way back from a Holiday party...

                           (shouting)
                       Get out--
          
          An EXPLOSION rips through the front of the car and swells, a
          ball of fire smashing through the car and blowing it apart...
          
          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
          
          Up and down the dark street, shadowed GHOULS break windows
          and claw at abandoned cars, searching for anything of value.

          Moving comfortably through the shadows, Mona follows the
          general movement towards a BASSY QUAKE farther up the block.
          
          A red neon `RAGNA ROK' bloodies the snow in the air, marking
          the entrance to the club responsible for the RUMBLE...

           NT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT
          
          Inside, that music is EARSPLITTING - a jet engine at 200
          beats per minute. Lights strobe past red gels, frozen
          glimpses of thin limbs and black pupils on the dance floor.
          
           ona melts into a corner, inconspicuously watching the room.
          
           inding around the dance floor, CLUBGOERS - some ragged, some
          in nice clothes - queue at a metal door in the back wall.
          One after another, they wait for their moment to enter...
          
          There's a disturbance at the front door. Black-clad Guards
          force open a rift in the crowd on the dance floor...
          
          Jack Lupino walks inside the rift - his tattooed face red and
          black, eyes calmly sweeping out across the riotous crowd...
          
           ROM THE DANCEFLOOR
          
          Lupino moves through bodies roiling like a parted sea, sheer
          walls of twisting flesh towering above him to the rafters.
          
          Mixed within, the wings POUND and SWEEP, blotting the light.
          
          Hell.
          
          INT. BB'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          BB crawls out from under the quilts, careful not to wake his
          WIFE. He passes windows frosted with ice, on his way to...
          
          HALLWAY
          
          BB shuffles down the hall, shivering in his boxers. He
          pauses at the thermostat, frowning to find the heat cut off.
          B
           B turns, startling as Max steps out of the shadows - steps
          stiff with pain, clothes dripping icy water across the floor.
          
                                 BB
                           (terrified)
                       Max? What are you doing?
          
          Max opens his coat and pulls out the file, now badly wrinkled
          and soggy. He opens it and hands BB a newspaper clipping.

                                 BB
                       Those grunts who went crazy in Iraq?
          
                                  AX
                       Go a little further, read what they did
                       to the bodies. It's the same as what
                       happened to Alex and that girl.
          
          BB reads on, frowning.
          
                                  B
                       Where did you get this?
          
                                   MAX
                       Michelle.
          
          BB looks up, startled, as Max pages through Michelle's notes.
          
                                  MAX
                       It's all in her notes: people describing
                       fevers, hallucinations...their lymph
                       nodes swell until their necks bruise like
                       something's been choking them.
                           (pointing to the drawings)
                       The angels they all talk about? Michelle
                       talks about eye spasms that make things
                       seem to flutter. Mixed with the other
                       delusions, that starts looking like
                       wings...
                           (beat)
                       She wasn't seeing them. She was trying
                       to figure out why other people were.
                                  B
                                  B
                         thought she was working on allergy
                       medicines.
          
                                  AX
                       Somebody at Aesir knows what--
          
                                 BB
                           (thunderstruck)
                       Oh, my God.
          
          Slowly, BB turns to show Max the grief in his eyes.
          
                                   BB
                       It's me.    I killed Alex.

                                                                   60.
                      (2)
          
          
                              MAX
                    What are you talking about?
          
                              BB
                    He came to me about six months ago,
                    asking about one of the executives at
                    Aesir. At the time I had no reason to
                    connect it to Michelle, I just thought...
                        (beat, torn up)
                    I tried to warn him, this guy has
                    connections to some scary people--
          
                               MAX
                    Who?   What's his name?
          
          BB hesitates, rattled by the rage in Max's eyes.
          
                               BB
                    Jason Colvin. He used to be the head of
                    the pharmaceutical division, but he's
                    moved up over the last few years.
                        (beat)
                    I guess Michelle probably reported
                    directly to him...
          
          Max barely nods, jaw clenched as he scoops up the documents.
          
                              BB
                     ou've got copies of this stuff, right?
          
          Thinking for a moment, Max sets the folder down again and
          turns away towards the dark hallway. BB picks up the folder.
          
                              BB
                     e careful, Max.
          
          Max doesn't respond, storming off into the shadows.
          
          EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - DAWN
          
          The snow isn't deep near the charred and twisted metal of the
          train, melted by the fireball. Police tape rings the area.
          D
           ETECTIVES wander between yellow tarps in the train, sipping
          coffee. Out on the tracks, Bravura works alone.
          
                              HOMICIDE COP
                    Looks like ten bodies, give or take.
                    Even in New York, that ought to be enough
                    to earn Payne the spike.

                                                                       61.
                     
          
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       The blast point is outside the train.
          
          None of the detectives want to encourage him by answering.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                        ased on the spread of the wreckage...
                       they moving very fast, either.
          
                                 HOMICIDE COP
                       He forced them to stop, first.
          
          Bravura nods at the explanation, but without conviction.       He
          continues to scan the wreckage, still not satisfied...
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       So he had the bomb with him inside, but
                       he decided to walk outside to detonate
                       it?
          
                                 HOMICIDE COP
                       Are you asking if that seems like odd
                       behavior from a guy who cut his partner's
                       head off?
          
          The Young Cop from the storage building slips down the snowy
          bank and towards Bravura. His face is bruised and swollen.
          
                                  OUNG COP
                       You wanted to see me?
          
                                 HOMICIDE COP
                       Careful what you say to him, if you ever
                       want to make detective...
          
                                 YOUNG COP
                           (to Bravura, guarded)
                       I already filled out a report.
          
          Bravura sees the Young Cop aware of the detective's presence.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       Show me where it happened, then.
          E
           XT. STORAGE FACILITY - MORNING
          
          Bravura and the Young Cop stand on the spot where he fought
          Max the night before - disturbed snow, the frayed cord...
          
                                 YOUNG COP
                       He jumped out and wrapped that cord
                       around me, and before I had a chance...
          
                                                                             
          
                       I

          Bravura nods at the bullshit, focus drawn to Max's locker.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                           (pointing)
                       He was coming out of here?
          
          When the Young Cop nods, Bravura starts to step inside.
          
                                 HOMICIDE COP
                       Hey, real cops are working here...
          
          INT. MAX'S STORAGE LOCKER - MORNING
          
          A few CSI TECHS take photographs of Max's storage locker.
          Bravura walks through, eyes quickly scanning the distracting
          jumble of boxes. The Homicide Cop follows, exasperated.
          
           t the back, Bravura stops and picks something up. It's the
          lid of the box, `OFFICE' written in Michelle's pen.
          
          Bravura looks around. There's no document box to match the
          lid. However, there are dust-free rectangles in the dirt.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                           (to a CSI tech)
                       Where's the stuff you guys moved?
          
                                 CSI TECH
                       Nothing's been moved.
          
                                 HOMICIDE COP
                       What, you playing detective now?
          
          On a mission, Bravura scans the rest of the room. He sees
          another open box, a colorful stuffed animal peeking out.
          Bravura opens it, startled by the family portrait.
                               B
                                  RAVURA
                           (studying the photo)
                       This is his wife?
          
          Bravura finally looks up to see the Homicide cop smirking.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                         spent four hours up at Homicide going
                       through Alex's desk and cataloging
                       pictures of this woman, and not one of
                       you bastards bothered to mention that she
                       was Max Payne's wife?
          
          
          
          
                                                                          
          
                                                                        63.
                     
          
          
                                  HOMICIDE COP
                           (shrugging)
                       If Alex was getting a little something on
                       the side--
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       Who are you protecting?
          
          Bravura charges closer, carrying enough force that the much
          larger Homicide Cop steps back. His cool facade crumbles.
          
                                 HOMICIDE COP
                       Nobody, we just...why would anybody talk
                       to IA without a reason?
          
                                 BRAVURA
                           (livid)
                       You've got a reason, now. Tell me
                       everything you know about this woman,
                       starting with her name.
          
          EXT. AESIR BUILDING (MIDTOWN) - DAY
          
          The city is starting to shut down under the relentless snow -
          the sidewalks are nearly empty, only cabs on the icy streets.
          
          The Aesir corporate offices gleam in the diffuse light, a
          pillar of glass and steel disappearing up into the storm...
          
          R
          Jason Colvin steps out of a cab and marches up the steps.
          
           ECEPTION AREA
          
          Stepping off of the elevator, Colvin passes a RECEPTIONIST.
          
                                 COLVIN
                       You should go on home, already.   There's
                       nothing going on today...
          
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                       Well, there's someone in your office...
          
          COLVIN'S OFFICE
          
          Colvin steps through the doorway and stops short.
          
          Max stands behind Colvin's desk, inspecting the photographs
          hanging on the wall. He's cleaned himself up a little.
          
                                 MAX
                           (pointing to a photo)
                       This your daughter?

                                 COLVIN
                       Yes, it is. Three years old.
          
          For reasons Colvin can't fathom, Max's mood seems to darken
          even farther. Colvin sees the badge clipped to his belt.
          
                                  COLVIN
                       Is there something I can help you with,
                       detective?
          
                                  AX
                       You can tell me about Project Valhalla.
          
                                 COLVIN
                           (nervous laugh)
                       I think you might have the wrong...
          
          Barely keeping his poker face, Colvin eyes the phone.
          
                                 MAX
                        eed to make a call?
          
                                 COLVIN
                       Maybe I'd better.
          
          Max motions for Colvin to go ahead. While the executive's
          shaking hands dial the number, Max closes and LOCKS the door.
          
                                 COLVIN
                       Yes, there's a detective here...
                            to Max)
                       What did you say your name was?
                                 M
                                   AX
                       Max.
          
          Abruptly, Max RIPS the phone cord out of the wall.
          
                                  AX
                           (low)
                       She was my wife.
          
          The words, Max's flat delivery, catch Colvin like ice water.
          Still holding the dead receiver, Colvin staggers back...
          
                                  COLVIN
                           (stunned)
                       Excuse me?
          
                                 MAX
                       Michelle Payne was my wife.

          What color there was to begin with drains out of Colvin.
          
                              COLVIN
                    What--
          
                              MAX
                    Before you say anything else, I want you
                    to know who I am.
          
                              COLVIN
                    Please, wait...
          
          Max throws his elbow up, CRUSHING Colvin's nose.
          
          INT. AESIR BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY
          
          Bravura enters the soaring lobby of the Aesir building,
          stomping his shoes clean. He approaches the front desk.
          
                              BRAVURA
                        (flashing his badge)
                    I need to talk to somebody about a woman
                    who used to work here.
          
          COLVIN'S OFFICE
          
          Colvin's eyes flutter open.   His nose is smashed flat.
          
          He's being held upright by his belt, which loops around his
          neck and the headrest of his ergonomic chair. His wrists are
          bound to the armrests with strips of his tie.
          
          Max sits on the edge of the desk, heavy lamp in his hand.
          
                              COLVIN
                        (weakly, eyeing the lamp)
                    Please don't hit me again.
          
          Max wraps the cord in his hand and jerks it free from the
          lamp, which he tosses with a CRASH. The cord, he keeps.
                               M
                               AX
                    A week ago, I thought the universe had
                    turned against me. Everything I loved
                    was gone, and for some reason I'd been
                    left here to suffer alone.
          
          Max strips back the insulation on the cord, exposing two
          frizzed bundles of wire: one brass, the other silver.
          Positive and negative. Colvin watches, apprehensive.

                                 MAX
                        ut it wasn't the universe that took my
                       family away from me.
          
          Max plugs in the cord.
          
                                 MAX
                       It was you.
          
          He crouches by Colvin, wire in each hand, moving them closer.
          
                                 MAX
                       Tell me about Valhalla.
          
          Colvin struggles to pull away from the approaching wires...
          
                                 COLVIN
                       There is no--
          
          Max brushes the bare wires against Colvin's throat.
          
           here's a bright SPARK.       Colvin SCREAMS.
          
                                  MAX
                       Tell me.
          
                                 COLVIN
                       There's no Project Valhalla anymore.   I
                       shut it down years ago.
          
          A timid KNOCKING starts on Colvin's door, VOICES calling in.
          Max waits for more, eyes frozen, wires hanging ready.
          
                                 COLVIN
                           (reluctant)
                       It was a disaster. The drug was so
                       addictive, the damage it did to the mind
                       was so devastating that we lost our
                       government funding. By the end, we
                       couldn't even guarantee the safety of our
                       scientists administering the experiment.
                       Test subjects would follow them home and
                       kill them for an extra dose.
                                 M
                                  AX

                       Nobody knows what happened to her.
          
          Max picks up a cup of coffee from the desk and pours it over
          Colvin's face as he struggles more frantically.

                    People thought Michelle might be a
                    whistle-blower. That she wasn't loyal
                    enough to Aesir, and she might go public
                    about the program.
          
          Max's eyes thaw, hit by the first true words about her death.
          
          LOBBY
          
          Bravura sits in the lobby, impatiently skimming a magazine.
          On the far side of the enormous room, movement draws his eye:
          
          A line of black-clad SECURITY GUARDS swiftly moving in
          formation into a stairwell. SWAT precision, heavy hardware.
          
          Bravura springs up, approaching the Guards left at the door.
          
                              GUARD
                    Authorized personnel only.
          
          Bravura pulls out his badge, and plans to keep moving...
          But the guards don't immediately part. They look at each
          other, silently conferring. Bravura's eyes light up.
          
                               BRAVURA
                    Don't look at him.    Move aside.

                    Why are you asking me about this?

                    I already told you.    Be quiet, now.
          
          Max chambers a round, leaving his hand up to block the spray.
          
                              COLVIN

          Colvin looks up, Max's words suddenly scarier than the gun.
          
                                 COLVIN
                       Are you telling me that there are people

                       How many of them?
          
          Max shakes his head.    Colvin's eyes show real terror.
          
                                 COLVIN
                       I knew it, I knew something was going on.
                       I told her the numbers were too good--
          
          The POUNDING outside the door is louder, more VOICES calling.

                           (calling through the door)
                       Mr. Colvin, are you okay in there?
                       Security's on its way...
          
          Max turns to the door - trapped, ready to fire on what comes
          through. Colvin looks at Max, a sudden realization dawning.
          
                                 COLVIN
                       They're not coming for you.
          
                                 MAX
                       What are you talking about?
          
          Colvin begins to struggle harder than ever, but his fear
          isn't directed at the man with the gun standing over him.
                               C
                                  OLVIN
                       You only know my name because somebody
                       high up decided to cut me loose.
                           (gesturing)
                       There's a safe in the wall. It's open.
          
           earing a trap, Max pushes aside a painting and pulls open
          the door. A small stack of DVDs sits inside.
          
                                 COLVIN
                       Show that to whoever will watch. If this
                       thing spreads, nothing will keep the rest
                       of you safe.

          Max looks at the middle manager, desire to pull the trigger
          slowly losing out to the credibility of Colvin's story.
          
          Max unfastens the belt, using it to hoist Colvin to his feet.
          
                                COLVIN
                          (terrified)
                      Wait, I'm not ready...
          
          HALLWAY
          
          OFFICE WORKERS draw back and GASP as Colvin's bloody face
          appears. Max is close behind, holding the belt around
          Colvin's neck, pressing his pistol to the back of his head.
          
                                MAX
                      Back up, all of you.   Make a path.
          
          There's a disturbance at the back of the crowd - glimpses of
          black uniforms fighting forward. The Guards.
          
          Max pivots, holding Colvin towards the Guards as a shield.
          
                                MAX
                           calling to the guards)
                      Stay back, or I'll--
          
          CRACK!    Colvin's head snaps back, blood spraying over Max.
          T
           he crowd goes crazy, SCREAMING and trampling each other...
          More SHOTS ring out, ripping through Colvin as Max lets his
          lifeless body fall and hides his retreat in the scramble...
          
          The Guards chase after Max, slowed by the panicking crowd...
          
          STAIRWELL
          
          Exhausted, Bravura plods up steps to a landing. Suddenly,
          AUTOMATIC WEAPONS erupt nearby. He fumbles for a cell phone.
          
                                 BRAVURA

                      Hell yes, I'd like to report something.
                      We've got machine gun fire in Midtown.

          Bravura snaps his phone shut, trying to regulate his breath.
          Drawing a tiny service revolver he creeps to the door...
          
          HALLWAY
          
          Max stumbles up the hall. He chances a look back at the
          black-clad GUARDS crashing through office workers...
          
          A BURST of machine gun fire POUNDS the floor in front of
          Max's feet. More Guards seal off the hall ahead. Nowhere
          else to go, Max grips a cubicle wall and vaults over...
          M
           ax gets a few careful SHOTS off from his new elevation,
          dropping Guards who've lost sight of him as he jumps from
          desk to desk, working deeper into the maze of cubicles...
          
          The fastest Guards race ahead to block off a burning `EXIT'
          sign. Max's boots THUNDER across desks, papers flying...
          
          The Guards ahead FIRE, but Max shows now sign of slowing.
          Overhead lights EXPLODE, smoke and sparks raining down...
          
          Max launches himself into the air, pistol CRACKING as he
          falls. Bullets RIP through the retreating Guards...
          
          Max hits the ground hard, scrambling through the exit...
          
          ANOTHER HALL
          
          ...and around the corner.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                           (shouting)
                       Put your hands up!
          
          Max slides to a stop, startled to see Bravura aiming at him.
          While he doesn't exactly comply, Max does lower the barrel.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                           (more human)
                       You need to come in now, before anything
                       else gets pinned on you.
          
           ax shakes his head.       HEAVY BOOT STEPS rumble closer...
          
                                 MAX
                       She was trying to stop it.
          
                                    BRAVURA
                       Stop what?     Tell me what's happening--

          Bullets STRAFE the wall just above Max's head. He dives to
          the ground, plaster dust and smoke pluming above him.
          W
           hile Max scrambles for cover, Bravura charges forward,
          waving his badge in the air above him.
          
                                  BRAVURA
                       NYPD!   Hold your fire!
          
           uards flow into the hall, a black mass bristling FIRE. It
          takes a split second for Bravura to realize they aren't
          stopping. He slips, tumbling back as bullets RIP past him...
          
                                 BRAVURA
                           (screaming)
                       Hold your fire!
          
          Finally, the machine guns go quiet. Smoldering gunpowder
          clouds the hallway. Bravura and the Guards search...
          
           ..but Max has disappeared into the smoke.
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          Mona struggles up a narrow street, buffeted by the wind.
          Ahead, flashing blue and red lights electrify the snow.
          
            squad car idles towards her, searchlight flashing into dark
          shadows. Mona ducks her head away as the spotlight finds her
          at her building door. For a moment, she's in a whiteout.
          
           lowly, the cop car moves on. Mona starts to use her key...
          but the lock has already been forced open.
          
          INT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Mona steps inside, ready for ambush.    She turns the corner...
          
          Max sits on her couch, scraped and scorched from his escape.

                       generals have all wrestled with one
                       undeniable truth - morale wins battles.
          
           ver an up-tempo ROCK SOUNDTRACK, a slick montage of war

           n screen, the shot cuts to the interview of a YOUNG SOLDIER
          in uniform. He smiles easily, confident, eyes alert but
          maybe a little distant. Something familiar about him...

           tartled, Mona moves closer to the screen.

                    better place.
          
          Max studies Lupino's image - thinner, no visible tattoos.
          All-American. There's already something in his eyes, though.
          
          As Mona sits back down, Max brushes past her to get his coat.

                    So what do we do now?
          
          Max stands up from the couch and starts away. Confused, Mona
          tries to follow, but stumbles when something pulls her back:
          
           he looks down to see she's been handcuffed to her chair.

                    killed your partner, you can decide
                    whether I--
          
          When Max finally speaks, the sound scrapes out of his throat
          like he hasn't used his voice in years:
          
                              MAX
                    He killed my wife.
          
          Mona struggles at the cuff, chain CLANKING but holding.
          
                              MONA
                    I've been inside that club.   You don't
                    have a chance on your own.
                        (realizing)
                    But you don't care.
          
          Max stoops down to pick up Mona's machine gun where it leans
          against the base of the couch. Mona THRASHES helplessly.
          
                              MONA
                    You don't want my help, because you think
                    if he puts you out of your misery, you'll
                    get to see her again.

                      (3)
          
          
          Without a look back, Max starts out the door.
          
                                MONA
                      I hope that's really the way it works.
          
          The door pulls shut behind him.
          
           XT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT
          
          The red neon sign is only an ember, muted under caked ice.
          
           n a chair blocking the front door, a GUARD watches the
          silent street, shivering uncontrollably.
          
           NT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT
          
          Inside, the dance floor is empty. Sitting at the top of the
          stairs, another GUARD sleeps, rifle propped beside him.
          
           ACK ROOM
          
          A room like the inside of a smoker's lung - walls painted
          black, haze from candles and whatever else blurring the air.
          Jack Lupino sits on the floor surrounded by candles, watching
          the flames with manic focus. Two GUARDS stand above him.
          I
           nto a bent spoon, Lupino taps greenish powder from a small
          glass vial. He uses the candle to heat the spoon. Checking
          his watch, one of the guards produces a cell phone and dials.
          
                                GUARD #1
                          (on phone)
                      All quiet, 4 a.m.
          
          Lupino dips a needle into the spoon, drawing the bubbling
          green liquid into the body of the syringe.
          
           XT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT
          
          The guard stomps his feet, trying in vain to keep some blood
          flowing. Blowing in his hands, he looks both ways down a
          street that is still just as empty as it has been for hours.
          
                                GUARD
                          (chattering, to himself)
                      Screw this...
          
          Frozen fingers fumbling with the keys, the Guard opens the
          door. Moving the chair just inside the doorway, the guard
          settles in the alcove...

          He pulls the door shut. It won't. Something's blocking it.
          The guard stands up, opens it wider to build some momentum...
          
          Max stands on the top step.
          
          BACK ROOM
          
          Lupino shoots up, gritted teeth tugging his belt tourniquet
          tight. Eyes clinched, beads of sweat already forming.
          
          The muffled BLAST of a machine gun, out on the dance floor.
          The Guards surrounding Lupino spring into action.
          
                                 GUARD #1
                       W
                        ait here, Mr. Lupino.
          
          Lupino lets the belt slip free, a deep SIGH rattling out. He
          opens his eyes, just in time for us to see the irises
          retracting. Candles shine in the black holes left behind.
          
                                  UPINO
                       I don't need protection.   I have my own.
          
          The Guards at the door lock and load, moving out...
          
          BALLROOM
          
          Max walks into the ballroom, motionless Guard bleeding out on
          the dance floor before him. Gunsmoke hangs in the air...
          
          In that final stillness, Max checks his clip.     Stone-faced.
          
          Thundering BOOTS echo out from the belly of the building.
          Doors fly open - Guards racing out from the kitchen on the
          first floor, two more from the office CRASHING out upstairs.
          
           ax OPENS UP, flames of automatic fire lighting his way.
          
          BACK ROOM
          
          Lupino and the Guards listen to the SHOOTING grow closer.
          Suddenly, the metal door flies open, BANGING at the stop.
          With lightning reflexes, THE GUARDS BLAST down the hallway.
          
           upino slowly stands, eyes glowing in the guard's muzzle
          flash. Forgotten now, he fades away into the smoke.
          
          The Guards crumble and fall until the room goes SILENT.
          M
           ax melts out of the smoke, weapon raised.     Hunting.

          The back room is deeper than the poor light gives away.
          Max's boots grind over burned-out candles, occult runes...
          
          Lupino launches out of the darkness at Max.   Before he sees
          it coming, Lupino drives a hard punch into Max's skull.
          
          Max stumbles forward, ears ringing from the blow. Lupino
          draws a gleaming knife from his boot and springs on Max.
          
           upino swings the knife so quickly it becomes a blur, blade
          WHISTLING as it cuts through the smoke. He slashes the knife
          across Max's thigh, dropping him to the ground.
          
           nable to stand, Max thrusts the rifle up for protection.
          The blade CLANKS against the barrel, carving deep trenches in
          the stock, finally gashing the back of Max's fingers.
          
          Blood rushes from the cuts, loosening Max's grip on the
          weapon. Teeth gnashing like an animal, Lupino reaches out
          and tries to pull the machine gun out of Max's hands.
          
           upino buries the knife into Max's shoulder.    He CRIES OUT.
          
                                 LUPINO
                        an you hear them, now?
          
          Lupino drives his knee into Max's chest. Arm numb from the
          stab wound, Max's grip on the gun is slowly overpowered.
          Helplessly watching it slip away, Max SCREAMS with rage...
          E
           XT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT
          
          Outside, no voice could carry on that raging WIND. TWO
          FIGURES walk up the street, closing slowly on Ragna Rok.
          
           NT. RAGNA ROK - BACK ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Lupino leans over Max, one hand grinding the knife deeper
          into his shoulder, the other wrenching the machine gun free.
          Max desperately tries to dig his nails into the grip...
          
                                 LUPINO
                       We'll see which one us they're flying
                       for. We'll see who they love best.
          
          Sweat streams down Lupino's face, dripping down onto Max.
          Fingernails splitting, Max finally loses hold of the gun.
          The sudden shift in momentum pitches Lupino back.
          
          For an instant, they are apart.

          In that instant, Max pulls the knife from his own shoulder
          and buries it to the hilt in Lupino's stomach.
          
          Lupino drops the machine gun. Max clamps his hand over
          Lupino's throat, using his grip to force the knife deeper.
          While Lupino GASPS, eyes wide, Max struggles to his feet.
          
                                 MAX
                       Who is your contact at Aesir?
          
          Lupino looks down at the knife in his stomach.       Fascinated.
          
                                 MAX
                            louder)
                       Who sent you after Michelle?
                                 L
                                  UPINO
                           (with difficulty)
                       You are so blessed.
          
          Max looks at Lupino - up close, his undyed skin is ashen and
          pockmarked, older than his age. Blood drools from his lips.
          Lupino's eyes swim around, lost in a fog of drugs and pain.
          
                                 MAX
                        ou don't know what I'm talking about, do
                       you?
          
          Lupino's eyes stop swimming.    For a moment, he sees Max.
          
                                 LUPINO
                       The angels are not done with you yet.
          
          Lupino's skull explodes.
          
          Max spins towards the hall, but another SHOT rakes across his
          shoulder and slings him to the ground. Defenseless, Max can
          only lift his eyes to see who's coming to finish it...
          
           B steps out of the smoke.
          
          As Max reels at the sight of BB, JOE SALLE (50'S) rumbles in.
          
           alle stomps on Max's wrist, in the same motion telescoping a
          metal baton and CRACKING it across his skull. With the grace
          of an old pro, Salle snaps on a pair of handcuffs.
          
                                   MAX

                       BB?
          
          Max is hauled to his feet - bleeding, cuffed, and trapped.

                    What's going on here, BB?
          
          As Max watches in disbelief, BB paces around the room taking
          stock - noting the dead Guards, crouching over Lupino's body.

          Max struggles to break free of Salle's grasp.

                    Hey!

                    you're doing...
          
          BB finally does look at Max.    Cold, dead eyes.   A stranger.
          
                                 BB
                     row up.
          
          EXT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT
          
          BB steps through the door, over the guard's upturned chair.
          
          The blizzard has won - streets and sidewalks no longer
          scraped, cars long abandoned under their icy cocoons. The
          fifth largest city in the world, reduced to a ghost town.
          
                               B
                    Happy New Year.
          
           B strides out in front, taking in the sight. It might as
          well be a desert, white sand sifting around their boots,
          buildings rising above like black canyon walls.
          
          Max shuffles along behind BB, head bent low in the wind.
          Plumes of his ragged breaths trailing out behind him.
          
                                                                          
          
                                                                        79.
                     
          
          
                                 BB (cont'd)
                       Look at it from my perspective: this
                       thing is going to be a true epidemic.
                       One hundred percent dependence within a
                       few doses, and we control the only
                       source. This is so much bigger than
                       Lupino's little bar. This is every
                       street corner in the City in a month,
                       nation wide in two.
          
          Max keeps trudging, one foot in front of the other. BB looks
          annoyed that he's not getting a reaction out of him.
                               B
                                  B
                       I hope you're not over there blaming me.
                       Really, this is Michelle's fault.
          
          Max's eyes start to burn.     BB sneaks a peek, encouraged.
          
                                 BB
                       She had no right to put me in that
                       situation. Asking me to pass up this
                       kind of an opportunity to help her rat
                       out my bosses...I'm sorry, but that's
                       unreasonable.
          
          Max's head snaps up, eyes simmering with rage.     BB smiles.
          
                                  BB
                       But then again, who could blame her for
                       getting confused, being married to such a
                       righteous man. So maybe it is your
                       fault, after all.
                           (beat)
                       Just like your old man. Always knew you
                       were better than everyone else--
          
                                  MAX
                       No.   Just better than you.
          
          BB's smile seems to double.     He considers Max for a moment.
          
                                 BB
                       For what it's worth, he didn't know
                       Michelle was going to die.
          
          Max starts walking again, doesn't raise his eyes. The seed
          has been planted, though. BB plays with the silence.
          
                                 BB
                       He thought they were going out there to
                       scare her, destroy her research.

          FLASHBACK: MAX'S KITCHEN - DUSK
          
          Looking up from the mail, Max sees the smashed kitchen door.
          R
           ESUME - EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          Max keeps walking, trying to fight off the memories. BB
          strolls along beside him, taking his time with the story.
          
                              BB
                    I'd arranged with the other guys to
                    finish the job.
          
           LASHBACK: MAX'S HALLWAY - DUSK
          
          Max races into the hallway bathed in golden light.
          
          Between Max and the end of the hall, two JUNKIES are huddled
          against a door. Twisting the handle, SMACKING the wood.
          
                              BB (V.O.)
                    He locked them out of the bedroom, tried
                    CPR...boy scout shit.
          
           he Junkies turn to Max, eyes black and glassy.   Sick smiles.
          
          RESUME - EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          Max looks nauseous.    BB sees it, thrilled.
          
                              BB
                        (smiling)
                    And as thanks, you nearly blew his head
                    off while he crawled out the window.
          
           LASHBACK: MAX'S HALLWAY - DUSK
          
          Max throws his shoulder into the door, SNAPPING the hinges...
          
          BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          A MAN slips out of the window, one leg still inside...
          
           ax OPENS FIRE at the retreating shape.
          
          RESUME - EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          Max's gait begins to falter, lost in the memory he's played a
          thousand times, the images shifting to show something new...
          B
           B watches eagerly, waiting for what comes next...

          FLASHBACK: MAX'S BEDROOM - DUSK
          
          Max charges in, again firing on the man escaping...
          
          ...but this time, we watch the glass behind the billowing
          curtains. The fabric ripples, revealing a reflection...
          
          Alex.
          
                              BB (V.O.)
                    That's funny, to me.
          
          A momentary flash of his profile, a mask of guilt and shame.
          
          RESUME - EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          Max stops walking.   All of his will gone.
          
          BB steps closer, drinking in the pain in Max's eyes.
          
                              BB
                    You really didn't know?
          
          With a shrug, BB turns away from Max's fury and moves on...
          
          INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS
          
          Above them, traffic signals strain under thick icicles.
          Intermittently, the lights go dark, the power faltering.
          
                               AX
                        (soft)
                    You should have killed me then, when you
                    had a chance.
          
                              BB
                    I learned something from your father,
                    years ago. Always give people a choice.
          
           tepping into the intersection, BB stops. Abruptly, Joe
          Salle closes with Max, meaty hand clamping onto his arm.
          
                                BB
                    He gave me the choice between early
                    retirement or facing the charges he was
                    going to bring against me. He sat me
                    down in that bar and explained that I
                    could either give up the thing I loved,
                    or I could have it taken away by force.
                    That (was my choice.
                          beat)
                                (MORE)

                                   BB(CONT'D)
                       You could have put a gun in your mouth
                       any time you wanted. Or, you could have
                       kept living in the hell I made for you.
                       That's your choice.
          
          BB smiles.
          
                                 BB
                       Just out of curiosity, though: why don't
                       I have a chance now?
          
          Max's eyes are clear - almost peaceful for the first time.
          
                                 MAX
                       Because now I know it's you.
          
          BB moves closer, the arrogance in his smile deepening.
          
                                 BB
                       Well, you're--
          
          Suddenly, Max launches himself forward - a fullback's
          explosion into the line that catches Salle by surprise...
          
          Hands cuffed behind his back, Max drives his shoulder into
          BB's jaw, splitting his lip. BB tumbles back into the snow.
          
          Joe brings the club out again, bashing Max across the head,
          using it to choke Max until his struggles lose power.
          
                                 JOE SALLE
                       Okay, enough. This is far enough.
          
          BB looks around, wiping the blood from his lip. His eyes
          fall on a mound of construction rubble in a vacant lot.
                               B
                                   B
                       Hang on.
          
                                  JOE SALLE
                       BB...
          
          BB stands and walks onto the lot, kicking away snow until he
          exhumes a cinder block in the rubble pile. BB picks it up.
          
                                 BB
                        've got something better.
          
          Carrying the cinder block, BB starts off down a different
          street. Grudgingly, Salle pushes Max along after him.
          
          Visible a few blocks away, the black body of the river waits.

          EXT. PIER - NIGHT
          
          An ancient shipping pier juts out into the river, murky water
          high and roiling around its pilings from the stormy weather.
          B
           B motions for Max and Joe Salle to follow him out onto the
          pier, its planks buried under a thick sheet of ice.
          
                              BB
                        (to Salle, taking Max)
                    Grab me some of that rope.
          
          BB drops the cinder block at Max's feet, CRACKING the ice.
          
                              BB
                    It's not like we didn't see it coming.
          
          Clamping onto Max's arm, BB unlocks his handcuffs.
          
                              BB
                    Sullen, withdrawn...Max just never seemed
                    the same after the tragedy.
          
           ights running the length of the pier flicker, eventually
          dying altogether. All down the shore, the power fails.
          
                              BB
                    It's a good thing his father didn't live
                    to see it, though. Bill Payne's only
                    son, a strung-out suicide.
          
           idden in the now deeper darkness, BB pulls something from
          his coat: two glass vials like Lupino's, filled with the same
          green powder. He tucks them into Max's coat pocket.

                         smiling)
                    It would have eaten him alive.
          
                              MAX
                    Bravura's not going to buy it.
          
                              BB
                    Sure? Not even once the autopsy turns up
                    traces in your blood?
          
          Max looks at BB, trying to understand how that could be.
          
                              BB
                      dosed you that night at Alex's, just to
                    make sure things were fuzzy. Compliments
                    of the house.

          Seeing that BB has removed Max's cuffs, Salle hurries over.
          The motion puts both men off balance on the slick boards...
          
                                 BB
                        oe, why don't you calm down...
          
          Salle grabs Max's arm. Max looks down at Salle's feet, hard-
          soled shoes slipping. Salle anticipates his next thought...
          
          Abruptly, Max jerks his arm away.
          
          Not able to let go in time, Salle's feet fly out from under
          him. The big man crashes down hard on his side.
          
          Max ducks and stumbles forward...
          
          BB FIRES, missing. Max looks back. Beached on his side, Joe
          Salle draws his pistol, the next shot coming any moment...
          
          Max slips. Struggling to right himself, hands scraping over
          rough planks, another shot CRACKS inches from Max's legs...
          
          With nowhere else to go, Max turns to the water. Boots
          slipping, he lunges for the edge, careening over...
          
          RIVER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Max SPLASHES down into the dark water, body twisted in an
          awkward position, wind blasted from his lungs by the impact.
          SHOTS from the pier above CUT into the water around him...
          
          Max dives under as much as he can stand it in the frigid
          water, swimming farther from shore. Shots continuing to
          SPLASH around him, the current pulls him into deeper water...
          P
           IER
          
          BB and Salle FIRE with less conviction. In the water, the
          disturbance made by Max grows smaller as he's swept away.
          
          BB lowers his gun, motioning for Salle to do the same.
          
                                  BB
                       It's fine, as cold as that water is...
                           (beat)
                       Just in case, though. Make sure.
          
          Salle frowns, shoots BB a look.
          
                                 JOE SALLE
                       How?
          
                                                                     85.
          
          
          
          RIVER
          
          Max lifts his head. The wide expanse of the river stretches
          around him, surface broken by swirling pocks of falling snow.
          
          The current caries him farther from piers and buildings
          receding into snow, as black as the water they rise above.
          Turning, Max sees that the opposite shore is even farther.
          
          Slowly, the exhilaration of escape begins to change. Icy
          water bites his skin. Muscles beginning to tremble...
          
          Limbs heavy with saturated clothing, joints seized by cold,
          Max tries to swim against the current with little success.
          
          Max sinks lower, churning water lapping his face.    GASPING
          BREATHS becoming SPUTTERING COUGHS...
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          INT. HALLWAY - TWILIGHT (VISION)
          
          Max moves down the hallway, the familiar golden light.    Boots
          A
          stepping quiet, past the bloody and motionless bodies.
          
           t the bedroom's door, Max pauses.   Unable to go through.
          
          Michelle's body faces away, bundle cradled in her arms.
          
          As Max stands watching, Michelle's body stirs...
          
          EXT. RIVER - NIGHT
          
          Max breaks the surface: COUGHING, GASPING, flailing his arms.
          It's hopeless; he immediately begins to sink again.
          Desperation, panic move his limbs, but for nothing.
          
          Max Payne slips under without so much as a ripple.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - TWILIGHT (VISION)
          
          Tentatively, Max crosses the threshold into the bedroom.
          
          Michelle's eyes open, aware that she's being watched from the
          doorway. She looks up at Max, a lazy smile forming.
          
          The bundle of blankets stirs. Michelle grins down at their
          infant daughter, offering her finger to the tiny pink hand.
          
          Max edges closer, overwhelmed by the sight. Michelle pats
          the bed beside them, inviting Max to sit. He doesn't move.

          For a long moment, Max drinks in the sight of his family...
          
          EXT. RIVER - PRE-DAWN
          
          Out in the middle of the river, the white curtain of blowing
          snow parts to reveal a dark shape, drifting in the fog. Like
          an island in the black water, a small boat bobs in place...
          T
           he CAPTAIN steps out onto deck, zipping his coat against the
          weather while talking into a two-way radio. Faintly visible
          around him, larger ships are outlined by twinkling lights.
          
                                  APTAIN
                           (into radio)
                       You know how blind I am, I'm not crashing
                       into the dock again. When the power--
          
          A THUD against the hull of the ship; something in the water.
          
                                 CAPTAIN
                        ang on a second.
          
          The Captain leans over the gunwale. A body floats below the
          surface, BUMPING as it bobs in the wake.
          
                                  APTAIN

                       Jumpers.
          
          The Captain swings a gaff, SPLASHING and glancing the sharp
          hook across the body. He tries again, a solid hit...
          
          A hand breaks the surface, weakly grabbing the pole.
          
                                 CAPTAIN

          EXT. DOCK - NIGHT
          
          The boat barrels out of the fog, moving too fast towards the
          pier. The Captain and his FIRST MATE crouch over Max.
          
                                 FIRST MATE
                       It's too late. He's frozen solid.
          
           ax lies on the deck, ice water streaming from his clothes.
          He's blue-gray, shivering violently, tiny puffs of breath...

          The boat tries to ease into the dock, but is moving too fast:
          it CRASHES against the pilings. The gathered CROWD SHOUTS.
          
                                 CAPTAIN
                           (calling to the pier)
                       Somebody get some blankets.
          
          The Captain and Mate lift Max's rigid body up to the pier.
          People start to inspect his cut and battered body.
          
                                 CAPTAIN
                        all the cops, he's bleeding everywhere.
          
          Catatonic to this point, Max suddenly tries to shake his
          head. He attempts to sit up, but hands force him down.
          Powerless, Max's eyes desperately look around, searching...
          
                                 CAPTAIN
                        on't move. We've got help coming.
          
          Hand shaking violently, Max reaches inside his coat and pulls
          out the vials BB planted. Trembling, he flips the caps away.
          
                                  IRST MATE
                       What is that? What's he...
          
          With everything he has, Max opens his chattering jaws and
          dumps the green-tinged powder into his mouth.
          
                                  APTAIN
                       Great, a junkie bleeding on my boat.
          
          The dust on Max's lips liquefies.    His trembling grows worse.
          
          The crowd parts, and a MAN rushes up with blankets.       He
          kneels down over Max, whose body keeps shaking.
                               M
                                  AN
                            touching Max, confused)
                       He doesn't really feel that bad...
          
                                 CAPTAIN
                       What do you mean, he's a block of ice...
          
          The captain touches Max's skin, jerking away in shock.
          
                                 FIRST MATE
                       Maybe it's a fever already.
          
          Max pushes their hands away, his strength suddenly regained.
          Unsteadily, Max climbs to his feet. The crowd pulls away.

                    Let him go, then.
          
          Max wobbles up the planks, the snow fall not quite as hard as
          it had been when he went into the water.
          
          Max's gait grows more steady, each step forcefully forward...
          
          One by one, the flakes become burning embers drifting from
          the sky. Max marches ahead, bits of fire raining over him.
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
          
          A exhausted man in the uniform of a GUARD slumps in an
          interrogation room. Bravura paces the floor, grilling him.
          
                               BRAVURA
                    Okay.   Again, from the beginning.
          
          Before the Guard can answer, the door flies open. Without a
          word, the RANKING OFFICER summons Bravura into the hall...
          
          HALLWAY
          
          ...where a row of more GUARDS are handcuffed to a bench.
          
                    U         RANKING OFFICER
                     nder what authority are you
                    interrogating these men?
          
                               RAVURA
                    An investigation into departmental
                    corruption. They're material witnesses--
          
                              RANKING OFFICER
                    Just between you and me, I wouldn't count
                    on these men being any kind of witnesses
                    at all. I served with a few of them, and
                    remember what kind of officers they were.
          
          From the bench, Bravura sees the smirks from the Guards.
          
                              BRAVURA
                    What kind would that be?
          
                               RANKING OFFICER
                    Cops.   Real cops.
          
          At the far end of the hall, a group of serious-looking men in
          DARK SUITS file out of the elevator. Bravura cracks a smile.
          
                                 RANKING OFFICER
                        o offense.
          
          The Suits get closer, revealing badges on their belts.   FBI.
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       None taken.
                           (to the lead agent)
                       Agent Taliente, I'd like you to meet a
                       real cop.
          
          The Ranking Officer and the Agent shake hands.    Icy.
          
          Standing in the doorway of an office down the hall, a
          DETECTIVE shrinks back to his desk and picks up the phone.
          
                                 DETECTIVE
                           (on phone)
                       Let me talk to BB.
          
          EXT. ASGARD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          With dead streetlights, the hulking black shape of the Asgard
          building looms like a mountain at the end of the block.
          
           ax moves up the street, steam rising from his clothes as
          they dry from the heat of his skin. Sweat beads on his face.
          
          Max enters Asgard's courtyard, the Gothic facade rising high
          above. He passes through its security lights, shadow casting
          down onto the clean white snow like a projection screen...
          
          Invisible to the naked eye, more shadows of winged shapes
          dart and swoop in the air above Max's outline on the snow.
          
          INT. ASGARD BUILDING - BB'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          BB POUNDS the receiver down onto the phone, CRACKING the
          base. Joe Salle watches him angrily pulling on his coat.
          
                                 JOE SALLE
                       What's going on downtown?
          
                                 BB
                       Bravura called in the Feds.
          
          BB storms for the door, surprised to turn back and see that
          Salle hasn't followed him. The big man scowls, nervous.
          
                                 BB
                        or God's sake, come on. Max is dead,
                       they've got nothing else.
          
          
          ENTRY HALL
          
          BB and Salle storm down the steps into the main entry hall.
          
                                  B
                       Get up to the armory, hide the--
          
          Salle grabs BB by the arm.
          
          On the floor between them and the front door, two guards
          sprawl face-down in enormous pools of their own blood.
          
                                 JOE SALLE
                       He's not dead. He's here.
          
                                   BB
                       Bullshit.    There's no way--
          
          At that moment, they both see movement in the shadows...
          
          Max steps forward into the light - soaked in blood up to his
          elbows, eyes black and animalistic. No longer himself.
          
           oe Salle reaches for his pistol. With freakish reflexes,
          Max raises one of the guard's machine guns and OPENS FIRE.
          
          BB and Salle fall back, diving into an ancient elevator car.
          Slugs ricocheting, BB and Salle struggle to shut the doors.
          
          From Max's POV: as the elevator doors slam shut, a glimpse of
          BB's face stretching and distorting into a demonic grin...
          
          ELEVATOR
          
          BB and Salle watch the floor number rise.       BB finds his cell.
          
                                 JOE SALLE
                       Who are you calling?
          
                                   BB
                       Her.
          
          By Salle's face, that's a thought scarier than Max.
          
          INT. AESIR BUILDING - PENTHOUSE OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          The giant glass-walled penthouse office of the Aesir building
          sits above the storm clouds. Up here, dawn is close.
          
          Nicole Horne watches the storm below her feet.       She ANSWERS.
          
          
          
          
                                  NICOLE HORNE
                           (even)
                       This isn't a number you use.
          
          INTERCUT - HORNE'S OFFICE/ELEVATOR
          
                                 BB
                         need you to send a helicopter to my
                       building. NThe storm's breaking...
          
                                 NICOLE HORNE
                        here was a shoot-out in my building
                       yesterday, twenty floors from where I'm
                       sitting. A secretary was killed.
          
                                 BB
                       I understand an executive named Jason
                       Colvin was also among the dead.
                       Senseless tragedies, all.
          
          Nicole sighs, eyes still fixed on the window.
          
                                 BB
                       Everything's fine, we're just--
          
                                 NICOLE HORNE
                       This was more than you were ready for.
          
                                 BB
                       What is that supposed to mean?
          
                                 NICOLE HORNE
                       Perhaps our partnership has run its
                       course.
          
                                 BB
                       Think pretty hard about that. I'm about
                       to be surrounded by Federal agents--
          
                                 NICOLE HORNE
                           (shadenfreude)
                       Good heavens, BB. Best of luck.
          
                                 BB
                       Who needs luck? They're going to love
                       the stories I can tell.
          
                                  NICOLE HORNE
                       Careful.
          
                                 BB
                           (losing it)
                       Send the helicopter, then.
          
          After a moment, Horne lets her eyes drift shut.        She smiles.
          
                                 NICOLE HORNE
                       It's on its away.
          
          INT. ASGARD BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          The elevator opens and BB steps out, snapping his phone shut.
          
                                  BB
                       Take everybody and get downstairs.    I
                       want no less than his head.
          
          HALLWAY
          
          Max turns the corner into a long hallway of prison-like
          offices. Emergency lights flicker through barred windows...
          
          A group of GUARDS look up and see Max at the same moment.
          Max is without hesitation, SHOOTING two before they can raise
          their weapons. Falling back, the others start FIRING...
          S
           uddenly, an office down the hall bursts to life - a ROAR of
          flapping wings, light from the window strobing with movement.
          
          Max doesn't seek cover, walking into BLAZING machine guns...
          
          One by one, all the offices FLICKER with fluttering wings.
          Max marches on, rage-filled eyes set in a lifeless face...
          
          ARMORY
          
          Guards empty the weapons lockers, loading for bear as the
          sounds of GUNFIRE grow closer. BB and Salle supervise.
          
                                 BB
                       Take some C4, wire it so he can't make it
                       to the roof. I'll wait on the chopper.
          
          Salle's mistrust of BB is painted all over his face.
          
                                 BB
                           (smiling)
                       You know I won't leave without you.
          
          
          
          
          CORRIDOR
          
          Max FIRES, plaster from shattered walls caking on his sweat-
          soaked skin. Guards take cover, fall back for position...
          
          With every shot fired, the muzzle flash glows in Max's empty
          black eyes, the flames glowing brighter as he advances...
          
          GREAT HALL
          
          ...into the vast, open space at the heart of the building.
          GUARDS appear at the other end of the hallway, OPENING UP.
          Their SHOTS echo, the great room ringing like a cave.
          
          Max lifts his eyes - what had been four stories now seems
          like forty, the top not visible behind hazy black smoke.
          
          Bullets WHISTLE past Max's ear. Distracted, he RETURNS FIRE,
          but his eyes are drawn back to the black smoke above.
          SOMETHING moves in the clouds, swirling closer...
          
          STAIRWELL
          
          More Guards THUNDER up steps littered with spent casings. In
          their haste, they don't notice the thin gap in one window...
          
           LENDER FINGERS slip in with the swirling snow, opening it...
          
          GREAT HALL (MAX'S POV)
          
          Crashing back into Max's perspective, a RUSHING WIND presses
          down from the black clouds above, the darkness spreading.
          Max's legs buckle, his machine gun scattering SHOTS...
          
          The room goes darker as it gets louder, light blotted out by
          WINGED CREATURES drifting down from above, circling closer...
          
          Max stumbles, buffeted by their POUNDING WINGS. CHOKING on
          sulfurous smoke, hair smoldering, skin starting to singe...
          
          ANOTHER HALLWAY
          
          A small group of Guards race forward, dodging the bodies of
          others Max met along the way. They hesitate, form ranks...
          
          GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS
          
          ...and the frightened Guards charge into the great room.
          
          It is silent. Smokeless. Just a hall. Blood streaks the
          walls, flows between the crumpled carcasses of more dead
          GUARDS. At the far end of the hall, something moves:
          
          
          
          Max. On his hands and knees, rivers of sweat flowing.
          Confused, the group of Guards approach Max. Weapons ready.
          
          MAX'S HALLUCINATION
          
          Crushed inside the DEAFENING blackness, Max lifts his eyes to
          see LEERING DEMONS gazing down, distorted versions of...
          
          GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS
          
          ...the four Guards, who look down on Max's trembling, sweat-
          logged body on the floor. He's MUTTERING, CHANTING...
          
          So easy it almost doesn't seem fair, a Guard aims his pistol.
          
          Suddenly, bullets RIP through the Guards from behind. No
          chance to respond, bodies torn open with a merciless BLAST of
          machine gun fire. They fall around Max, joining the rest.
          
          Gun smoking, Mona rushes up the hallway to Max.
          
          MAX'S HALLUCINATION
          
          The Demons fade away, their howling SCREAMS lingering behind.
          Awaiting the next horror, Max is shocked by something else:
          White light splits open the smoke, cutting the black in two.
          
          GREAT HALL
          
          Mona kneels down over Max, lifting up his head. Max's skin
          is pale, slick like melting wax. His eyes are empty.
          
          There's nothing gentle in her touch - she SLAMS Max's head
          back onto the cold marble, jerking him up again by his hair.
          
                                 MONA
                       Max!
          
          Gradually, Max's black eyes start to find Mona's face.
          M
           AX'S HALLUCINATION
          
          The white light grows brighter, blasting away shadows and
          smoke. In its center, traces of Mona's face appear.
          
          GREAT HALL
          
          Max starts to sit up, gazing with confusion at the hallway.
          
                                 MONA
                       You don't have much time.
          
          
          Max nods.    No idea if he understands, Mona helps him up.
          
                                 MONA
                       I'll do what I can to slow them down, but
                       you have to hurry.
          
          Max looks back at Mona, clearly having some idea of what that
          means for her. They look at each other for a long moment.
          
                                 MONA
                       You're not done yet.
          
          EXT. ASGARD BUILDING - ROOF - DAWN
          
          Sickly light glows in the east. The snow has all but
          stopped. BB strides across the roof, hope in his eyes.
          
                                  BB
                           (on phone)
                       The weather's broken, your pilot is going
                       to have no problem landing.
          
          INT. AESIR SKYSCRAPER - PENTHOUSE OFFICE - DAWN
          
          Nicole Horne sits at her desk, watching the storm recede.
          
          A red light flashes on her phone.     She ignores it.
          
          INT. ASGARD BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAWN
          
          Joe Salle kneels over a pile of C4 bricks, wiring a bomb. He
          tenses, hearing something in the hall behind him. Raising
          his hands and turning slowly, he finds Mona waiting.
          
                                 MONA
                       Where's the detonator?
          
          Slowly, Salle holds it out for Mona.     She grabs the remote.
          
                                  JOE SALLE
                       There's more like this all over. Even if
                       the building doesn't collapse, this floor
                       is gone.
                           (beat)
                       Careful with that thing, is what I'm
                       saying. I'm sure you and I can work
                       something out.
          
          Suddenly, BOOT STEPS ring up the hallway behind Mona.
          
                                  UARDS
                       Drop your weapon!
          
          Salle smiles.
          
          BB'S OFFICE
          
          Max staggers through the door to BB's office. Out the big
          windows, the East River begins to glow with approaching dawn.
          
           ax scans the room for BB, his vision still plagued by
          flickering shadows, hallucinations receding but not yet gone.
          He pauses at the glass, caught by his twisted reflection.
          
           ax can see his own wings.
          
          HALLWAY
          
          Salle holds out his hand for the detonator. Behind Mona,
          elevator doors open to reveal more Guards. They file out...
          
                                 JOE SALLE
                           (to the Guards)
                       Hurry, Max's already upstairs.
                           (to Mona, frustrated)
                       Just hand it over.
          
          Mona watches the guards file towards the stairs. Behind her,
          the elevator car waits, empty, the doors starting to close...
          
                                 JOE SALLE
                        B's done for, but this thing doesn't
                       have to stop. I'm his number two, and
                       somebody has to take over for Lupino.
                       Like I said, we can work something out.
          
          Ever so casually, Mona takes a step back onto the elevator.
          The doors HISS along their tracks, converging...
          
                                 JOE SALLE
                            frowning, confused)
                       Give me one reason we can't do business.
          
          Mona presses the button on the detonator.
          
          BB'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          T
           he window Max stands in front of SHATTERS in the EXPLOSION,
          his demonic image bursting into a thousand shards of glass...
          
          EXT. ASGARD BUILDING - DAWN - CONTINUOUS
          
          From the ground, the explosion rains glass down over the Feds
          and waiting SWAT team. Shielding his eyes, Bravura squints
          up at the flames in the windows. Taliente pats his shoulder.
          
          
          
          
                                                                        97.
                     
          
          
                                 BRAVURA
                       Try to take Payne alive, if there's
                       anything left.
          
          Taliente nods.    On his signal, the SWAT team mobilizes.
          
          INT. ASGARD BUILDING - BB'S OFFICE - DAWN
          
          Wind GUSTS through the shattered windows of BB's office. Max
          brushes away diamonds of broken glass, struggling to stand.
          
           hin rims of color have returned to his eyes. Human again.
          Max draws his pistol and strides through the roof door...
          
          EXT. ASGARD BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAWN - CONTINUOUS
          
          A shower of bullets strikes the doors as he steps outside.
          Max can't react. Bullets shred the door behind him, one slug
          hitting Max in the stomach and knocking him to the ground.
          
           cross the roof, BB keeps FIRING until his pistol CLICKS.        BB
          returns his attention to the sky, hopelessly waiting.
          
                                 BB
                       It's unbelievable. All that snow, and...
                       Watch it end up being a beautiful day.
          
           ritting his teeth, Max struggles to his knees. Blood rushes
          between his fingers, streaming out of the hole in his side.
          
           earing Max's effort, BB turns away from the empty sky.
          Using the pistol as a crutch, Max finally stands...
          
                               BB
                       You want my confession, first?   You came
                       all this way for it...
          
          BB tosses his useless weapon aside.
          
                                 BB
                           (mock penitent)
                       Forgive me, Max, for I have sinned. I
                       should have bet more on you, and less on
                       that helicopter.
          
          Max limps closer, pistol swinging at his side.     A thin trail
          of blood follows behind him in the snow...
          
          BB watches Max's approach, his swagger rapidly failing.
          
          
          
          
          
                                 BB
                       Just get to it, already. That's all I
                       ask. You've earned it, so just...
          
          With the pain in his stomach causing some difficulty, Max
          pulls the pistol's slide back to check for a live round.
          
          BB watches Max's preparations, terror growing. Unable to
          resist his panic, BB abruptly tries on a helpless smile.
          
                                 BB
                       But I want you to listen to me, first.
                       Just try to hear what--
          
          Max raises the pistol and PULLS THE TRIGGER. The slug hits
          BB in the center of the forehead, snapping his neck back.
          
          The shell casing twirls down, landing in the snow without a
          sound. BB's corpse lands a moment later with a clumsy THUD.
          
          Max lets the gun slip out of his hand and walks past the body
          - BB's eyes frozen on the sky, red halo slowly expanding.
          
          Max reaches the edge, the river's black body revealed below.
          His gait falters, blood filling each footprint in the snow...
          
          INT. ASGARD BUILDING - BB'S OFFICE - DAWN
          
          The SWAT team streams through the door, racing for the roof.
          
          EXT. ASGARD BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAWN
          
          Max stands at the roof's edge. A stiff wind buffets against
          his chest, forcing his unsteady legs to sway a little.
          
          Slowly, his eyes drift from the water below to the sky...
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. MAX'S BEDROOM (VISION) - TWILIGHT
          
          From the doorway, Max watches Michelle smiling down at their
          baby, who grabs at her finger with a wide grin.
          
                                 MAX'S VOICE
                       I don't believe in heaven.
          
          Gently, Max takes a seat on the edge of the bed beside them.
          
                                                                  99.
          
          
          
          EXT. ASGARD BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAWN
          
          Max looks up at the sky. Behind him, the SWAT team races
          outside, swarming and BARKING orders at Max, weapons raised.
          
          Max drops to his knees. He raises his hands, one dripping
          with his own blood. But his eyes stay on the sky...
          
                              MAX'S VOICE
                    But I have this idea about it.
          
          ...where a tiny tear opens in the clouds, revealing steel
          grey dawn beyond.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.

          "Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
          But what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game."
          The Rolling Stones, 1968

                         

          1.

          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - NIGHT

          CLOSE on the needle of a precision-weighted 33rpm turntable.
          It comes down, touches vinyl. The Rolling Stones "Sympathy
          for the Devil" purrs out...
          ARTHUR BISHOP (40's) Sitting in a comfortable wooden chair,
          stares right through us. Lean, hard, in perfect physical
          shape. In this moment, carrying the stillness of someone
          utterly in balance. For all we know, he's been sitting this
          way for hours.

          BISHOP (V.O.)
          Every man has a death that's right
          for him. Every one.
          REVERSE to find a wall of photographs, charts, official
          documents. In the center A PHOTOGRAPH of a man, mid-40's,
          East-Indian, dressed like the billionaire he is. Dodi Fayed
          meets Bill Gates. THE MARK.

          BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          For every man, there's a way to
          leave this earth which is so right
          for them, it's almost as if they
          carry it with them.
          MOVING over the wall. MORE PHOTOGRAPHS. The Mark escorted
          from a bullet-proof sedan by ear-wired men. Entertaining at
          a palatial estate. Magazine covers: "The billion-dollar
          lifestyle." "The new Playboy." ...passing over smaller
          articles: "What does this man do with your money?"

          BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          When the right death overtakes a
          man, there will be grief in those
          who knew him, but there will also
          be a sense of inevitability.
          Because they will know, that of
          course...
          CLOSE ON BISHOP. Statue-like, except his eyes which dart
          across the wall in front of him, making connections...

          EXT. RURAL RACETRACK - DAY

          VINTAGE RACE CARS speed by, a blur of color. But all we hear
          is the Rolling Stones' song. And...

          BISHOP (V.O.)
          ...Of course, this was always going
          to happen this way.
          WHOMP! The SOUND OF THE RACE floods in as the cars blow by,
          revealing Bishop amidst onlookers, watching, calculating.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          BISHOP'S P.O.V.: Two cars TANGLE in a corner, SPIN to a
          stop, crushing a half-million in beautiful restored antique.
          The Mark climbs from his wreck, tosses his helmet, pissed.
          Bishop raises a camera, takes a picture.

          EXT. BISHOP'S STUDY - DAY

          Bishop at his wall again, this time actively engaged, working
          it. A picture of the Mark in his vintage car goes up,
          underneath, Bishop tacks a stats page: "Fatality in auto
          accidents by type of impact. Head on, Side rear,..."
          Off to the side, bank statements, cash transfers. Saudi
          Arabia. Chechnya. United Arab Emirates.
          Bishop tacks more photos up. The Mark, getting off a private
          plane, the Mark, playing Polo...

          EXT. POLO GROUNDS - DAY

          WHACK! A Rider SLAMS a ball forward, spurs his horse
          onwards, bearing down on the ball... and SLAM! Another Rider
          comes in from the side, sends the man crashing off his horse.
          The second man, the Mark, takes a second to gloat over his
          fallen opponent before CHARGING onwards.
          IN THE STANDS. Bishop watches, takes a note on a pad.

          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - DAY

          Bishop keeps working, the wall completely covered now. Lists
          of possible deaths have been ordered, drawbacks circled.
          Bishop scans over various magazine covers featuring the Mark.
          One with a vintage hunting rifle slung low in his arms,
          unbroken. "American Dream or American Nightmare?"
          Bishop stares at this. Eyes moving over the wall, accident
          stats, a copy of a hunting-club reprimand... he's arrived.

          INT. RIVERWAY - NIGHT

          Bishop stands in front of a moving riverway, his body
          sheathed in a black slicksuit, backpack on. He slips into
          the water and starts to SWIM.
          We STAY with Bishop as he SWIMS HARD, powerfully, not tiring.
          Finally, we PULL AWAY, across miles of water, realizing this
          is what Bishop will swim without stopping.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

          EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT

          A pair of ARMED SECURITY patrol a wooded shore. One lifts a
          pair of binoculars, scans the shore as BEHIND THEM, a form
          moves from behind a tree, blends into the woods.
          ON BISHOP. Moving fast, silent, towards a LIT STRUCTURE in
          the distance...

          INT. HIDEAWAY - NIGHT

          BLACK. The SENSE that someone is in here with us...
          A LOW GREEN GLOW illuminates Bishop in a TINY, CRAMPED,
          COMPARTMENT. No way to know what or where. The glow, coming
          from his watch, illuminates his face, crammed and
          claustrophobic. An eye checks the time, the light goes out.
          Just the sound of his breathing...

          EXT. SPORTS CLUB WOODS - MORNING

          CRACK! CRACK! PLUMES OF SMOKE rise from the end of vintage
          hunting rifles. Game birds scatter into the air. Dogs BARK,
          tear through underbrush. MEN dressed in traditional hunting
          livery move through foggy woods, followed by STEWARDS.
          This is old school hunting, old school weapons. Camera finds
          The Mark, raising his weapon, sights... BLAM! A PHEASANT
          falls, dogs race after it. The Mark starts forward but is
          interrupted by his Steward reminding him to break his weapon
          as the other hunters have.
          The Mark pushes the man back, ignoring him, hurrying on. At
          a small distance, two unhappy private security guards follow.

          INT. HIDEAWAY - NO TIME

          BLACKNESS. A soft BEEPING, almost inaudible. A low rustle
          of cloth, then the green glow illuminates Bishop's face as he
          checks the time again. Hasn't moved in HOURS.

          EXT. SPORTS CLUB WOODS - MORNING

          The Mark stumbles forward, over-eager to get to his prize.
          He's worked his way ahead of the field. The MIST has grown
          thicker. Human forms move on all sides, hard to distinguish.
          CRACK! CRACK! Guns go off around them. Dogs rush by. The
          Mark brings the weapon to his face... BLAM!! The shot echoes
          through the foggy woods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          INT. SPORTING CLUB - DAY

          The Mark, pleased with himself as always, bursts into the
          lodge, gun over his shoulder. A round of APPLAUSE as his
          Steward holds up the morning's catch.
          He pushes on into the locker rooms as one security takes
          station at the door. The second emerges from the lockers,
          having just done his sweep.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM, SPORTING CLUB - DAY

          The Mark leans his vintage hunting rifle against the wall,
          opens his locker. He kicks off his boots, pulls off his
          shirt. Takes a second to rub his face with his hands. It
          can be exhausting being him.
          Behind the Mark, a locker door opens and closes. Like a
          ghost did it. He doesn't sense a thing, reaches for his
          weapon, accidentally knocks it to the side. It LANDS, HARD.
          The Mark WINCES, half expecting it to fire. But no.
          He starts to lean down for it when another man's gloved hands
          reach it first. The Mark smiles down at the well-dressed man
          crouched by the gun, a little confused.
          Bishop looks up, smiles back. He puts out a gloved hand.
          Before the Mark can consider, he's taken Bishop's hand.
          Bishop holds tight. The Mark's smile... fades.
          Even though we know it's coming, Bishop's actions are so fast
          and final we're taken by surprise. He PULLS the Mark in as
          at the same time he cocks the rifle's hammer, slams the gun
          into position, barrel pointed up and BOOM!
          The shot hits the Mark in the face, obliterates him, sends a
          plume of gore up against the ceiling.
          One, two seconds before the Mark's SECURITY rush into the
          room, guns lined. First sees the mess, puts a hand to his
          mouth. Second starts on the radio.
          The room is empty.

          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON

          A vintage 1972 Shelby Cobra parked by the edge of the river.
          Bishop emerges from the water, pops the trunk of the car.
          Towel and large rock inside. He towels off, tosses the suit
          and the rock into his pack, pack goes into the river. He
          grabs a sweater from inside the trunk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

          INT. BISHOP'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Bishop gets behind the wheel, dressed. He checks himself in
          the rearview, finds a bead of sweat traveling from his brow.
          Wipes it away, irritated, and starts the car.

          EXT. LOCAL GROCERY - EVENING

          Establishing. A quaint local convenience store off a two-
          lane road, nestled amidst trees. Bishop's vintage car pulls
          up and he gets out.

          INT. LOCAL GROCERY - CONTINUOUS

          Door jingles as Bishop steps in, smiles to the GROCER, a
          friendly beefy guy in his 60's who checks the clock. 7:00 on
          the nose.

                         GROCER
          'Evening, Arthur. Got your weekly
          right here.
          The man hoists two bags of groceries onto the counter.
          Bishop comes forward, sees the Owner's DAUGHTER behind the
          counter. 12, precocious, reading a dog-eared kid's book.

                         BISHOP
          Hey, Sophie. I got something for
          you, wanna see?
          The girl smiles, puts down the book and comes over. Bishop
          crouches in front of her. He puts out two empty hands, shows
          them back and front, then tickles one ear with a hand while
          the other "appears" a small daisy.
          The girl sees it, smiles... a little disappointed.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          I'm just kidding.
          Bishop reaches into his jacket, pulls out the next
          installment in the kid's book she's reading: A series
          featuring a young female Harry-Potter like character on the
          cover: LUNA CROMWELL.
          Sophie BEAMS, takes it. A quick hug and she's back to her
          seat, opening the new book.

                         GROCER
          What do you say, honey?

                         SOPHIE
          Thank you, Bishop.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         BISHOP
          You're very welcome.
          And she's back into the book. Bishop smiles, a little sad.
          It was nice... but the moment's over. He stands and collects
          his groceries.

                         GROCER
          See you next week, Arthur.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING

          A ranch-style compound, nestled in the hills. Warm, rustic,
          and inviting.
          Bishop's Cobra drives past the MAIN HOUSE, a large craftsman,
          into a BARN where he parks next to a collection of other
          beautiful vintage cars. He gets out, crosses the dirt drive
          towards his home. A STUDIO separate from the main house.
          Two horses graze in an attached paddock.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING

          Bishop's enters, flicking on lights. The home is beautiful,
          ordered. Everything a model of design and elegance. The
          walls are home to a collection of original and slightly
          sociopathic art. Lucian Freud, de Chirico, Zak Smith,
          Francis Bacon. Isolation, beauty, unrest...

          INT. BISHOP'S KITCHEN - EVENING

          Bishop unpacks his groceries. Organic. Raw. Supplements.
          Vitamins. Nothing looks delicious. His fridge is ordered.
          Glass containers in rows, lightly hued liquids in each.
          He opens a can of Friskies, sets it down for a mutt-like
          tabby-cat who lopes over and eats. Bishop scratches her
          behind the ears.

          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - EVENING

          Bishop flicks on lights illuminating the WALL covered with
          charts, documents, photographs of the Mark.
          He goes to a gas fireplace built into the side of the room,
          fires up the flames. A sideboard holds a collection of Vinyl
          Albums. Mint condition, collector. Fingers play over
          titles... Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Bob Dylan...
          The turntable needle hits Young's "Needle and the Damage
          Done." Music croons sweet into the room as pages, photos,
          everything goes into the fire.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          One photo in particular: The Mark, busy on the phone as a
          young girl pulls at his suit jacket. He was a criminal
          bastard, but also a father.
          Bishop stares down at the picture, consumed by fire,
          reflected in his eyes.

          INT. BISHOP'S GYM - NIGHT

          Bishop, running on a treadmill, full-tilt. A controlled
          sprint without end. The gym has all manner of customized
          exercise equipment. Weights, machines, a climbing wall, an
          infinite lap-pool.
          Bishop jumps off the treadmill, immediately takes his pulse,
          checks it against a clock on the wall, jots a note.
          Bishop, pressing weights. 300+ pounds. Reps over and over,
          Muscles HARD, STRAINING. In his eyes, almost a relaxed
          intensity. The rest of the world, turned off.
          Bishop RACKS the weights, LOUD. Immediately taking his
          pulse, checking the clock...

          INT. BISHOP'S GYM - LATER

          Bishop sits at a small desk, plotting the evening's work-out
          in a book. He traces columns, enters points on a graph.
          THE BOOK. Doesn't matter how impressive the numbers are,
          they've peaked and are now starting their inevitable slide...
          ON BISHOP. Staring at the book.

          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - NIGHT

          Bishops stands in front of his phone. He scrolls through the
          last ten calls that have come through. They all read
          "McKenna, Harry." Over and over. Three days' worth.

          INT. BISHOP'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Bishop eats dinner, alone at the end of a beautiful antique
          table. Hanging on the wall across from him, a vivid
          disturbing painting of three women.
          ON HIS PLATE. His food is a meal we might expect an
          astronaut to eat. Raw Spinach, a collection of supplements.
          He crunches through something that looks like cardboard,
          chews, stares at the painting. In his study, the phone
          rings. He eyeballs it, lets it ring.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

          INT. DEN, BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Bishop sits on the couch in front of the television, his cat
          curls under his arm, purring. Bishop flips channels through
          an endless display of over-amped human behavior. People HAW
          and WINK in the sitcoms, people YELL on the talk-shows,
          people CRY and LUST on the dramas. Flip. Flip.
          A news channel shows a PICTURE of The Mark. "Billionaire tech
          mogul dead in tragic accident." Two ANCHORS discuss...

          MALE NEWS ANCHOR
          ...here's a guy at the top of his
          game. And yes there were questions
          about the money: Where did it all
          go. Were some of his friends less
          than friendly to the US? But in
          the end, it's not the feds who
          catch up with him --

          FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR
          It's that age old adage that boys
          will be boys. These dangerous
          hobbies come with the risk of
          accidents like this --
          Bishops punches off the tv, heads for the door.

          EXT. HIGH-END APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Bishop pulls up in his car, looks up. Hundred of lit windows
          above him, lives going on behind each. He heads forward, the
          doorman holding the door for him.

          EXT. CORRIDOR, HIGH-RISE - MOMENTS LATER

          Bishop gets out of the elevator, stops in front of a door.
          Beat. He rings the bell.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE

                         (FROM INSIDE)
          It's open!
          Bishop pushes the door open, steps into...

          INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Beautifully, warmly furnished. Sofas surround a living area,
          a gas fire flickering. Throws and rugs. Art on the walls,
          tasteful and human. An open bottle of wine on a granite
          counter top.
          THE VIEW. Over all the city, thousands of lights twinkle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
          I'll just be a minute.
          We catch a GLIMPSE of the WOMAN. A towel over her hair,
          wearing a skirt and a bra, crossing from the bathroom into
          her bedroom. Even in the small glimpse, she's beautiful.
          Bishop looks down at a coffee table. Magazines, newspaper.
          A picture of the first Mark's elaborate funeral.

                         BISHOP
          I'm sorry I was away so long this
          time. I had some complications...
          He turns. She's emerged from the bedroom. 30's. Long dark
          hair, damp from the shower. Buttoning a shirt, the curve of
          her breasts caught as she does. A comfortable, sophisticated
          air about her. Effortlessly attractive.

                         WOMAN
          You don't have to apologize. I'm
          just glad you're here now.

                         (BEAT)
          Are you hungry?
          She starts to move by him, his hand catches her arm and she
          is in his arms, holding him TIGHT, kissing him.

          WOMAN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I just... miss you. I
          never thought I was going to be a
          "woman who waits." But I do. I
          wait for you.
          He nods. She breaks off, pours red wine in a glass.

          WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Were you in Europe? Africa?

                         (BEAT)
          Was there another woman?

                         BISHOP
          No.

                         WOMAN
          Liar. It's alright. I don't mind.
          (Suddenly shifting gears)
          I... I made something for you.
          She picks up a remote, fire up a large flatscreen TV. Hits a
          button. A moment, then an IMAGE flickers to life.
          ON THE TV: The WOMAN, sitting in this same living room. She
          wears a long sleeve shirt over panties. Sips a glass of
          wine. Smiles warm at the camera. The silence of late night.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          WOMAN ON CAMERA
          Hey, you. Just got back from the
          weekend at the lake with Julianne
          and Barry and their kids. Their
          oldest is five. You'd like him.

                         (BEAT)
          Everybody spoke about you, of
          course. We should go up there
          sometime, just the two of us...
          ON THE TV: She reaches towards the camera and the image
          JUMPS AHEAD. Another night, late. The WOMAN enters the
          frame, now wearing a stunning black party dress.

          WOMAN ON CAMERA (CONT'D)
          (announcing, giggling)
          I, just got back from seeing the
          most boring opening at the Pierre
          Grochet gallery. And of course
          everyone's asking where you are and
          of course I made your apologies,
          but what I was thinking...
          ON THE TV: She winks at the camera, happily drunk. Raises
          her dress a little, suggestive...

          WOMAN ON CAMERA (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPER)
          Why weren't you here to take me
          home and make love to me...?
          She blows a kiss. Closes her eyes...
          ON BISHOP: Watching. Emotion breaks the surface.
          The WOMAN raises the remote. Turns off the image. Looks at
          Bishop. Plain, not demanding. But caring.

                         BISHOP
          I'm not a man who... It wouldn't
          be good for you, if I was around
          all the time.

                         WOMAN
          I know. I know.
          She moves to him and they are kissing fierce.

          INT. BEDROOM, HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Bishop and the woman make love. She's the aggressor at
          first, pulling away Bishop's clothing, climbing on top of
          him, pulling her own clothes away...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          Bishop grabs the woman who LAUGHS in ecstacy. He reverses
          her, throwing her down on the bed, climbing on top. The two
          of them, eye to eye as they fuck...

          INT. BEDROOM, HIGH RISE APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          Early morning light filters into the room. Bishop, awake,
          staring at the sleeping woman. His eyes click over to the
          clock which reaches 6:00 am. As if he's been waiting, Bishop
          rises and dresses, silently.

          INT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          Bishop stands in front of the plate glass windows. He turns
          and moves to a music box on a shelf, opens it. A melancholy
          tune plays. He admires the machinery as he removes twenty
          $100 bills from his wallet, tucks them under the box...

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
          Stay for breakfast?
          He turns. She's standing in the doorway, tying a robe around
          herself. A cool professionalism inhabits her demeanor. Not
          crass or mean-spirited, but the romance is gone.

                         BISHOP
          Do I ever?

                         WOMAN
          No. But there's a first time for
          everything.
          Bishop goes to the DVD player, slots out the DVD they watched
          the night before and pockets it.

                         BISHOP
          Thank you. This was a good one.
          See you next time.

                         WOMAN
          Bishop... You all right?
          He turns, studies her. This is new ground. He nods and
          leaves. She stares a moment at the door after he's gone.

          EXT. WOODS - MORNING

          Bishop, running. Full-tilt again, a maintained sprint. He
          maneuvers through trees, over rocks. Below him, through the
          woods, his home comes into view...
          ... a BLACK BENTLEY sits parked in front of the house. A MAN
          on a cell phone stands by it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

          The man wears a mid-level suit, a hired professional.

                         MAN
          (into a phone)
          Yes, I just got here. No, not yet.
          He turns, REACTS as Bishop is there, CLOSE, barely sweating.

          MAN (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hold on, I got him.
          The man holds his cell phone out for Bishop. A beat, Bishop
          studying the angles... he takes the phone.

          MCKENNA (O.S.)
          Arthur? Jesus Christ, Arthur, is
          that you?

                         BISHOP
          ...How are you, Harry?

          MCKENNA (O.S.)
          Oh you know, I'm God Damn perfect.
          I'm redecorating my fucking office
          and I wanted your advice on the god
          forsaken curtains is how I am.
          (beat, serious)
          This is... this is something,
          Arthur. I need to see you, for old
          time's sake.

          INT. BENTLEY - DAY

          Bishop sits in the back, looks out at the city moving around
          them as the man drives. They approach the armored gates of a
          business tower: MCKENNA HOLDING CORP. The driver nods at
          SECURITY who recognize the car, open the gate. The car drops
          down into the garage under the building.

          INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

          Bishop and the man exit the Bentley. Four more ARMED
          SECURITY down here, seated around a table, eating delivery
          from a local Deli. Two stand, one steps forward.

                         SECURITY
          Sorry, gotta do this...
          Patient, Bishop puts his arms out as the man searches him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          INT. MCKENNA HOLDING CORP. - DAY

          Bishop steps out of the elevator into a top-level wonderland
          of money manipulation. Desks, crushed with monitors, manned
          by casually brilliant MIT-grads. Flat screens track the
          markets. All of this overseen by a witch's tit of a MANAGER
          who eyeballs Bishop coolly.
          A tapping gets Bishop's attention. The corner office is
          glass-walled. HARRY MCKENNA is tapping on it, gesturing
          Bishop inside.

          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - MOMENTS LATER

          The office is high-tech. Harry less so. 60's. Overweight
          and doesn't give a shit. Cigars in a ashtray, ash-burns on
          the Persian rugs. A man to be reckoned with, in his time.
          The time has perhaps passed.
          Harry comes out from behind his desk, points Bishop to a big
          leather sofa. Bishop perches on the arm.

                         BISHOP
          I like the new digs.
          McKenna LAUGHS, like a grunt. Fiddles with his hearing aid,
          turning it up. Bishop's eyes track.

                         MCKENNA
          Has it really been that long?
          Jesus.

                         (BEAT)
          You know how they say youth is lost
          on the young? They're right. If I
          had my nineteen year old body back,
          I wouldn't be here, I'll tell you
          that. I'd be out there, making it
          my personal life mission to bang
          every stewardess who ever dared put
          on one of those whatchamacallit
          skirts.

                         BISHOP
          Times have changed, Harry. They
          don't wear skirts anymore.
          McKenna eyeballs Bishop, shakes his head. He goes to the
          glass wall, points out at the screens, financial markets.

                         MCKENNA
          You know what all that is?
          (off Bishop's nod)
          That's their money, getting moved,
          exchanged. Made clean and neat and
          proper for Uncle Sam. And I have
          always been extremely careful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          McKenna goes to his desk, tosses legal papers on the table
          between them.

          MCKENNA (CONT'D)
          You know what that is? That's a
          God damn subpoena from the Justice
          Department. We get a new face in
          the white house, all of a sudden
          they want to look at my records.
          They got accountants want to go
          through MY BOOKS. Are you kidding
          me? I got the left hand coming
          after me for what I did for the
          right hand.
          Bishop looks over the papers, nods.

          MCKENNA (CONT'D)
          So I call them up. I say "hey, you
          guys gotta get your own house in
          order..."

                         BISHOP
          And...

                         MCKENNA
          And? And that's the point!
          Nothing. I tell them they have a
          problem here and instead of dealing
          with it I get silence, zippo, fuck-
          all. What are they, twelve?

                         BISHOP
          ...I don't see how I can --

                         MCKENNA
          That's bullshit, Arthur. Your
          father -- they still talk about the
          guy like he walked on water. You,
          they'll listen to. You --

                         BISHOP
          I'm not a part of that.
          McKenna stares out the window at the street below, nervous.
          Shakes a pill out of as small vial, pops it. He chuckles,
          shakes his head.

                         MCKENNA
          You remember that fishing trip we
          all took, back in the day. You
          were, what? About eight, right?
          (Off Bishop's nod)
          You fell out of the boat...
          couldn't swim a stroke. City kid.
          (Animated, laughing)
          You're in the water, splashing
          around.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         MCKENNA (CONT'D)
          You got these big eyes like
          saucers, like you're sure you're
          gonna drown. Splashing...
          swallowing water... just STARING at
          your father and he's not making a
          move. Remember? Just looking down
          at you like...
          Suddenly it's gotten less funny.

          MCKENNA (CONT'D)
          I finally had to grab you by the
          hair, pull you back into the boat.
          You're shivering like hell and he --
          your dad -- gives one of those
          laughs. Those big laughs everyone
          loved him for.

                         (BEAT)
          Anyway, the whole time you're in
          the water, you didn't cry out. Not
          once. You were a tough
          sonofabitch, even then.

                         BISHOP
          That was a long time ago, Harry.
          McKenna turns from the window, takes in all his monitors,
          charts. Stock lines tick up and down, graphs flow, pulse...

                         MCKENNA
          Well, I'm in the water this time,
          Arthur. You think it's easy for me
          to ask? It cuts like hell. But
          that's what I'm doing.
          Bishop eyes the barely open doorway into a small room off the
          office. Pillows and blankets on a sofa. Some clothes strewn
          about. McKenna's been sleeping here.
          A long beat. Bishop... nods. The tension seems to DRAIN
          from McKenna. He claps Bishop on the back, nods back.

          MCKENNA (CONT'D)
          ...Thank you. Thank you.
          THROUGH THE GLASS WALL OF THE OFFICE. Bishop's eyes track as
          elevator doors open and STEVE MCKENNA steps out, a beautiful
          young woman with him, LOUISE. She's a trophy, the woman you
          get for being top dog and the one you regret getting.
          Gorgeous, self-obsessed, entitled. She flops onto a leather
          sofa as Steve moves towards the office.
          Steve's young, mid-20's, strikingly handsome, wearing the
          casual uniform of wealth not earned. But there's something
          else that arrests Bishop immediately. Unwasted motion,
          detachment, observing the world around him... from above.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          Even as Steve nods to one of his father's security and pushes
          into the room, he picks up Bishop. The two men lock eyes, a
          strange reflection not of appearance, but of nature.

          MCKENNA (CONT'D)
          And here's the prodigal son,
          arrived to bilk me for ransom.

                         (TO STEVE)
          Steve, this is Arthur Bishop.
          Steve shakes Bishop's hand. Strong. Observant.

                         STEVE
          Hey. Nice to meet you. You work
          for my father?

                         MCKENNA
          No, quite the opposite. Arthur's
          doing me a little favor.

                         STEVE
          So you're a criminal?

                         MCKENNA
          That's enough.

                         STEVE
          Relax, relax. I'm kidding.
          A last beat between Steve and Bishop, then Steve lets it go,
          turns his attention to his father.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          I need you to make a donation to
          Louise's charity. She's mounting
          some kind of fundraiser and she
          wants to make sure we do our part.

                         MCKENNA
          What's it for?

                         STEVE
          I have no idea. And don't pretend
          you care, either. Write the check,
          go to the party, smile when the

                         ORPHANS-SLASH-HOMELESS-WIDOWS THANK
          you and call you a great and
          generous man.

                         MCKENNA

                         (TO BISHOP)
          You ever think of having kids,
          Arthur?

                         BISHOP
          Nope.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          Wearily, McKenna brings out his checkbook.

                         MCKENNA
          Wise man. How much?

                         STEVE
          Thirty thousand.
          (Suddenly, to Bishop)
          You know, I can't tell what you're
          thinking, Mr. Bishop. Usually, I'm
          very good with that, with people.
          Sort of like a bullshit detector I
          developed. But you're very... hard
          to read.

                         BISHOP
          Sorry.

                         STEVE
          Don't be. So what are you
          thinking?

                         BISHOP
          I was thinking that a son, should
          be more grateful to his father.

                         STEVE

                         (NODDING)
          I agree. I agree. I often wonder
          why I'm not.
          McKenna tears the check out, hands it to Steve.

                         MCKENNA
          There. Now go away.

                         STEVE
          Thank you, dad. Are we going to
          see you at the house any time soon?

                         MCKENNA
          Yeah, this is just a few more days.
          We got this... situation.
          Steve hears the dark in his father's tone, tracks it.

                         STEVE
          Anything I can do?

                         MCKENNA
          You? Yeah, you can earn some
          money. Get married.

                         (BEAT)
          No, it's going to be okay now.
          Arthur's helping me out.
          Steve glances between the two men. Ego slightly bruised.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         STEVE
          Well it's good to meet you Mr.
          Bishop. My father seems to trust
          you, which is... unusual.
          Bishop and McKenna watch as he hits the atrium, hands Louise
          the check who goes out of her mind, jumping up and down,
          giving him a kiss that speaks of more to come, trotting off.
          Steve glances back one more time, then follows her.

                         MCKENNA
          We will take from our children for
          a lifetime what we would not suffer
          from another man for an instant.
          Explain that to me.
          (off Bishop's silence)
          Okay. Okay, call me when you hear
          something.

                         BISHOP
          You take care of yourself, Harry.

                         MCKENNA
          Well, that's your job now, isn't
          it?

          INT. PARKING GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

          Bishop exits the elevator. Security holds the door to the
          Bentley open for him. Bishop shakes his head, walks out.

          INT. ARTIST'S STUDIO - AFTERNOON

          Bishop exits an old freight elevator, enters this HUGE loft
          space. Old architecture divided by free-standing walls hung
          with PAINTINGS from the same artist who's work hangs in
          Bishop's home. Intense, slightly surreal, deeply haunting.
          Nudes, raw. Men's faces, distraught, alone.
          A matronly ART DEALER comes forward familiar, takes his hand.

                         ART DEALER
          Arthur. Glad you're here. Right
          this way.
          As they move across the space Bishop catches sight of a
          MODEL, lying nude in a pool of blue paint. Across from her,
          The ARTIST is full-focused on her. He's roughly Bishop's
          age. Cigarette dangles off a lip, tattoos on his arms.
          Fully comfortable and committed to the alternative life.
          The model senses Bishop's gaze, looks over, unashamed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

          ART DEALER (CONT'D)
          This way.
          Bishop follows the Dealer into another area where they
          approach a canvas. It's a portrait of a young boy, alone.
          The effect is of rage-filled isolation.

          ART DEALER (CONT'D)
          Zak is almost finished. It will
          make a wonderful addition to your
          collection.
          Bishop looks at the canvas. Nods. Glances back to where the
          artist is carefully adjusting his model's position.

          ART DEALER (CONT'D)
          Do you want to meet him?

                         BISHOP
          ...No.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Bishop enters his home, sets his things down. Stares at his
          phone a beat, then on impulse picks it up and dials. The
          voice that answers is female, official.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
          Good evening, Mr. Bishop. How can
          I help you?

                         BISHOP
          Yes. I'd like to speak to Dean.
          There's a brief pause on the phone, then.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
          ...Mr. Dean is not available right
          now. Can I take a message?

                         BISHOP
          No. Just tell him I called.
          Bishop hangs up, stares at the phone.
          The doorbell rings. Bishop opens it to find a DHL COURIER on
          his doorstep. Bishop is suddenly casual, friendly. The
          public face of Bishop.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          Hello, Don. They make you drive
          all the way out here this evening?

                         DON
          That's the job.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          The man gestures to the open barn door, the classic cars.

          DON (CONT'D)
          You find tires for that old
          FleetMaster?

                         BISHOP

                         (SIGNING)
          No, not yet. Maybe when I do,
          we'll take it out for a spin. Say
          hello to the wife for me.

                         DON
          Will do. Good night, Arthur.
          The man heads back towards his truck. Bishop tears away the
          strip that seals the envelope, a small USB jump-drive slides
          into his hands. The friendly grin on Bishop's face...
          evaporates.

          INT. STUDY - NIGHT

          Bishop fires up a computer hooked to a printer. He slots the
          USB drive into the computer. Nothing seems to happen, just a
          low pulsing red light on the drive.
          Almost instantly, his phone rings and he answers. Silence.

                         BISHOP

                         (INTO PHONE)
          We should all be so lucky.
          Click. The phone goes dead. Almost at the same time, the
          glowing red light on the jump-drive turns GREEN.
          Bishop's PRINTER fires up. It starts printing out pages. A
          few medical charts... and then a photograph: Harry McKenna.
          The new mark.

          INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Bishop eats. Lost in thought. Eyes play over his art...

          INT. STUDY - NIGHT

          Bishop hits the study, work-mode. All hesitation gone.
          Pages are tacked up, other ripped down and tossed. He takes
          out a thick pen, circles words: "Syncope cardiac spasms..."
          "Prognosis..." "Poor eustachian tube function..."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

          Bishop sits at a desk under a reading lamp, making notes out
          of a stack of books. Medical textbooks. Charts. A diagram
          of the central nervous system. Stress tests. The technical
          specs for an electronic device.

          INT. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE - DAY

          Bishop receives a SET OF PLANS from an attendant. Spreads
          them out over a counter. In the corner, a large photocopier.

          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - EVENING

          Bishop sits at his desk, a Jeweler's Loup over one eye,
          working with soldering iron and electronic tools, meticulous.
          Behind him, tacked to the wall, are copies of the building
          plans. Heavily inked. Routes in and out penned in.
          Locations of security. Photographs. He's done his recon.
          Sitting in the sun on a window ledge: an open jar of
          Mayonnaise, turning rancid. A fly buzzes around it.
          THROUGH THE JEWELER'S LOUP: Bishop is working on a hearing
          aide. Tweezers adjust a tiny chip, slot it into place...
          Phone rings. Bishop eyes it for a beat. Snaps it up. The
          voice on the other end is world weary, professional. DEAN.

          DEAN (O.S.)
          Bishop. I heard you called. Hey,
          you get the stuff I sent you?

                         BISHOP
          That's what I called about. I know
          him. I think there might be a

                         MISUNDERSTANDING --

          DEAN (O.S.)
          Hold on a second.
          A long pause. Just air on the line. Bishop stares at his
          work in front of him, his research on McKenna tacked to the
          wall. Dean's voice comes back as suddenly as it departed.

          DEAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          No, it's been decided. This one's
          a go. You take care of yourself,
          Bishop.
          The line goes dead. Bishop stares at the phone for a second,
          sets it down. He looks up at Harry's picture on the wall.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

          EXT. CITYSCAPE - MORNING

          The sun rises over the city, shafts of light illuminating the
          top floor plate glass of McKenna Holding Corp. The SOUND OF
          A PHONE RINGING, being picked up.

                         MCKENNA'S VOICE
          Hello?

                         BISHOP'S VOICE
          They want to talk. I'm picking you
          up in an hour.

                         MCKENNA'S VOICE

                         ARTHUR --

                         BISHOP'S VOICE
          Send your people home. I don't
          want anyone I don't know near you
          today. I'm serious.

                         MCKENNA'S VOICE
          ...Thank you, Arthur.

          INT. DELI - MORNING

          Bishop hangs up his phone, watches as three bags of food are
          put up on the TO GO counter. "McKenna Garage" scrawled.
          Bishop approaches the counter, reaches over the bags for his
          own food, pushing his drink onto the floor.

                         BISHOP
          I'm sorry. My bad.
          The guy at the counter shrugs, turns for a mop. Bishop
          quickly reaches into the McKenna bag, switches a wrapped
          sandwich for one he brought.

          EXT. MCKENNA HOLDING CORP. - DAY

          A white van passes the entrance to the underground garage,
          pulls into the Alley behind the building and stops.

          INT. WHITE VAN - CONTINUOUS

          Bishop kills the engine, pushes aside a curtain and heads
          into the back of the van which is empty aside for a heavy
          acetylene torch. The bottom of the van is covered by a thick
          black matt which Bishop kicks with his foot.
          The matt falls aside revealing a large HOLE in the bottom of
          the van, right down to the pavement and the welded steel
          cover Bishop has parked on top of.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.
          Bishop picks up the torch, SPARKS IT.

          INT. PARKING GARAGE - MORNING

          The four SECURITY are eating their delivered lunch. Security
          #1 puts a hand to his gut. Security #2 looks over.

                         SECURITY #2
          Hey, you okay?

                         SECURITY #1
          Actually, call central. I'm not --
          And with that, he's suddenly up and MOVING towards the
          bathroom. Security #2 raises his radio.

          INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP. - DAY

          Elevator doors open. Another SECURITY GUARD steps out,
          checks in by radio and heads down a corridor.
          IN THE ELEVATOR behind him, Bishop drops through the ceiling
          hatch, dressed casual. He hits a button, doors close.

          INT. MCKENNA'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Elevator doors open and Bishop steps out into the office.
          Deserted. Monitors glow, tracking markets and trades. But
          the human element is gone.
          Except for Harry, alone, silhouetted at one of his large
          plate windows, watching the sun rise over the city.

                         MCKENNA
          You ever wonder what the last day
          of your life will feel like,
          Arthur?

                         BISHOP
          You keep standing next to that
          window, maybe you'll be able to
          tell me.
          McKenna looks over, smiles weary. He looks exhausted. He
          goes to his desk, picks up a tie, looks to Bishop.

                         MCKENNA
          This turns out alright, I'm going
          to send you a dozen Thai hookers
          and a case of Cuban Esplandidos.
          You can return the hookers if you
          want, but the cigars...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         BISHOP

                         (SMILING)
          I don't smoke.

                         MCKENNA
          You will, my friend. For these,
          you will.

          INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Bishop and McKenna heading down. McKenna watches the
          numbers. Bishop studies McKenna... then, casually:

                         BISHOP
          Why the change of security?

                         MCKENNA
          ...What?
          Beat. Bishop SLAPS the STOP button. Elevator jerks to a
          halt. Bishop gets a finger into the doors, PRIES them open.

          MCKENNA (CONT'D)
          Arthur...?
          McKenna looks at the effort, sighs. Lets Bishop help him
          down. Halfway through, BALANCE SHIFTS, McKenna starts to
          fall. Bishop STEADIES him. McKenna STARES at Bishop,
          concerned. Bishop nods, heading towards the STAIRS,
          pocketing a small hearing aide as he goes.
          ON MCKENNA, touching the hearing aide in his ear...

                         BISHOP
          Come on...

          INT. STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

          Bishop and McKenna reach the bottom of the stairwell.
          McKenna's winded, steadying himself against a wall. Bishop
          cracks the door, peers out.

                         BISHOP
          What the hell...?
          McKenna moves in, pushes Bishop aside.
          MCKENNA'S P.O.V.: His SECURITY. Only there are two new
          faces in the garage. Replacements packing weaponry.

                         MCKENNA
          This isn't good, Arthur...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         BISHOP
          Listen to me. Stay here. I'm
          going to check it out.

                         MCKENNA
          Bishop, those men are armed...

                         BISHOP
          Harry, relax. I know what I'm
          doing.
          And Bishop slips out the door, shutting it behind him.

          INT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

          The moment he's out, he turns and sinks down in front of it,
          blocking it with his back. He opens his jacket, brings out a
          small TRANSMITTER. Waits a beat, then flicks a switch.

          INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

          McKenna there, STARING at the door. Nothing. He approaches
          the steel door, tries the handle. Can't open it. Nervous,
          he carefully puts his head against the door to listen...
          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The SOUND OF GUNFIRE, VOICES fill
          McKenna's ears. He staggers back, crouched, terrified...
          CLOSE ON HIS HEARING AIDE: The sounds of gunfire is coming
          from it. BLAM! BLAM! More shots, then the sound of
          POUNDING on the door.

                         BISHOP'S VOICE
          Harry! It's a trap! RUN!!!
          The door flies opens and Bishop LURCHES IN, gun raised.
          McKenna starts up the stairs, breathing hard. Behind him, he
          can see Bishop, gun lined back at the door. BLAM! BLAM!
          Gunshots assault his eardrums.

          INT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

          On the other side of the door, Security hears the door slam,
          looks over for a moment, but there's nothing else.

          INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

          McKenna picks up the pace, hauling himself upwards. Sweat
          POURING off him, eyes wild. He stops, tries to catch his
          breath. Shooting PAIN through his right arm, he grabs it
          just as MORE GUNFIRE SOUNDS from below.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          Bishop comes rushing up the stairs. His shirt stained with
          blood. Gun in his hand.

                         BISHOP
          Come on! If we can get to the roof
          I can hold them off! Come on!
          McKenna GULPS AIR, staggers on...

          EXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - MOMENTS LATER

          Door BLOWS open, McKenna staggers onto the rooftop. The
          manic victory of having made it clashing with the tragic
          knowledge that his heart is rebelling.
          He falls to his knees, clutching his right arm. PAIN
          coursing through his body. Unaware for the moment that
          everything has gone silent.
          FEET come into his view. He looks up, sees Bishop standing
          over him. Bishop's face is a death mask. Emotion removed.
          Harry stares into his eyes... and understands.

                         MCKENNA
          ...You.
          Bishop nods. McKenna CACKLES which turns into a scream as
          PAIN sends him reeling. He falls, hitting his head. Blood
          rolls down his face.

          MCKENNA (CONT'D)
          You bastard. You... Sonofabitch.
          You didn't have the balls... The
          balls to AARRRGHHHH!
          He CONVULSES. Tears stream down his face. His body HEAVING,
          not giving up the ghost.
          ON BISHOP. We know it's in there. But it doesn't show.
          Instead he checks his watch, calculates time...

          MCKENNA (CONT'D)
          Oh God. Oh, Jesus Christ help me.

          ARRGHHHH!!! ARRRRGHHHHHH!!!!
          Please... Please... Please...
          McKenna stops struggling, stares up at Bishop. Tears
          streaming down his face.

          MCKENNA (CONT'D)
          Please, Arthur, put me out of my
          misery. Your father...
          Bishop checks his watch again, doesn't meet McKenna's eyes.
          Checks the stair door, looks over the building edge...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          MCKENNA (CONT'D)
          Please. I'm scared. I'm really
          god damn scared...
          Suddenly Bishop MOVES. Lightening fast, wrapping up
          McKenna's head, fingers PRESSING expertly along arteries.
          McKenna STARES UP one horrible second, then goes limp in his
          arms, dead.
          Bishop releases, stands, stares down. For the first time,
          uncertainty in his face. Why did he do that? He looks at
          the body, at his hands, out at the city. Wipes his forehead
          with the back of a hand, furious at himself.
          He reaches down, removes the hearing aide from McKenna's ear,
          replaces it with the original, turns away.
          SEEN FROM FAR ABOVE. McKenna's body, alone on the rooftop.

          EXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - NIGHT

          WITH STEVE as he pushes through doors into a MASS of Police,
          detectives, private security, lawyers, all milling about on
          phones, gathered around a figure on the ground...

          INT. ARTIST'S STUDIO - NIGHT

          The Art Dealer hands Bishop the finished painting, wrapped.
          At the far end of the studio the Artist and his friends smoke
          and drink and laugh. Bishop nods thanks, turns and leaves.

          EXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - NIGHT

          Steve stares down at his dead father. A COP draws a line
          around the body. Steve is expressionless.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Bishop backs off from the wall where he has just hung the new
          painting of the boy. It stares back at him.

          EXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - EARLY MORNING

          Blue-gray morning. Cold wind blows across the rooftop.
          Steve watches the last police leave. He's alone. He stares
          down at the outline where his father lay.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          EXT. CEMTERY - DAY

          A funeral in progress, hundreds of flower arrangements,
          decorations, fit for a head of state. A few dozen attendees.
          At the front, Steve McKenna sits in front of his father's
          coffin, cold. His girlfriend Louise next to him, weeping.
          She cries at funerals.
          Bishop stands at the back. His eyes scan over the
          proceedings. Sixth-sense, Steve suddenly turns his head,
          makes eye contact with Bishop.

                         PRIEST
          His good works comfort all of us,
          even in his going. We commit his
          remains to your earth, oh Father,
          and we pray you vouchsafe him
          eternal life and that you bring
          comfort to those who have been left
          behind. His only son, Steve, who
          is himself devoted to --
          The Priest falters as Steve rises, moves away from the event.
          Bishop tracks him as he wanders through gravestones.

          PRIEST (CONT'D)
          ...Glory be to the Father, and to
          the Son, and to the Holy Ghost...

          EXT. CEMTERY - DAY (LATER)

          At the gravesite, men fill in the hole with dirt. Nearby,
          six limousines are lined up. But only the one directly after
          the hearse has its door open for Louise who stands, waiting,
          looking for Steve.
          Bishop watches the dirt hit the coffin. Then looks over as
          Steve approaches through mausoleums.

                         BISHOP
          My condolences.

                         STEVE

                         (NODS)
          Yeah, Harry was a popular guy.
          Good to see so many of his friends
          here. Touching.
          Bishop considers, tracks the attendees who pass by a suited
          man as they leave... Each of them receiving and pocketing an
          envelope as they do. Bishop looks back to Steve.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Best grief money can buy. Give me
          a ride home?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          Bishop nods to the head limo where Louise is waving
          impatiently at Steve to come.

                         BISHOP
          Looks like you have one.

                         STEVE
          Yeah, all of that. Empty limos.
          Fake guests. All so that the
          papers print what an important and
          respected man Harry was.
          Steve takes in the one or two guests, already counting their
          money a few yards away. Shakes his head.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Well, I hope it's what Harry would
          have wanted. But it's not for me.
          Beat. Bishop nods.

          INT. BISHOP'S CAR - DAY

          Bishop steers the car into the hills, past high-end estates.

                         STEVE
          You know, what I don't get is you.
          Harry didn't have any friends.

                         BISHOP
          Your dad worked with my father a
          long time ago.

                         STEVE
          So?

                         BISHOP
          So, just paying my respects.

                         STEVE
          So your old man was into all that?

                         BISHOP

                         (SMALL NOD)
          Yeah, he was into all that.

                         STEVE
          Well, that is refreshingly honest,
          Mr. Bishop. What about you?
          Bishop doesn't answer, steers the car up a manicured drive.
          P.O.V. - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: An ESTATE. A main house,
          lawns, pools, guest houses.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - AFTERNOON

          Steve and Bishop get out of the car. The McKenna estate was
          modeled neoclassical for a wanna-be emperor. Now a week of
          youth with limitless credit has left its mark. A SOUND
          SYSTEM has been set up poolside. A DJ spins a trance-like
          deep groove. YOUNG WOMEN lounge around the pool in bikinis,
          less. Beautiful and bored. YOUNG MEN, most dressed modern
          hip-hop, mostly white, eyeball the women, fist-bump each
          other, drink beers.
          Steve takes the whole thing in, nods, somehow pleased.

                         STEVE
          Why is it so comforting, when
          people surpass even our lowest
          expectations?

                         (BEAT)
          Come on in, meet the crowd.

                         BISHOP
          No, thanks. I've got to --

                         STEVE
          Please. A favor to me. None of
          these people even remembered what
          today was.
          Bishop nods. They move into the scene. People recognize
          Steve, hug or bump-fists. Steve's friendly, but stays locked
          on Bishop. Bishop observes it all, not uncomfortable.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Do you believe in fate, Mr. Bishop?

                         BISHOP
          Why?
          A basketball hoop has been set up near the pool. Young men
          take turns dunking and then landing in the water.

                         STEVE
          I think maybe we're all doomed to
          become our fathers. I'll probably
          die spoiled, corrupt, lonely and
          alone. Runs in the blood. What
          would that make you?

                         BISHOP
          You're still young. You can do
          pretty much whatever you please.
          AT THE HOT TUB, two girls kiss each other, filmed in DV by an
          young entrepreneur.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         STEVE
          You think so? Just chuck all this
          and go help the children in South
          America, something like that?

                         BISHOP
          Maybe.

                         STEVE
          Well look at you, Mr. Bishop.
          You're a dreamer.
          Steve heads inside. A beat, Bishop follows.

          INT. MCKENNA ESTATE - AFTERNOON

          As soon as they enter, Steve finds himself locked up by two
          BEAUTIES who whisper excitedly in his ear.

                         BEAUTY #1
          Well? Do you want to...?

                         STEVE
          No, in fact I'm pretty sure that's
          illegal in this state.

                         (TO BISHOP)
          Come on, this way.
          Steve leaves the Beauties disappointed, moves up some stairs.
          Bishop follows.

          INT. MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

          Steve and Bishop move into another room where two HUGE
          flatscreens have converted the room into a Wii court. Young
          muscle-bound posers play a first person head-to-head shoot-em
          game. Others drink, CHEER.
          Two bump fists with Steve. One fronts cool at Bishop, fakes
          a punch at him. Bishop just watches, doesn't do a thing.
          The kid smiles, nods...
          On the floor, paintings of Harry McKenna, discarded.

          INT. MASTER SUITE, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

          This used to be Harry's realm. Now Steve's taken it over.
          Giant ornate king bed. Huge balcony overlooking the estate.
          Steve goes to the railing of the balcony, looks down at the
          grounds, the people. Bishop hangs back, glances into a
          private study, untouched from when Harry ruled there.
          Papers, books, a portrait of Harry over the desk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         STEVE
          You know, I went up there. To
          where my father died.

                         BISHOP
          Oh?

                         STEVE
          Hell of a place to die. Lonely...
          Bishop comes abreast of Steve, also looks down. Removed from
          the party and the pool area, a separate area of the estate
          contains an outdoor gym. Weights, exercise equipment, a
          fighting matt and martial arts equipment all present.

                         BISHOP
          (off the gym area)
          That all yours?

                         STEVE
          If the body is weak, the mind can't
          be strong.
          Bishop nods, impressed. Something about this young man.
          Engaged, observing Bishop, but not needy.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Steve! Steve, man. It's Louise.
          At the door, a FRIEND of Steve's is held back by security.

                         FRIEND
          She's up in the bungalow. I think
          she might really do it this time.

                         STEVE

                         (TO BISHOP)
          My girlfriend thinks that my
          father's death is a good time to
          kill herself. She thinks I'm not
          showing the appropriate human
          reaction.

                         BISHOP
          I'll let myself out.

                         STEVE
          No, please. You've seen this much.
          Aren't you interested? I am.
          Off Bishop...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          EXT. BUNGALOW, MCKENNA ESTATE - EARLY EVENING

          Steve and Bishop push through a guarded gate, up a small path
          arriving at a beautiful bungalow, set back in the gardens.
          Candle light glows inside.

          INT. BUNGALOW, MCKENNA ESTATE - EARLY EVENING

          Louise is nude, immersed in the water of a jacuzzi located in
          the center of the room. On the side, she has a bottle of
          scotch, some pills, and two razor blades.
          She looks up at Steve, streaked eyes dart to Bishop.

                         LOUISE
          Who's he?

                         STEVE
          A friend. Would have thought you'd
          have started by now.

                         LOUISE
          This isn't about me. It's about
          you. You need to watch.
          Steve crouches down, pours himself a shot from her whiskey
          bottle. Something angry and cold in his eyes.

                         STEVE
          Okay. I'm here. I'm watching.

                         LOUISE
          You don't believe I'll do it.

                         STEVE
          No, I know you, Louise. You'll do
          just about anything if it'll get
          you enough attention.

                         LOUISE
          You think you can hide behind that
          cool attitude. Like nothing
          matters to you. But I know you.
          You care. You feel.

                         STEVE
          Do I?
          Louise blinks, scared a little. But she pushes the fear
          away, picks up one of the razor blades. A beat, then with a
          quick gesture, she slices across one wrist. Blood rises to
          the surface, runs down her arms into the water.
          Steve doesn't move. Neither does Bishop. Louise picks up
          the second blade with the cut hand. Fingers fumble, but she
          gets it. Slices across her other wrist.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          Blood runs... stains the water rose.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          ...Wow.

                         LOUISE
          How long will it take?

                         STEVE

                         (HE SHRUGS)
          Mr. Bishop?
          Bishop rises, looks down at her in the tub.

                         BISHOP
          How much do you weigh?

                         LOUISE
          A hundred and ten.
          His eyes take in her body, the flow from her wrists...

                         BISHOP
          You're a hundred and twenty-five.
          It'll take an hour and a half,
          maybe two. When you get cold...
          then you'll know you're close.
          Steve takes in Bishop in this moment, nods. Glances at the
          clock: 9:30. Then he refills his drink, heads out to the
          patio outside. Sits facing away from them.

                         LOUISE
          He'll stop it. He thinks he's
          above it all. But he's not. No
          one is.
          Bishop nods. Not clear if he's agreeing or observing.

          EXT. BUNGALOW, MCKENNA ESTATE - EVENING

          Bishop sits with Steve on the patio. From inside, Louise's
          soft crying can be heard. Seen through the trees in front of
          them, young people dance, splash, party.

                         LOUISE

                         (FROM INSIDE)
          Steve! Steve! I know you feel
          this. I know you'll stop me.

                         STEVE

                         (CALLING BACK)
          If you don't care anything about
          your life, why should I?
          Steve looks to Bishop. He checks his watch. 10:30.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         LOUISE
          I'm getting cold. Please. I'm
          frightened. I'm scared, Steve.
          Bishop looks at Steve who just keeps staring outwards.

                         STEVE
          You can help her if you want.
          The sounds of water, splashing. Louise arrives on the patio,
          a blood-stained robe loosely pulled on around her. Mascara
          eyes ran. She stares down at Steve.

                         LOUISE
          You're a bastard.

                         STEVE
          You know what the kick of it is,
          Louise? If you actually had the
          stones, then there's be something
          for us. But in 30 seconds when you
          run down that path and all of those
          people go crazy saving your life...
          Well, then we'll be done.

                         (BEAT)
          I know. Catch-22. Life's not
          fair.

                         LOUISE

                         (REALIZING)
          What happened to you?

                         STEVE
          Maybe nothing. Maybe you never
          really knew me.
          A beat. Louise, looking between the two men. She SWAYS on
          her feet and Bishop puts a hand out, steadies her.

                         LOUISE
          You're a bastard, too. Both of
          you. Like looking in some dark
          mirror.

                         STEVE
          Go on, Louise. You'll do fine.
          The world's gonna love you.
          Louise steps away, turns, stumbling down the path into the
          dark. A beat, the men just watching after her and then a
          SCREAM from below. COMMOTION, ACTION. People rush to
          Louise, help her to the ground. Others pulling out cell
          phones, call for help. Louise's LOUD cries drift back.

                         BISHOP
          Would you have let her do it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         STEVE
          We'll never know, will we?
          Steve rises, heads up a small path.

          EXT. ESTATE GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Steve and Bishop, walking high above the estate. Far below
          them, the lights of an ambulance in the driveway.

                         BISHOP
          You didn't answer my question.

                         STEVE
          Everybody dies.

                         BISHOP
          Sure. But it's a whole other world
          when you're personally involved.
          There's a very big tab that has to
          be picked up.

                         STEVE
          Such as?
          Bishop stops, looks down at the action far below them.

                         BISHOP
          Governments, cops, the military...
          we give young men a licence and
          send them into it blind, thinking
          it'll all be okay. Because someone
          told them they had permission.

                         (BEAT)
          But when you cross over that line,
          you do it alone. Most people, they
          stay that way from then on. Alone.

                         STEVE
          Everybody can kill. You take a
          mother, protecting her child...

                         BISHOP
          Sure. But that's instinct. What
          I'm talking about is up here...
          (tapping his head)
          Knowledge of foresight. Intention.
          A person who knows that the only
          way to truly be free of man's laws,
          is to break his highest one.
          Beat. It sits there, between them.

                         STEVE
          Why are you telling me all this?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         BISHOP
          Why did you want me to see that
          little stunt with your girlfriend?
          Bishop stares down the hill at the commotion. Ants swarming.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          These aren't your people, are they?
          You don't have "people." Your life
          is crowded, but you're alone.
          Steve unconsciously nods, then:

                         STEVE
          You know, you're right. You grow
          up spoiled, rich, like me... Only
          thing you really learn to recognize
          in people is when someone wants
          something from you.

                         (BEAT)
          What do you want, Mr. Bishop? What
          are you doing here?
          Bishop considers Steve, thrown. Then...

                         BISHOP
          Thanks for the tour. It's been
          interesting.

                         STEVE
          Yes, it has.
          Bishop turns, heads back down towards the estate. Steve
          watches him go.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Bishop stares down at the line of supplements and pills set
          out in front of him, something gnawing at him. His cat
          nuzzles around his legs, purring. He scoops up the lot,
          washes them down with water.

          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - NIGHT (LATER)

          Bishop sits on his sofa, antsy. On the TV, the day's news
          plays out in silence. Anti-American PROTESTS in a Middle-
          Eastern country. Words scroll: "...Official resistance to US
          eavesdropping policy..." "...Break down of high-level..."
          Bishop rises, goes to a stack of DVD's. Grabs one, slots it.
          ON THE TV: The WOMAN, speaking to him from her beautiful
          apartment. Similar to the one we saw. She leans against a
          large plate glass windows, shirt and panties, sipping wine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

          WOMAN ON TV
          Hey, you. Jesus, what a night. We
          went to opening of Fernando's new
          restaurant and Betty was there
          wearing -- well, whatever we call
          those things she wears...
          ON THE STACK OF DVDs. There must be twenty of them.

          WOMAN ON TV (CONT'D)
          I miss you. Everybody says hi, of
          course. But with me... it's like I
          feel you there with me, even when
          you're not.
          ON THE TV: She pulls her shirt off over her head, faces the
          camera again, topless.

          WOMAN ON TV (CONT'D)
          I feel the way you touch me...
          Bishop rises, blows out of the room.

          INT. BISHOP'S GYM - NIGHT

          SLAM! Dropping in on Bishop, SPRINTING on the treadmill.
          FASTER than we've seen him go before. ON and ON.
          He hits the weights, slots extra 45's onto the press bar.
          The weights CLANG into place.
          ON BISHOP, PRESSING the enormous weight. One, two, three...
          He RACKS the weights, disgusted. Gets up, throws on more
          weight. He PRESSES it again. Five... six... RACKS it
          again, angry. Adds MORE WEIGHT. Back under the bar.
          Pressing. Muscles distending, STRAINING. Seven... Eight...
          He CRIES OUT as something GIVES in his shoulder. The Weight
          SETTLES down on him, crushing him. A moment in his eyes, the
          weight pressing the air out of his lunges. He LAUGHS MANIC,
          SURGES up against the weight, tossing it off, the weights
          slamming into the floor, BOOM!

          EXT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - EVENING

          Bishop's car pulls up fast. He gets out, tosses the valet
          his keys, heads in, weirdly focused.

          INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - EVENING

          Bishop sits alone at a reserved table at the back, a plate of
          sashimi in front of him. He looks out at the restaurant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          BISHOP'S P.O.V.: Laughter, smiles, hands touching, hands
          waving mid-story, lips parting. Woman's hands touching their
          necks, eyes sparkling, men laughing, wallets flashing...
          Bishop rises suddenly, his hand going to his wallet, trying
          to get out of there. ROOM SWAYS. He steadies himself, moves
          towards the exit. People look over, alarmed as he grabs
          backs of chairs to steady himself. VERTIGO LOOMING, sounds
          DISTORTING and suddenly he's FALLING into blackness...

          INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - MORNING

          Bishop, shirtless. A FEMALE DOCTOR is examining the injury.
          Professional, but attractive. And attracted to him. Her
          hands on his shoulder, gentle. Her other hand on his back.
          Her eyes play over his form: SCARS, WOUNDS, healed. A
          battlefield for a body.

                         FEMALE DOCTOR
          Quite a collection you have here.
          Military?

                         BISHOP
          Something like that.

                         FEMALE DOCTOR
          Does this hurt?
          Bishop smiles, recognizing the nature of the touch.

                         BISHOP
          Yes, a little.
          The doctor lets her hands rest just a fraction too long, then
          moves across the room, writes in a chart.

                         FEMALE DOCTOR
          Any next of kin, anybody we can
          notify?
          (off his shake no)
          How about an acquaintance?

                         BISHOP
          Am I going to die?

                         FEMALE DOCTOR

                         (SMILE)
          No, not today.
          Bishop reaches for his shirt, slips it on.

          FEMALE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          You damaged your deltoid muscle.
          But that doesn't explain the
          anxiety attack.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

          FEMALE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Any unusual stress recently?
          Something at work?
          (off his shake no)
          I'm prescribing Cataflam for the
          pain and Paxil for the stress and
          I'm going to give you my card. If
          you have any other episodes... or
          if you need anything else, don't
          hesitate to give me a call.
          She holds out her card. He looks at her, lets her stay that
          way for a moment, then takes the card. She looks away.

          FEMALE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          You can pay at the desk.

          INT. FRONT DESK, EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Bishop pays cash. He crumples the prescriptions, tosses it
          in the trash, starts to toss the doctor's card.
          Beat. He can see her down the hall, speaking with another
          doctor. Pretty, real. A moment, he pockets the card.

          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP. - DAY

          Steve sits in his father's office chair, staring back at us,
          occasionally nodding. We REVERSE to find a collection of
          Investigators, a Forensic Doc, and a hardened SECURITY
          SPECIALIST. The Doc is in the middle of a presentation.
          BOARDS hold diagrams, conclusions, crime scene photos, all
          about Harry McKenna.
          The Doc demonstrates the precise hold, the pressure points
          that killed Harry McKenna. Steve watches, impassive.

          EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

          Bishop runs through the woods, full-tilt. Finally stops in
          front of his house. He feels his injured shoulder, winces...

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING

          Bishop sits on his sofa in front of the TV: A bureaucrat at
          a press conference. A female diplomat pushes through photogs
          with her hand up, shielding her face. Words scroll: "US
          Intelligence under scrutiny... High level meeting..."
          Bishop hits the remote and the TV goes to static, white noise
          again. His eyes... relax, almost asleep. We stay on his
          face, a glimpse into his only moments of peace...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.
          BANG! BANG! BANG! POUNDING on his front door. Bishop's
          eyes POP open. He's on his feet, instantly alert, moving
          past a sideboard. He touches a hidden catch, a "click" and
          he reaches underneath, comes out with a handgun.

          EXT. FRONT DOOR, BISHOP'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

          Steve is there, pounding on the door.

                         STEVE
          Mr. Bishop! Arthur! Please, I
          need to speak with you.
          The front door opens. Bishop, fronting sleepy. Steve is
          ENERGIZED, LIT, eyes blazing.

                         BISHOP
          What time is it?

                         STEVE
          I wanna show you something.
          Please. It'll be... It'll be
          interesting.

          INT. BENTLEY - EVENING

          Steve drives, too fast. Bishop is shotgun. The rear area
          usually reserved for passengers is empty.

                         BISHOP
          Gonna tell me what the big surprise
          is?

                         STEVE
          I'd rather show you. I know,
          melodramatic. But I think it'll be
          worth it to you.
          Bishop TENSES, almost imperceptible as Steve pilots the car
          into the underground structure beneath McKenna Holding Corp.

          INT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Car screeches to a stop. Steve grabs a case, is out.
          Bishops takes in the area. Two of Steve's SECURITY there,
          looking stern. Bishop checks the gun he has concealed in his
          waistband, reaches for his door.

          EXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA ENTERPRISES - EVENING

          Elevator opens at the very top. Steve pushes out onto the
          roof. Bishop follows. Security lighting floods on,
          illuminating the desolate surface in eerie even light.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          Steve opens his case, starts tossing down PHOTOGRAPHS:
          CLOSE ON THE PICTURES: Harry McKenna. Dead on the roof.
          Other details. The doors, the elevator shaft, everything.
          PAPERS, coroner's documents. Medical photographs.

                         BISHOP

                         (CAREFUL)
          Maybe it's time you start talking.

                         STEVE
          (off the papers)
          You know what that says? My dad
          didn't die of a heart attack. I
          mean, he was dying of a heart
          attack, but that's not what killed
          him. The blood flow to his brain
          was cut off, his brain died before
          his body. Somebody killed him.
          On Bishop, considering Steve.

                         BISHOP
          What do the police think?

                         STEVE

                         (LAUGHING)
          The police? They don't want to
          hear about this. I mean, they'll
          look into it. But they don't very
          much like the idea that they
          totally missed this one and it'd be
          just easier for everyone if I would
          shut the hell up.

                         BISHOP
          ...What do you want?

                         STEVE
          They killed him. Here, on the roof
          of his own building. His own
          security all around. Why here?
          Why even kill him, if he was
          already dying?

                         BISHOP
          You tell me.

                         STEVE
          To make a point. That no one's
          safe. That they can get to anyone,
          whenever they want to.

                         BISHOP
          So what am I doing here?
          Bishop, supremely alert, listening. Tracking shadows...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         STEVE
          I got my black belt in Karate when
          I was nineteen. I've studied Judo
          since I was six.

                         BISHOP
          I'm impressed.

                         STEVE
          No, you're not. Most people are,
          but you're not. If I came at you
          right now, I'd wind up dead as my
          father, wouldn't I?
          Bishop doesn't answer. Steve breaks away, looks down at the
          place where his father died.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Same as if I tried to exact justice
          for my father. These men, what
          this is... It's something you know
          about, isn't it?

                         (BEAT)
          Something you could teach me.

                         BISHOP
          I didn't get the impression you
          even liked Harry very much.
          Steve SURGES forward. Real anger, intensity boiling over.

                         STEVE
          You really going to stand there and
          judge how much I loved my father?
          What the hell do you know about it?
          Bishop, hearing this. A nerve touched.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Besides, this isn't just about
          Harry. Harry's dead, may he rest
          in peace. But this is about me.
          They came here and they killed my
          father. They did that to me.

                         BISHOP
          You want revenge.
          Steve doesn't answer. A long moment between them. Steve
          turns, looks out over the city.

                         STEVE
          You know the word "Nemesis"? It's
          not actually a word. It's a name.
          She was one of the Greek goddesses.
          Of anger. Retribution against any
          mortal who became too proud.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
          The executor of divine justice.
          It's a beautiful idea, don't you
          think? Justice.

                         BISHOP
          Justice?
          A beat. Bishop shakes his head, turns, starts to walk back
          towards the elevators. Steve collects his papers, angry.

                         STEVE

                         (CALLING AFTER)
          Fine. Fine. In case you haven't
          noticed, I now have a couple of
          million dollars to spend on this,
          so I will find them myself and I'll
          deal with them myself and if I wind
          up dead trying, you can bury me
          right next to dear old dad --

                         BISHOP
          Jesus, stop your whining.
          SLAP! No one's ever spoken to Steve that way. He STARES. A
          stillness between them, even the wind slows, waiting...

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          Corner of sixth and Grand.
          Tomorrow morning. 7:00 am. Don't
          be late.

                         STEVE
          I won't.
          Beat. Bishop nods, starts to leave, turns back...

                         BISHOP
          And Steve... no more surprises like
          this, okay?
          Steve nods. Bishop goes. On Steve, watching as the elevator
          doors erase the older man.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Bishop stands in the middle of his home, still. Thinking.
          Then he moves to his office, grabs a newspaper.
          He moves to his Study, turns to a page, slaps it down on the
          glass on his scanner. Hits a button, the white light of the
          scanner passes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          INT. BISHOP'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Big King bed, never used. A huge painting by the Artist on
          the wall across from the bed. Landscape. Empty. Ruined.
          Bishop hoists the painting down off the wall. He has a print-
          out from his computer, tacks it in the center of the blank
          space left by the painting: The picture of Steve, scanned
          from the McKenna Obituary, enlarged. Tacked alone on the
          wall. A start.

          EXT. CORNER OF SIXTH AND GRAND - MORNING

          Bishop stands on the corner, waiting. He checks his watch:
          6:58. Steve's Bentley pulls up to the corner, parks in a
          handicapped space. Steve gets out, nods to Bishop.
          Bishop takes in Steve, the Bentley, a metermaid ten yards
          away, already moving towards them.

          INT. STERILE HALLWAY - MORNING

          Bishop enters this linoleum-lined hallway, slips the bored
          ATTENDANT $100. The man hits a button, a door CLICKS open.

          INT. MORGUE - MORNING

          As they enter, fluorescent lights flicker on. Cheap,
          overused. Some burnt out, others shorting.
          ROWS OF GURNEYS line the room. Bodies, covered in green
          morgue drapes. Steve's eyes play over it. He swallows.
          Bishop is cold, business-like.

                         BISHOP
          Stay focused. This is a test.
          Bishop moves down the rows, pulling drapes away as he does.
          Nude BODIES are revealed. Men, women, teens. In some, the
          reason for their death is obvious. Others aren't telling.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          You want to know about killing,
          look around.
          Steve does, a little creeped out, but keeping it cool.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          The act of killing, is an end in
          itself. Any other motive keeps it
          from being pure.

                         STEVE
          The psychopath has no motive.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         BISHOP
          No, he's driven, compelled, by his
          sickness. He's as much the victim
          as those he kills.
          More drapes fall. Dead eyes stare up at them.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          But when you make your own law,
          you're responsible to no one else
          but yourself. Maybe you're free...

                         STEVE
          I understand.

                         BISHOP
          Do you? This isn't some idea
          anymore. This is the real thing.
          You still with me?

                         STEVE
          I am.
          Another drape falls. A beautiful woman. No signs of injury.

                         BISHOP
          Ever heard the term "Mechanic" used
          outside of its normal meaning?

                         STEVE
          My father used it. A dealer... a
          guy who works the tables.
          Bishops smiles, shakes his head.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Or a... killer. A hit man.
          Bishop just stares. Steve shakes his head, looks away from
          Bishop, winds up staring at a dead man. Laughs to himself.

                         BISHOP
          What are you thinking?

                         STEVE
          I had you pegged as... a security
          consultant. Maybe ex-military.
          Someone who... protects people.

                         BISHOP
          Maybe I do.

                         STEVE
          Or maybe you just get paid to kill
          people.
          Bishop nods his head yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          So why let me in? I mean, I know
          what I want. What do you get out
          of it?

                         BISHOP
          ...Times are changing. Security is
          better trained, more lethal.
          Sometimes I could use a partner.

                         STEVE
          Bullshit.
          Bishop nods, smiles. He moves away from the tables, leaves
          Steve standing in the middle of it all.

                         BISHOP
          In this... there isn't room for
          those who are outside of it.
          There's too much isolation.
          Friendships can't work. Eventually
          everyone expects you to account.
          The isolation... becomes a
          liability. You stand out.
          Standing out... isn't good.
          Steve smiles, shakes his head.

                         STEVE
          You need a... friend?

                         BISHOP
          An associate.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm offering to teach you something
          that most people can't be taught.

                         STEVE
          Because you think I'm a natural.

                         BISHOP
          That remains to be seen.
          (taps his head)
          But you're alone in there, aren't
          you? That's... the prerequisite.
          Steve continues to stare at the bodies. Bishops starts
          towards the exit.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          Think it over.

                         STEVE
          Bishop...

                         (BEAT)
          When I find the men who murdered my
          father. You help me to kill them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         BISHOP
          You may never find them.

                         STEVE
          You didn't answer my question.
          A beat. Bishop nods.

          INT. BISHOP'S GYM - DAY

          Dropping into the middle of a FIGHT. Steve and Bishop,
          attacking each other, mixed martial arts.
          Steve is the aggressor, moves in knocking Bishop's defenses
          away. HITTING Bishop who takes the punch, steps back...
          Steve's still on him. Kicking, two, three times. Bishop
          catches a kick, tosses Steve back. He lands cat-like on his
          feet, comes back at Bishop, strong. Hitting, pushing Bishop
          back against a wall, seeming to dominate the fight.
          BUZZ! A buzzer goes off. Bishop drops his guard, would be
          flattened if Steve didn't pull his punch, walks out.

          EXT. BISHOP'S RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          Behind Bishop's gym is a rifle range. An assortment of
          weapons lie on a table. In front of them, some trees, some
          old cars... some bottles sitting on the limbs of the trees.
          Bishop picks up a handgun, checks his pulse. Steve has
          obviously learned from him, does the same.
          Bishop raises the gun. BLAM! BLAM! Two bottles shatter at
          30 yards. He tosses Steve the gun. Steve keeps two fingers
          on his pulse.

                         STEVE
          I'm still at 130.

                         BISHOP
          Too fast.

                         STEVE
          I know. I'm working on it.
          Bishop nods, picks up the rifle, sights. BLAM! 1,000 yards
          away, the bullet IMPACTS the head-rest of an abandoned car.
          Bishop looks to Steve who gives up, raises the handgun.
          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Three shots. Three misses. Steve
          tosses down the gun, frustrated.

                         BISHOP
          You were still over 100.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         STEVE
          What am I supposed to do?

                         BISHOP
          There are no perfect situations.
          You fought me at 100%, so you were
          winning. But in doing so, you gave
          up your shooting option.

                         (BEAT)
          It's all about choices. Always.
          Bishop starts to leave.

                         STEVE
          Bishop... What's your 100% look
          like?
          Bishop smiles.

          EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

          Two cars BLISTERING down the highway. Bishop's Cobra and
          Steve in a classic Maserati. They JOCKEY for position, WEAVE
          in and out of the other cars on the road.
          WITH BISHOP. Portrait of control. Expertly working the
          tuned car, coaxing power and speed out of it.
          WITH STEVE. Careless, going for broke, not caring if he has
          the space to make his moves. He SWERVES his car, right at
          Bishop...
          ... who has to PEEL away, off the highway, onto the smooth
          dirt-pack. He DOWNSHIFTS, blasts back onto the road,
          catching air. Steve LAUGHS out load as they CREST the top of
          a rise...
          LOOMING AHEAD: An existing accident. A beer truck jack-
          knifed across the freeway. Bishop BRAKES, fighting for
          control.
          Steve SWERVES his car, too fast, it goes into a SPIN... CLIPS
          another car, gains air and PLOWS ass-backwards into the side
          of the beer truck.
          BISHOP'S CAR slides to a stop. Bishop gets out, tracks:
          STEVE, climbing out of the Maserati onto the hood protruding
          from the side of the truck. LAUGHING, WHOOOPING at the sky.
          Bishop approaches, sees that hundreds of bottles of BEER have
          cascaded out of the punctured truck.
          Steve wipes blood from a cut on his forehead, grabs a beer
          and cracks it, swigs as he sits on the Maserati hood. He
          grabs another, tosses it to Bishop.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         STEVE
          Come on up, man. The view is
          beautiful.
          Bishop takes in the situation, the small crowd gathering...
          he jumps up, sits on the hood of the car with Steve, both
          leaning back against the cracked windshield.

                         BISHOP
          You lost control.

                         STEVE
          You think?
          Steve puts out his beer. A hesitation, then Bishop clinks
          beers with him. They both drink. Stretched out in front of
          them, the highway seems to go on forever.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          You ever think about just... going?
          Leaving. Never turning back?

                         BISHOP
          ...Sometimes.

                         STEVE
          Why don't you?

                         BISHOP
          I have... responsibilities. I have
          a cat.
          A beat. Steve LAUGHS loud. Bishop laughs. Maybe the first
          time in ages. They drink, watch the sun move lower in the
          sky as emergency vehicles approach.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING

          Steve comes in from the guest-house, showered. Sees Bishop
          at the dining room table, takes in the place for the first
          time. The art on the walls.

                         STEVE
          You know, looking at these, a
          person might think maybe there's a
          screw or two loose up there...
          Steve catches sight of a manila envelope in front of his
          empty place.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Is this what I think it is?

                         BISHOP

                         (SHAKING NO)
          Don't be so eager. Open it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          PLANS, diagrams. Pictures. They're of an outdoor area.
          Steve's eyes scan over them, interested.

                         STEVE
          Who's the Mark?

                         BISHOP
          ...I am.

          INT. OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY

          A huge square filled with VENDORS selling all manner of food
          and good out of CARTS and STALLS. Music, voices, crowds of
          people. Bishop moves through. Dressed average, just a guy
          in the crowd. He watches a couple argue. Moves on...

          BISHOP (V.O.)
          It's not good enough to simply
          follow your Mark and attack him.
          Most of these people know they're
          targets. They'll be watching for
          you.
          ... A moment, then Steve enters the frame, tracking Bishop.

          BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          You need to understand the
          location, control the situation.
          You're looking for escapes,
          security, police presence...
          Bishop passes two COPS, squeezes between two parked produce
          trucks towards the row of shops that border the square.

          INT. WATCH REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS

          Bishop stands in front of a case, watches the precision
          instruments tick. From behind a counter, the Chinese OWNER
          notices him, puts down the watch he's repairing, approaches.
          60's, authoritative, a LOUP on his forehead.

                         OWNER
          Interest you in anything?
          Bishop takes in the man, eyes check polished reflective
          surfaces, back to the man. Bishop points to a watch.

                         BISHOP
          That's a beauty.

                         OWNER

                         (BEAMING)
          You know your instruments...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

          EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - CONTINUOUS

          Concealed amidst exotic Guatemalan wraps, Steve tracks the
          Watch Shop. The attractive older woman running the stall
          eyes him. He looks right through her.
          STEVE'S P.O.V.: Bishop exits, heading back into the market.

          BISHOP (V.O.)
          Most of all, you need to answer
          this question: "How does this man
          die here today?"
          Bishop passes a butcher cutting into a slab of meat. Steve
          follows behind Bishop, lost in the sea of people.

          BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Everybody, everyday, has a way to
          die. You have to find it.

          EXT. CURIOS STALL, OUTDOOR MARKET - MOMENTS LATER

          Bishop stands in front of stall filled with classic toys,
          rocking horses, vintage dolls. His gaze finds a large, still-
          boxed doll of the "Luna Cromwell" character that the Grocery
          Owner's Daughter is obsessed with. Almost life-sized.

                         SALESMAN
          They don't make that anymore.
          That's a classic. I can let you
          have it for three hundred...

          INT. OUTDOOR MARKET - MOMENTS LATER

          Bishop turns away from the stand carrying the doll. A GROUP
          of teens RUNS by Bishop, buffeting him for a moment.
          Slightly off kilter, he checks his surroundings. Nothing.
          Bishop starts again, aware for the first time that a MAN is
          headed his direction, passing a knife-sharpening stand,
          blades gleaming, his face hidden by a low hat...
          Bishop tracks the figure out of the corner of his eye, turns
          and pushes through the tight space between two stalls, out
          the back where trucks are parked. Bishops glances back for
          the man, squeezes between two large trucks...
          ...coming out the other side when POP! A loud SOUND makes
          Bishop glance over. A HISSING coming from one of the trucks
          which starts to ROLL backwards and
          Suddenly HANDS are on Bishop from behind, PUSHING HIM
          backwards, into the space between the two trucks! A FLASH, A
          SPLIT SECOND to stare into Steve's face, holding him there to
          be crushed and...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.
          CRASH! The one truck SLAMS into the second, the vice closed,
          metal crumpling.
          Bishop, at the last minute pulled back by Steve who's holding
          him there, smiling. A beat. Bishop checks the surroundings,
          nods. Steve release him.

                         BISHOP
          ...Good. Very good.

                         STEVE
          Good? That's all you got? How
          about God damn perfect, man?

                         BISHOP
          Don't get cocky.

                         STEVE
          Broad daylight. A thousand
          witnesses. Man takes a wrong step.
          Excuse me if I take a moment to
          appreciate myself. Because that
          was poetry.
          (laughing, smiling)
          You just can't bring yourself to be
          impressed, can you?
          Bishops considers, notices that the Luna Cromwell doll has
          fallen in the gutter. Picks it up, tries to dry it.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          (hand to his ear)
          What's that? You're what? Oh, you
          are impressed? No, come on, you
          don't have to say that. Really,
          I'm fine with -- You what? You've
          never seen someone better? Wow.

                         BISHOP
          All right. You did very well.

                         STEVE
          Damn straight I did. And now, in
          celebration of me, I'm taking you
          to a restaurant where the
          waitresses... what?
          Something about Bishop's serious gaze has stopped Steve.
          Bishop reaches into his jacket, places a gun in Steve's
          hands. A confused beat, Steve conceals the weapon.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          ...Bishop?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         BISHOP
          There's a man behind me. Look up
          once, then look away. Don't look
          back.
          Steve glances up. We realize we're right in front of the
          watch store. The OWNER is pulling the steel grate down over
          his store, closing for the day.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          You got him?

                         STEVE
          Yeah. Look...

                         BISHOP
          You did good here. Really good.
          But this was just a game. That
          man... is your graduation.

                         STEVE
          Who is he?

                         BISHOP
          He owns the watch store.

                         STEVE
          I know. I meant... what did he do?
          Bishop comes close, FOCUSED.

                         BISHOP
          I've taught you how to kill without
          anyone knowing there was a murder.
          I've taught you to be invisible.
          But that's strategy, not killing.
          The real test... it's the actual
          killing, isn't it?

                         STEVE
          Bishop...

                         BISHOP
          Do you want this? Be very sure.
          Because you can walk away.

                         STEVE
          No. I'm ready.
          Bishop studies him... nods. Turns to go.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Bishop... We're right here, where
          you wanted us to wind up. You knew
          where I'd hit you, didn't you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         BISHOP
          ...School's out.
          Bishop leaves. Steve watches him go. Stuck. Helpless. He
          turns back. The Owner is headed home for the day.

          INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Bishop sits back at his reserved table in the rear of the
          place. In a chair next to him, the doll is awkwardly
          perched. Around him, people LAUGH. Lovers NUZZLE..
          He reaches into his breast pocket, slides out a new DHL
          envelope, tears it open. A new jump-drive slides onto the
          table. He eats, takes pills, his eyes locked on the drive.

                         BISHOP
          (to Luna doll)
          Who do you think that is, Luna?
          He takes a card out of his wallet, studies it. It's from the
          flirtatious doctor. He pulls out his phone, dials.

          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

          Steve sits in a nondescript car, lights out, parked.
          STEVE'S P.O.V.: Two stories up, a lit apartment. The WATCH
          STORE OWNER crosses by one of the lit windows.

          INT. WATCH STORE OWNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The Owner has a delicate vintage Brietlang in his hands. He
          places it on a patch of velvet, watch-repair tools laid next
          to it. He moves to an old stereo, puts the needle of a turn-
          table down on spinning vinyl. The lonely sounds of Brahms
          Piano Concerto No. 2 fill the room.
          He returns to his desk, sits. A tiny noise from the hall. A
          "click." He looks up, sees nothing, settles in to work...

          TRACKING ACROSS THE ROOM
          To the front HALLWAY. Steve stands in the hallway,
          motionless. He's just closed the front door behind him. In
          his hands, a lock-pick set which he now pockets and pulls out
          the gun Bishop gave him.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON BISHOP. No way to tell where he is. He's holding
          the Luna doll. He reaches forward, knocks on a door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE

                         (FROM INSIDE)
          It's open!

          INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The WOMAN's apartment. Not the doctor's, the same we've been
          to before. Everything eerily identical to the last time.
          Sofas, gas fire, throws and rugs, open bottle of wine.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
          I'll just be a minute.
          A GLIMPSE of the woman in her bedroom, topless in front of a
          vanity. She glances back, smiles warm. Laughs a little when
          she sees the doll.

                         BISHOP
          It's for a friend.
          Bishop awkwardly sets the doll down near the front door,
          moves on, into the apartment. Restless.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry I was away so long this
          time. I had some complications --

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
          Don't be.
          He turns. She's emerged from the bedroom, adjusting the
          dress she's just pulled on. Beautiful. She comes up to him,
          kisses him. He doesn't respond. She backs off, moves to the
          kitchen to pour two wines,

                         WOMAN
          You know who I saw yesterday?

                         (BEAT)
          Bradley Fliescher. He and Ginny
          have this little cottage up the
          coast they hardly use. I was
          thinking, maybe next week you and I
          should go.
          Approaching, handing him a wine.

          WOMAN (CONT'D)
          You and me, the whole weekend.
          What would we... do?
          She approaches him, sexy. Touches him, intimate. He stares
          at her, blank. She recovers fast, moves off.

          WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Of course why do we need that? We
          have each other right here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

          INT. WATCH STORE OWNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Carefully, slowly, Steve makes his way down the hall towards
          the lit living room.

          IN THE LIVING ROOM
          The owner pauses, enjoying the crescendo of the music. Eyes
          closed for a moment. Then they open...
          ... Steve is standing in the doorway to the living room, the
          gun pointed at the owner. The owner sees him, becomes
          motionless. The two men staring across the space between
          them... and then everything happens very fast.
          The Owner LURCHES to the side with surprising speed and
          agility just as Steve FIRES! The bullet catches the Owner in
          the side, SPINNING him around. He CRASHES to the floor...
          ... but only for an INSTANT. THEN he's BACK ON HIS FEET,
          MOVING across the room! Steve tracks, pulls the trigger
          again but the gun only "clicks" empty.
          The man reaches a coat rack, grabs it in one fluid motion and
          is MOVING back at Steve who barely has time to drop the gun
          and BLOCK the rack as it SLICES through the air at him.
          The Owner HITS and HITS again. Skilled, professional,
          martial-arts trained. Steve blocking one, two, the third hit
          connects, sends Steve REELING back, crashing through the
          watch-repair table.
          The Owner leaps at him with the rack. Steve is BARELY able
          to catch the end before it impales him. The two men,
          BREATHING, STRUGGLING, the Owner FORCING the point lower
          towards Steve's face...
          ... Blood pools on Steve's shirt. Steve and the Owner both
          track it. The man is bleeding badly from the bullet wound.
          A split-second calculation and the man abandons the coat-
          rack, races across the room as Steve clambers to his feet.
          The man reaches the far wall, hits a RELEASE. The wood
          paneling slides open, revealing a CAR-15 fully automatic
          assault rifle with a silencer. The man grabs it, opens up!
          Bullets CHEW through furniture, drywall, glass searching for
          Steve who DIVES into the hallway, retreating as the man comes
          forward, firing in deadly precise BURSTS.
          Steve hides behind a wall which ERUPTS, blown to bits. He
          stumbles through a doorway into a KITCHEN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Stillness. The woman and Bishop, staring forward, watching
          another of her videos. Another late-night diary. She's in a
          long shirt and panties, leaning close to the camera.

          WOMAN ON CAMERA

                         (QUIET)
          Do you know what I dreamed? I
          dreamed you and I had a child...
          Bishops turns from the screen, walks away. Beat, she
          silences the TV, moves to join him.

                         WOMAN
          I know, it's crazy. I don't want
          to pin you down. I know you need
          your freedom. I just... sometimes
          I miss you so much...
          He's staring at her, oddly.

          WOMAN (CONT'D)
          What?
          A beat. His eyes move down to her sofa where another man's
          tie has been discarded. A moment, then she shakes her head,
          angry with herself. The pretense dropping. The real woman
          scooping up the tie, tossing in a drawer.

          WOMAN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. Really, I am. I
          just... You didn't give me any
          warning this time.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry, Bishop. It won't happen
          again.

                         BISHOP

                         (NODDING)
          It's okay. Really. It's okay.

          INT. WATCH STORE OWNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          WITH THE OWNER. Holding the CAR-15. Listening for his
          target. His hand moves to the wound in his side, comes away
          covered in blood. Another decision, the man slides the
          weapon over his shoulder, retreats...
          ...MOVING with the man, through his apartment. He reaches
          his BATHROOM, blows inside. Tosses the toilet tank to the
          side, reaches in and comes out with a military-grade STIM
          needle which he JAMS into his own thigh.
          A MOMENT with the Owner, feeling the drug course through his
          system, giving him strength...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          Steve comes out of nowhere, HITS the man in the head with a
          heavy copper pot, sending him reeling back into the tub.
          Steve starts forward, DIVES to the side as the man opens back
          up, full auto, bullets CHEWING everything... CAR-15 finally
          clicks empty.
          Steve rises... and the Man is on him, kicking him. Steve,
          rolling away. The man PULLING him back. WHAM! WHAM! Steve
          takes brutal punches to the head and face. Blocks one and
          they GRAPPLE, rolling in the tight space of the hallway, the
          man coming up on top, pinning Steve's arm, SLAMMING him in
          the ribs. Something SNAPS.
          Steve SCREAMS, surges up with the man... smashing him THROUGH
          a small table, winding up on top of him, his hand around the
          owners throat...
          The two men... eye to eye. Fierce, deadly. Steve SQUEEZING
          the life out of him. The man's free arm HITTING Steve, OVER
          and OVER. Brutal body blows. Steve takes the punishment...
          continues to Squeeze...
          ...Finally, the man weakening. In his face... a dull
          resignation.

                         OWNER

                         (WEAKLY)
          Who... are... you?
          Steve doesn't answer, just keeps PRESSING. And finally...
          the man's eyes film over. He dies.
          Steve just KEEPS PRESSING. Locked. Horrified. Staring into
          the dead man's face. Finally, he rolls off. Flops back
          against the wall, broken, bleeding, weeping...
          He SCREAMS. From the heart, the guts, releasing EVERYTHING.

          INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Bishop sitting at the woman's dining room table. Carefully,
          she comes and takes the seat opposite him. No pretense. The
          professional, not the actor.

                         WOMAN
          Hey, Bishop. You okay?
          He stares into his wine. Raises the glass to drink. His
          hand shakes.

                         BISHOP
          Do you remember, what you wanted to
          be, when you were a little girl?
          She hears it, it wounds her. Looks down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I didn't mean... I was
          thinking of me.
          She looks up, clear eyes. She's tough.

                         WOMAN
          No, it's okay. I wanted to be a
          Marine Biologist. I used to watch
          those Jaques Cousteau movies and
          just... dream.

                         BISHOP
          What happened?

                         WOMAN

                         (BEAT)
          I was beautiful.
          He hears the simple truth of it, nods, respectful. He rises
          and goes to the music box on the mantle, takes out his wallet
          and removes the twenty $100 bills.

          WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Don't worry about it this time. On
          the house.
          A beat. Then he slides the money under the box as before.

                         BISHOP
          We all gotta make a living.
          He leaves, grabbing the doll as he goes. She watches him go,
          strangely. Sadness breaking through her cool.

          INT. LOCAL GROCERY - NIGHT

          Bell jingles as Bishop pushes in, holding the large Luna
          Cromwell doll. The Grocer looks up, smiling as he sees
          Bishop, then confused as he takes in the doll.
          A SQUEAL of delight as Sophie appears, running, grabbing the
          doll out of Bishop's hands.

                         SOPHIE
          Thank you, thank you! Bishop! Mom!

          MOM!
          She takes off back into the living quarters of the house.
          The two men exchange looks, uncomfortable.

                         BISHOP
          I saw that in a... I'm sorry, I
          probably should have asked.
          A small beat that says "Yes, you should have."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         GROCER
          Don't worry about it, Bishop. You
          have a good night.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Bishop pulls up in his vintage Cobra. Shuts down the
          powerful engine, emerges into the night and moves to his
          porch. The front door has been BLOWN OPEN by gunfire.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Bishop moves in silent, alert. He reaches down under his
          sideboard for his gun. REACTS as his hand finds nothing.

          STEVE (O.S.)
          ...Can I ask you a question?
          STEVE sits on his sofa in the dark, head lowered.

                         BISHOP
          Go ahead.

                         STEVE
          Are you surprised to see me?
          Beat. Steve reaches over, turns on a table lamp as he looks
          up. His face is BRUISED, bloody. His clothing, stained and
          ripped. In his hand, Bishop's gun from the sideboard.
          Bishop TENSES, doesn't react. Steve spits blood, smiles.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Guy owns a watch-store, yet keeps a
          million dollar apartment.
          Supposedly sits on his ass all day,
          yet takes stairs double-time.

                         (BEAT)
          It was sitting there, right in
          front of my face, wasn't it?
          Bishop doesn't respond.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Was that the man who killed my
          father?

                         BISHOP
          There's a code, to what we do. It
          may not be rational, but it
          matters. The man's name was Harry
          Xiao. He was a Mechanic. Last
          year a US Representative died in a
          fire... along with his wife and two
          children.

          62.

                         BISHOP (CONT'D)
          A few months ago, a CEO vacationing
          in Costa Rica was found dead with
          his wife. Because the woman was
          tortured, the authorities believed
          it was drug related.

                         STEVE
          Bishop! --

                         BISHOP
          Civilian casualties are very
          effective at hiding intent, but
          there's a line ---

                         STEVE
          I don't give a damn about that!
          You haven't answer my question:
          Did he kill my father?
          Bishop doesn't react, then...

                         BISHOP
          You should put that behind you now.
          Steve nods, swallowing emotion. Bishop starts to move and
          Steve is suddenly there, still angry, pointing the gun right
          in Bishop's face.

                         STEVE
          I could have died today!

                         BISHOP
          You didn't.

                         STEVE
          Blind fucking luck! Look at me!
          You tried to kill me! That man
          was... he was unstoppable.

                         BISHOP
          But you stopped him.

                         STEVE
          Fuck you! You sonofabitch! Give
          me one good reason I don't blow you
          away right now! ONE GOD DAMN

          REASON!
          FAST, Bishop SLAPS the gun away, PINS Steve up against the
          wall. Cold.

                         BISHOP
          Now I'm sorry if you got a little
          scared. But this isn't coaching
          girl's softball, is it? This is
          life or death. Every time you go
          into this, somebody dies.

                         BISHOP (CONT'D)
          Every time, it's you or the other
          man. So stop your crying.
          He releases Steve who falls to the floor, sucking air.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          You got what you came for,
          congratulations. You're done Go
          back to your friends, your women,
          your whole beautiful life.

                         (POINTING)
          That used to be my front door. Try
          to close it on the way out.
          Bishop starts to go. Steve's words stop him.

                         STEVE
          Bishop. Those things... they don't
          mean anything to me. This, makes
          sense. I don't know why. But I
          think I was meant to do this.

                         (BEAT)
          And like you said, you could use
          someone.
          Bishop studies Steve a long beat. Shakes his head, goes into
          his study. Steve follows.

          INT. STUDY - NIGHT

          Bishop fires up the computer hooked to the printer. He
          glances over. Steve is standing in the doorway. Bishop
          tosses Steve the jump-drive. Steve studies it, slots it into
          the computer.
          Almost instantly, the phone rings. Bishop punches on
          SPEAKER. The same silence.

                         BISHOP
          We should all be so lucky.
          The phone goes dead. The light on the drive turns GREEN.
          Bishop's PRINTER fires up. It starts printing out pages...
          ON BISHOP and STEVE. Watching the pages feed out.
          PHOTOS: A new Mark at an elegant gathering of powerful men
          and women. Tall, powerful, entitled. His arm around a
          Turkish beauty in an elegant black one-piece. Emerging from
          a limousine at a large public event. Security EVERYWHERE.
          The same beauty on his arm. Charts. Height, weight, medical
          history. Bank accounts, figures. Leases, deeds of property.
          A LAST PHOTO: Peeling out of the printer... THE WOMAN, the
          beauty, in a diplomatic power-suit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.
          A second to realize: She's the mark. More pictures, we've
          seen this woman on television recently.
          ON BISHOP AND STEVE, reacting. Then Bishop gestures towards
          the large empty wall, waiting.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          You get started. I'll make coffee.

                         STEVE
          Bishop... Nemesis. Devine
          Retribution. ...What did she do?
          Beat. Unsaid questions asked, unanswered.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Okay. Okay. Forget I asked.

          EXT. EMBASSY - DAY

          Seen through 30x telescope. The images MAGNIFIED, FLAT. The
          view unstable, moving. Just the low SOUND OF WIND.
          Panning over upper-floor windows, hesitating on a pair of
          armed security, making their rounds. Camera "clicks" then
          move on. Finds the ENTRANCE. A line of people moving
          through a metal detector. One young man in particular...

          EXT. ENTRANCE, EMBASSY - DAY

          Steve collects his cell phone from the other side of a metal
          detector, slots a bluetooth and heads in. Bishop's voice
          fills his ears.

          BISHOP (O.S.)
          Slow down as soon as you get
          inside. Security station will be
          to your left...
          Steve passes through a door, pauses as two guards talk in the
          open doorway to a security control room. Monitors visible.

          BISHOP (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          How many views?

                         STEVE
          (eyes moving fast)
          Sixteen, no, eighteen. Four second
          intervals.
          One of the men notices Steve who starts forward to ask a
          question. The man points him down the hallway towards the
          consulat's reception. Steve's eyes track monitors.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Make that four and a half seconds.

          INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS

          Bishop is sighting through a camera affixed to the telescope,
          headphones on. He's on the 14th floor of a skyscraper under
          construction. Cement pillars and steel-work.

          STEVE (O.S.)
          These guys are packing Israeli-made
          Uzis. Couple are actual military.
          Bishop takes in the other buildings across the street, then
          moves his sight up the embassy, adjusts a control
          P.O.V. - THROUGH THE SCOPE: Large tinted glass windows
          suddenly turn transparent. Bishop scans, find The Mark's
          HUSBAND on the bed watching TV, bored. He scans again...
          finds The Mark in the adjoining room, on the phone and ANGRY.
          Bishop touches a switch on the telescope and a small LASER
          projects. The woman's voice fills Bishop's headset:

          TURKISH ENVOY'S VOICE
          No, we're literally locked in here.
          I'm supposed to be presenting at
          the UN but I can't do that if
          everyone is going to panic about
          security...

          INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS

          Bishop's scope zoomed in TIGHT on the Mark, staring at
          herself in the bathroom mirror. She's brave.

          TURKISH ENVOY'S VOICE
          ...This is America. People don't
          just kill people here.
          Then she shuts the door. Bishop moves his focus upwards to a
          glassed-in terreriam-like structure on the rooftop. An
          indoor swimming pool. "Click." "Click." More pictures.

          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - EVENING

          The SAME pictures, now tacked up. MOVING over the wall.
          Meticulous study, days of work: BLUEPRINTS of the building.
          Service corridors highlighted, surveillance cameras marked,
          pictures tacked to locations.
          Magazine and newspaper clippings about the Mark, showcasing
          her beauty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.
          Headlines: "The new (and beautiful) face of Turkey." "The
          face that said "no" to America." Other materials: Doctor's
          reports. Time-tables, intervals circled, holes noted.
          Steve and Bishop studying everything. Bishop, almost trance-
          like. Steve pacing.

                         BISHOP
          Work it again.

                         STEVE
          She never leaves. It's like they
          know we're coming.

                         BISHOP
          Maybe they do.
          Steve nods, continues pacing, scoops up Bishop's cat and
          strokes her. Bishop watches him.

                         STEVE
          Falls off the rooftop.

                         BISHOP
          Falls or jumps?
          Steve moves to the wall of pictures, his gaze lingering on
          shots of her on vacation is a swimsuit.

                         STEVE

                         (SMILING)
          I tell you one thing, killing her
          is not the first thing that jumps
          to mind... what?
          Bishop HEARS this, frowns, moves forward. His eyes scan:
          The Mark at the pool, getting ready to swim. The security...

                         BISHOP
          Nothing. I'm going for a run. You
          wanna come?

                         STEVE
          Let me ask you something. You ever
          not feel like running 5 miles?

          EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

          Bishops sprints/runs through the woods around his house.
          Body pushed to limit. In his eyes, his mind somewhere far-
          off, working...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING

          Steve, alone in Bishop's home. He moves from room to room.
          He hits the kitchen, looks in the fridge, makes a face at the
          empty shelves, the bottles of supplements.
          He moves on, pauses to stare at the gas fireplace in the
          study... moves on towards Bishop's bedroom, takes in the king
          bed. Runs a finger across the headboard, dusty. He STARES
          at the large painting across from the bed...

          BISHOP (O.S.)
          You like it?
          Steve REACTS. Didn't hear Bishop come in.

                         STEVE
          I don't know. Feels disturbed.

                         BISHOP
          Always made me feel... understood.

                         (BEAT)
          Come on.

          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS

          Steve follows Bishop to the wall of research on the female
          mark. Bishop points to some OLD RESEARCH on the Mark,
          glamorous. She was a model.

                         BISHOP
          The Mark is a beautiful woman.
          Before arriving at her current
          position, she enjoyed the way men
          looked at her. That's gone now.
          She needs to be taken seriously.
          She hates that men only see the
          beauty. Magazines, heads of state,
          all focusing how what a piece of
          tail she was. Like you did.
          Steve SQUINTS... Bishop slaps a picture of the pool, the
          Mark swimming. Two SECURITY AGENTS positioned.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          Why is he standing here? Wouldn't
          he get better coverage... here?

                         STEVE
          ...He can't see her.

                         BISHOP
          He can't see her. Neither of them
          can.
          Beat. PHONE RINGS. Bishop snaps it up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          Bishop.

          DEAN (O.S.)
          Hey, Bishop. Catch you at a bad
          time?
          Bishop doesn't respond. Waits...

          DEAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Always the conversationalist.
          Anyway, just calling to say we'd
          like you to go ahead with this one.
          As soon as you can.
          Click. Phone goes dead. Bishop hangs it up. Steve looks at
          him, anticipating... Bishop nods.

          INT. RESTAURANT - DUSK

          Nice downtown joint. Businesspeople dine. Second-story
          tinted glass looking out over downtown. TRACKING over faces,
          laughing, drinking, relieved to be done for the week...
          Finding Bishop, sitting alone, watching the people. The
          flirtations, the animosities... He looks down at the street
          below where a UPS driver has exited the building.
          Steve breaks the frame, sits down across from Bishop.

                         BISHOP
          Run it again.

                         STEVE
          Patrol number three moves down the
          service corridor at 18:50. Five
          minute window after to make it up
          top. Three minute climb to
          position. That's 18:54. Three
          minute window to engage. Shake,
          stir, add lime and enjoy.
          Bishop smiles, looks away.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          How'd you get into it?
          Bishop looks back, surprised. Checks his watch.

                         BISHOP
          ...This business, it's not like
          there's a degree you can go get.
          It's like most trades, it gets
          passed down.

                         (BEAT)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         BISHOP (CONT'D)
          My father was very good, better
          than I'll ever be. But no one
          controls 100%. The nature of the
          work is that some people know who
          you are and what you do.

                         (BEAT)
          A man told his girlfriend, to
          impress her. The girlfriend told
          some people she owned money to...
          Bishop finishes his glass of water.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          I was young. It took me four
          months to find the people, another
          to find the girl, and she gave me
          the Man. That's how I... "got into
          it."

                         STEVE
          You ever wish you just... walked
          away? Let it go?

                         BISHOP
          Sure. Every day. But I wasn't
          wired that way.

                         (BEAT)
          What about you?
          Beat. Steve and Bishop, oddly locked... BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
          Three SMALL EXPLOSIONS in the kitchen. FLAMES shoot out of
          the galley. A cook stumbles out, on fire. A waiter douses
          him with water. People SCREAM! Alarms BLARE!
          Steve and Bishop. They haven't moved a muscle.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          Here we go...
          And they're MOVING.

          INT. SECURITY STATION, EMBASSY - EVENING

          SECURITY takes a call as another man studies his monitor:
          People fleeing the building across the street, smoke.

                         SECURITY
          Fire in the restaurant.
          (into radio, Turkish)
          Patrols two and five, we're closing
          down the front entrance.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          INT. SUITE, EMBASSY - EVENING

          The MARK stands at her closet, starting to unbutton her shirt
          to change for her swim. She pulls it closed as one of her
          security knocks and pushes into the room from a balcony.

                         SECURITY PRO
          Excuse me, 'mam. There's a fire
          next door, nothing to worry about.
          The Mark nods. The man locks the door behind him, crosses
          the room, leaves through the main door, professional.

          INT. STAIRWELL - EVENING

          Steve and Bishop push UPWARDS through a stream of people
          flooding DOWN the emergency stairs. They reach a heavy door,
          locked and alarmed. Beat. Three people burst out from the
          inside. Steve catches the door and they're through...

          INT. LAW OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          A few LAWYERS and a SECRETARY still collecting their things
          look up as Bishop and Steve push in, holding up badges.

                         STEVE
          Hey! You need to get out! Whole
          building is going up!
          Bishop and Steve move on as the startled employees leave.
          They move down five doors, push into...

          INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          A private office. Desk, computer, a handwritten note reads
          "Leave mail here, will be back Wednesday." A box from UPS
          which Bishop TEARS open. Inside, what looks like a large
          WEAPON. Steve goes to the windows, pushes them open.
          P.O.V. - THE EMBASSY ACROSS: Changing its security pattern.
          Men are leaving posts on exterior patios, locking doors.
          Below, the excess manpower is channeled to the front.
          Bishop turns, FIRES OUT THE WINDOW. A Cable streaks across,
          SINKS into the wall of the embassy 30 feet away. Bishop
          HOOKS the cable on this side, tosses the gun in the box.
          Steve seals it with tape, slaps a return label on it.
          He crosses the hall, tosses it in the MAIL ROOM. When he
          returns, Bishop's already secured the cable outside.

                         BISHOP
          Ready?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          Steve hooks on as well, they're both wearing harnesses under
          their clothing. He steps out onto the ledge with Bishop,
          closes the window behind him.
          Bishop lets himself fall backwards.

          EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

          Flashing light of the fire trucks. No one sees the two
          figures sliding silently from building to building above,
          disappearing over a 4th story railing.

          EXT. BALCONY, EMBASSY - NIGHT

          Steve lands next to Bishop who unfastens the cord they used
          to cross, spools it back to them. A look. No way back now,
          and no trace left behind.
          Jackets strip, reverse to the pattern of the embassy
          Security. A quick lock pick, and they slip inside.

          INT. ROOF LEVEL, EMBASSY - NIGHT

          Elevator doors open and the Mark gets out. She nods to the
          guard on duty, heads into a changing room.

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT

          Two guards monitor screens: Corridors, rooms, entrances and
          exits. Pairs of guards make their rounds.
          CLOSING IN ON ONE PAIR. Something about them... The guard
          squints just as the image CHANGES, showing another part of
          the embassy. The guard hits a toggle, returns the previous
          image... But Bishop and Steve are gone.

          INT. CHANGING ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT

          The Mark pulls the straps of her swimsuit up over her
          shoulders. Stares in a mirror as she tucks strands of hair
          under a swim cap.

          INT. INDOOR POOL - NIGHT

          Quiet, lit from overhead by large halogen lights hanging from
          the hanger-like beam structure. Dark shadows in the corners.
          The low sound of water lapping, light reflecting off the
          water, moving over walls.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          The Mark enters, and hangs up her robe. She goes to the edge
          of the pool, looks down into the water, then glances up at
          the GUARD who's stationed across the space. He nods back to
          her, moves to the lower space, giving her a little privacy.

          EXT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT

          A second guard looks in, rudely checks out the Mark as she
          DIVES into the water and out of sight. He shrugs, looks back
          out at the roof, lifting a cigarette to light... pauses.
          ACROSS THE ROOF, an access door is open.

          INT. INDOOR POOL - NIGHT

          The Mark swims, hard. Cutting through the water. She
          reaches the far wall and kick-turns against it.
          UNDERWATER. Her body passing above us. Silhouetted by the
          strong halogen lights above her. ONLY THE THROBBING SILENCE

          OF UNDERWATER.
          ACROSS THE SPACE. The indoor guard checks in on his radio.
          Looks up as the DOOR nearest him swings open. He rises,
          approaches the door, curious. Looks out.
          HIS P.O.V.: The rooftop, lit by security lights, the
          strobing of the firetrucks below. Dark shadows. He hears a
          RUSTLING, a BANGING. Torn, he glances backwards. Can't see
          the Mark in the pool from here, but can hear her strokes.

          WITH THE MARK
          She kicks hard, dives under... And we're in her P.O.V. The
          far wall approaching, then we REVOLVE as she turns, now
          looking UP at the surface as she backstrokes to the surface,
          BREAKING THE SURFACE, now swimming face up to the bright
          lights hanging from the girdered ceiling.

          EXT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT

          The second Guard tests the door. Seems fine. Takes out his
          flashlight and plays it over the roof. Sees nothing. We
          REVERSE to find Steve there, tucked away, just out of sight.

          ACROSS THE ROOF
          The first guard reaches the source of the noise: A plastic
          bag, caught in a revolving air vent. He pulls it free.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          INT. INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS

          With the Mark, coming out of another turn, still backstroke,
          looking up. She makes it half way across the pool... pauses.
          She slows... floating, staring upwards into the light.
          HER P.O.V. The lights. But it's like she senses something
          beyond them, puts a hand up to shield her eyes...

          AND BISHOP DROPS FROM THE CEILING, FREE-FALL, COMING STRAIGHT

          DOWN AT HER!!!!
          She opens her mouth to scream...
          WHUUMPH! He goes in, taking her with him underwater, his
          momentum carrying them both several feet under. She TWISTS
          in his arms, fighting. Screaming, bubbles FLOWING from her
          mouth!
          ABOVE THE SURFACE. It's silent. No sign of the violent
          struggle going on below the surface.
          ACROSS THE ROOM. Guard number one returns, glances up
          towards the pool. Doesn't hear anything. He sits back in
          his chair.
          UNDERWATER. The struggle is violent, silent, terrible in
          it's inevitable conclusion. The Mark writhes and jerks but
          Bishop holds her tight, always pulling her away from the
          surface. Finally, the fight goes out of her. She goes limp
          in his arms.
          He turns her, stares into her unseeing eyes. Then lets her
          go, rising slowly to the surface.
          AT THE SURFACE. Bishop just breaks, breathing in, silent.
          He raises himself slightly, sees the guard at his post.
          ACROSS THE ROOM. The guard glances back towards the pool,
          hasn't heard anything for a little bit...
          BAM! BAM! BAM! A new noise from outside gets his attention
          again. He heads out, hand on his sidearm...

          EXT. POOL STRUCTURE, ROOFTOP - NIGHT

          The guard approaches the same door Guard #2 already checked,
          banging in the wind. Open again. He starts to move towards
          it when a FIGURE looms, he almost draws his weapon, breathes
          relief when he makes Guard #2.

                         GUARD #2 (TURKISH)
          It's the second time it's come
          open. She still swimming?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          INT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT

          The two Guards come into the pool area. On the far wall, the
          shower is running, a towel has fallen over the drain and the
          water is flowing down and into the pool.
          One of the men steps forward, concerned...

                         GUARD #2 (TURKISH)
          Oh hell...
          The Mark floats face-up in the pool, just under the surface.

          INT. CHANGING ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT

          Bishop has already shed his wet clothing, pulls on dry
          clothes as Steve comes into the room. They barely
          acknowledge each other, business. Bishop stuffs the wet
          clothes in a bag, dumps it into a LAUNDRY chute.

                         STEVE
          How did it go --

                         BISHOP
          Not yet.
          As if on cue, an ALARM BLARES. Excited voices come on over
          an embassy wide PA System. VOICES from the next room.
          Bishop opens the chute again as Steve cracks a glowstick,
          puts it between his teeth, swings his legs in, and DROPS.
          ACROSS THE ROOM. The door to the dressing room opens, armed
          guards flood in, along with Embassy officials speaking on
          radios. The room is empty.

          INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE - CONTINUOUS

          Tight, PITCH BLACK except for the eerie glow coming from the
          glowsticks Bishop and Steve have in their teeth. They slide
          FAST, the sides of the tube RUSHING up at them. And then
          suddenly a dim LIGHT at the bottom, rising fast...

          INT. SERVICE ROOM, EMABASSY - CONTINUOUS

          Steve lands hard in a cart of towels. Rises and pushes
          himself out of the way just in time for Bishop who grabs the
          pack he tossed down, shoulders it, and they're MOVING again,
          now through sub-corridors.

                         STEVE
          Alright, you gotta admire that.
          You gotta admit, we are a spooky
          good team...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          They PUSH through a set of old doors, move fifteen feet to a
          metal roll-down door.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          It's like one moment we're there...
          the next moment...
          He ROLLS UP the door. STARES at a NEW WALL OF CEMENT BRICKS.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          ...we're fucked.
          Bishop takes in the problem, starts to solve it. He tracks
          left right, considering options...

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          There wasn't any sign of this on
          the plans. I went over them fifty
          times!! This isn't supposed to be
          here! This can't be here!
          Bishop holds up a finger. "Shhhhhh" They LISTEN. A soft
          "beeping." Both men PEER around the edge of the metal door
          to where a small box with a red light BLINKS.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Bishop... what do we do!?

                         BISHOP
          Duck...
          Steve looks at Bishop and BOOM! Doors BLOW OPEN, THREE
          GUARDS burst through, machine guns raised and SPITTING...
          Steve hits the deck. Watching Bishop, it's like everything
          we've seen so far was in slow motion. This is the real
          thing, unleashed.
          Bishop WRAPS the first man up, uses his Kevlar vest as a
          shield to catch the fire from the other two. The man SCREAMS
          as his arm breaks. Bishop gets control of his weapon,
          focuses it on the other two. One is BLOWN back. The other
          DIVES for cover.
          Fluid, Bishop REVERSES the man, pushes him AWAY from him,
          coming up with TWO of the man's Flash-bangs in each hand.
          Each hand DIALS the grenade's timers to two different
          settings, simultaneously POPPING the levers.
          Second attacker FIRES a burst which Bishop DUCKS, the bullets
          stitching across the first attacker, SLAMMING him back, his
          rounds TEARING into the ceiling, showering Steve in debris.
          Bishop THROWS the first grenade which reaches the attacker
          just as he rises for another shot. BOOM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          Another down as ANOTHER ATTACKER dives through the door at
          Bishop who wraps the man up, his fingers finding pressure
          points on the man who goes limp in his arms, dead.
          ON STEVE. On the floor, witnessing everything. Even in the
          chaos, recognizing the move.
          Bishop SHOVES the last grenade down the front of the dead
          attacker's clothes, wheels him around, PRESSING him against
          the concrete brick wall...
          ... TWO more Security kick open a door, guns fire! Bishop
          goes horizontal, his legs CRUSHING the one man against the
          metal Grate even as he returns fire at the other two who fall
          back and BOOM! The grenade goes off! Bishop is HURLED
          against the far wall. SMOKE AND DEBRIS fill the space.
          Bishop MOVES, hauling Steve to his feet and shoving him into
          the ragged hole blown in the brick wall even as bullets trace
          after them. A bullet catches Bishop in the side, he sprawls,
          then LEAPS towards the hole...

          INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

          Cover in the floor is tossed aside. Bishop and Steve emerge,
          move 6 feet to a non-descript Buick. Climb in. The keys are
          waiting, Bishop starts it up, drives up the ramp.
          Next to him, Steve is catatonic, lost. As he drives, Bishop
          RIPS a strip from his shirt, pads the wound in his side.

                         BISHOP
          Hey! Hey! You still here?

                         STEVE
          ...It was my fault. I was in
          charge of the exit. I looked at
          every work order, every entry in
          the building logs...

                         BISHOP
          No one controls 100% That's the
          nature of the beast.
          Steve swallows, nods as Bishop brings the Buick around a last
          corner, ACCELERATING at the closed gate in front of them, a
          Turkish guard waving his arms frantically...

          EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

          Firetrucks and ambulances already crowd the streets. There's
          just no time or extra manpower left to react to the Buick
          which plows through the gate of the locked garage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

          INT. BUICK- CONTINUOUS

          Two blocks behind, a single police car follows. Bishop takes
          a hard turn, moving FAST.

                         BISHOP
          Hey! You did good in there. You
          hear me?. It was asking a lot.
          You came through.
          Steve nods, processing, accepting. Another TURN. Bishop
          slides the car to a stop in a covered lot. Across from them,
          Bishop's own Cobra waits.
          Behind them, the police car tears by, lost.

          INT. BISHOP'S CAR - NIGHT

          Bishop drives down the small lane leading to his home. Steve
          is staring out his window, deep in thought. Finally, looks
          over. For the first time takes in Bishop's injuries.

                         STEVE
          You're bleeding.

                         BISHOP
          ...Yup.

                         STEVE
          So back there. That was one
          hundred percent?
          Bishop looks over, gives nothing. Tiny smile.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Door opens and Bishop and Steve come in. Steve plops in a
          chair, head in his hands. A beat, and then MUSIC filters in.
          Neil Young's "Needle and the Damage Done." He raises his
          head, sees light glowing from the study.

          INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

          Bishop sits in a chair, eyes closed. Steve comes in, stares
          at Bishop. Looks over and admires the surface of the
          spinning record...

                         STEVE
          Do you think you know it, when
          you've made the mistake you won't
          survive? Or will it be like the
          Marks? Wake up on top of the
          world, never know...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Steve glances into the open cabinet where Bishop keeps his
          vinyl, FREEZES. Comes out with an signed album.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          ...Oh my God. This is a signed
          Hendrix Axis, 1967 release. This
          has gotta be worth... we have to
          play this. You have to play this.

                         BISHOP
          (shaking head no)
          That one... is for a special
          moment. Haven't found it yet.

                         STEVE
          You haven't found the... Are you
          kidding? You have to -- what?
          Bishop's eyes SHOOT open. He looks out the window where a
          series of SEDANS are pulling up. Men get out, approach.

                         BISHOP
          This could get... interesting.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Bishop steps out of his home. One of the several men there
          steps forward.

                         MAN
          Mr. Bishop? Mr. Dean would like a
          moment of your time.
          Off Bishop who... nods.

          EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT

          Sedan pulls up, Bishop is escorted onto a private jet.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Steve stands in the middle of Bishop's home. Home alone.
          -- Steve stares at the classic vinyl on Bishop's turntable.
          -- Steve, wiring his IPod to Bishop's stereo. Nine Inch
          Nails' "Piggy" comes blasting out, insults the speakers.
          -- Steve moves to the bedroom, STARES at the haunting
          painting. He reaches forward, takes it down. Nothing.
          Blank wall behind.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - NIGHT

          Steve blasts in, lights glow on, illuminate the wall of
          research on the Female Mark. He goes to the gas fireplace,
          flames flicker up. Steve RIPS down the pictures of the
          woman. Moves to the fire and feeds the first one in.
          ON STEVE, watching. His eyes... Tracking to the side.
          STEVE'S P.O.V.: Down, below the fire, stuck to the side of
          the interior cavity... a scrap of paper...
          Steve kills the fire, reaches in, carefully removes the scrap
          of paper. A corner of a photograph. A few buildings,
          distant, out of focus. Almost nothing.

          INT. BATHROOM, PRIVATE JET - EARLY MORNING

          Bishop, shirtless, stares in the mirror. He checks the wound
          in his side, splashes Vodka from a handful of mini bottles,
          painfully re-wraps the wound.

          INT. PRIVATE JET - EARLY MORNING

          Bishop emerges from the bathroom, peers out at the grey
          monoliths of Washington D.C., below.

          EXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - MORNING

          Gray morning. Wind blows. Steve stands alone, holding the
          scrap of photograph, now in a plastic envelope. He stares at
          where the chalk line has almost completely faded, then looks
          up, taking in the views, vantage points. A half mile away a
          building under construction rises high.

          EXT. AIRFIELD - MORNING

          Bishop steps off the plane. Another sedan and driver waits.

          EXT. OPEN CONSTRUCTION FLOOR - MORNING

          P.O.V. THROUGH A CAMERA: The McKenna Holding Corp building.
          Image focuses on the rooftop, shutter clicks.
          Steve lowers the camera, looks at the display. He removes
          the scrap from Bishop's fireplace, compares it... the same
          buildings in the corner of the frame. Perfect match.
          ON STEVE. No remaining doubt. Bishop killed his father.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          WIDER. The SECURITY PROFESSIONAL is up here with Steve,
          hanging back. Steve nods to him.

                         STEVE
          Do it. I don't care what it costs.

          I/E. SEDAN - MORNING
          Driver pulls the sedan to a stop in front of a large
          nondescript building. Bishop steps out, alone on the street,
          passes through the morning commuters, and goes in.

          INT. NATIONAL SECURITY BUILDING - MORNING

          Bishop passes through a SECURITY CHECKPOINT. Post 9/11,
          hyper-conscious. Metal detector. Smart guards backed up by
          battle-ready US Marines. Bishop collects his ID, waits for a
          door to "click" open.

          INT. WAITING ROOM, NSA BUILDING - MORNING

          Bishop sits in a fluorescent lit room, now with a bar-code
          badge on his coat. A few other people also wait. Bishop
          checks his wound, pulls his coat closed to mask where blood
          has stained his shirt.
          A door opens and a plain woman nods to Bishop.

          INT. DEAN'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Bishop sits in a chair. Through blinds, views of gray DC.
          WIDER. We realize that the plain woman is sitting across
          from Bishop, watching him. Finally, the door opens and DEAN
          enters. Pasty white, slightly balding. It's hard to locate
          where the sense of power come from, but it's there, innate.
          He motions to the woman who leaves. Dean sits at his desk,
          taps his fingers on it.

                         DEAN
          You look like shit.

                         (BEAT)
          How does Harry McKenna's son figure
          in?

                         BISHOP
          He's going to be working with me
          from now on.

                         DEAN
          You sure that's wise?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         BISHOP
          Do I need your permission?

                         DEAN
          No... And for the record, I don't
          believe you'd ask for it.
          Dean grabs a remote control on his desk, points it at the set
          of flatscreens on the wall which hum to life, muted.
          News reports featuring the killing of the Turkish Embassador.
          Shots of the woman, smiling. Helicopter shots of the pool
          structure. Words scroll: "Terror on our soil."
          "Assassination!" "US Envoy ejected from Turkey..."

          DEAN (CONT'D)

                         (POINTING)
          That was my baby. But my baby has
          turned into an epic shit-storm and
          so when the man who caused said
          epic shit storm suddenly decides to
          do some soul-searching...

                         (PLAINLY)
          What are you doing, Bishop?

                         BISHOP
          The mistake was mine, not the
          kid's.

                         DEAN

          I DON'T CARE.
          Dean leans in, intense. Bishop watches the screens. A
          screen changes to a commercial for a Bahamas resort.

          DEAN (CONT'D)
          I am on some very fucking thin ice
          right now which means you are on
          some very fucking this ice as well.

                         BISHOP
          Someone I trained. That could be
          worth a lot to you.
          Dean laughs, rises with nervous energy and goes to the
          interior blinds, raises one. From here they can see out over
          the office. Glimpses of a dozen conversations. Other men
          and women at work. More than a couple glance over towards
          Dean's office. A predatory vibe.

                         DEAN
          And here I thought we were both
          going to live forever.
          Bishop smiles. Dean stares at him. Bishop stares back.
          Suddenly, this becomes the moment, the decision...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

          DEAN (CONT'D)
          You know, in this business, you
          only get one mistake.
          (off the flatscreens)
          So nothing more like that. You
          take full responsibility.

                         BISHOP
          Yes.
          The two men, face to face. Then Dean's phone rings. He
          turns to it, snaps it up.

                         DEAN

                         (ON PHONE)
          Hey, Stanley. Yes, we're all
          sorted out. I just need you to --

                         BISHOP
          The hit, on the woman. What was
          the reason?
          Dean looks back, surprised, angered.

                         DEAN

                         (ON PHONE)
          I'm calling you back.
          Dean clicks off, takes in this change of rules. A dead
          seriousness infects his voice. Fear.

          DEAN (CONT'D)
          You know, this foul-up, McKenna's
          son, it's all got some people's
          panties in a real twirl.

                         (BEAT)
          This isn't the time for questions.
          This is the time for survival.
          Everyone... is expendable.
          Beat. Dean turns away, picks up the phone again.

          DEAN (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Yeah, get me Stan again...

          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - AFTERNOON

          Steve lays out by his pool, sunglasses, baking under the sun
          as his group of hangers-on swarm around him. Play, dance,
          splash. He's immune to all of it. Louise climbs from the
          pool, water drips off her perfect form. She nestles in
          behind Steve, her hands running over his body.
          He stares straight ahead, as if she didn't exist.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         LOUISE
          Come on, baby. What's the matter?
          Finally, something does catch his attention: At the gate, a
          DHL Van pulling up, the driver heading toward him. Steve
          lowers his glasses.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING

          Seen from far away, the sedan pulls up. Bishop gets out.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Bishop enters, looks around. No sign of Steve, or any
          disturbance. He moves through the house.

                         BISHOP
          Steve! Steve...!?

                         LATER
          Bishop tense, in his study, holding the phone which rings...
          rings... Steve's voice comes on the voicemail: "Hi, this is
          Steve. You know what to do."

                         LATER
          Bishop, sitting on his couch. On the TV in front of him,
          images from a protest in Turkey, an American flag burning.
          Bishop's eyes flick to the stack of DVDs from the woman. No.
          He keeps watching the news images.
          His phone rings. He snatches it up.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          Bishop.

          STEVE (O.S.)
          You're still alive.

                         BISHOP
          Seems that way.

          STEVE (O.S.)
          Hey, can you meet me? Something I
          want to talk with you about.
          Bishop, silent.

          STEVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          It's important. Come up to the
          house. Please, okay?

                         BISHOP
          Okay.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT

          Bishop's sportscar pulls up in front of the large estate.
          Bishop gets out, surveys the grounds. Weirdly quiet. The
          windows of the house, dark. The grounds, empty.
          He moves to the gates to the back yard, finds them open. He
          pushes through, cautious.

          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT

          Bishop moves towards the darkened pool area. As he
          approaches, Steve comes into view, standing by himself on the
          edge of the diving board in the center of the dark space.

                         STEVE
          There you are. Thanks for coming.

                         BISHOP
          What's on your mind?
          Steve just smiles, shakes his head. Bishop stares at him,
          tense, confused. Each trying to read the other.
          Then Steve raises a bottle of whiskey to his mouth, drinks.
          Bishop takes a step forward and...
          ... LIGHTS WASH THE SPACE! Explosions! SOUND FILLS THE AIR!

                         VOICES

          SURPRISE!
          Bishop ducks, rolls, his hand moving under his jacket...
          ... but not coming out with his gun. He takes in a surprise
          party, opening in front of him. Beautiful woman, LAUGHING,
          blowing horns. Men, pouring champagne. STREAMERS falling to
          the ground where seconds before they blew into the air, a
          large BANNER, illuminated behind Steve: "HAPPY BIRTHDAY
          ARTHUR!" And Steve, standing on the board, master of
          ceremonies, staring back at Bishop... oddly cool,
          dispassionate. Then he smiles.
          Bishop rises. Women come to him, touch him, put a party hat
          on him and give him small kisses with wishes of "Happy
          Birthday" as he moves to the pool edge across from Steve.

                         BISHOP
          It's not my birthday.

                         STEVE
          When was the last time you
          celebrated your real birthday?
          No response from Bishop. Steve nods, swigs the bottle again.
          He's lit, something fierce and fiery in his eyes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          See? You're overdue, buddy.

                         BISHOP
          Who are these people?

                         STEVE
          They think you're a friend of mine,
          a producer, from Canada.

                         (BEAT)
          In other words, they're all your
          best friends.

          EXT. POOL AREA, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Bishop sits on an outdoor sofa, surrounded by several
          gorgeous aspiring MODELS. Steve sits across from him, Louise
          under his arm. Bishop watches as one of the models ties a
          cherry-stem into a knot with her tongue, presents it to the
          group to a round of applause.

                         MODEL

                         (TO BISHOP)
          So what movies have you made?

                         STEVE

                         (JUMPING IN)
          Oh, he makes the really violent,
          disturbing stuff. You wouldn't
          know it to look at him, I know, but
          what's locked up away in there...
          (tapping his head)
          Frightening, man.

                         MODEL
          God, I love those. Which ones --

                         BISHOP
          Mr. KcKenna has a creative
          relationship with the truth. I
          don't actually...
          The model glances around, unsure...

                         MODEL
          Oh, okay. That's funny. So what
          do you do?

                         STEVE
          Yes, Mr. Bishop. What do you do?
          Bishop doesn't respond. He's just staring down.
          BISHOP'S P.O.V.: Discarded, lying beneath the sofa the
          models are perched on: The tear-strip from a DHL Envelope.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Come on, Mr. Bishop. We're all
          waiting.
          Bishop looks up at Steve who SMILES back. A beat, and then
          Bishop is up and moving through the crowd, pushing by people
          LAUGHING, DANCING. He almost runs into a bright blue-haired
          woman on the arm of a jockish RAPPER.

                         BISHOP
          Excuse me...
          He comes up short, realizes he's staring into the face of the
          Woman. She's utterly different than we've seen her.
          Tonight, she's the clubbing party-girl. Dark lipstick,
          bright blue wig, heavy eye-liner.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          Hi.

                         WOMAN
          Hi... This is strange.
          The Rapper she's with has found a group of his buddies. High-
          fives all around. He glances around for his date...

                         BISHOP
          Is he your...?

                         WOMAN
          No, just a job.
          (off his nod)
          I have to...

                         BISHOP
          I know. Go on.
          She nods, turns away. He also turns, starts moving through
          the crowd, pushing through DANCING BODIES...
          ... and suddenly she's back with him. No words. Lights and
          sound and dance around them. She leans forward, kisses
          Bishop once. Backs off, smiles, turns away and makes her way
          back to the guy she came in with who tucks her under his arm
          without missing a beat, mid-story with his posse.
          Bishop... staring. Turns away as the MUSIC STOPS. Steve's
          voice fills the outdoor space, amplified.

                         STEVE
          Ladies and gentlemen! The man of
          the hour!
          A SPOTLIGHT hits Bishop. He squints up as the crowd makes
          space for him. Steve's near the DJ, speaking on a mic.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          I know that not many of you know my
          friend. My good, dear... friend.
          I mean, he's a man of few words...
          And he's an art lover! Did you
          know that? His home is covered
          with work. It's amazing, what you
          can find in there. Amazing.
          A weird beat. Steve, smiling fierce.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Happy birthday, Arthur.
          Behind Steve, a covered object. Steve now turns to it, pulls
          the cover off a PORTRAIT of Bishop, clearly done by the
          Artist he collects. The image is twisted, vivid, disturbing.
          As the crowd erupts in APPLAUSE the ARTIST himself now comes
          forward, Steve's arm around his shoulder and bumping fists
          before the Artist heads on towards Bishop, shaking Bishop's
          hand. Faces BEAM. People CLAP. On Bishop, just looking at
          Steve who stares back... unreadable.

          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT

          Bishop bangs out a door into the front drive, makes it to his
          car, fumbles for his keys. Sweating, off-kilter.

          STEVE (O.S.)
          Hey, you forgot something.
          Steve's there, holding the portrait. Bishop nods, takes it.

                         BISHOP
          Sorry... Sorry for leaving. I'm
          just not used to --

                         STEVE
          No worries, man. It's your party.
          You can leave it.

                         (BEAT)
          It's true, isn't it? What you said
          to me the first time we met.

                         BISHOP
          What's that?

                         STEVE
          This thing we do. Finally, you
          always do it alone.
          Bishop nods unconsciously, starts towards his car, forces
          himself to stop.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         BISHOP
          Steve... thank you.

                         STEVE
          Uh-oh. I can feel some male
          bonding coming. We gonna hug it
          out, Bishop?

                         BISHOP
          No, I'm serious. Thank you.
          People don't... Anyway, it's been
          a long time, since someone did
          something for me.
          Steve looks back, nods. Strangely dark.

                         STEVE
          Happy Birthday, Arthur.
          Steve raises a hand, shoots Bishop with a finger. A wink,
          and he turns and is gone, back to the party.
          Bishop climbs into his car, pulls away.

          INT. BISHOP'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Bishop drives the car out of McKenna's estate, pulls out onto
          the street. He starts to accelerate away... then STOPS the
          car in the middle of the street.
          ON BISHOP. Fighting what his guts are screaming at him.
          Losing it, POUNDING on the steering wheel. Suddenly still...

          EXT. POOL AREA, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT

          Party rages on, oblivious to the absence of its recipient.
          Suddenly faces turn UPWARDS... to where Steve is looking down
          on everyone from a third story balcony over the pool.

                         STEVE

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Are you all having fun!
          SHOUTS and NODS. LAUGHTER.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          I despise each and every one of
          you!
          MORE SHOUTS, LAUGHTER. Steve LEAPS out into space. Perfect
          huge swam dive... falling... HITTING the water. A moment of
          silence... did he? Was that deep enough...?
          Steve ERUPTS out of the water. Party ROARS back into life.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          EXT. GROUNDS, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

          High above the festivities. Bishop slips over the wall,
          makes his way down towards the estate.

          INT. MCKENNA ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

          Dark and empty in here, party raging outside. Bishop enters
          Steve's bedroom. Messy, the bed unmade. A woman's
          underthings lying on the floor.
          Bishop surveys the room, checks drawers, peers down into the
          party below. He can see Steve in the middle of it all,
          Louise on his arm, his hand on her ass.
          Bishop moves to the office door, locked. He slides a pick-
          set out of his pocket, gets to work.

          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT

          The door lock "clicks" and Bishop enters, closes the door
          after himself and locks it, turns around...
          The room has been STRIPPED of everything that was in here
          last time. GONE are the paintings, the portraits, the
          mementos. All traces of Harry McKenna, removed.
          Instead, a SINGLE desk inhabits the center of the room, a
          small computer monitor and keyboard centered on it. Bishop
          comes around, touches a key on the keyboard. The monitor
          glows to life with a single "PASSWORD" prompt.
          Bishop stares at it. He sits, staring, concentrating...

          EXT. POOL AREA, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

          Steve has moved to the edge of the raised patio, looking down
          into the valley. His eyes still, deep, impossible to read.

                         LOUISE
          Hey! Hey baby! Karen's got some
          amazing E. You need to come try...
          Steve turns those cool eyes on her. She shrinks. We think
          he might slap her, then:

                         STEVE
          Give me a moment. I'll be right
          there. We'll do that amazing E.
          And he looks away, back down over the view. A resigned
          loneliness settling into his features.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Bishop, just staring at the password prompt which throbs in
          front of him. Beat. His eyes flick across to the few books
          lying on the desk. Weaponry, physiology... Greek Mythology.
          Bishop reaches forward, types "Nemesis." Hits ENTER. A
          moment... and then our minds are blown.
          The entire wall of the room in front of Bishop glows to life.
          It's a one large high-resolution monitor. On it, glows an
          infinitely detailed work-up on Bishop. A photograph on him
          glows at the center of the screen, changing every three or
          four seconds to another.
          This is Bishop's method, brought into the 21st century.
          Accounts, Medical charts, psych profile, associates,
          residence...
          Bishop approaches... takes it in. Touches "Accounts" and the
          window SPREADS OUT across the whole wall. Multiple windows,
          all of Bishop's money, displayed in real time, the numbers
          subtly changing with the flow of foreign markets.
          Another window above is labeled "Associates." Bishop touches
          this one and the financial windows are replaced with a
          collage of FACES. Not too many. We recognize the Store
          Owner and his Daughter. Steve himself. An older man "Gerald
          Bishop," Bishop's father. And a photo of the Woman.
          Bishop touches the woman and multiple images propagate out
          from the single. Many stills, but several are in motion,
          looping: Childhood movies. A commercial done as a teen. A
          blue movie when she was 20. Bishop's eyes settle on a video
          image: He and the woman, caught just an hour ago in the
          middle of the dancing party. The woman leaning to him,
          kissing him.
          Bishop stares at the image, then touches another image
          labeled "Residence." INSTANTLY, the images are replaced with
          images of the interior and exterior of Bishop's home.
          Bishop stares at them, confused. SQUINTS... realizing that
          in one of the images, the trees lightly sway in the breeze.

                         BISHOP
          Huh.
          His eyes dart to an image of his DINING ROOM. It looks like
          a still, until suddenly Bishops' cat passes through the
          frame. Bishops' eyes dart, moving from frame to frame. The
          whole interior of his life. His living room, bedroom, study,
          gym. All live feeds.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          Son of a bitch...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          INT. BEDROOM, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Door BURSTS open, Steve pushing in, his arms wrapped around
          Louise and another gorgeous woman from the party. As the two
          women hit the bed, start undressing each other, Steve takes a
          moment -- sensing. Something not right. He pulls keys from
          his pocket, unlocks the study door, peers in.

          STEVE'S P.O.V.: THE STUDY - EMPTY

          LOUISE (O.S.)
          Come on, Steve. We need you.

          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

          Low end. Mean men and loose women. Metal on the juke. Duct-
          taped naugahyde. Bartender on parole. Eyes raise as Bishop
          pushes in, scattered focus, hits the bar.

                         BISHOP
          Whiskey. Neat. Lots of it.
          Bishop fumbles in his pocket, brings out a thick wad of cash.
          $100s and $20s. Eyes track. At a booth, two EX CONS lock
          onto Bishop, one sporting a middle-finger raised FU tattoo on
          his bare shoulder. Bishop pushes $100 forward.

                         BARTENDER
          That's too much.
          Bishop grabs the shot, down it. Pushes the empty shot and
          the cash back at the bartender.

                         BISHOP
          I'm not going anywhere.

          AN HOUR LATER
          Another shot is put down on the bar, empty. Bishop wipes
          watery eyes, nods to the bartender to hit it again.
          Bishop stares at the drink, then his attention is drawn to
          the bar TV. Footage from the protests in Turkey is narrated
          by a news anchor, speaking.

          FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR
          ...Intelligence services can listen
          to our calls. But what about the
          rest of the world?

          92.

          FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D)
          Well, today the answer seems to be
          'No" as outrage over the
          assassination of the Turkish envoy
          Bahar Miryem has forced the US to
          reverse its position, now saying
          that it will not make it support of
          Turkey's EU bid contingent on its
          cooperation in the security
          agreement. Miryem had always
          advocated for Turkish autonomy from

                         --
          Bartender hits a remote, annoyed. Channel changes to a 70's
          Charles Bronson flick. Bishop blinks, shakes his head...
          He collects himself, weaves out of the bar. The Ex-Cons
          watch him go.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

          Bishop weaves his way into an alley to piss. Relieves
          himself on a wall. Done, he zips up, turns...
          WHAM! One of the Ex-Cons catches him across the face with a
          punch. Bishop reels back against the wall.

                         BISHOP
          ...More.
          WHAM! WHAM! Bishop takes the punches, no defense. Face
          punished. The guy backs off, slightly winded.

                         EX CON
          Dude, you don't want any more, give
          us that money.
          Bishop shakes his head. WHAM! WHAM! Two more hits to the
          body. Bishop just keeps taking the punishment. Seems to
          relish it. Spits blood.

                         BISHOP
          Look, I'll give you my money, but
          you have to promise me you won't
          spend it all on lipstick and
          tampons.
          Ex Con #2 pulls a gun, puts it to Bishop's head.

                         EX CON #2
          You wanna die right here,
          motherfucker?
          Bishop raises his eyes to the man. Not so drunk after all.

                         BISHOP
          ...Thank you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Bishop sits at his dining room table, staring straight ahead.
          His face is cut, his flesh swollen. He STARES. If paranoia
          and loneliness had a face, this is it.
          REVERSE to find the Artist's portrait of him, hung on the
          wall across, a surreal and distorted mirror. He chews his
          food steady, even, acutely aware he's being watched.
          We LINGER on the small camera eye tucked in the high corner
          of the room, staring down...

          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

          Steve sits half-naked in the office chair, the high-tech wall
          illuminated in front of him. In the bed in the other room,
          the two women are asleep, nude, draped over each other.
          Steve watches Bishop leave his table. He hits a control and
          the image SHIFTS, picks up Bishop checking his mail, grabbing
          a baseball cap from a rack as Bishop moves to his den,
          settles into a chair facing the television. Can't see his
          face, just the back of the cap on his head, the tv screen,
          set to white static. He touches a key and the IMAGE ZOOMS IN
          on Bishop, moving slightly...

          LOUISE (O.S.)

                         (SLEEPY)
          Steve...? Where are you, baby?

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          The TV purrs static, white flickering light fills the room.
          We SLOWLY TURN, reversing, to find: The baseball cap, held
          up at the top of the chair by a pillow. No sign of Bishop.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Bishop moves through shadows. He knows the positions of the
          cameras, avoids them, heads towards his BARN.

          INT. BARN - NIGHT

          Bishop enters, turns on lights. He threads his way through
          his collection of beautiful automobiles until he reaches the
          far wall. He ROLLS up a large steel door...
          ... revealing a wall, COVERED with his research on Steve.
          Lots of it, weeks of work. He moves forward to a paper that
          lists stats about Steve that includes a blank space for
          "Occupation:" Bishop fills it in: "Mechanic."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.
          Suddenly LIGHTS wash across the space. Bishop glances out:
          A VAN is making it's way up the drive.

          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT

          The wall-sized monitor glows Steve's face as he watches the
          DHL driver get out, makes his way to the door, knock...
          Steve's eyes flick to what he can see of Bishop, asleep in
          the chair. No movement... Steve LEANS FORWARD, interested.
          The DHL Driver knocks again, rings the bell. Still no
          motion... and then Bishop RISES from the chair, makes his way
          to the door.
          Steve watches Bishop signing, closing the door and moving
          into his living room where he opens the package, considers
          the small jump-drive that slides into his hands.
          ON STEVE. Watching.

          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - MORNING

          CLOSE on Bishop's weighted RP turntable. The needle coming
          down... touching spinning vinyl. Stones' "Sympathy for the
          Devil" croons out.
          ON BISHOP, tacking up pages, photographs, financials. We
          don't get a clear look, but some pages are redacted, there's
          government letterhead. Personnel files, budgets,
          itineraries. Many stamped "CLASSIFIED."
          Bishop draws lines, connections. Tosses some pages down,
          pins others higher. Working it. He backs off, stares
          through us.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - MORNING

          Steve pushes in, looks around, tracks towards the study.

                         STEVE
          Hello? Bishop?
          He enters the study, sees the WALL, the night's work. In the
          center, a photograph of Dean, Bishop's boss.

          BISHOP (O.S.)
          There you are.
          Bishop is leaning in from outside. Nods to Steve.

                         STEVE
          So who is he?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         BISHOP
          ...US Government. NSA. Very well
          protected.

                         STEVE
          What happened to you?

                         BISHOP
          You should see the other guy.
          Bishop TOSSES Steve an object, goes back outside. Steve
          looks at it. A WELDER'S helmet with visor.

          EXT. BISHOP'S BACK PATIO - MORNING

          Steve comes out to find Bishop working intently on a chemical
          project. He's pouring a black plastic-like substance into a
          shallow mold creating a Quarter-sized object. EXTREME CARE.

                         STEVE
          What's that?

                         BISHOP
          This... is liquid Semtex with a
          built in combustible. Very
          volatile. Nice and shiny once it
          dries. But don't... scratch it.
          Bishop takes a knife, scratches the surface of the coin-sized
          disc, then backs off, by Steve, back into

          INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS


                         STEVE
          So that's how we take him out?

                         BISHOP
          (shaking his head)
          No. That's just to focus the mind.

                         STEVE
          You makes bombs to focus your mind.

                         BISHOP
          What do you do?
          (beat, off the Wall)
          This one's different. They want it
          fast, and they don't want it to
          look like an accident. Someone
          wants to send a message.

                         STEVE
          Like with my father.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         BISHOP
          Yes. Like that.

                         STEVE
          Didn't think that was your style.

                         BISHOP

                         (BEAT)
          First time for everything.
          Steve looks at Bishop. BOOM! Outside the explosion
          CONCUSSES against the house. A window CRACKS. Steve
          crouches, hands covering his head.

                         STEVE
          Jesus...
          Bishop puts a hand out.

                         BISHOP
          There's something I haven't told
          you.

                         STEVE
          What?

                         BISHOP
          ...I broke a rule. I brought you
          in without asking. So this hit, is
          a test. Of us, of our arrangement.
          (beat, off Dean's picture)
          If that man is breathing three days
          from now... then they'll need to
          make an example of us. Do you
          understand?
          Steve ... nods. Takes Bishop's hand who pulls him up.

                         STEVE
          So what you're saying is you and I
          are stuck with each other.

                         BISHOP
          I'm sorry.

                         STEVE
          ...For what?

                         BISHOP
          For getting you into this --

                         STEVE
          I knew what I was doing.
          Bishop considers, nods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         BISHOP
          Get packed.

          INT. TENEMENT - DAY

          Steve and Bishop push in, backpacks on. Trash, bad lighting,
          sad people in dirty hallways. They start up a long flight
          of stairs.

          EXT. ROOFTOP, TENEMENT - DAY

          Steve and Bishop push out onto this dilapidated rooftop,
          Washington DC spread out around them. They unpack gear from
          the backpacks. Tripod, camera and telescope are quickly
          assembled.
          Bishop steps back, lets Steve take the first look. Bishop
          takes notes.

                         STEVE
          ...I count six... no seven at the
          main door.
          P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: The front entrance of the NSA
          building. The security check Bishop went through.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Jesus they've got US Marines in
          there. Two at the door, one...
          maybe another two out of sight.
          Bishop considers Steve, locked to the telescope, the sharp
          point of the pen in his hand...

          BISHOP (O.S.)
          Fifth floor, corner office.
          P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Steve finds Dean, at his desk,
          talking on the phone. Animated.

                         STEVE
          ... Alright, got him. He's at his
          desk. We could take the shot right
          from here.

                         BISHOP
          Glass is three inches thick...
          Steve moves his hand to turn on the laser Bishop used before
          to listen with...

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          And has laser sensors.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          Steve laughs, suddenly walks away from the telescope. Bishop
          goes to it, takes up the watch.

                         STEVE
          Alright, fine. What are we doing
          here? Who is this guy?
          P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Dean shouts into the phone,
          slams it down. Leaves his office. Bishop pulls away from
          the telescope, hunkers down to wait.

                         BISHOP
          Starting to get it?

                         STEVE
          Yeah, I'm getting that this isn't a
          job. It's just a really
          complicated... suicide.
          Bishop smiles. Steve moves off, restless.

          EXT. ROOFTOP, TENEMENT - NIGHT

          Whole day has passed. Bishop hasn't moved, stares across at
          the NSA building, the corner office. Steve sits nearby.

                         STEVE
          You know, you can front sonofabitch
          all you want, Bishop. You're
          scared, too. You don't really know
          how we're going to pull it off, do
          you? You ever think there's some
          things that just can't be done?

                         BISHOP
          Everyone has a death --

                         STEVE
          Really? Because, this guy? I look
          at this guy, I don't see his death.
          I see my death. And I don't
          particularly like the view.
          Bishop notes the lights going back on in Dean's office,
          returns to the telescope and starts jotting notes in a book.
          P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Dean back at his desk. He
          looks exhausted.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          And you know, as much as I like the
          quality time, unless you can read
          lips, I don't exactly see what
          we're doing here...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          Steve glances at Bishop's pad where he's transcribing words:
          "No, no, tomorrow. I'm sick of this, this is my life we're
          taking about. You're bringing me in. Give me a time and a
          place..."

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          You read lips.
          Bishop glances at Steve, puts his eye back to the camera.
          P.O.V. THROUGH THE LENS: EXTREME CLOSE on Dean's desk. A
          piece of paper on the blotter. "Click." "Click."
          Bishop pulls the memory-card from the camera.

                         BISHOP

                         (INNOCENTLY)
          You any good with computers?

          INT. BISHOP'S BARN - DAY

          Bishop is working on his classic Mustang. He's got the
          steering column apart, working the mechanism. Focused.

          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT

          Steve is in front of the electronic wall of info on Bishop.
          His hospital report open. In a separate window, video feed
          of the real Bishop in his barn working on his car.
          Steve marks the injury on Bishop, then opens a new window.
          Multiple images of the scrap of paper on Dean's desk. Steve
          gets to work enlarging, rotating, skewing the images...
          Music and LAUGHTER filter in from outside. Steve becomes
          aware of the noise from outside, frowns.

          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

          Steve emerges onto the high balcony overlooking the never-
          ending party. He raises a GUN and fires into the air.
          Faces, startled look up at him.

                         STEVE
          Everybody out. I'm serious. Get
          the fuck off my property.
          A moment, then people start to flee. Only Louise, drink in
          hand, moves towards Steve, confused.

                         LOUISE
          Steve, baby...?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          Steve levels the gun at her.

                         STEVE
          You, too.

          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

          Steve comes back into his office, facing the wall. He tosses
          the gun on the table, gets back to work. Glances at one of
          the other open windows that shows Bishop at his fridge,
          pouring himself filtered water.
          Steve's hands fly. The images are pieced together, enlarged,
          skewed until nonsensical markings resolve into an address.
          Steve punches it into a search window, waits a beat, then
          eyes scan over the list of returns, lock onto something.
          He picks up the phone, punches a number. Watches as Bishop's
          phone rings, watches Bishop answer it.

          BISHOP (O.S.)
          Did you get it?

                         STEVE
          It's the US Attorney's office in
          New York. He's running. He's
          trying to get out.
          Steve, trying to read Bishop's face, ZOOMING in.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Do you think we're hitting him
          because of what he's done, or
          because he's trying to get away
          with what he's done?

          BISHOP (O.S.)
          Does it make a difference?

                         STEVE
          ...No, I don't suppose it does.
          A beat. The two men, far separated.

          BISHOP (O.S.)
          Do the angles. Find us a shot.

          EXT. DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MORNING

          Steve and Bishop step out of the airport with bags, hail a
          taxi and climb in, headed into DC.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

          STEVE (V.O.)
          Security's going to have the actual
          street locked down. But there's a
          residential street, perpendicular.

          EXT. DC STREETS - MORNING

          Upscale streets lined with brownstone walk-ups. Steve and
          Bishop walk with roller bags and a shoulder tube past mothers
          and Nanny's ushering their children to school.

          STEVE (V.O.)
          High-end people. They'll put up
          with a sweep, but they're not going
          to allow an agent to spend the day.
          They reach an address. Bishop puts on a hat, some
          sunglasses, slaps a badge onto his jacket that reads "DC
          Municipal Utilities." He trots up the the half-flight, rings
          the bell of an elegant brownstone.

          INT. DC FLAT - MORNING

          Nice. Lace curtains. Classic living room. Magazine racks,
          grand piano, original art.

                         STEVE
          Besides, the angle isn't right, too
          flat. Except when they hit the
          stairs. It'll spread the group
          vertically. It's... the shot.
          Steve and Bishop work in quiet efficient silence. Each opens
          their bag, removes a series of innocuous objects, begins to
          dismantle them for the more important parts they conceal.
          From a clock, a firing mechanism. From the tube, an aluminum
          barrel holds a fishing rod. The rod is discarded, the barrel
          is attached to a hard plastic stock. AA Batteries are opened
          and slender shells are removed from each.
          As this strange choreography continues in silence, we PAN
          ACROSS to the dining room where a WOMAN and a MAN are bound
          and tied, pillowcases cinched over their heads. Their
          bindings allow them to hold each other's hands which they
          do, tight. They're terrified, but okay.
          Back in the living room, Bishop adds the last piece to the
          home-made rifle, a telescope, lifted from a child's gift box,
          snaps it on top of the rifle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

          INT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - DAY

          Dean squints in the back of his limo as it pulls into
          daylight. He's on the phone, eyes darting, nervous.

          DEAN (O.S.)
          Look, I don't care. Find her, I
          need to talk to her right now...

          INT. DC FLAT - DAY

          Bishop puts the rifle to his shoulder, sights. Behind him,
          Steve slips a blade from the crease of his suitcase,
          considers it, looks back to Bishop.

                         STEVE
          You ever worry about the right and
          wrong of it all? I'm not talking
          about God, just...
          (tapping his chest)
          Whatever you feel here.
          BISHOP'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SCOPE: The US Attorney building.
          The security detail. The steps leading to the street.

                         BISHOP
          It's a little late for --

                         STEVE
          Come on. You're telling me you've
          never done anything just because it
          was the right thing to do, even if
          it didn't make any sense? You
          never took a chance like that?
          Bishop pulls his eye away from the scope a touch.

                         BISHOP
          Once I did...

                         STEVE
          How'd that work out for you?
          Beat. Then suddenly Bishop's view is obscured by a large
          truck, which has stopped trying to make the turn.

                         BISHOP
          We have a problem...
          Bishop moves the scope, precisely looking for alternatives.
          Nothing. He sets the rifle down, thinking as Steve takes in
          the new situation.

                         STEVE
          There's no shot. What do we do?
          There's no shot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          A moment more, and then Bishop MOVES. We travel with him, to
          the entryway. Keys, hats, jackets, sunglasses. Bishop grabs
          a hat, tosses one to Steve.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Bishop...?
          And Bishop's out.

          EXT. US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          The TRUCK, wedged in. The security detail, suspicious of the
          truck. COPS get involved. Men speak into radios.

          EXT. DC BROWNSTONE - AFTERNOON

          MOVING with Bishop, Steve following. Hats and sunglasses.
          They descend the steps onto the sidewalk, closing on the US
          Attorney building ahead. Steve comes abreast of him as they
          move down the street.

                         BISHOP
          On your four. You see him?
          Coming up, a MAN in a jogging suit stretches, touches his ear
          where's he's wired.
          Steve and Bishop come abreast of him. WHAM! Steve pushes
          him down into the garbage alley between two homes. WHAM!
          WHAM! The man drops. Steve comes back, the man's gun
          palmed. Offers it to Bishop.

          BISHOP (CONT'D)
          No. You're the shooter.

                         STEVE
          When?

                         BISHOP
          You'll know when.
          WITH THEM, MOVING, taking the corner onto the main street in
          front of the large building.

          INT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - CONTINUOUS

          Dean's eyes track the outside, the limo making the final turn
          onto the street. Security visible ahead.

                         DEAN

                         (ON PHONE)
          Hey... Listen, I need you to go out
          of town for a few days. No, I
          know, but you have to trust me.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         DEAN (CONT'D)
          Just go -- no, don't tell me where.
          Just go, okay. Okay? Yes, I'll
          call you soon, I gotta go...

          EXT. DC STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          Steve and Bishop, MOVING. They pass directly behind a
          COMMAND VEHICLE. Security on headsets, watching monitors.
          LOCAL POLICE are also working, one COP in particular guarding
          the corner of the perimeter.
          Bishop nods to Steve who heads up the stairs towards the
          building. Bishop checks his watch, looks down the street
          where DEAN'S LIMO and escort have turned the corner.
          Bishop moves to the cop, stands in front of him. The guy
          patiently puts a hand on him, moving him on.
          Bishop doesn't move. The cop FROWNS.
          A needle hits a record's surface. "Pleased to meet you, hope
          you guess my name..."

          I/E. GOVERNMENT LIMO - CONTINUOUS
          Suddenly dropping into Dean's POV as his limo pulls up to the
          steps. Chaotic motion, LIGHT STREAMING IN as the car door
          opens, security handlers reach in. We MOVE, fast up steps
          lined by City POLICE. One of the police turning his head,
          staring at Dean. Bishop.
          ON DEAN. Suddenly frozen. His handlers unsure what's going
          on, alert that something's not right.

                         DEAN
          ...Bishop?
          Bishop does NOTHING. Security reads Dean's fear, closes on
          Bishop even as Dean himself starts to BACK AWAY, separating
          himself from his own security, now turning to RUN...
          ... Straight into Steve, gun raised. A small moment frozen
          in time as Dean understands his end...
          BANG BANG! - BANG! Steve double-taps Dean in the chest, then
          one to head. And CHAOS begins its rule.
          Security which were closing on Bishop now REVERSE, draw
          weapons and FIRE at Steve who drops down in the small cement
          crease between stairs and statues.
          ON STEVE. Ducked low, bullet shattering granite and marble
          around him, LAUGHING. The first glimpse of something WRONG
          inside this young man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          ACROSS THE STEPS
          Bishop, for the moment forgotten by the security who have
          reversed to deal with Steve, suddenly ANIMATES.
          Perfect timing, the security REVERSING again as Bishop draws
          his gun and FIRES, over and over, clipping officers and
          security in the legs as he SPRINTS down the steps towards...

          INT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - CONTINUOUS

          Bishop lands inside the limo, pulls the door shut as bullets
          "thunk" into armored sides and spider bullet-proof glass.
          The DRIVER looks back through the opening, surprised, just in
          time for Bishop to grab him by the collar and HAUL him into
          the back at the same time slipping through the opening and
          sliding into the driver's position.
          As he slams the shifter into REVERSE men line up in front,
          OPEN UP with weapons.

          EXT. DC STREET - CONTINUOUS

          WHEELS SMOKE, Limo ACCELERATES backwards, angling UP THE
          STEPS. Security DIVE ASIDE as the Limo clears the rail,
          comes down HARD just across from the small alcove Steve's
          pressed into. The passenger door opens.

                         BISHOP
          Get in.
          Security are standing up, opening up, as Steve DIVES forward.

          INT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - CONTINUOUS

          Steve lands awkward in the front seat as Bishop throws the
          limo into drive, floors it DOWN the steps of the building,
          men diving aside, swerving onto the street.

                         STEVE
          Thanks.

                         BISHOP
          Behind you.
          Steve has half a second to puzzle this one as the Driver
          grabs him from behind, HAULS him backwards.
          Bishop eyes his mirrors, counting the number of vehicles
          pursuing. Eyes makes calculations, gets distracted for a
          moment from the RAGING FISTFIGHT between Steve and the Driver
          occurring in the rear compartment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          Bishop raises the divider, steps on the gas.

          EXT. DC STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          Engine WHINES, Limo surges forward, pursuit cars dropping
          off. There are no turns, no spins. This is straight-line
          acceleration circa FRENCH CONNECTION. Bishop guides the limo
          faster and faster, blasting across intersections, timing his
          spacing to inches, no margin for error.
          Around him, pursuit cars aren't as good, they VEER off into
          crashes, clip traffic, SPIN out of control.

          INT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - CONTINUOUS

          In front of Bishop, intersection after intersection of cross-
          cutting traffic. Bishop speeds up or slows just a fraction,
          making space for the limo, BARELY.
          He notices a hand-held automatic weapon secured to the dash,
          grabs it, checks his mirrors.
          IN THE REARVIEW: Bishop watches a pursuit car T-BONED by a
          truck, then his view is blocked by STEVE and the DRIVER as
          they wrestle and fight.
          Over his initial surprise, the Driver's trained, and good.
          He locks Steve up, SLAMS him against the window, choking him.
          UP AHEAD. Bishop sees a traffic jam LOOMING ahead, the limo
          closing at 100 mph, no alternatives. He lowers the divider.

                         BISHOP
          Get in front.

                         STEVE
          Working on that...

                         BISHOP
          Now!
          Bishop HAULS UP the E-Brake, putting the Limo into a SPIN.
          The shift in force tosses Steve and Guard across the rear
          space. Steve dives forward towards the front as...

          EXT. DC STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          The Limo goes into a 4-wheel ROTATION, angling towards the
          hard corner of a building and WHAM! Limo clips the building
          halfway, SHEERS the limo in half. The rear section crumples
          against the building as the front section SKIDS down the
          building face, comes to rest against a GROCERY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          Bishop and Steve recover, roll out of the now exposed rear of
          the driver's compartment and into

          INT. GROCERY - CONTINUOUS

          Bishop and Steve slide in as POLICE CARS slide to a stop
          outside. Small glimpses of COPS and SWAT taking positions.
          Steve peeks over a counter. A few cops fire. A glass window
          SHEERS, fruit catches rounds.

                         STEVE
          We have got to go!
          Steve's pointing at the rear exit. It looks far away.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          You go for it, I'll cover you.
          Bishop takes in the exit, the gun in Steve's hand...

          EXT. GROCERY - CONTINUOUS

          More COPS arrive, take positions. There must be thirty guns
          pointed in their direction.

          INT. GROCERY - CONTINUOUS

          Bishop cranes around, tracks cop and SWAT...

                         BISHOP
          I'm sorry I brought you into this.

                         STEVE
          Not now, Bishop, we have to --

                         BISHOP
          It was... It was the only thing I
          knew how to teach you.
          Steve looks at him oddly, moved. Then...

                         STEVE
          Don't worry about it, Bishop. I
          brought myself into this.
          Bishop considers this, nods. And he's UP AND FIRING towards
          the SWAT.

                         BISHOP
          Go!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          ON STEVE. Clear shot at Bishop. A micro-second hesitation,
          and then he's RUNNING for the rear exit.

          EXT. GROCERY - CONTINUOUS

          Cops and FBI REACT to the shots, ALL open up.

          INT. GROCERY - CONTINUOUS

          The WINDOW'S ERUPT in a hail of gunfire from the outside.
          Bishop hits the ground, rolls towards the rear exit. Bottles
          and produce EXPLODING under the assault. Steve reaches the
          exit, glances back to see Bishop on his tail, room being
          chewed-up behind him.

          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Steve BLOWS down a corridor. A SWAT member suddenly comes
          out of as side-door, raising his weapon...
          Steve FLATTENS him, comes up with the man's weapon, reverses,
          lining it straight at Bishop... who hits the ground, as Steve
          FIRES rounds pushing back pursuing SWAT behind Bishop.
          More SWAT push in, shields raised, guns lined. Bishop SLAMS
          into them from the side. Pushes one through a door, breaks
          anothers knee as he disarms him, moves after Steve.

          EXT. ALLEY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

          Steve and Bishop emerge almost simultaneously, race up the
          alley as SWAT emerges behind them, rounds tracing after them.
          They clear the alley, onto...

          EXT. DC STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          Pedestrians and shoppers crowd the small streets. Bishop and
          Steve tear through people on opposite sides of the street as
          overhead a helicopter clatters.
          Behind them, SWAT and COPS give chase.
          UP AHEAD, a van skids to a halt, SWAT pouring out. Bishop
          and Steve duck into...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          INT. RETAIL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

          Travel agency. Displays fly as they muscle through to the
          back, then through service corridors, back into a RESTAURANT,
          headed for the front door...
          TWO COP cars close from outside. Bishop raises his weapon,
          OPENS UP into the metal of the cars. The COPS panic,
          REVERSE, SLAMMING into parked cars. The cops piling out and
          taking position as RESTAURANT PATRONS scream and flee.
          Bishops checks his fire. PURE INSTINCT, swings his weapon to
          lock onto Steve who's also raised his weapon at Bishop. The
          two of them, suddenly lining weapons into each other's faces.
          Breathing had... eyes locked as beyond them another police
          reinforcement arrive, takes position...
          The SOUND of a cop, distant outside, CHAMBERING a round into
          a shotgun...
          Both men DIVE to the ground, roll even as they switch to
          single-shot mode to preserve ammo. BANG BANG BANG, they fire
          back at their attackers, precise, as the cops open up.

          WITH THE COPS
          Firing. Bullets find exposed legs and arms, men stumble back
          or fall to the ground, screaming.

          STEVE AND BISHOP
          Almost at the same exact moment, the men switch their aim
          back to each other. Both men, controlling emotion and body.
          Gasping for breath, bleeding.

                         BISHOP
          ...Why?

                         STEVE
          You don't know?
          Tense beat. Glimpsed through shattered windows, SWAT
          arrives, takes the perimeter. They're being surrounded.
          Suddenly an SUV pulls into view between the restaurant and
          the SWAT and Police position, a confused and frightened WOMAN
          at the wheel. Police SHOUT at her, confusing her more.
          Steve makes a decision. Lowers his weapon, grabs a napkin,
          ties it to hide his features.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Cover me.
          And with that Steve is RUNNING towards the outside...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.
          ... BEHIND STEVE, Bishop steps out, gun in each hand. Clean
          shot of Steve's back. He opens up. Bullets tracing around
          Steve, pushing the men back just long enough for Steve to
          reach the SUV, haul open the door.

          INT. SUV - CONTINUOUS

          The WOMAN screams as Steve pushes her aside, takes the wheel.
          She scratches back, one hand ripping the bandana away from
          Steve's face. He STARES at her for one deadly second.

          INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

          Bishop FLINCHES as the sound of the SHOT come from the SUV.
          The passenger door opens and the woman climbs out as the SUV
          ACCELERATES away, cops and SWAT firing after it.
          BISHOP'S P.O.V.: The woman watches her car go, then turns
          and sits on the pavement. Her hand moves to her chest, comes
          away bloody.
          ON BISHOP. Angry like we've never seen him. Cold. Furious.
          The stupid waste of it all. He meets the woman's gaze. She
          dies looking at him.
          Helicopters clatter above, bullets plink into dishware and
          hardwood. Bishop just stares at the woman for a long beat,
          then he turns away, back into the building.
          It is... over.

          EXT. DC STREETS - DAY (LATER)

          SWAT approaches the SUV, slammed against another car.
          Shielded men throw the door open. It's empty.

          INT. RESTAURANT - DAY (LATER)

          SWAT move into the restaurant Bishop was last seen in. Guns
          lined, checking corners. But there's no sign of Bishop.

          INT. DC FLAT - AFTERNOON

          Bishop enters the flat. Cool afternoon breeze blows through
          curtains. He stops, stares at the couple who owned the flat
          who now lie motionless. Small holes in the red-stained
          pillowcases over their heads. Steve has been here.
          Bishop swallows, angry. He forces himself back to the task
          at hand. Breaking down the never-fired weapon. He works
          efficiently, silently.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111.

          INT. AIRPORT - EVENING

          Bishop sits at the gate, waiting to board his plane. He
          watches families get ready, college kids laughing.
          On the silent TVs, CNN shows footage of the aftermath of the
          gunfight in the street. "Eight dead." A US Attorney
          speaking at a press conference.

                         US ATTORNEY
          ...Something is wrong in this
          country. But today because of the
          actions of a few cowardly men, we
          may never know the true face of --
          A voice announces boarding, drowning out the TV. Bishop
          collects his things.

          INT. LOCAL GROCERY - NIGHT

          Grocer glances at Bishop's two grocery bags, then to the
          clock: 7:10. Sophie reads her book with her doll. A CAR
          speeds by outside. Sophie tracks it, looks at her father.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Key in the lock, Bishop enters, stands in his living room.
          TENSE. WAITING. Nothing.

          INT. BISHOP'S GYM - NIGHT

          Bishop stands in front of his machines, still. Reaches out,
          touches one. Waiting.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME- NIGHT

          Bishop sits across from the portrait of himself, finishes the
          last bite of his dinner. He takes the plate, walks into the
          kitchen and to the sink, washes the plate...
          His cat curls around his legs, purrs. Bishop takes a scrap
          off the plate, bends down and feeds it to her.
          She starts to eat, then her EYES NARROW... WHAM! Steve hits
          him from out of nowhere. Bishop sprawls as Steve LOOMS, gun
          lined!
          WHAM! Bishop hits Steve with the fridge door, knocks the gun
          out of his hands, it skitters along the floor. Bishop moves
          towards it, Steve swings a knife. Bishop catches the blow,
          but Steve HAULS down on the bad shoulder. Bishop SCREAMS as
          something gives, stumbles back as Steve swings again, Bishop
          turning, catching the blade in his shoulder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.
          Bishop reels back against the wall as Steve picks up the gun
          and BANG! BANG! BANG! Fires as Bishop flees the room.
          Steve follows, keeping his shots controlled. Slugs chew into
          walls, furniture as Bishop dives out the front door.
          Steve advances, re-loading.

                         STEVE
          You know, when they came to me... I
          said "Are you sure?" Bishop?" But
          They're right, aren't they?

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

          Steve steps out onto the porch.

                         STEVE
          ...You don't really like the work
          anymore.
          Bishop's voice comes from the darkness near the barn.

                         BISHOP
          Maybe not.
          BLAM! BLAM! Steve SHOOTS as Bishop MOVES, finds cover.

                         STEVE
          Yeah. That's... what did you call
          it? That's a prerequisite.

                         (BEAT)
          Besides, I guess I had other
          reasons.

                         BISHOP
          If it matters, today we killed the
          man who ordered the hit on your
          father.

                         STEVE
          Yeah, but not the man who actually
          killed him.
          Steve advances, clearing the side of the barn, LINES his
          weapon on Bishop, who's standing next to the barn.

                         BISHOP
          Why'd you kill those other people?

                         STEVE
          (shakes his head)
          You really going moral high ground
          on me? Seriously? You might want
          to check your soapbox there,
          partner.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.
          BLAM! Steve fires just as Bishop SLIDES back, into the barn
          through a side door. Steve LAUGHS, slides towards the front.

          STEVE (CONT'D)

                         (CALLING OUT)
          But that's the difference between
          us, isn't it? You're all alone,
          but you still... like people. You
          wish they liked you. Whereas I
          have people everywhere... and all I
          ever want, is to be alone.
          Steve hears BANGING coming from the barn.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          There's no weapons in there,
          Bishop! I've... what did you teach
          me? I've controlled the situation.
          One hundred percent.
          BOOM! The barn door blast outwards as Bishop's vintage
          Mustang come careening out of the barn at Steve...
          Who STANDS HIS GROUND. He aims, fires five times through the
          windscreen. The rounds IMPACTING Bishop as the car LOOMS at
          Steve who steps aside at the last moment, the car barely
          missing him, continuing on and IMPACTING against the side of
          the house... the propane tank.
          Steve squints and BOOOOOM! The propane tank ERUPTS in flame.
          Steve is knocked back.
          When he rises, the interior of the car is an inferno. The
          body is slumped against the wheel, the fire consuming him,
          cleansing him.
          Steve. Bleeding, bruised, victorious.

          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Steve enters the study, looking down at Bishop's record
          player, looks back at the wall of work on Dean. Smoke seeps
          through the walls, pushes through cracks in sills.
          Steve opens Bishop's record collection, takes the pristine
          collector's Hendrix. The one never played.
          He moves into the living room. FLAMES lick across the walls.
          Through the smoke, he sees the portrait of Bishop staring
          back at him. He raises the album in thanks.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT

          Steve now stands outside Bishop's home, watching. The whole
          place is an inferno.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.
          INSIDE. Pictures bubble and peel before turning black in the
          heat. The stack of DVDs melts, dripping down...
          IN THE BARN. Flaming beams crash down, crumple classic cars.
          Steve watches it all. The fire reflected in his eyes.

          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - DAY

          A hot gorgeous day. Slight breeze blows through trees,
          ripples the water on the pool which is suddenly CUT THROUGH
          by the figure of Steve, swimming laps, hard.
          He gets out at the far end, looks over his grounds. There's
          no one here anymore. The place is deserted except for ear-
          wired SECURITY who patrol the grounds.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - DAY

          POLICE and FIRE pick through the smouldering rubble. A
          DETECTIVE watches as the door to Bishop's fire-ravaged car is
          pried off.

          INT. MCKENNA ESTATE - DAY

          Steve trots in from outside, pulling on a loose shirt. The
          house is spotless, transformed. No sign of a frivolous young
          man's pursuits. Art and culture and wealth.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - DAY

          The door to the car gives suddenly, falls to the ground. The
          Detective pulls a handkerchief, puts it over his nose and
          mouth as he peers in at the body...

          INT. MCKENNA'S OFFICE - DAY

          Steve busts in, dragging his father's 80's turntable with
          him. The portrait of Bishop has been hung here in his
          office. He glances at it, then breaks the seal on the
          Hendrix album, stares at the grooves before seating it on the
          turntable and hitting a switch. Player starts up, needle
          swings over...
          Steve moves to his computer and punches in the password.
          On the wall-sized screen, the Bishop research glows to life.
          All the connections, people, history that made Bishop.
          Bishop's cat jumps into his lap, purring, and Steve strokes
          her. Finally, a decision. He hits a button and the prompt
          "DELETE FILE?" Appears on the screen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.
          Needle comes down, touches the record, the sweet sound of
          Hendrix's "Little Wing" fill the world.
          Steve's finger still hovers over "ENTER." Bishop's cat jumps
          down, trots away. He watches the cat go, hits the button.
          The wall-sized screen goes blank. Just a cool white nothing.
          Steve SMILES, nods, leaning back... when a voice comes from
          the record player, overlayed above the song.

                         BISHOP'S VOICE
          ...Steve, if you hear this, then it
          means you found the right moment to
          play the record. Good for you. It
          also means you had to scratch the
          needle across the surface of the
          record.
          Steve's eyes LOCK on the record player, the needle scratching
          across its surface, from the surface of the record, the
          smallest trace of smoke...

          BISHOP'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Sorry it has to end this way.
          Steve's eyes dart to the portrait of Bishop. Its cold eyes
          stare back.

          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

          KABOOOM! The windows of Steve's office blow out of the
          estate's 2nd story.

                         FADE TO:

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - DAY

          The Detective, handkerchief over his face, leans over the
          body. Burnt beyond recognition. CAMERA moves away, down to
          the body's shoulder...

          BISHOP (V.O.)
          Every man has a death that's right
          for them. Every one.
          ... where a form, a heat shadow, has burnt into the charred
          remains of a shirt. A fist, middle-finger raised. We know
          this tattoo. It was on the ex-con who tried to mug Bishop
          outside the bar. This is not Bishop.

          BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          A death so right that when it
          arrives, those who knew him will
          say "Yes, this is right..."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.
          The detective leans the body forward, and the shadow
          disintegrates into ash.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

          A brand new Maserati crests the hill, moving FAST. Brakes
          lock up, it slides to a stop in a patch of dirt.

          BISHOP (V.O.)
          "...This was always going to happen
          this way."
          Bishop gets out. Shaved, healthy, clean. He climbs onto the
          roof of the car, stares at the highway which winds away into
          the distance.
          Freedom, laid out before him. He stares at it, wanting,
          needing. He blinks.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          THE END

      PHOTO: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER
      HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a
      confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of

      METALLIC GAUNTLET.
      
      The images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the
      MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each
      photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored

      We ZOOM IN to the last headline.
      
      "MASTER MIND BEHIND BARS ONCE AGAIN - THANKS TO UBERMAN!"

      hips, obviously trying to accentuate the "U" insignia on his
      chest.
      
      END OF CREDITS SEQUENCE
      
      EXT. BUILDING - DAY
      
      We DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the
      exact same position.
      
      WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city
      below. A perfect view for our guardian hero.
      
      He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as
      people happily go about their day.
      
      Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's
      expression.
                                                               2.
      
      
      
                          UBERMAN
                You look so peaceful from up here.
      
      His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND
      coming from his wrist.
      
      He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm.
      It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter "U".
      
                          UBERMAN (CONT'D)
                Looks like Roxanne's in trouble
                again.
      
      Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape
      gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off
      into the distance like a speeding bullet.
      
      EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT
      
      Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned
      building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and
      wonder - now home to a great evil.
      
      INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge
      hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC
      EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have
      an obvious function FLASH and HUM.
      
      A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story
      MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS
      INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-
      SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.
      
      He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain
      could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE
      WITH A GIANT GREEN "M" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging
      at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES
      PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.
      
      Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO
      PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.
      
      A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other
      men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.
      The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,
      is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                I hate the outfits. I mean, I get
                it: we're all supposed to be
                "masterminds" - very clever.
                          (MORE)
                                                                3.
                          EINSTEIN(cont'd)
                I just feel stupid. I mean, what
                the hell did Einstein really do
                anyway?
      
                          PLATO
                Theory of relativity.
      
      Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Well, you'd think he'd invent a
                wool sweater that didn't itch so
                much.
      
      Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they
      see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.
      
      Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right
      shoulder and turns around.
      
      He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with
      his metal gauntlet.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                The real Einstein once said, "God
                does not play dice with the world."
                He was right, because the world is
                MY dice. Is that understood?
      
                          DA VINCI & PLATO
                Sir! Yes, sir!
      
                          EINSTEIN
                    (gasping for air)
                Yes, sir.
      
      Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Alright, then - clean slate. Do we
                have the girl?
      
                          DA VINCI
                Yes, sir. She fell into our trap
                just like you knew she would.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Reporters are a curious lot, and
                easily manipulated.
      
      He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his
      posture and sucks in his gut.
                                                                  4.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Alright, let's not keep the lady
                waiting.
      
      MOMENTS LATER
      
      Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE
      RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are
      standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away
      from us.
      
      She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo
      the blindfold.
      
      Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking
      features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes
      that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
      
      The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master
      Mind.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You didn't need to turn around like
                that. I can recognize the stench of
                failure.
      
      Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I trust you gentlemen know the very
                sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly
                regarded investigative journalist
                who some say has a more than
                friendly relationship with our
                super powered foe Uberman. And Miss
                Ritchi, I trust you've already met
                my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!
      
      Roxanne gives Einstein a once over.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Looks like a real group of winners.
                At the risk of sounding cliche',
                you'll never get away with this.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                In a way, I already have.
      
      Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH.
                                                               5.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                We go through this every time. You
                kidnap me to get to Uberman, he
                immediately finds your hideout,
                escapes whatever lame trap you've
                come up with, and takes you and
                your cronies to jail. I propose we
                just save everybody some heartache
                this time by YOU letting me go, and
                ME forgetting this whole thing ever
                happened?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What about my revenge?
      
                          ROXANNE
                We can say it was wasting
                everyone's time.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You have a wicked tongue. I hope
                you rid yourself of that when
                you're my queen.
      
      Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'm sorry. What makes you think I
                would want to be your queen?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Power corrupts absolutely, Miss
                Ritchi. And when I have ultimate
                power over this city, I have
                absolutely every intention of
                corrupting you with it.
      
                          PLATO
                Sir!
      
      Master Mind turns to Plato who's now standing at a computer
      terminal.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (annoyed)
                What is it!?
      
      EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket.
                                                                  6.
      
      
      
      
      INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in.
      He looks around, but there's suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.
      
                                                       CUT TO:
      
      EXT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - DAY
      
      The boat is shooting through the ocean, away from the
      observatory.
      
      INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
      
      Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft's main
      bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see
      the observatory shrinking in the distance.
      
      Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero
      intently searches his hideout.
      
                          UBERMAN
                    (on monitor)
                Master Mind!
      
      INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly -
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                Over here, old friend.
      
      He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT
      SCREEN.
      
                           UBERMAN
                What's the matter, miss your old
                jail cell?
      
      Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.
      
                          MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)
                Actually, I wanted to share the
                experience with my oldest friend.
      
      A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping
      Metro City's protector.
      
      Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.
                                                                  7.
      
      
      
                           UBERMAN
                You can't possibly believe this
                will work.
      
      Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED
      BUTTON on it.
      
                          MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)
                Oh, can't I? I have attained
                control of the Earth's most
                abundant energy source. I doubt
                even you are strong enough to
                withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED
                POWER OF THE SUN!!!
      
      He presses the button.
      
      EXT. OUTER SPACE
      
      A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth's atmosphere. Its
      bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS.
      
      The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the
      sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the
      burning star's power.
      
      The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING
      SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.
      
      INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
      
      From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from
      the observatory.
      
                          PLATO
                We're now at minimum safe distance,
                master.
      
      Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and
      puts down the control box.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Excellent. Stop here, I like this
                view.
      
                          PLATO
                Twenty seconds until impact.
      
      Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci
      and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.
      
      Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the
      monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.
                                                               8.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Any last words?
      
      Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile.
      
                          UBERMAN (ON MONITOR)
                Yes: there's no caging the power of
                justice.
      
                          PLATO
                Ten seconds to impact.
      
      On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage's bars in
      his hands. He yanks...NOTHING.
      
                           PLATO (CONT'D)
                Nine...
      
      Master Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused.
      
                           PLATO (CONT'D)
                Eight...
      
      Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as
      leverage.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (genuinely concerned)
                What's going on?
      
                          UBERMAN
                    (straining)
                Hold...on...a second.
      
      Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They're equally
      befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness.
      
                           PLATO
                Seven...
      
      Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS.
      
                          UBERMAN
                SON OF A BITCH!!
      
      Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison.
      
      Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears.
      
                          DA VINCI
                What did he just say?
                                                               9.
      
      
      
                          PLATO
                Six......Five...
      
      Master Mind begins to laugh.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What kind of trick is this?
      
      Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.
      
                          UBERMAN
                Like you don't know. These bars are
                made of copper, aren't they?
      
                             PLATO
                Four...
      
                             MASTER MIND
                Yeah, so?
      
      Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand.
      
                          UBERMAN
                You figured out my weakness, damn
                you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!
      
                             PLATO
                Three...
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Your weakness is copper?
      
                             PLATO
                Two...one.
      
      Everyone turns to the window.
      
      EXT. OUTER SPACE
      
      The satellite fires a giant BEAM OF LIGHT toward the earth.
      
      EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      The beam hits the observatory. The building instantly
      EXPLODES in a white nova blast of fire.
      
      INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
      
      The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window.
      Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out.
      
      One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out
      toward the observatory.
                                                                10.
      
      
      
      All we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and
      smoke.
      
                          PLATO
                I don't think even he could have
                survived that.
      
      Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Whoa! Is it me or did you just
                finally destroy Uberman?
      
                           MASTER MIND
                    (carefully skeptical)
                Well...let's not get ahead of
                ourselves.
      
      Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside.
      
                          DA VINCI
                Look, there's something in the sky,
                coming this way.
      
                           ROXANNE
                Uberman!
      
      Master Mind turns toward the window.
      
      An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it
      closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A
      CAPPED FIGURE.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S
                GONNA RAM US!!!
      
      Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact.
      
      Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know
      what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with
      his hands.
      
      The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet.
      
      He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around
      its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman.
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                    (horrified)
                HOLY SHIT!
                                                              11.
      
      
      
      Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci's hold and runs over to the
      body.
      
                           ROXANNE
                Uberman?
      
      She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered
      black cape with the yellow "U" on it.
      
      Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded
      at the grotesque sight before him.
      
                          ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                You killed him!
      
      Roxanne's eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as
      she FAINTS.
      
      Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he's just
      walked on water.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                You did it!
      
      Now that he's committed the impossible - our villain is at a
      complete loss.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                ...so I did.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                I mean, I know you always wanted
                to. I mean, all the schemes all the
                plots - I never thought you'd
                actually be capable of it.
      
      Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow
      henchmen.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                This is history. Every villain and
                lackey in the history of villains
                and lackeys dream of this moment,
                but when does it actually EVER
                happen?
      
      A sudden realization comes over his face.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Good lord...You do all realize what
                we get to do now, don't you?
                                                                 12.
      
      
      
      His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind
      and the others.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                We get to go on a crime wave.
      
      CRIME WAVE MONTAGE - SET TO "Fun Fun Fun" by The Beach Boys.

      ARMORED TRUCK
      
      It's driving along when the men inside suddenly notice
      something - THEY'RE FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CITY STREETS.
      
      We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw
      at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER.
      
      Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh
      maniacally.
      
      SPINNING HEADLINE: "CHAMPION-LESS CITY AT THE MERCY OF

      METRO CITY BANK
      
      Da Vinci and Einstein run out the front of the bank holding
      BAGS OF MONEY.
      
      Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around
      the corner and into an alley.
      
      After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming
      and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after
      them.
      
      The robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like
      convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the
      driver's wheel.
      
      They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done.
      
      SPINNING HEADLINE: "MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!!"
      
      A VICIOUS TORNADO
      
      It's heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the
      lackeys coolly look on.
      
      Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with
      bricks of CASH.
                                                              13.
      
      
      
      The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in
      the three trucks.
      
      Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one
      when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward
      the tornado.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                    (absentmindedly)
                Oh, right.
      
      Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and
      aims it at approaching windstorm of death.
      
      He presses the button marked "Tornado Off."
      
      The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the
      city.
      
      As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the
      window with a hint of something in his eyes. Is it
      melancholy?
      
      END OF MONTAGE
      
      EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      It's Metro City's premier bowling alley. On top of the neon
      lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL.
      
      INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      HAL STEWART (early 30's) takes careful aim with his BOWLING
      BALL.
      
                          HAL
                It's a sport of honor, focus and
                grace. Honor the ball, focus on the
                pins, release the ball not hard and
                fast, but as if you were releasing
                a baby dove.
      
      He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball,
      following it with his eyes.
      
      It's a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL.
      
      An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth
      looks over at him.
      
                          HAL
                Okay, do something like that - but
                center it more.
                                                                14.
      
      
      
      She picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim.
      
                          ATTRACTIVE BLOND
                Tell me how my form looks, honey.
      
      Hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson
      administration era derriere.
      
                           HAL
                Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin'
                REAL good.
      
      It doesn't get anymore clear. This man is a pig.
      
                          VINNIE (O.S.)
                Hal, I want to see you in my
                office!
      
      Hal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling
      him.
      
                          VINNIE
                Now!
      
      INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
      
      Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who's sitting at his desk.
      
                          VINNIE
                You're fired. Leave your shirt and
                locker key.
      
      This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train.
      
                          HAL
                Fired? Are you going to tell me
                why?
      
                          VINNIE
                Showing up to work late. Showing up
                to work late drunk. Sexually
                harassing customers. Stealing from
                the register.
      
                          HAL
                Vinnie, I don't know where you're
                getting these accusations -
      
      Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts
      in a VCR.
                                                              15.
      
      
      
                              HAL
                   Oh, which one do you supposedly
                   have here?
      
                             VINNIE
                   This is all of them at once.
      
      TELEVISION
      
      A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair
      of shoes.
      
      As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and
      disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.
      
                             HAL
                   I've got this one, Benny. So,
                   Cinderella. Can I help you find
                   your glass slipper?
      
                             WOMAN
                   Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.
      
      He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a
      cat-like grin on his face.
      
                             HAL
                       (with a leer)
                   Seven - Well, maybe I could
                   interest you in something in an
                   EIGHT. Namely, me.
      
      Disgusted, she walks off screen.
      
                             HAL
                   Lesbo.
      
      Suddenly realizing the register's open, he quickly grabs a
      stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.
      
      BACK TO OFFICE
      
      Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond.
      
                             HAL
                   From the angle of the camera, I can
                   see where you might have gotten the
                   wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't
                   think you've thought this through.
                   If you fire me, who's gonna be
                   captain of the alley's bowling
                   team?
                                                                16.
      
      
      
                          VINNIE
                Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody
                who can actually bowl. You guys
                have never won a game. I hired you
                because you said you were on the
                pro circuit.
      
                          HAL
                No, I said I WILL BE on the pro
                circuit.
      
                          VINNIE
                Please, a loser like you will never
                amount to anything.
      
      This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned.
      
                          HAL
                Wow...If that's how you feel...I
                guess we should then talk about
                what kind of severance I'm gonna
                get.
      
      EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      TWO BRUISERS open the door and throw Hal out onto the street.
      
      He quickly picks himself up and turns back toward the
      building.
      
                          HAL
                Hey...what about my ball?
      
      A bowling ball sails past him, just missing his head.
      
                             HAL
                Thank-you!
      
      EXT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - DAY
      
      The massive building with a giant 7 on the roof stands in the
      heart of Metro City.
      
      INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY
      
      The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle
      of a busy news day.
      
      Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are
      SHOUTING.
      
      The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.
                                                              17.
      
      
      
      Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.
      
      Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room
      to see every eye on her.
      
                          ROXANNE
                It's...um...It's good to be back.
                Thanks for everyone's cards and
                concerns. I really appreciated it -
                now I'm ready to climb back on the
                horse.
      
      No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting
      to make her uncomfortable.
      
      The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK
      BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.
      
      Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad
      expressions on everybody's face.
      
                          FRANK
                Someone die or something?
      
      He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in
      his mouth.
      
                           FRANK
                    (cursing himself)
                Oh, Jesus.
      
                             ROXANNE
                It's okay.
      
      Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the
      arm.
      
                          FRANK
                Come on into my office, sweetie.
      
      INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
      
      He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns
      toward his door.
      
                          FRANK
                Can we get this woman some water
                for God's sake?
                    (to Rebecca)
                I gave you two months off. What're
                you doing back? People are gonna
                think I'm a slave driver.
                                                              18.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                Aren't you?
      
                          FRANK
                Yeah, but I don't want people to
                think it.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Frank, listen. I want to go back to
                work. I NEED to go back to work.
      
                          FRANK
                ...You're hysterical, aren't you?
      
      Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM
      EMBRACE.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What're you doing?
      
                          FRANK
                Keeping you warm before you go into
                shock.
                    (toward the open door)
                DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP
                TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND
                HERE?
      
      A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it
      on the table in front of them and leaves.
      
      Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to
      face him.
      
                          ROXANNE
                It was a traumatic experience. Yes,
                everyone knows Uberman and me
                were...close. But what I really
                need - what would really make me
                better is getting back to work.
      
      There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank.
      
                          FRANK
                Well, that's going to be...
      
                          ROXANNE
                I thought you'd be happy to have me
                back.
                                            19.
      
      
      
                FRANK
      Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us
      happier than to have our girl back,
      but...
      
                 ROXANNE
      Yes?
      
                FRANK
      Things have sorta...changed.
      
                ROXANNE
      In three weeks?
      
                FRANK
      Listen, I'm not one who likes to
      open up wounds - especially ones
      that are just starting to scab, but
      you were sorta our go to girl for
      the exclusive on Uberman. And now
      that he's gone...I moved Brad into
      your anchor spot.
      
                ROXANNE
          (disgusted)
      Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an
      idiot.
      
                FRANK
      It's the suits. They think it's
      time to switch things up.
      
                ROXANNE
      Oh, because they can't use me to
      get the big story.
      
                FRANK
      C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the
      nature of what we do. They used
      you, you used Uberman. Everybody's
      happy.
      
                ROXANNE
          (defensive)
      I didn't use him.
      
                FRANK
      Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you
      two were in love or something. My
      bad.
      
                 ROXANNE
      We were.
                                                                 20.
      
      
      
                          FRANK
                And that's great.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Very in love.
      
      There's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if
      she's failed to convince even herself of this.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Okay. So, where are they going to
                move me if Brad has my spot?
      
                          FRANK
                ...Human interest.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Bake sales and pet stories.
      
                          FRANK
                I told them I wouldn't be surprised
                if you just upped and quit. You
                busted your ass for that desk.
      
      Roxanne can hardly get it out - she's busy swallowing her
      pride
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'll take it.
      
      Frank looks up at her, not believing what he's hearing.
      
                          FRANK
                What?
      
      EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT
      
      Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands
      out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century
      Gothic architecture.
      
      LIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding
      a cracked plaque, reading: METRO CITY LIBRARY.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT
      
      A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and
      dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely
      futuristic machinery.
      
      The building has been converted into Master Mind's new SECRET
      LAIR.
                                                              21.
      
      
      
      In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING
      BLUE ORB. At the base of it is a sign that reads "Reactor -
      Don't Touch."
      
      We PAN OVER to the READING ROOM where Master Mind is sitting
      on a couch watching TELEVISION.
      
                          REPORTER ON TELEVISION (O.S.)
                It's been nearly six weeks, and
                still no word on the whereabouts of
                billionaire playboy, and
                philanthropist, Wayne Scott. Tune
                in at 11:00 as we look into what
                has become Metro City's biggest
                mystery.
      
                          TELEVISION NARRATOR (O.S.)
                We now return to "The Hero of our
                Hearts: The Uberman story."
      
      Einstein and Plato come into the room holding a BAG OF LOOT.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Just robbed the diamond exchange.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (feigning pleasure)
                Great, great. Put it on the pile.
      
      Einstein tosses it on a LARGE PILE of purloined valuables in
      the corner of the room.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Anything else today?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                No.
      
      Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato
      sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out
      of it.
      
                          PLATO
                    (cheerfully)
                Sir, the new reactor is installed.
      
      Plato nods to the giant orb.
      
                          PLATO
                Do you want to throw the switch? I
                know how you love to start
                reactors.
                                                                 22.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Maybe later.
      
      Einstein gives Master Mind a funny look then exchanges
      glances with Plato before leaving the two of them alone.
      
      Without turning away from the TV, Master Mind addresses
      Plato.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                What is it, Plato?
      
                          PLATO
                    (nervously)
                Sir, I can't help but notice that
                you've been...a little down lately.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                When I want your opinion I'll beat
                it out of you.
      
                          PLATO
                Yes, sir, I know, but please
                forgive my impertinence. It's just
                that you seem to have lost your
                lust for our profession. You've
                stopped going on jobs and spend
                most of your time watching Uberman
                specials.
      
      Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in
      a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic
      beat...
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I have defeated my greatest enemy.
                I have free reign over Metro City.
                I have more wealth than a thousand
                Sultans. I've achieved all I have
                worked for...so why am I so
                unhappy?
      
      He walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly
      like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND'S
      FATHER.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I mean, my father, god rest his
                evil and tormented soul, raised me
                straight from the test tube to be a
                symbol of evil.
                          (MORE)
                                                              23.
                          MASTER MIND(cont'd)
                And, I have accomplished something
                he had only dreamed about - the
                destruction of Metro City's
                champion. I tell you, I've always
                lived with this unquenchable
                thirst. I thought it was to make
                him proud or to get absolute power.
                But now that I've pretty much
                accomplished both, I am at a loss.
      
                          PLATO
                ...I sort of have a theory about
                all that.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (snippy)
                Oh, really?
      
                          PLATO
                Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman
                was more important to you than you
                thought.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I
                wonder, did he consider me his evil
                equal or was I just an annoying,
                little gnat to him? ...What's the
                second part?
      
                          PLATO
                I think you sort of have a thing
                for Roxanne Ritchi.
      
      Master Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD
                YOU GET SUCH A NOTION?
      
                          PLATO
                Sir, your plans always involve Ms.
                Ritchi either being kidnapped or
                placed in danger. If that's not
                love, I don't know what is. It's
                the grown up equivalent of dipping
                her pigtails in the ink well. Don't
                you see? She's the one treasure
                that's always escaped you.
      
      From Master Mind's expression, we see Plato's words beginning
      to ring true.
                                                                 24.
      
      
      
      INT. RESTURAUNT - DAY
      
      Roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting
      around her, gabbing.
      
                          FRIEND #1
                I can't believe you came back so
                soon.
      
                          FRIEND #2
                Are you sure it's not TOO SOON,
                honey?
      
                          ROXANNE
                I just wanted to get back to work.
      
                          FRIEND #3
                What we need to do is get you back
                on the saddle...the love saddle.
      
      Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks.
      
                          FRIEND #3
                It's been three weeks.
      
                          FRIEND #2
                She just lost the love of her life,
                Grace.
      
      A WAITER comes by with a tray of CAESAR SALADS and begins
      setting them out for the ladies.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I keep trying to tell people it
                wasn't really like that. Uberman
                and I - We were kinda having
                problems. We broke up.
      
      The waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too
      shocked by Roxanne's revelation to notice.
      
                          FRIEND #1
                You broke up with Uberman!
      
                          FRIEND #3
                You must have REALLY, REALLY high
                standards. I mean, you were dating
                a god. I mean, what's it take?
      
                          ROXANNE
                Maybe someone who's a little more
                aware of his faults. Someone a
                little more sensitive.
                                                                 25.
      
      
      
                          FRIEND #3
                Right. Someone who listens, sexy
                but attainable with cute little
                cheeks like a hamster and
                heartbreak in his eyes.
      
      She turns to Friend one and two to explain.
      
                          FRIEND #3
                She wants John Cusack.
      
                             FRIEND #2
                The actor?
      
                          FRIEND #3
                No, the famous pediatrist - Yes,
                the actor. Ever since we were
                teenagers, Roxanne's totally had
                the hots for him.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Well, until he miraculously comes
                walking into my life, I'm just
                going to take a little reflection
                time for myself.
      
      The waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away
      as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away.
      
      EXT. RESTURAUNT - DAY
      
      The waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his
      sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS
      WRIST.
      
      His image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then
      disappears - revealing the man's true form underneath: MASTER
      MIND!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Who the hell is John Cusack?
      
      EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
      
      A YOUNG MOTHER pushes her baby stroller past a building
      construction site.
      
      ACROSS THE STREET
      
      A local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the
      sidewalk, including Roxanne.
                                                                 26.
      
      
      
                          POLITICIAN
                The Fifth Avenue Renovation
                Project, which I championed, will
                breath new life into the downtown
                area. New life means new jobs and
                new revenue.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Councilman, is it true that your
                brother-in-law's construction
                company won the contract for this
                project?
      
                          POLITICIAN
                Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not
                here to answer a lot of crazy
                questions...
      
      YOUNG MOTHER
      
      The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into
      the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby.
      
      Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to
      an upper floor.
      
      Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction.
      
      CRANE
      
      The crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look
      on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to
      fix the problem.
      
      Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie
      his shoe.
      
      CRANE
      
      The operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED
      BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL.
      
      HAL AND THE WOMAN
      
      The woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing
      her and her baby. She screams.
      
      Hal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the
      way and crashes into the woman and stroller.
      
      ACROSS THE STREET
                                                                 27.
      
      
      
      The reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on
      film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just
      as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND.
      
      HAL AND MOTHER
      
      Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and
      kisses it.
      
      Hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him.
      
                          YOUNG MOTHER
                Thank you! Thank you for saving me
                and my baby!
      
      She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy.
      
                             HAL
                       (not knowing what she's
                        talking about)
                Huh?
      
      He's a little uncomfortable with the woman's public display
      of affection and the small child in-between their embrace.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                There, there.
      
      Hal slowly eases out of the woman's grip.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Okay, we better...well, I hear
                these little guys smother easy.
      
      The reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What's it feel like to be a hero?
      
      Hal looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, he's captivated by her
      beauty.
      
                          HAL
                Well...I'm just a man doing what
                men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi,
                aren't you?
      
      They're suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his
      way in between them.
      
                          REPORTER
                Were you scared?
                                                              28.
      
      
      
                             HAL
                   Scared? Who had time?
      
      The reporters eat this up.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT
      
      TELEVISION
      
      John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a
      two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and "In Your Eyes" by
      Peter Gabriel begins to play.
      
      From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   John Cusack, huh? So all I have to
                   do is have a cute puppy dog stare,
                   be willing to make a fool of myself
                   and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.
      
      He turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear
      from his cheek.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   Please, get a hold of yourself.
      
      INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
      
      Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as
      she peruses the isles. She sets it down on a shelf to pull a
      book out and ends up KNOCKING THE DRINK OVER.
      
                             ROXANNE
                   Shit.
      
      She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it
      up for her.
      
      Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned
      speechless - It's popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN
      CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him.
      
                             "JOHN CUSACK"
                   Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.
      
                             ROXANNE
                       (stunned)
                   You're...you're.
      
                             "JOHN CUSACK"
                   Yes, it's me. John Cusack...the
                   actor.
                                                               29.
      
      
      
      He notices the book she's reading.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think
                remember something from that one -
                Let's see: "My head is screaming `I
                want you and need you' - my heart
                it keeps reaching to see you and
                feel you - yet in the end, I'm
                alone once again." Wow, I scare
                even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just
                really into poetry. Probably
                because I'm so sensitive and always
                going to great lengths to express
                myself. But enough about me. Can I
                fill you up?
      
                          ROXANNE
                    (captivated)
                ...Yes.
                    (catching herself)
                I mean, excuse me?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Can I fill you up? Your coffee.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Right.
      
      INT. BOOKSTORE CAFE' - LATER
      
      Roxanne talks as John Cusack listens to her every word
      intently.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I did have a boyfriend - until
                fairly recently.
      
      She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers-
      by being to notice who she's with.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'm sorry - this is so surreal!
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Yeah, they charge way too much at
                these places - Now back to your
                boyfriend. I'm interested and
                compassionate. I want to know about
                you.
                                                              30.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                Things were complicated. He was a
                man married to his work. There
                was...there was a lot of
                competition in his line of
                business. I'm sure you know what
                that's like.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Sure. In my business, one thing I
                have is RIVALS. For example, mine
                is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno.
      
                          ROXANNE
                ...The body-builder who used to
                play The Hulk on TV?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Did he? Well, we're always up for
                the same roles. Did your boyfriend
                have someone like that? A
                particular rival that was always
                getting his goat - so to speak?
      
                          ROXANNE
                Well...one rival in particular
                seemed to get more of his attention
                than I ever did. But enough about
                my problems.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                NO, TELL ME MORE!!!
      
      Suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins COUGHING to mask
      it.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK" (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry. I got a whooping cough.
                Had it ever since Serendipity. I
                WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!!
                (fakes cough) See, there it goes
                again. Please, go on.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Right, well, he seemed to need him
                more than he needed me.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                How do you mean?
                                                               31.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                It was conflict he thrived on. He
                always said he wouldn't know what
                to do with himself if Master - I
                mean, this guy were gone. It was
                like he needed it, like oxygen.
      
      The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of
      lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                    (almost to himself)
                I think I finally understand...The
                only logical answer is to recreate
                that rivalry - or if that's
                impossible, create one of equal
                structure. That's it!
      
                          ROXANNE
                What?
      
      John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she's
      heard every word.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing
                for a part...where I play a man who
                talks to himself at inappropriate
                times.
      
      In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                I have to go right now, but I'd
                really like to see you again - if
                that's alright.
      
      Roxanne looks up at him - She can't help but laugh at the
      craziness of the situation.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'd love that.

      Master storms in the office to find Plato and Einstein
      playing darts with the original Mona Lisa.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Got her nose!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I've got it!
                                                                 32.
      
      
      
      Everyone stops what they're doing upon seeing that their
      master has returned.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I've got it!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                It's plain and simple.
                Extraordinary minds need
                extraordinary stimulation. Without
                that stimulus they wither and die.
                Therefore, there is only one
                logical conclusion: I must create a
                new superhero.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Yeah, maybe that's not such hot
                idea...

      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY
      
      The lab is slick, white and ultra modern.
      
      Dressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING
      GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Prepare the subject.
      
      He glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked
      thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a
      huge vat dangles precariously.
      
      Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and
      Einstein.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Plato, pour the toxic waste.
      
      Plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of
      gallons of green and brown goo into the hole.
      
                            MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Drainage.
      
      The slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo-
      soaked Severs.
                                                                33.
      
      
      
      Master Mind looks into the pit.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Well, Severs?
      
                          SEVERS
                I feel fine. Just a little sticky,
                but aside from that everything's
                completely -
      
      BOOM - Severs explodes. A hail of blood and tissue covers
      Master Mind and his men. For a good ten seconds nobody moves
      an inch. Finally...
      
                             MASTER MIND
                Okay then.

      Through a glass WATER TANK we see a man breathing normally.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                And this one?
      
                          PLATO
                We attached gills to him. He can
                breath under water.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Ah. Does he have extraordinary
                strength?
      
                             PLATO
                Well...no.

                He just breathes under water, then.

      The next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass
      tube not much wider than himself.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Plato, the radioactive spider,
                please.
      
      Plato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto
      Stenwick's arm.
      
      Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him.
      
                          STENWICK
                Ow!
      
      He brushes the spider off.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Anything, Stenwick?
      
                          STENWICK
                    (shaken)
                No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this
                was about spiders. I have a pretty
                severe case of arachnophobia.
      
      Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                We're gonna need more venom.
      
      Plato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF
      SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he's
      engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids.

      Master Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in
      the background.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                This has proven to be a challenge.
                I just don't know what I want. What
                do I want?
                                                                35.
      
      
      
      He stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no
      advice.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                I want a man of moral fiber with a
                strong sense of right and wrong.
                Someone who doesn't seek power -
                instead, they must have it thrust
                upon them and find, within
                themselves, the courage to rise to
                the occasion.
      
      Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone's
      attention.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Yeah, well, it sounds like what you
                want is Uberman.
      
      Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                That's it! Why make a copy when the
                real thing will do?
      
      The lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what
      they're hearing.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                I was just kidding, sir. In case
                you forgot, you actually burned
                Uberman alive.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Then we'll make a new one. Plato,
                bring me the box!
      
      MINUTES LATER
      
      Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small
      table.
      
      Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center.
      
      As Master Mind opens it, he's immediately doused in WHITE
      GLOW emanating from inside.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Behold - Uberessence. The very
                thing that gave Uberman his
                superhuman powers.
                                                              36.

                Oh, I shot him with a power sucking
                gun and had this idea to use this
                to clone a whole army of evil
                Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never
                got around to following up with
                that.
      
                          PLATO
                I believe he defeated you before
                you could, master.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                ...Right. Man, he was good!
      
                          DA VINCI
                You want another volunteer, sir?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Not another volunteer driven by the
                need for personal gain. Somebody
                else, somebody pure.
      
      Master Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the
      muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with
      white lettering that reads: "Hal Stewart - Metro City's
      Newest Hero?"

                Please, please, you're embarrassing
                me. I saw someone in need and I
                helped them. What more can we ask
                of ourselves. I ask you, what more?
      
      A smile creeps across the evil one's face.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

                Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece

                love this -
      
      We follow Plato's line of sight across the street where we
      see HAL PLAYING WITH A LARGE GROUP OF BLIND CHILDREN.
      
                          PLATO
                - He volunteers at a school for the

                          MASTER MIND
                He volunteers. He doesn't ask for
                any reward for his deeds. The fates
                are shining down on me. This Mr.

                You greedy little bastard. I
                already gave you a twenty.
      
                          BLIND KID
                Hey, you want me to play along?
                Then pay up, bitch!

                          HAL
                Fine, but you better be convincing.
      
      He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his
      shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them.
      
                          HAL
                Here she comes, go to work.
      
      Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his
      hands and begins to cry.
      
                          BLIND KID
                    (weeping)
                Why can't I see! Why God?
      
      Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder.
      
                          HAL
                Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me
                look at you.
      
      The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance.
      
      The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark
      sunglasses - he should get an Oscar.
      
                          HAL
                You know, in life we're all given
                no more than we can bear. This
                happened to you maybe because you
                were meant to rise above it - Maybe
                to be an inspiration to the other
                little Peteys out there.
      
                          BLIND KID
                You really think so, Hal?
      
                          HAL
                Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying?
                Now c'mon, go feel your way to
                class before you get your little
                butt suspended.
      
      The boy stands up and is about to take off.
      
                          HAL
                Petey, wait a minute.
      
      Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the
      boy's face before sending him on his way.
                                                               39.
      
      
      
      The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to
      absolutely melt.
      
                          HAL
                Don't run into anything!
      
      EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
      
      Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should
      be next in line for popehood.
      
                          PLATO
                I think I've seen enough, sir. This
                is your guy.
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                    (over radio)
                Then return to base. We have much
                work to do.
      
      Plato starts up the van and pulls away.
      
      INT. BAR - DAY
      
      It's a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting
      pool as the bartender slings drinks.
      
      Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a
      very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him.
      
      As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly
      catches himself on the bar's TELEVISION - it's a story about
      how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site.
      
      He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back
      to the TV. A plan of attack is forming.
      
                          HAL
                    (obviously playing it up
                     for the woman's benefit)
                Oh, there it is again. This is
                really getting embarrassing now.
      
      The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take.
      
                          ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN
                Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man
                who saved that woman   and her baby
                the other day! It is   you, isn't it?
      
      TRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them,
      OVERHEARS.
                                                               40.
      
      
      
      Hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air.
      
                          HAL
                    (to Attractive Woman)
                Oh, crap. You got me.
      
      TRUCKER#1 taps Hal on the shoulder.
      
                          TRUCKER#1
                Let me tell you something. That was
                just about the bravest damn thing
                I've ever witnessed. (he turns to
                the rest of the bar) Hey,
                everybody! This guy's the hero from
                TV!
      
      The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS.
      
      MOMENTS LATER
      
      Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as
      `I'm Holding Out For A Hero' plays on the jukebox.
      
      TRUCKER#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room
      quickly goes silent.
      
                          TRUCKER#1
                I want to give you something.
      
      He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it
      up in the air for everyone to see.
      
                          TRUCKER#1 (CONT'D)
                Lost my whole platoon. They were a
                lot a good boys, a lot of good
                boys. That was just the way things
                were in "The Grenada." I'd rather a
                real hero have this.
      
      Trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal.
      
                          ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                Hey, you're on TV again.
      
      The crowd looks up at the Television.
      
      TELEVISION - CONTINUOUS
      
      The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40's, amazing mustache),
      suddenly has a memo passed to him.
                                                                 41.
      
      
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                This just in. Upon a second look at
                that tape from this morning, which
                we'll now replay for you, it
                appears it was not the heroic act
                it first seemed to be.
      
      The tape shows Hal running in slow motion.
      
                          BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                With the tape slowed down you can
                actually see the man push the woman
                and her child out of the way in an
                effort to save his own life.
      
      The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation,
      pushing the woman and child out of the way.
      
                                                CUT BACK TO:
      
      INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
      
      In unison, everyone turns their heads back to Hal.
      
                          HAL
                I guess that looks kinda bad.
      
      Trucker#1 snatches his medal back.
      
      EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal
      cutting through a dark alley.
      
                          DA VINCI
                There he is, boss.
      
      Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Now, we're sure this won't kill
                him?
      
                          PLATO
                Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight
                electrical shock.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Good.
      
      Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal.
                                                                42.
      
      
      
      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
      
      Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve.
      
      A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth
      spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and
      shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row
      of garbage cans.
      
      EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT
      
      An angry Master Mind slaps Plato.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Slight electrical shock?
      
      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
      
      Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering.
      
      Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky.
      
                          HAL
                God, I hate the weather in this
                city.
      
      Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the
      emitting smoke from his jacket.
      
      EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind turns to Da Vinci.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Follow him.
      
      INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
      
      It's a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes
      are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a
      minefield.
      
      Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights
      wobble and streak like a hallucination.
      
      He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks
      worse.
      
      Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a
      chair. The room begins to swim.
      
      His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him.
                                                                 43.
      
      
      
      From Hal's POV the cat's face looks like we're seeing it
      through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it.
      
                           CAT
                 You don't look so good, man.
      
                           HAL
                 I don't feel good. I was struck by
                 freaking lightening.
      
      Suddenly Hal realizes his cat's talking to him.
      
                           HAL (CONT'D)
                 AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?
      
                           CAT
                 No, you're just hallucinating. By
                 the way, we're out of orange juice.
      
                           HAL
                 AAAAAAHHHHH!
      
      Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself
      out on the coffee table.
      
      INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - MORNING
      
      Hal lies in the same position we left him last night.
      
      He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst
      hangover in the world.
      
      Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not
      really sure what he's looking for.
      
                           HAL
                 Man...
      
      Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the
      refrigerator.
      
      He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his
      mouth. It's empty.
      
      As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton
      to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself.
      
      He shakes the thought from his mind.
      
      BATHROOM
      
      Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.
                                                              44.
      
      
      
      HAL'S FACE
      
      He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The
      inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content
      look washes over his face.
      
      There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and
      SPLINTERING.
      
      The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM
      SMASHING THE TOILET.
      
                              HAL (CONT'D)
                   Oh, God!
      
      He whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL.
      
                              HAL (CONT'D)
                   Oh, God!
      
      He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it
      destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom
      mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window.
      
                              HAL (CONT'D)
                   Oh, God!
      
      He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now,
      to see the floor give way.
      
      Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole.
      
      He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast
      table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the
      smashed toilet on his pancakes.
      
      EXT. STREET - DAY
      
      Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the
      stop.
      
                              HAL
                   Wait!
      
      He starts running after it.
      
      ZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING.
      
                             HAL (CONT'D)
                   Whoa, whoa, whoa!
      
      Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls
      back to the ground.
                                                                 45.
      
      
      
      As the bus continues on he sees an INDENTATION of his torso
      right below the rear window.
      
      Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Something's not right here.
      
      He slaps himself in the face as hard as he can.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Wake up! Wake up, Hal!
      
      HONK!
      
      Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him.
      
      He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES
      UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the
      sidewalk.
      
      Hal sits up, disheveled and scared.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Okay, okay. Let's get it together,
                man.
      
      He closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                This is just some sort
                of...episode. It will pass, it will
                pass.
      
      He opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL
      NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Well, not too fast I hope.
      
      As she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he
      catches ANOTHER NAKED WOMAN - an old disgusting one.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                Yes, fast, fast!
      
      He turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK
      OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business.
      
      He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone
      has returned to a clothed state.
                                                              46.
      
      
      
      He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's
      floating a foot off the ground.
      
                          HAL (CONT'D)
                I think I need to go home.
      
      INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
      
      Hal's front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master
      Mind.
      
      He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he
      notices the giant hole in the floor.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Welcome to your second birth, Hal
                Stewart.
      
      Master Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look
      over a "KARATE KID" POSTER on Hal's living room wall.
      
      He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a
      young Ralph Macchio to kick.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Instruction is very important in
                the formative years. Every hero
                needs a mentor, a father figure to
                look up to.
      
      He presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO
      THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA.
      
                           "PAT MORITA"
                Perfect.
      
      INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
      
      Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge
      and takes a long pull from it.
      
                          VOICE (O.S.)
                A man will usually find that if he
                drinks from a bottle, eventually,
                the bottle drinks from him.
      
      Hal does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands.
      
                          HAL
                Who are you!?
                                                                47.
      
      
      
                          VOICE
                I am the guide on your journey.
                Fate has chosen you to be it's
                champion.
      
      Pat Morita steps out from the shadows.
      
      Hal passes out again.
      
      LATER
      
      We are close on Hal's face as his eyes flutter open. He
      appears to be lying on the couch.
      
      He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is
      as it seems.
      
      He lays his head back down.
      
                          HAL
                Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I
                must be losing it.
      
      A voice sounds right next to his ear.
      
                          "PAT MORITA" (O.S.)
                You know you're out of orange
                juice?
      
      Hal leaps up to find he's been resting his head on Pat's lap.
      
                          HAL
                Jesus! This isn't happening, this
                isn't happening.
      
      Hal backs away and trips over a box.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Calm. All things must be filtered
                through calmness.
      
                           HAL
                Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to
                freak out.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                I think we must work on your
                attitude first.
      
                          HAL
                Look I'm gonna call the cops in
                about two seconds if you don't get
                out of here.
                                                              48.
      
      
      
      Pat rises and walks to Hal. He's so calm it makes Hal calm.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Are you calm now?
      
                          HAL
                Yeah, I'm okay.
      
      Pat slaps him across the face hard.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Good, because we've got a lot of
                work to do.
      
      Hal grabs his jaw.
      
                          HAL
                What the hell was that for?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Rule number one: expect the
                unexpected.
      
                           HAL
                Can you just tell me what this is
                all about?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                The heavens are not in the habit of
                bestowing a gift such as this to
                just anyone. You are being rewarded
                for being a man of great moral
                fortitude with an unwavering belief
                in humanity.
      
                          HAL
                That's me alright.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                I am to train you so you may
                fulfill your destiny to defeat the
                great menace to Metro City: Master
                Mind.
      
      Pat gets up and walks toward the door.
      
                           "PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)
                Come.
      
                          HAL
                We're are we going?
                                                              49.
      
      
      
                             "PAT MORITA"
                To train.
      
      EXT. PAT'S CAR - DAY
      
      Pat is sitting in the driver's seat. The car is bumping up
      and down.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Strength is just as much in the
                mind as it is the muscle. Remember,
                both need to be exercised.
      
      We PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head.
      He's hardly straining.
      
                          HAL
                I'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!!
      
      Pat leans on the HORN.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Hey, Corky? You listening?
      
      Two highly attractive female joggers run by. They're clearly
      impressed with Hal's show of strength. He smiles and mouths a
      "hello."
      
                          HAL
                Yeah, work both muscles.
      
      EXT. DESERT - DAY
      
      Pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up
      and carefully takes aim...at Hal's chest.
      
                             "PAT MORITA"
                Trust me.
      
                          HAL
                What are you doing!?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                An invulnerability test. Something
                wrong?
      
                          HAL
                Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to
                get shot. Do not fire that thing!
      
      Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun.
                                                               50.
      
      
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                You're bulletproof.
      
                          HAL
                Okay, do you know that for sure?
      
      Pat quickly aims and fires.
      
      Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets
      off his chest.
      
                            "PAT MORITA"
                I do now.
      
      Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch.
      
                            HAL
                You suck.
      
      EXT. SKY - DAY
      
      Hal is in the air flying in a sitting position. He's weaving
      back and forth.
      
                          HAL
                Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.
                Two Russian Migs coming in hard and
                fast.
      
                            "PAT MORITA"
                Hey!
      
                            HAL
                What?
      
      Hal looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof
      of a building down below.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                What did I tell you? Stomach down,
                hands up.
      
      Hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight
      position.
      
                          HAL
                God, I feel so gay.
      
      Pat's CELL PHONE begins to RING. He answers it.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                    (in Master Mind voice)
                What is it?
                                                              51.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE (V.O.)
                John?
      
      Pat panics. He looks up to make sure no one is in earshot.
      
      He sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air.
      
                          HAL
                YEEEE HAWWWW!
      
      Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his
      John Cusack voice.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                    (in Cusack voice)
                Yes, it's John Cusack.
      
                           ROXANNE (V.O.)
                Hi, it's Roxanne. Listen, I...I
                really enjoyed talking with you the
                other day.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                ...As did I.
      
                          ROXANNE (V.O.)
                Great. God, I feel really silly,
                and if you have a lot going on I
                totally understand. But, I was
                wondering if you maybe wanted to
                have lunch.
      
      He can't believe what he's hearing.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                    (excited)
                I'd love to!
      
      He quickly recovers his composure.
      
                          "PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)
                I mean, I AM a little hungry.
      
                          ROXANNE (V.O.)
                Great. How does the park sound,
                around noon-ish?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Sure!
      
                          ROXANNE (V.O.)
                Great, see you then.
                                                              52.
      
      
      
      Pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as Hal
      lands behind him.
      
                          HAL
                WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It's
                like fly - Oh my God, I almost said
                it was like flying.
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                For the rest of the day I want you
                to continue to practice your flying
                posture.
      
                          HAL
                Why, where're ya going?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                ...To do something...mysterious
                ...and Asian.
      
                          HAL
                Say no more, bro. I'll just keep at
                it, then.
      
      EXT. PARK - DAY
      
      John Cusack and Roxanne eat WRAPPED SANDWICHES while walking
      through Metro City Park.
      
                          ROXANNE
                How's your sandwich?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                It's quite delicious.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Hope you don't think I'm too
                forward. Some men are intimidated
                when a woman asks them out. I just
                find you really easy to talk to.
      
                             "JOHN CUSACK"
                And I you.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You know, you're not at all like
                you are in the movies.
      
                             "JOHN CUSACK"
                I'm not?
                                                              53.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                Yeah. I don't know - You have this
                strange, refined way of speaking.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                I do? That is most interesting.
      
                           ROXANNE
                Anyway, when we were talking the
                other day I just felt, even though
                we only talked for a couple of
                hours, that we've known each other
                for years.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                I know just what you mean.
      
      Roxanne bites into her sandwich.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You know what? This sandwich is
                disgusting.
      
      She tosses it in a nearby garbage can.
      
                           ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                Of course I already ate half of it.
                I wonder what that says about my
                character?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                It means you don't give up on a
                sandwich. You see that it has
                potential, and you give it every
                chance to be all it can be.
      
      Roxanne smiles at his analogy.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Thanks, but knowing me, I was
                probably projecting my expectations
                of what a lunch should be on the
                sandwich. It might have been okay
                at first, but I just made it
                bitter.
      
      John Cusack notices Roxanne's smile starting to fade.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Is that what happened with your
                last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?
                                                              54.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                When I look back, I probably
                shouldn't of expected so much from
                him. He was already a giving
                person. You know, one of those go
                out and save the world types.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                I've run into a few.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I was selfish, I guess. I didn't
                want to share him with anybody
                else.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                It sounds like he was a special
                man.
      
                          ROXANNE
                They broke the mold.
      
      John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Perhaps not.
      
      INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY
      
      Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask
      and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It's not
      unlike Uberman's except for a giant "T" on his chest. (From
      here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN)
      
                          TITAN
                What's the "T" stand for?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Titan.
      
                          TITAN
                What's that supposed to mean?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's
                father...oh, just go with it. You
                look perfect.
      
                          TITAN
                I don't think this mask is big
                enough. Are you sure no one is
                gonna recognize me?
                                                               55.
      
      
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                It's fine, just don't slouch. It's
                all in the posture.
      
      He grabs Titan's shoulders like a proud papa.
      
                          "PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)
                It is time.
      
      INT. BANK - DAY
      
      There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet
      ropes. They're all waiting for their chance at the one open
      teller window.
      
      Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and
      CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank.
      
      John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an
      immediate panic.
      
                          JOHN
                Alright folks, this is a robbery.
                Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,
                yadda...
      
      Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills
      into a bag.
      
      As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner
      office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGER'S head.
      
                          GEORGE
                The safe. Let's go.
      
                          BANK MANAGER
                Okay, just don't hurt anyone.
      
                          GEORGE
                Yeah, yeah, yeah.
      
      George leads him out by the collar.
      
      CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold
      superhero stance with hands on hips.
      
                          TITAN
                Well, boys, there's no need for all
                this just to get the free toaster.
      
      Paul cocks his gun.
                                                                 56.
      
      
      
                          PAUL
                What are you suppose to be?
      
      We move in for a nice dramatic close up.
      
                            TITAN
                Justice.
      
                          GEORGE
                Well, justice, suck on this...
      
      George, John and Paul open fire on Titan.
      
      He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him.
      
      With their guns empty the three just stare at him in
      amazement.
      
                          TITAN
                Now it's my turn.
      
      He turns to George.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Hey, George, here comes the sun.
      
      Titan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light
      fixture in the ceiling.
      
      Paul tries to run for the door. Titan snatches the collar of
      his jacket.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Say, Paul, your mother should
                know...that you're a scumbag.
      
      He tosses Paul out the window and into a parked DELIVERY
      TRUCK.
      
      Titan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his
      shotgun. It instantly breaks apart in his hands.
      
      Titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                John, all you need is love...
      
      He throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - GROIN
      FIRST.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                ...and a good urologist.
                                                              57.
      
      
      
      Titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo
      cowering on the floor.
      
      He grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up.
      
                          HAL
                Well, Ringo...um...um...you're
                under arrest.
      
      EXT. BANK - DAY
      
      Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his
      arm. He's suddenly swarmed by a group of television
      reporters, including Roxanne.
      
      Across the street is Pat Morita. He watches Titan's first
      news conference with great anxiety.
      
                          BANK MANAGER
                    (to Hal)
                On behalf of the First National
                Bank of Metro City, I'd like to
                offer you a reward for your act of
                bravery.
      
      He hands Titan a check.
      
                          TITAN
                    (reading)
                Ten thousand dollars!
      
      Titan looks over to Pat, who violently shakes his head no.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                    (unenthusiastically)
                I...can't except this. Law and
                order is it's own...um...reward.
      
      Pat gives him the thumbs up. Pat turns, suddenly seeing
      Roxanne with her camera crew. Captivated, his eyes lock on
      her.
      
      Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering
      around the crowd to get closer to Titan.
      
                          BRAD HELMS (O.S.)
                Not so fast, Roxanne.
      
      They both turn to see Roxanne's reporter rival Brad Helms,
      Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman, FRANK.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                This story's mine.
                                                                 58.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                Listen, Brad. We were just in the
                area. I was just trying to -
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                I've been in this business long
                enough to know pretty well what you
                were "just trying to do." Besides,
                I heard you couldn't take the big
                game anymore and were put on fluff
                detail?
      
      Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the
      camera off.
      
                          SETH
                You're not gonna take that from
                him, are you?
      
                          ROXANNE
                He's right. Old habit, I guess.
                    (to Brad)
                We'll get out of your way.
      
      As they walk off, Brad makes a comment to Frank loud enough
      for her to hear.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                Besides, I'm sure there's a pancake
                supper somewhere that needs
                covering.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY
      
      ON TELEVISION
      
      We see the news conference on the bank's steps. In the corner
      of the screen is written: "recorded earlier."
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                For months now, since the death of
                Uberman, the citizens of Metro City
                have been holding out for a hero.
                Well, it appears they won't have to
                hold out for much longer as a new
                costumed crusader has suddenly
                stormed onto the scene. Today, at
                the Metro Savings and Trust, a
                masked mystery man single-handedly
                defeated "The Fab Four Gang." Just
                who is this new caped avenger?
      
      Brad holds the microphone to Titan's face.
                                                               59.
      
      
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                I'm sure all of our viewers are now
                wondering, what's the "T" stand
                for?
      
                          TITAN
                It's a message to all the scum out
                there. Uberman may be gone, but
                Metro City has a new protector, and
                his name is "Tighten!"
      
      Another reporter leans in.
      
                          REPORTER
                How do you spell that?
      
      We PULL BACK to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this
      spectacle. Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a
      NEWSPAPER.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (reading paper)
                Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't
                believe it. He misspelled his name.
      
      Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads
      "Metro's New Hero: Tighten."
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                No matter, I suppose.
      
      Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace
      around the room with his arms folded behind his back.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                We've now fully established Titan
                as Metro City's hero. They will
                love him just as they loved
                Uberman. Everything is going
                according to plan.
      
      Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato's ear.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                    (whispering)
                Yeah, if the plan is getting us in
                jail.
      
      Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over,
      standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen.
                                                              60.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You know, Einstein, maybe I should
                have called you Socrates. He also
                didn't know when to keep his
                thoughts to himself.
      
                           EINSTEIN
                I just fail to see the point in all
                of this. I mean, why are we
                creating another superhero when it
                was such a pain in the ass for you
                to get rid of the other one? I
                mean, Uberman is destroyed, we
                should be using this opportunity
                to...to...
      
                            MASTER MIND
                To what?
      
                          EINSTEIN
                I don't know. To take over the
                weather, space, the world -
                whatever super villains are
                SUPPOSED to do.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                The reason someone like you will
                always be a minion is because you
                have no foresight. We take over the
                earth, like you said. Then what?
                Women? Cars? Money? Even the
                grandest treasures will lose their
                lustre if you don't have someone to
                hold them over.
      
      Einstein throws up his hands. He's had enough. He pulls off
      his wig and throws it to the floor.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                That's it! This balance of the
                force bullshit is getting way too
                Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's
                with me?
      
                            MASTER MIND
                You dare?
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing
                stupid costumes, and I'm sick of
                working for a super villain who's
                turning into a softie.
                                                              61.
      
      
      
      Plato and Da Vinci's mouths drop to the floor. They turn to
      Master Mind for his rebuttal.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What - did - you - call me?
      
                          EINSTEIN
                You heard me. You used to be an
                inhuman monster, now look at you.
                You're creating super heroes, you
                don't go with us on robberies
                anymore, it's been days since you
                threatened anyone, oh, and not to
                mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                THAT is none of your business,
                knave!
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Hey, you guys haven't sealed the
                deal yet, have you?
      
                           MASTER MIND
                Silence!
      
                          EINSTEIN
                    (In a woman's voice)
                Oh, Master, your head is so big.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I'm warning you, Einstein.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                    (In a woman's voice)
                Take me!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I said silence!
      
      With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the
      throat and lifts him into the air.
      
      Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of
      Master Mind's grip.
      
      Master Mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not
      into what he's about to do. He let's Einstein drop to the
      floor.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Get out of my sight.
                                                               62.
      
      
      
      EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
      
      Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a
      fancy restaurant.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Don't get me wrong, I love being a
                reporter. I don't think I could do
                anything else. It's the
                consequences of what we do that I'm
                having a problem with.
      
      He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                That's where journalistic
                responsibility comes in, no?
      
                          ROXANNE
                It's supposed to.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Sounds to me like you're running
                from something.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I got someone I cared about killed.
                If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't
                have been involved.
      
      John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing
      what she's talking about.
      
      He reaches across the table and takes her hand.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                You can't blame yourself. My father
                used to say each of us must answer
                the great call to truly feel alive.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Was he an actor?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                ...No. He was...a landscaper. And a
                horrible one. I mean he would fail
                time and time again at
                his...landscaping. And sometimes
                he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown
                in jail -
      
                          ROXANNE
                Jail?
                                                              63.
      
      
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                My point is he took the good with
                the bad. He grew a little each
                time. Improved, learned.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Was he ever successful?
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                God, no...but don't let deter you.
      
      Roxanne LAUGHS.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Thanks for this. You know, this is
                embarrassing, but it's been a long
                time since I -
      
      It's starting to lightly sprinkle. Roxanne looks up.
      
                          ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                I think it's starting to rain. We
                might want to find a table inside.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                What were you gonna say?
      
                          ROXANNE
                Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a
                long time since...well, I've been
                with someone I...enjoy being with.
      
      John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                To people who enjoy being with each
                other.
      
      They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John
      Cusack's disguise generator to short.
      
      His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne
      as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.
      
      Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Oh, no. Don't look at me.
      
      LIKE A BROKEN TV the image keeps switching between MASTER
      MIND AND JOHN CUSACK.
                                                              64.
      
      
      
      As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the
      Cusack disguise begins to hold steady.
      
      He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak.
      
                          "JOHN CUSACK"
                Okay, never mind that. Now, where
                were we?
      
      Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face,
      causing the generator to short out permanently.
      
      Master Mind now sits in his true blue form.
      
                             ROXANNE
                Oh my God.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You're not gonna get all freaky
                about this, are you?
      
                          ROXANNE
                This...this is too much, even for
                you. God, I go out with you, tell
                you my innermost thoughts.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I only did this because I wanted to
                talk to you on the same level. You
                know, without all the baggage?
      
                          ROXANNE
                Baggage? You burned my boyfriend
                alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You see, that's exactly what I'm
                talking about.
      
      Roxanne starts to walk away.
      
                             MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Roxanne!
      
                          ROXANNE
                Stay away from me.
      
      Master Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now
      heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food.
      
      Several resturaunt patron's are looking at him through the
      window.
                                                                 65.
      
      
      
      Our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What?
      
      INT. MASTER MIND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (mumbling to himself)
                Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,
                it's his fault. He's the one who
                sent me on this weak-willed path.
                I'll filet his scrotum for this.
                Me, a creature of evil, in love
                with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.
                I hardly give such matters thought
      
      He rolls onto his side. He yawns and closes his eyes.
      
      Suddenly, they shoot back open.
      
                                               CUT TO:
      
      EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street
      from Roxanne's apartment
      
      He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of
      her.
      
      Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment
      window's reflection.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I should just go up there and just
                lay it all out to her. "Roxanne, I
                like you - I always have. Oh, and
                I'm sorry I blew up your ex.
                (realizing the absurdity of his
                words) Yeah, that would go over
                like a pants-less clown at a
                child's birthday party. What the
                hell am I even doing here? Who
                cares what she thinks? I'm a
                supervillain and here I am acting
                like a love struck schoolboy.
                Forget this. I control my own
                destiny!
                                                                66.
      
      
      
      He turns the ignition key - NOTHING HAPPENS. He repeats but
      gets the same results.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                    (disgusted)
                Perfect.
      
      INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
      
      She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty.
      
                             ROXANNE
                Damn.
      
      She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe.
      
      EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING
      
      Roxanne steps outside.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Please be open.
      
      Across the street is a liquor store. The light is still on.
      
                             ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                Thank God.
      
      She walks across the street, passing in front of Master
      Mind's car.
      
      Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat.
      
      Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence.
      
      Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into
      the store.
      
      INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
      
      Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the
      counter.
      
                          ROXANNE
                A pack of Lady Strikes, please.
      
      EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind is talking on his cell phone.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Hello, Triple A?
                                                                 67.
      
      
      
      He suddenly spots something across the street.
      
      EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
      
      A HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out
      a gun from under his coat.
      
      EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind stares in shock.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I'll call you back.
      
      He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the
      store.
      
      INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
      
      The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full
      of cash from the register.
      
                          SHOPKEEPER
                Hey!
      
                          SHOTGUN HOODLUM
                Shut up, Gramps.
      
      He turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her
      neck.
      
                          SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT'D)
                Gimme that necklace!
      
                          ROXANNE
                I don't think so.
      
      The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun.
      
                          SHOTGUN HOODLUM
                I said give it to me!
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                The lady said no.
      
      The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway
      holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs
      and blinking lights.
      
      The hoodlum starts to laugh.
                                                              68.
      
      
      
                          SHOTGUN HOODLUM
                What the hell's that? A super
                soaker?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                No, it's a goo gun.
      
      The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind.
      
                          SHOTGUN HOODLUM
                Yeah, what's it do?
      
                           MASTER MIND
                It goos.
      
      Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store
      in a cloud of SMOKE.
      
      The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL,
      covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK.
      
      Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                It's...a prototype.
      
      Master Mind starts to walk out when he's suddenly confronted
      by the shopkeeper.
      
                          SHOPKEEPER
                I know you! You Master Brain guy.
                You a hero.
      
      Master Mind points the goo gun at him.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Don't - EVER - say that again.
      
      EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder
      like he's a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly
      behind him.
      
                           ROXANNE
                Hey!
      
      Master Mind turns around.
      
                          ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                Are you following me or something?
                                                               69.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Don't flatter yourself.
      
      He turns away and continues walking. Roxanne runs in front of
      him blocking his way.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Don't walk away from me when I'm
                talking to you.
      
      Finally it occurs to her what's going on.
      
                          ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                What a minute...all that stuff you
                use to say to me when Uberman was
                alive - about me being the loyal
                queen by your side as you rule over
                Metro City. That wasn't just super
                villain rhetoric, was it? You
                actually meant it!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                My, someone has a rather high
                opinion of themselves.
      
      They stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in
      conflict.
      
                          ROXANNE
                    (coldly)
                Do you really think I would be with
                someone like you?
      
      This stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief
      contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful
      conclusion.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                No.
      
      With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne
      with a baffled expression on her face.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind enters in a huff. Da Vinci closes the door behind
      him as Plato notices his master's agitated state.
      
                          PLATO
                Everything alright, sir?
      
      Master Mind GRABS PLATO BY THE GROIN with his metal gauntlet
      causing Plato's eyes to bulge in pain.
                                                              70.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (overly calm)
                Fine, why do you ask?
      
                          PLATO
                You...just...seem...
      
      Master Mind tightens his grip.
      
                            MASTER MIND
                Go on.
      
                          PLATO
                ...distracted.
      
      Master Mind releases him.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Just with business, my minion. Just
                with business. I've decided it is
                time.
      
                            PLATO
                You mean?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Yes, we've created our hero, now
                it's time to give him a little
                motivation.
      
                          DA VINCI
                How do we do that?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                To be simply good is not enough. A
                hero must be driven by an almost
                relentless desire to right a wrong
                that can never be corrected.
      
                            PLATO
                You mean?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Yes, he must lose someone near and
                dear to him - his father figure.
                Gentlemen, it's time for Operation
                Mentor Kill!
      
      EXT. SKY OVER METRO CITY - DAY
      
      Titan flies high over and through the city, under bridges,
      between buildings, etc. He's not really working, just
      enjoying himself.
                                                                 71.
      
      
      
      INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
      
      A PRETTY WOMAN sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but
      her bra and panties. Through the reflection in her mirror we
      see a large window directly behind her.
      
      As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the
      background. After a moment he slowly slides back in view and
      begins ogling the girl.
      
      She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a
      robe.
      
      Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off.
      
      MOMENTS LATER
      
      Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN.
      Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run
      around in chaos.
      
                          TITAN
                Man, what the hell happened down
                there? Wait a sec -
      
      He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                THAT'S MY APARTMENT!!!
      
      EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
      
      Titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home.
      Reporters stand just beyond the police line.
      
                            TITAN
                Crap.
      
      From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita.
      
                            TITAN (CONT'D)
                PAT!
      
      Titan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms.
      
                            TITAN (CONT'D)
                You okay?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                I'm dying, kid. There is just one
                last lesson I have for you. It is
                the most important of all.
                                                                72.
      
      
      
                          TITAN
                What's that?
      
                           "PAT MORITA"
                Master Mind did this, you must
                avenge me.
      
                          TITAN
                Master Mind? Why?
      
                          "PAT MORITA"
                Because he's evil. You must stop
                the evil Hal - stop the...
      
      Pat's body goes limp.
      
      The cameras begin to pop and flash around them.
      
      Titan gently lays Pat's body down and stands respectfully
      over him. The reporters rush over.
      
                          REPORTER 1
                Tighten, Is this the work of Master
                Mind?
      
                          REPORTER 2
                How will the death of your mentor
                affect your resolve?
      
                          REPORTER 3
                Was that Pat Morita?
      
      Titan walks up to one of the cameras.
      
                          TITAN
                This injustice will not go
                unpunished. Master Mind, if you can
                hear me, Tighten is coming for you.
      
      In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS
      PARAMEDICS, load pat's body onto a stretcher.
      
      PLATO ACCIDENTALLY DROPS HIS SIDE. As he bends down to pick
      it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing
      dead.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal's
      revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy.
                                                              73.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Alright, people, we don't have much
                time. Titan should be here any
                minute, so let's get the lead out.
      
      There is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall
      being tinkered with by Da Vinci.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                How's the death ray coming?
      
                          DA VINCI
                Nearly up to full power, sir.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Hum. Let's turn it down a few
                notches. It's his first time and
                we don't want to get in a lucky
                shot, now do we?
      
      Plato enters the room.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Anything on the radar yet?
      
                          PLATO
                Not yet, sir.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I see. Well, he must be planning
                something big. Are the flame
                androids deployed?
      
                          PLATO
                All twelve.
      
      Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on
      his throne.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da
                Vinci, take your places next to me.
      
      They move to either side of the chair.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                No slouching.
      
      Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut.
      
      They remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind
      occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no
      Titan.
                                                               74.
      
      
      
      LATER
      
      Apparently quite some time has passed. The bold stances have
      degraded to fatigue.
      
                          PLATO
                He's certainly taking his time.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                He'll be here. That's the way it
                works.
      
      STILL LATER
      
      Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet
      impatiently on the armrest.
      
      Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Unprofessional, that's what this
                is. No, it's disrespect for the
                craft.
      
      Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Would Uberman have kept us waiting
                like this? Of course not. He was a
                pro who knew the score. It's time
                we spelled out a few things for
                this Titan. I will not be made a
                fool of.
      
      He storms out of the room.
      
      INT. HAL'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY
      
      Titan's sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing
      his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as
      he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV.
      
      Much to his annoyance, there's a KNOCK at the door.
      
                          TITAN
                Oh, for crying out loud.
      
      He gets up and opens the door. It's Master Mind.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Do you know who I am?
                                                                 75.
      
      
      
      It takes a few moments to register, but Titan's suddenly
      excited.
      
                          TITAN
                Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah!
                You're actually the guy I want to
                see!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Oh, so NOW you want to get down to
                it. Well, I want to get a few
                things off my chest first.
      
      Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins
      around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal
      fingers.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Of all the inconsiderate - Do you
                have any idea how long we waited
                for you? We're you even planning on
                coming to me and getting revenge?
      
      Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his
      guest.
      
                          TITAN
                Well, at first I was going to. You
                know, because that's what I figured
                I was supposed to do. But then I
                got to thinking-
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (interrupting)
                -You got to thinking? There's
                nothing to think about. I'm the
                villain. I do something bad, you
                come and get me.
      
                          TITAN
                - I got to thinking...what's the
                point?
      
      Master Mind throws up his hands.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Maybe you're right. What's the
                point?
      
      He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He
      walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a
      LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER
      VALUABLES.
                                                              76.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                What are these?
      
                          TITAN
                That's what I wanted to talk to you
                about.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (baffled)
                Where did you get all this?
      
                          TITAN
                    (proudly)
                Get this: I stole them.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                From where?
      
                          TITAN
                From all over. You see, once you
                killed Pat and ruined my other
                apartment building I was pretty
                pissed off, so I figured I'd go,
                find you and kick some ass. Then I
                thought to myself: "Okay,then
                what?" I mean, if we were to fight,
                what would I get out of it? Would I
                get my apartment back? Would I be
                able to pay the bills?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Well, what about your mentor?
      
                          TITAN
                Tell you the truth? He was kind of
                a dick. I mean, being a hero is
                dandy and all, but it's volunteer
                work. Now you've always had the
                right take on all this. I mean,
                when you rob a bank or take over
                the diamond exchange you get
                something out of it. I mean, when
                you don't get caught, which, no
                offense, isn't very often. And that
                brings me to what I wanted to
                propose to you: Who could catch you
                if I'm by your side?
      
      Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan
      awe-struck.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You want to team-up?
                                                                 77.
      
      
      
                          TITAN
                You got the brains, I got the
                brawn. We could even call ourselves
                that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at
                this.
      
      Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and
      shows it to Master Mind.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                I even designed us some new
                costumes.
      
      The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.
      A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of
      grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his
      chest.
      
      Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a
      black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank.
      
      Titan proudly points to the two figures.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                See, you'd be brain, so you got a
                little one on your costume, and
                then I'll have brawn on mine...once
                I figure out the best, you know,
                visual interpretation of it. What
                do you think?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What do I think?
      
      Master Mind shakes his head tiredly.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                I think you're probably the biggest
                idiot I've ever met. I mean, I
                can't believe you. All your gifts,
                all your powers, and all you want
                to use them for is your own
                financial fulfillment. You know
                what? Your kind of people make me
                sick.
      
      Titan puts down his drawing.
      
                          TITAN
                I worked hard on this.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Oh - gee - I am so sorry!
                                                              78.
      
      
      
      Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                    (under his breath)
                Of all the people to pick, it had
                to be this loser.
      
      This strikes a cord with Titan.
      
                          TITAN
                Now, hold on. You're going a little
                too far.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I wish your mother said that to
                your father the night of your
                conception, they would have saved
                me a whole lot of heartache.
      
                          TITAN
                Hey, I mean it.
      
      Master Mind gets right in his face.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?
      
      EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
      
      We see Master Mind's body CRASH through the building and land
      in a DUMPSTER across the street.
      
      A car pulls up. The driver's door opens. Da Vinci gets out
      and runs to help his master.
      
                            DA VINCI
                Master!
      
                            MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                It hurts.
      
      Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind's body
      cushioned by a stack of trash bags.
      
                          DA VINCI
                What hurts?
      
                            MASTER MIND
                It!
      
      The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the
      dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It's
      Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall.
                                                                 79.
      
      
      
                          TITAN
                I don't need you, I don't need
                anybody. I have the power to do and
                take anything I want. And now, I'm
                gonna take back everything this
                city owes me. Beware Metro City,
                it's time for Titan to collect.
      
      Titan shoots up into the air.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY
                THE WAY I WANT TO FLY!
      
      He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were
      piloting an invisible jet.
      
      Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan
      disappear into the distance.
      
                          DA VINCI
                How'd the plan go, boss?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I just made myself redundant, old
                friend.
      
      Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff.
      
                          DA VINCI
                It's not that bad.
      
      INT. BANK - DAY
      
      Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The
      last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks
      nostalgic.
      
      A SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his
      TV idol.
      
                          SECURITY GUARD
                Morning, Tighten.
      
                           TITAN
                Morning.
      
                          SECURITY GUARD
                Is there something we can do for
                you?
                                                                 80.
      
      
      
                             TITAN
                   Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just
                   here to make a withdrawal.
      
      Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration
      from all.
      
      A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good-
      natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault.
      
      The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK
      OF CASH.
      
      Sure he must be misunderstanding what's going on, the
      security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out
      the door.
      
      The bank manager comes over to the guard.
      
                             BANK MANAGER
                   Say, did he just rob us?
      
                             SECURITY GUARD
                   Not sure. Sort of looks it, don't
                   it?
      
                             BANK MANAGER
                   Yeah.
      
                             SECURITY GUARD
                   Should I, you know, stop him?
      
                             BANK MANAGER
                   Umm...Yeah.
      
      As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out
      the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror.
      
      The guard's body suddenly smashes through the window, landing
      at the startled bank manager's feet.
      
                             BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)
                       (looking down at the
                        guard)
                   He did rob us, didn't he?

                "Absolute power corrupts

                that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell
                Creighton in 1887, no one thought
                much about it, but today Metro City
                is reeling from that very prophecy.
                Tighten, who many thought of as our
                savior, has turned his back on the
                cause of justice.

      TITAN BEING EVIL - MONTAGE
      
      EXT. DIAMOND EXCHANGE - DAY
      
      Titan flies through the window of the building. He emerges
      seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty.
      
      EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
      
      A woman screams from the window of a BURNING BUILDING. Titan
      flies up to her, grabs her fur coat and zooms off again,
      leaving the woman behind, slightly confused.
      
      EXT. OUTSIDE MARKET - DAY
      
      Titan steals a little boy's lollipop and gooses his mother.
      
      EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
      
      Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get
      out of a downpour. We cut to the top of a building and see
      Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da
      Vinci.
      
                          PLATO
                I don't understand it. He seemed to
                have every characteristic we were
                looking for in a superhero.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Well, there's no use crying about
                it now, we must take action. I'm
                not going to play second fiddle to
                that crass buffoon. We must destroy
                Tighten.
                                                                 82.
      
      
      
                          PLATO
                It won't be easy. Uberman had a
                sense of decency and genuine love
                for the people. That was his
                weakness and was easily used
                against him.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Yes, but he possesses the same
                flaws present in Uberman's DNA -
                copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin
                always said: "If something works
                don't dick with it."
      
      EXT. BAR - DAY
      
      It looks like a war zone passed through here. Smashed police
      cars and debris lay everywhere. This seems to be the only
      building left untouched.
      
      INT. BAR - DAY
      
      A very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into
      the bottom of his beer glass for answers.
      
                          TITAN
                I can have anything I want. I'm
                like a god.
      
      The BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a
      dirty rag.
      
                          TITAN
                Point to any woman in this bar. I
                could have her in a second.
      
      He follows the bartender's gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON
      THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY.
      
                          TITAN
                    (to Old Barfly)
                Hey, you wanna get with this?
      
                          BARTENDER
                Buddy, what do you want?
      
      Titan carefully considers this for a moment.
      
                          TITAN
                What do you want? That's the
                question, isn't it. I mean, what do
                you want when you can have
                everything?
                          (MORE)
                                                                83.
                          TITAN(cont'd)
                I suppose what I really want is to
                never be forgotten again. I want to
                do something that can never be cast
                aside or one-upped. I want a -
                what's it called? - A legacy. I
                want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I
                like the sound that.
      
                          BARTENDER
                I meant, what do you want to drink?
      
                          TITAN
                Oh.
      
      EXT. BAR - LATER
      
      Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of
      money.
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                Your time has come to an end,
                Titan!
      
      He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him.
      
                          TITAN
                What?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                There can be only one master
                criminal in this city - and it's
                me.
      
                          TITAN
                Really?
      
      Titan melodramatically throws up his arms.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                I guess I should leave town then,
                huh?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I have a better idea - NOW!
      
      Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like
      the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan.
      
      Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars,
      tries to pull them apart but can't.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                That's copper my good man. Your one
                weakness.
                          (MORE)
                                                                84.
                          MASTER MIND(cont'd)
                For all your amazing gifts of brawn
                you are no match for my intellect.
      
      Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a
      human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW.
      
      As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look
      on Master Mind's face until Titan suddenly explodes out from
      under the street in front of him.
      
      Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded.
      
      Titan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops.
      
                          TITAN
                You know what? You're nothing but a
                bug. Not even worth my effort.
      
      He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the
      street.
      
      Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They
      watch Titan shrink into the distance.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                He's not as dumb as I thought.
      
                          PLATO
                I guess not...Funny, though.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What's funny?
      
                          PLATO
                Funny Uberman didn't think of the
                same thing.
      
      EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY
      
      As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city
      below.
      
      Suddenly, something catches his attention.
      
                             HAL
                That's it!
      
      He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below.
      
      The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are
      in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up
      to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane.
                                                                85.
      
      
      
                          HAL
                Hello, Legacy.
      
      EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a
      COMMOTION.
      
      They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL
      from the top of the establishment.
      
                          VINNIE
                Hey, that's my ball!
      
      INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
      
      Roxanne enters the building's elevator. Just before the door
      closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in.
      
                          ELDERLY WOMAN
                That was a close one. Sixth floor,
                please.
      
      Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button.
      
      The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a
      MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne's face. She falls to the
      floor unconscious.
      
      INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - DAY
      
      Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her
      living room.
      
      We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to
      adjust her vision.
      
      Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear.
      
      It's Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks
      to be some kind of JOURNAL.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Wow, I always thought Uberman was
                your first superhero - but it looks
                like our little Roxanne dated a
                linebacker in college.
      
                          ROXANNE
                That's my diary.
      
                            MASTER MIND
                So it is.
                                                                 86.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                It's personal.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Well, then I wouldn't leave it in
                your underwear drawer for just
                anyone to find.
      
      He throws the diary over his shoulder.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What do you want?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I need your help.
      
                          ROXANNE
                So you knock me out and tie me to a
                chair?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You're not going to like what I'm
                about to tell you.
      
      As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked
      unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the TV.
      
      ON TELEVISION
      
      Brad Helms is huddled behind a van.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                It's chaos here in city square as
                city police -
      
      Behind him, Titan picks up a POLICE CAR and throws it at a
      PADDY WAGON. Both vehicles EXPLODE on impact.
      
      BACK TO SCENE
      
                          ROXANNE
                He's really out of control.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Tell me about it.
      
      As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at
      Master Mind.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I should have known. You have
                something to do with this, don't
                you? - With Titan turning evil.
                                                              87.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Well, the evil thing he did by
                himself. My goal was to give MYSELF
                purpose by creating an intellectual
                sparring partner.
      
                          ROXANNE
                    (confused)
                You're talking like you made him.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                And they call me Master Mind.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Let me get this straight. You
                missed getting your ass kicked, so
                you made a new guy to kick your
                ass. That's pathetic.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                In hindsight...
      
      Roxanne turns back to the TV to see a group of POLICE
      OFFICERS open fire on Titan. The bullets just deflect off his
      chest.
      
                          ROXANNE
                And his powers, they're just like
                Uberman's. Why would he have his
                powers?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (almost ashamed)
                I had some left over from
                something. I infused him with it.
      
                          ROXANNE
                YOU DID WHAT!?
      
      Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. She
      finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure
      hatred.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Yeah, that's why I decided to tie
                you up.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You did all this because you wanted
                purpose?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                He seemed nice.
                                                                 88.
      
      
      
      TELEVISION
      
      Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves
      for the camera to zoom in on him.
      
                             TITAN
                   Closer. I want to show the people
                   my real face.
      
      He pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to
      the public for the first time.
      
                             TITAN (CONT'D)
                   Recognize me?
      
      BACK TO SCENE
      
                             ROXANNE
                   Hal Stewart. He's the guy we
                   thought saved that woman and kid.
                   Turned out he was just trying to
                   save his own ass.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   Yeah, good to know - NOW!
      
      TELEVISION
      
      Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the
      car.
      
                             TITAN
                   That's right, I'm really Hal
                   Stewart. Former hero and bowling
                   teacher at Kingpin's Bowling.
      
      BACK TO SCENE
      
      Roxanne turns to Master Mind, condescending him with her
      eyes.
      
                              ROXANNE
                   You picked a bowler to give super
                   powers to?
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   It's a modest profession!
      
      TELEVISION
                                                              89.
      
      
      
                          TITAN
                With my new found power, I've
                recently started to wonder what
                sort of legacy I should leave.
                Should I be a hero? I tried that
                once before - even saved a lady and
                her baby from being squashed. I was
                treated like a god until everyone
                started to shit on me - Okay, so
                what if I didn't "purposely" save
                them!
      
      He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete
      shape just off camera.
      
                          TITAN
                Well, I'm going to make something
                that can't be taken away from me.
                I'm going to create a permanent
                monument to my greatness. One that
                won't be so easily forgotten or
                erased.
      
      The camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING
      BALL from Kingpin's.
      
                          TITAN
                I intend to create a new category
                in the Guinness Book of World's
                Records by rolling the biggest
                strike in the history of bowling.
      
      He grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS.
      We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN
      FORMATION.
      
                          TITAN
                My thanks to the city planning
                commission. This wouldn't have been
                possible without them.
      
      Titan grabs the camera so it's pointing back at him again.
      
                          TITAN
                Tell your friends and family to
                tune in right here to this station
                at noon tomorrow.
      
      BACK TO SCENE
      
                          ROXANNE
                My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy
                the whole business triangle.
                                                              90.
      
      
      
      Master Mind seems to be contemplating something - something
      bad.
      
                             ROXANNE
                What?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                My lair is in the direct path of
                the ball.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want
                anything to happen to your hideout,
                would we?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You don't understand. I have
                certain equipment that's - that's
                highly unstable.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What do you mean?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,
                okay?
      
                          ROXANNE
                A HYDROGEN reactor?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                It's experimental - only one in the
                world...Well, how do you think I
                power all my inventions? Someone
                like me can't pay for electricity.
                The bills would be outrageous.
      
                             ROXANNE
                A REACTOR?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                It creates 100 times the output of
                a nuclear one...If destroyed it
                could...
      
                          ROXANNE
                - Vaporize the entire city!
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (proudly)
                Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard,
                actually. That little baby is
                amazing. I'm quite proud of it.
                          (MORE)
                                                               91.
                          MASTER MIND(cont'd)
                    (off her deadpan reaction)
                I mean...we'd better find a way to
                stop him.
      
      Master Mind thinks a moment.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Did Uberman have a hideout?
      
                          ROXANNE
                What?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                A cave, a solitary fortress of some
                kind. C'mon, all heros have a place
                to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,
                it may be our only chance to find
                something, a clue, anything that
                could give us a fighting chance.
      
                          ROXANNE
                It's under his house.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Whose house?
      
      Roxanne can hardly believe what she's telling him.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Wayne Scott's.
      
      Master Mind shoots up out of his chair.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne
                Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy
                philanthropist? But he disappeared -
      
                           ROXANNE
                     (interrupting)
                He disappeared just over two months
                ago when you killed him. Not only
                did you rid the world of a hero,
                you killed a kind, noble, generous
                man.
      
      Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head.
      
      Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds.
      
      Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the
      door.
                                                                 92.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                Looks like you got what you always
                wanted. Uberman is out of the
                picture and Metro City is doomed.
      
      He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                "Metro City doomed." You know, I
                never thought I'd say something
                like this, but here it goes -
      
      He slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Not if I have anything to say about
                it.
      
      EXT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT
      
      Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Such a dark place for one such as
                you. I wonder, underneath your
                noble deeds, what inner demons
                drove you to your endless crusade
                for justice?
      
      He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been
      sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear
      them off with his metal hand.
      
      INT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT
      
      The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the
      darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the
      manor.
      
      Master Mind enters.
      
      Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic
      crypt.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Good lord, man. You've only been
                dead for two months.
      
      Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF
      WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his
      fallen foe.
                                                                 93.

                 A disguise so simple, it's
                 ingenious. No wonder I never caught
                 on.
      
      Besides the Armani suit, there's nothing to hide the fact
      that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he's
      even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists
      on his hips.
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                 Two lives, yet in both you were an
                 ideal. Perhaps it was you who was
                 victorious in the end, old friend.
      
      A BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls.
      
      Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a
      gigantic BOOKCASE.
      
      On the twelfth bong it falls silent.
      
      Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he
      hears a loud CLICK.
      
      The bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN
      PASSAGE.
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                 I'll miss how predictable you were.
      
      The passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR.
      
      Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with
      stone walls.
      
      He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED
      SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway.
      
      Master Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he
      begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the
      door.
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                 Hello? Anyone here...besides..all
                 the BIG MEN who are with me now?
      
      Nothing.
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                     (to himself)
                 What's the worst you're gonna find?
                           (MORE)
                                                                 94.
                          MASTER MIND(cont'd)
                The man was a boy scout, not a
                serial killer.
      
      He opens the door to his immediate amazement.
      
      It's some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image
      onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS
      litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is
      covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine
      stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.
      
      Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.
      
      SCREEN
      
      A woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an
      overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt
      sticking out.
      
                          DOMINATRIX IN FILM
                YOU ARE A WORM!
      
      She whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain.
      
                          FAT MAN IN FILM
                PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!!
      
      Master Mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery.
      
      The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open.
      
      WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room
      carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP.
      
      Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                Ahhhhhh!
      
      Wayne Scott is just as startled.
      
                           WAYNE SCOTT
                Jesus!
      
      He drop his drink and snack to the floor.
      
      The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain
      their normal breathing patterns.
      
      Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick
      layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)
                What the hell are you doing here?
                                                                 95.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I might just ask you the same
                question. I had thought I
                incinerated you.
      
                           WAYNE SCOTT
                You scared the bejesus out of me.
                How'd you figure out I was still
                alive? Wait, how do you know my
                identity!?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,
                I forgot to line the bottom of the
                copper cage - Somebody pointed that
                out to me recently. Figured if they
                could do it, so could you. But one
                thing I couldn't figure out -
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                The skeleton? Something I
                "borrowed" from a medical school a
                few months before.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                A few months? How long had you been
                planning this?
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                I always planned to retire -
                eventually. I mean, come on, you
                can't do this sort of thing in your
                fifties. You'd just look
                ridiculous.
      
      The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in
      Master Mind's head.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I see it all so clearly now.
      
      INT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK
      
      Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the
      observatory explodes.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)
                You must have done it just seconds
                before the observatory exploded.
                                                                96.
      
      
      
      INT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK
      
      Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the
      cage.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)
                You bore out from under the cage.
                Then, using your Uber-Speed, -
      
      EXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK
      
      Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in
      front of some bushes.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)
                - you made your way to safety,
                where you had the skeleton safely
                hidden away somewhere.
      
      EXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY
      
      Uberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the
      observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O) (CONT'D)
                Then you must have flown to a safe
                distance and waited for the
                explosion, then...
      
      Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the
      SKELETON like a javelin.
      
      It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the
      flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the
      windshield of Master Mind's hydrofoil.
      
      END OF FLASHBACK
      
      Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed.
      
                          WAYNE
                Man, you ARE smart.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                But why fake your death? Why go
                through all of it? You could have
                just quit.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                But the responsibility would still
                be there.

                                                              97.
                          WAYNE SCOTT(cont'd)
                A cop can retire and stop handing
                out speeding tickets - but people
                expect more from superheroes. I
                tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt
                in Zimbabwe without everyone
                expecting me to do something about
                it. I figured, out of sight, out of
                mind.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to
                disappear?
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Both of my lives have so much
                baggage. It's time for new baggage,
                you know?
      
      Master Mind's is absolutely flabbergasted.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I just can't believe it. This whole
                time you've been in hiding while a
                force of great evil is tearing your
                city apart?
      
      Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to
      say no more.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                I don't want to hear about it.
                That's why I don't have a
                television in here to remind me of
                all the things I SHOULD be doing.
                Hell, I could get a wife to do
                that.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                There's a demented supervillain out
                there about to destroy our - I
                mean, your city.
      
      Wayne shrugs indifferently.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You're really going to do nothing?
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Good and evil have a way of
                balancing themselves out. If this
                guy is as bad as you say, somebody
                will rise up to fight him. It's
                just the order of things. You found
                me, didn't you?
                                                                98.
      
      
      
      Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind's shoulder.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)
                I know it's hard, but you'll find
                someone else someday.
      
      He then starts walking to the door.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You're the only one who can stop
                him.
      
      Wayne turns around.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a
                plane to catch.
      
                            MASTER MIND
                A plane?
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Going to Barbados for a little
                change in climate. Now, if you'll
                excuse me, I got to go pack.
      
      He reads the still defeated look on Master Mind's face.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)
                You were a good foe. I'm sorry if
                I've let you down. If it makes a
                difference, you were the best foe a
                hero could ask for.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Not smart enough to come up with a
                full-proof trap.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Well, you did almost have me when
                you figured out my weakness was
                copper. Now that made me sweat a
                little. Took me way too long to
                drill out from under that cage.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I got lucky.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Anyway, it's a good thing for my
                sake that I could always count on
                you for an out.
                                                              99.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (suddenly confused)
                What do you mean?
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                C'mon, we always threw each other a
                couple of bones. You would always
                leave me an out in one of your
                `full-proof' traps, and I'd never
                had you incarcerated at a
                penitentiary that you couldn't
                eventually escape from. It kept our
                little game going.
      
      Master Mind seems deflated.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Game? - Was that all this ever was
                to you? You know, I was trying my
                best every time I fought you. Those
                `outs' as you call them were
                unintentional.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Oh.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I guess I was never really a match
                for you, was I?
      
      Wayne shrugs.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                    (thoughtfully)
                Then how can I expect to be one for
                Titan?
      
      A beaten man, Master Mind heads for the door, but stops and
      turns around.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                What about Roxanne?
      
      Wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                I think we both got what we wanted
                out of our relationship. She got a
                career out of me, and I got plenty
                of other things out of her. But I'm
                ready to move on to greener
                pastures.
                                                                100.
      
      
      
      Master Mind's steel hand clinches into a fist at his side.
      Wayne's oblivious to this.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I guess I wasn't the villain I
                thought I was, and you...you
                weren't the hero I thought you
                were.
      
      He turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees ROXANNE
      STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME.
      
      Wayne is almost at a loss for words.
      
                          WAYNE SCOTT
                Roxanne! How long have you been...
      
                          ROXANNE
                Long enough.
      
      Roxanne looks at Master Mind.
      
                           ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                Don't you have something else you
                can go do?
      
      Master Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in
      silence.
      
      EXT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY
      
      Titan emerges with Brad and Frank. He's holding a BEER CAN
      and a bag of PORK RINDS.
      
                          TITAN
                Alright, I want this whole thing to
                look ESPN professional, understand?
      
      A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises,
      signaling the approach of something powerful.
      
      Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the
      sound becomes almost deafening.
      
      A TANK TRACK
      
      as it moves over the street. We PULL BACK to see a whole line
      of TANKS rolling along the street.
      
      PLAZA
      
      From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks
      roll toward Titan.
                                                                101.
      
      
      
      Titan turns to Brad and Frank.
      
                             TITAN (CONT'D)
                   You guys are about to get some good
                   footage. I might need a little
                   room, though.
      
      Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover
      behind a nearby building.
      
      Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks
      begin to surround them.
      
      FEEDBACK belts out of one of the tank's loudspeaker's,
      causing Titan to do a mock wince.
      
                              TANK LOUDSPEAKER
                   Titan, we have orders from the city
                   of Metro to take you into custody.
                   If you do not give your self up
                   willingly, we will be forced to
                   open fire.
      
      There's a long pause as no one says anything.
      
                             TANK LOUDSPEAKER
                   What is your answer?
      
      Titan takes a sip of his beverage and UNLEASHES A GIGANTIC
      BURP - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks
      flying into a nearby building.
      
      Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have
      him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive
      guns.
      
      Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each
      barrel.
      
      They FIRE.
      
      The FORCE OF THE BLAST SENDS THEM BOTH FLYING IN OPPOSITE
      DIRECTIONS where they CRASH into nearby buildings.
      
      Titan bends down and pick his beet back up.
      
                             TITAN
                       (to beer)
                   Miss me?
      
      Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine-
      gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a
      nearby car.
                                                                102.
      
      
      
      He looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It's nose-
      mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him.
      
      Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The
      bottom of it was blown apart in the blast.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Didn't mean to get you involved in
                all of this.
      
      He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun
      gets a bead on him.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Hey, man! You killed my suds!
      
      Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his
      hand.
      
      It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade
      clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like
      a car dropped off a building.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                That's one was for you, beer.
      
      Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and
      Frank still hiding behind the building.
      
                          TITAN
                Guys, please tell me you got that
                last bit.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                Huh?
      
                          TITAN
                You're kidding me. I give you my
                sexiest moves and you mean to tell
                me it was for nothing?
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                We were afraid something might hit
                us.
      
                          TITAN
                Looks like I've given the story of
                the century to the wrong man.
      
      He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him.
                                                             103.
      
      
      
                          TITAN
                Wait. What about that other
                reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on
                the topper half, but killer legs.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a
                much better reporter than I am. You
                want her.
      
                          TITAN
                Where can I find her.
      
                          FRANK
                We're actually not supposed to give
                out that sort of information.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe
                she lives in a penthouse.
      
                          TITAN
                You've been very helpful.
      
      He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream
      cone.
      
      In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of
      the Metro City river.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY
      
      Master Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack
      boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Hurry, we must be on our way as
                soon as possible.
      
                          DA VINCI
                Master, why must we flee?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I told you, Titan is too powerful.
                If he's set on destroying us,
                there's precious little we could do
                about it.
      
                          DA VINCI
                Where are we going?
                                                             104.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                To another city, someplace with a
                shitload of superheroes to fight.
                We'll start over, we'll go back to
                doing what we do best.
      
                          PLATO
                With our tails between our legs?
      
      The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip
      by, but as we have seen, he's not the same man.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Plato, do you have a better plan?!
      
      Master Mind's cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his
      men and answers it.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Hello...Roxanne?
      
      INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT
      
      Roxanne paces back and forth on the phone.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What are you going to do about
                Tighten?
      
      INTERCUT between Master Mind and Roxanne on phone.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Right now I'm packing, later I'll
                have a snack on the train.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You're running away?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                In a word - yes.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You created this monster...
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I didn't create this - the god's of
                irony did and I am eating the crow
                I so richly deserve.
      
                          ROXANNE
                There's no time for self pity.
                                                             105.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I'll make the time.
      
      Roxanne can't believe what she's hearing.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                You can leave with us. You'll be
                safe.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'm not going anywhere.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Will you listen to me, no one can
                stop him.
      
                           ROXANNE
                You have to try. The city needs
                your help.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I'm afraid you have an inflated
                opinion of me.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What the hell's happened to you?
                The Master Mind I knew would never
                have run from a fight even though
                he knew deep in his heart that he
                didn't have a chance in hell of
                winning it. It was your best
                quality. You need to be that man
                right now...I...
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What?
      
                          ROXANNE
                    (heart felt)
                I believe in you.
      
      Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way. But he catches
      himself before the words swell his heart.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Sweet words, but that man is dead.
                Please, Roxanne, just come with me.
      
                          ROXANNE
                No...I guess you are a coward after
                all.
      
      Suddenly, there's a loud crash.
                                                               106.
      
      
      
      Roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been
      completely ripped off.
      
      Titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if
      it were a paper plate at a barbecue.
      
      He looks down at her and smiles.
      
                          TITAN
                Man, have I got a story for you.
      
      Master Mind can hears Titan's familiar laugh from his side of
      the line.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Roxanne? Roxanne?
      
      EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      Titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to
      decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion.
      
                          TITAN
                What pose would be best? The corny
                folded arms thing?
      
      He demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air.
      
                          TITAN
                Or maybe on the hips, like this.
      
      It's the classic Superman pose, only not as masculine.
      
                          TITAN
                No, makes me look like a flamer
                pirate.
      
      As Titan starts to fix his hair in the window, Frank pretends
      to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to Roxanne.
      
                          FRANK
                    (whispering)
                Shouldn't we be making a run for it
                right about now?
      
                          ROXANNE
                    (whispering)
                The guy can outrun bullets. I don't
                think either one of us is in that
                kind of shape.
      
                          TITAN
                She's right, Frank.
                                                             107.
      
      
      
      Frank looks up, stunned that Titan could have possibly heard
      him.
      
                          TITAN
                Also got super hearing. I promise
                not to keep the both of you long,
                but you'll thank me when this is
                all over.
      
      Frank and Roxanne exchange helpless expressions.
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY
      
      Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of
      his father.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Dad, it's me...
                    (he looks around to make
                     sure no one can hear)
                ...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked
                in a while, and I'm sorry. It's
                been a little crazy trying to live
                up to a legacy.
      
      The painting's menacing stare seems to reach into his very
      soul.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Anyway...You raised me to be the
                worst that I could possibly be. And
                I've tried to live up to that as
                best as I could - even dropping out
                of dentistry school like you wanted
                me to. But I'm about to do
                something now that would really
                piss you off. I'm going to go
                against everything you ever taught
                me. I hope...I hope that maybe
                you'll look down at what I'm about
                to do as not so much a good deed,
                but more like the outright defiance
                of a hateful and ungrateful, son.
                If you could do that, then maybe -
                in your own little way - you could -
                for probably the first time - find
                a reason to be proud of me.
      
      He looks back up at the picture. Is it our imagination, or
      does the painting's stare suddenly seem even angrier?
                                                             108.
      
      
      
                              MASTER MIND
                   Well...either way, you're probably
                   going to see me real soon.
                        (calling over his
                         shoulder)
                   Men?
      
      Plato and Da Vinci suddenly stop what they're doing and look
      up at him.
      
                              PLATO AND DA VINCI
                   Yes Sir?
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   Stop packing. Our work is not
                   finished here.
      
                              PLATO AND DA VINCI
                   YES SIR!
      
      TELEVISION
      
      A news report shows an aerial shot of Titan setting the giant
      ball down in the middle of a vacant city street.
      
                             REPORTER
                   We interrupt your regular afternoon
                   programming to show you live
                   footage of a potential dangerous
                   situation in downtown Metro. The
                   former hero knows as Titan is
                   placing what appears to be a giant
                   ball...
      
      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY     - CONTINUOUS
      
      Da Vinci stops in front of a television set, seeing the news
      report in progress.
      
                             REPORTER
                   Hold on...It appears our own
                   Roxanne Ritchi is somehow at the
                   scene. We now go to her with a live
                   report.
      
                             DA VINCI
                   Sir, I think you should see this!
      
                                                   CUT TO:
                                                             109.
      
      
      
      EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
      
      Roxanne is standing in front of a camera with a mike in her
      hand.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'm here with the cause of the
                destruction in Metro City. He has
                kidnapped me and a cameraman to
                chronicle what he refers to as the
                creation of a monument to his
                invincibility and overall
                "Asskickiness." He will use this
                giant concrete bowling ball to play
                the largest game of bowling ever
                using the buildings of downtown
                Metro City as his pins.
      
      Titan suddenly steps into the shot.
      
                          TITAN
                And I'm going for the biggest
                strike ever.
      
      He leans into the camera.
      
                          TITAN
                And you, Metro City, have a
                ringside seat as I cement my name
                in the anal of history.
      
                             ROXANNE
                Annals.
      
                             TITAN
                What?
      
                             ROXANNE
                Nevermind.
      
      EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER
      
      Titan holds up the massive bowling ball, lining up his shot.
      
                          TITAN
                    (in quiet professional
                     bowler announcer voice)
                Like Tiger before him, a young
                savior has come to raise a sport
                from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart,
                a young man with a dream, realizing
                that dream here today, folks.

                          TITAN(cont'd)
                One might click there heels and say
                "There's no place like home" upon
                finding themselves in such a
                fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much
                at home right were he is - with a
                ball in hand and glory in his
                sights.
      
      INT. METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
      
      In the bowels of Master Mind's hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR
      glows and HUMS MENACINGLY.
      
      BACK TO SCENE
      
      Roxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Hal, I know everyone treated you
                like shit, but you don't have to do
                this.
      
                          TITAN
                You're right. I don't HAVE to do
                anything. Isn't that cool?
      
      Titan lines up his shot.
      
                          TITAN
                Here's one for the record books!
      
      Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main
      street.
      
      ROXANNE
      
      Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable
      destruction of Metro City.
      
      As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it's wake;
      cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete
      sphere brushes along side buildings.
      
      TITAN
      
      He smiles in anticipation and uses "body English" to direct
      the ball.
      
      GIANT BOWLING BALL POV
      
      It's nearly halfway to its target.
      
      ROXANNE
                                                             111.
      
      
      
      She closes her eyes.
      
      Titan's smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something
      we don't.
      
      About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT
      SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a
      defensive barrier. An enormous letter "M" is etched in the
      web's center.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                What the...?
      
      The ball breaks through the web, but it's speed is greatly
      reduced.
      
                          FRANK
                Look, what's that flying in the
                air?
      
      We suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A
      JET PACK.
      
      He quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a
      path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere's path.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                C'mon, slow down
      
      Master Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to
      empty.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                C'mon.
      
      The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side.
      It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Gutterball!
      
      TITAN
      
      He's furious to say the least.
      
                             TITAN
                YOU!
      
      Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Bowling? What other trailer park
                sports can you play?
                                                                112.
      
      
      
                            TITAN
                  You are becoming a real pain in my
                  ass. I should have done this a long
                  time ago.
      
      Titan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER
      on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the
      city with Titan in hot pursuit.
      
                            MASTER   MIND (CONT'D)
                      (into walkie   talkie)
                  Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,
                  he's falling for   it.
      
      ELSEWHERE
      
      A flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city
      streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight.
      
      He turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left.
      
      Sitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange
      collar. It smiles at him.
      
                            TITAN
                  What the hell?
      
      From behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more RADIO
      CONTROLLED APES.
      
                              TITAN (CONT'D)
                  GODAMNIT!
      
      The critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one
      off two more jump him.
      
      Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them
      across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their
      sight they begin to attack the fruit.
      
      MASTER MIND
      
      He's a block away frantically hitting his remote.
      
                            MASTER MIND
                  Shit! Stupid monkeys and their
                  fruit.
      
      Titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find
      Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with
      only his head sticking out.
                                                             113.
      
      
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                No more games.
      
      Titan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MIND's CHEST.
      
      Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT.
      Titan's EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high
      pressure stream of water.
      
      Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of
      CEMENT mix into the truck.
      
      The crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan
      doesn't emerge.
      
      Master Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck
      cautiously.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Could it really be that easy--
      
      - BOOM - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and
      concrete everywhere. When the dust clears we see and enraged
      Titan.
      
                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                Didn't think so.
      
      As the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to
      give Master Mind the killing blow.
      
                          TITAN
                If you don't mind, I'm going to
                punch trough your face now.
      
      Preparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as
      a SUDDEN GUST OF WIND BEGINS TO PICK UP.
      
      AS Titan goes to strike, a BLURRY FIGURE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES
      MASTER MIND OUT OF THE AWAY.
      
      Stunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to
      make sure everything's still in place.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                I'm alive.
      
      He turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                Uberman?
                                                             114.
      
      
      
      The terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing
      next to Master Mind.
      
                          BYSTANDER 1
                It's Uberman!
      
                          BYSTANDER 2
                Uberman's alive!
      
                          BYSTANDER 3
                We're saved!
      
      As the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro
      City's newly resurrected champion.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                I thought.
      
                             UBERMAN
                So did I.
      
      He puts a hand on Master Mind's shoulder.
      
                          UBERMAN
                Thank you, old enemy.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                For what?
      
                          UBERMAN
                Showing me the error of my ways,
                Showing me I'm meant to be this
                city's savior, showing me that,
                while we can try, there is no
                running away from our true destiny.
      
      With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY
      TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON.
      
      Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING
      EYES.
      
                          TITAN
                Oh...Did I interrupt something?
      
      Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him.
      
                          TITAN
                Where you going, buddy?
      
      Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across
      the street into a parked car.
                                                                115.
      
      
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Welcome to Paintown. Population:
                you.
      
      Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a
      daze, unable to move.
      
      Titan flies up in the air.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Time to finish this.
      
      With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master
      Mind. He's like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing
      blow.
      
      Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                WAIT!!!
      
      Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like
      an old Warner Bros cartoon.
      
                          TITAN
                What?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Quick joke - What's the capital of
                Thailand?
      
                          TITAN
                Huh - I don't know.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                It's bang cock!
      
      In a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN
      THE GROIN.
      
      The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching,
      with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the
      pain suddenly surging through his member.
      
                          TITAN (CONT'D)
                Ow.
      
      Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind's hand and sees his
      gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                So, I guess pennies are good for
                something.
                                                             116.
      
      
      
      He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold.
      
      Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little
      pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to
      see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE.
      
      Roxanne comes up to him.
      
      The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He's
      not sure what to make of it.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Pretty strange, huh?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                They're cheering for me.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You saved them. You saved
                everybody. How's it feel?
      
      Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to
      well up a little.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                It's a...it's nice, you know? I
                usually don't get a lot of
                feedback.
                    (whispering)
                But I also kind of caused all this.
                What happens when they find that
                out I was the cause of some of
                this?
      
      Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master
      Mind.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What they don't know won't hurt
                them.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I guess that is all in the past.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You're the hero.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I don't think I'd go that far...I
                mean I just...er...
      
                          ROXANNE
                Master Mind?
                                                             117.
      
      
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   Yes?
      
                             ROXANNE
                   Stop talking.
      
      She kisses him.
      
      The crowd erupts in a cheer.
      
      TELEVISION
      
      The channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the
      title "Eye on Metro City."
      
      A picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind
      her.
      
                             SAMANTHA SUMMERS
                   Who's bad? Well, not Master Mind.
                   It seems the former villain has
                   done a career 180 after defeating
                   Tighten and saving Metro City from
                   certain enslavement. And here he is
                   getting a full pardon by Metro
                   City's Mayor, Steve Dent.
      
      Cut to ceremony on capital steps. The MAYOR is shaking Master
      Mind's metal gauntlet when it suddenly STARTS TO CRUSH HIS
      HAND.
      
                             MAYOR
                   Ahhh!
      
      Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and
      take aim at Master Mind.
      
      Realizing what's happening, he quickly lets the mayor's hand
      go and puts his arms in the air.
      
                             MASTER MIND
                   Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.
      
      He elbows the mayor.
      
                             MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                    We're okay, right?
      
      Wincing, the mayor signals the men to put their guns down.
      
      WE CUT to video of Titan behind bars in a regular prison.
                                                             118.
      
      
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                And what about Tighten? Is there a
                prison in existence that can hold
                this super powered menace? Well,
                the answer we found is no.
      
      A man in a white lab coat stands in front of Titan's cell
      just out of reach.
      
                          PRISON SCIENTIST
                Of course normally he could break
                out of there anytime, but as you
                can see we've taken some special
                precautions.
      
      The news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a
      copper JOCK STRAP with electrical cables hooked to it.
      
      Back to Samantha at the desk.
      
                          BRAD HELMS
                What is a Hero? It seems never has
                that question needed to be asked
                more than it does tonight. We go to
                our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making
                her triumphant return to our news
                desk for the answer.
      
      Brad turns. The camera pans over to Roxanne who we now see
      has been sitting beside him.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What is a hero? Well, there are
                many different kinds. There are
                those who hear a call, like the
                policeman or doctor, then there's
                the kind the public creates in
                their search for meaning and hope.
                Then, there are those who have the
                courage to change.
      
      DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
      
      A woman is being chased by two large thugs. They're gaining
      on her.
      
      She comes to a brick wall - a dead end.
      
      The thugs laugh.
      
                          THUG #1
                Hey, gimme that purse?
                                                             119.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S)
                I don't think it would go with your
                outfit.
      
      The thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his
      arms folded across his chest.
      
                          THUG #2
                It's Master Mind!
      
      Thug #1 draws a knife.
      
                          THUG #1
                So? It's not like he has any
                superpowers.
      
      Thug #1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles.
      
      Suddenly two more Thugs appear behind Master Mind.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                I'm gonna give you a chance to
                surrender.
      
                          THUG #1
                Four against one. For a Master
                Mind, you're really bad at math.
      
      Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air.
      
      Suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men
      behind him.
      
      Thug #1 and Thug #2 drop their knives and raise their hands
      in the air.
      
      Master Mind looks up and waves.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Way to take out those two goons,
                guys!
      
      We see Da Vinci and Plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot.
      
                          DA VINCI
                What two goons?
      
      The giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of it's
      sole. It KNOCKS OVER WATER TOWER in the process.
      
      The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified.
                                            120.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (apologetically)
                Sorry, we're new at this.

EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

A million stars wink in the night desert sky. Down here on earth, an
insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides
effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air.

The insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS
unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down
the road.

INT. VAN -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

The DRIVER of the van, a fifty-year-old American, turns on the wipers,
smearing the remains all over.

				DRIVER
		Goddamn bugs.

He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but
now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight
of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road.

He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He
speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled.

				DRIVER (CONT'D)
		Deja me hablar.
			(Let me do the talking.)

EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

The van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue
four doors with "INS" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS
stand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward
and comes to the window.

The DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also
government issue, looks at him and sighs.

				AGENT JANUS
		Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where
		you comin' from?

				DRIVER
		I was fishing in Cuernavaca.

				AGENT JANUS
		Sure you were. What do you say we have a
		look at your catch?

AT THE BACK OF THE VAN,

the Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a DOZEN FRIGHTENED
MEXICANS, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus
looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his
head.

				AGENT JANUS
		Me, I woulda thrown 'em back.
			(to the passengers, in Spanish)
		Vamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina!
			(Let's go. Out. Form a line!)

They pile out of the van. Some are parents with small children.

				AGENT JANUS (CONT'D)
		What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a
		head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all
		for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna
		need --

He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching,
fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several
Agents pull their weapons.

The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS
cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their
headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD.

TWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple
black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of
world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach
the INS agents.

				KAY
		We'll take it from here.

				AGENT JANUS
		Who the hell are you?

Kay and Dee flash some form of ID.

				KAY
		INS Division 6.

				AGENT JANUS
		Division 6? I never heard of Division 6.

				KAY
		Really?

Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		What're we thinking, Dee?

				DEE
		Tough call, Kay.

He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in
Spanish.

				KAY
		!Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey!
			(What's up, how are you?)
		No se preocupe, abuela. Bienvenida a los
		Estados Unidos.
			(Don't worry grandma.
			Welcome to the United
			States.)
				(next)
		A donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo,
		no? Buena suerta.
			(Where are you going? San
			Antonio?  Looking for
			work, aren't you?  Good
			luck.)
				(next)
		Es un placer verle aqui.
			(It's a pleasure seeing
			you here.)

One by one, their faces relax, reassured by Kay's calm demeanor. When he
reaches the fifth Guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but:

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Que dices si te rompo la cara?
			(What do you say if I
			break your face?)

The Guy smiles and nods. Kay stops. His own smile broadens and he drops a
hand on the Guy's shoulder.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol,
		verdad, amigo?
			(You don't speak a word
			of Spanish, right, friend?)

Again, the Guy smiles and nods. Kay looks back at Dee.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		We got a winner.
			(to the others)
		Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense!
			(The rest of you are free
			to go. Scram!)

				AGENT JANUS
		Sir!

				KAY
		Tomen el camion, y vayeuse.
			(Get on the road and go.)

				AGENT JANUS
		Sir, you can't just --

				KAY
		Don't "Sir" me! You have no idea who you're
		dealing with!

Silence on the road. The Driver grins, jumps back in the front seat of the
van. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there.

				KAY (CONT'D)
			(to Janus)
		We're gonna have a little chat with our
		friend here. You boys can hit the road ...
		and keep on protecting us from dangerous
		aliens.

Kay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise,
leaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway.

				AGENT JANUS
		You ever heard of Division 6?

				2ND INS AGENT
		There is no Division 6.

				3RD INS AGENT
		Who are those guys?

EXT. DESERT CLEARING - NIGHT

Kay and Dee lead their captive into a clearing in the desert brush. Dee
pulls an enormous handgun from a shoulder holster and stays a pace or two
off, covering him. Kay has an arm draped around the man's shoulders.

				KAY
		I think you jumped off the bus in the wrong
		part of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet
		dollars to pesos that you're not --

He pulls out a small laser device, which he ZIPS neatly down the front of
the man's clothes.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		-- from anywhere near here.

The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is
underneath -- A SCALY SPACE BASTARD, about four-and-a-half feet tall, with
a snouth, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at
the top of his head.

The only part of his camouflage not crumpled to the ground is the
humanesque "head," which he still lamely holds in one of his hands. It's
propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions
as he holds it.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Mikey?! When did they let you out of jail?

MIKEY replies -- an unfathomable combination of GRUNTS, SQUEAKS, and
saliva.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Political refugee. Right.

				DEE
		You know how many treaty articles you've
		just violated?

Mikey makes a lame SQUEAK.

				KAY
		One, my ass. Try seven.

				DEE
		From unauthorized immigration to failure to
		properly inoculate prior to landing.

				KAY
			(off Mikey's objections)
		Okay, that's enough. Hand me your head and
		put up your arms.

From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified GASP.

Kay and Dee both look over quickly. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall
stalk, whips around too. All three of them see AGENT JANUS, standing just
over the rise, staring in frozen amazement.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Ah, shit.

Agent Janus SCREAMS. Mikey rips free of the rest of the "Mexican"
disguise, knocks Dee out of the way, and takes off straight at Janus,
SCREECHING a horrible Space Bastard screech. Janus freezes, terrified.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Dee! Shoot him!

Dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell
out of his hand as he hit the ground.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Dee, for Christ's --

Mikey keeps moving, covering the last few yards to Janus quickly. He steps
on a rock, launches himself into the air, his dripping jaws cranked wide
open --

-- there is a SIZZLING sound, a brilliant white flash --

-- and Mikey ERUPTS in a geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the
ground, the trees, and Agent Janus' face. Behind where Mikey was, Kay
stands, smoking weapon in hand.

EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

On the road, the INS AGENTS pull their guns and run toward the rise.

EXT. DESERT CLEARING -- NIGHT

Kay has an arm around Janus, whom he is leading further into the clearing.
Janus is white, shaking, eyes like silver dollars.

				AGENT JANUS
		Th -- th -- th --

				KAY
			(helping)
		"That."

				AGENT JANUS
		That wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --

				KAY
		Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on
		you.

He takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the Agent's face. As he does,
Janus looks back to where Mikey blew up. Then at Kay. And then up at the
stars.

The other INS Agents burst over the rise, SHOUTING questions.

				KAY
		Okay, everybody, situation's under control,
		calm down. If you'll just give me your
		attention for a moment I'll tell you what
		happened.

From over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start
to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular
metallic device the size of a pocket recorder. He checks his watch,
figures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the
device up to "08."

				KAY (CONT'D)
		This is called a "neuralyzer." A gift from
		some friends from out of town. The red eye
		here isolates and measures the electronic
		impulses in your brain. More specifically,
		the ones for memory.

Behind him, six more MEN IN BLACK, all wearing black suits and sunglasses,
come over the hill. Kay barks a few orders to them.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please;
		holes at 40, 60, and 80.

				2ND INS AGENT
		What in the hell is going on?!

				KAY
		Exactly the right question. And the answer
		lies right -- here. Pay attention.

				JANUS
		Who are you, really?

				KAY
		Really? I'm just a figment of your
		imagination.

He holds up the neuralyzer. The Agents peer closely at it.  Kay reaches
into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses --

-- and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  A BLINDING FLASH a
tenth of a second long sears the Agents' eyeballs. They stare blankly.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		God, we're a gullible breed.

Behind him, TONGUES OF FIRE blast from a flame thrower held by one of the
Men in Black. Kay looks back at the INS Agents, who are just coming
around, as if awakening from a concussion.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be
		alive after a blast like that.

The Agents look around, confused.

				AGENT JANUS
		What -- blast?

Kay gestures behind him, where the Men in Black are now using fire
extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started.

				KAY
		Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need
		to exercise more caution before discharging
		your firearms.

He jabs a finger into Janus' chest.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Especially you.

Dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at
the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away
from the group and finds him. He sits down next to him.

				DEE
		I'm sorry. About...back there.

				KAY
		Happens.

				DEE
		Didn't used to.

He holds up his hands, which tremble with age.

				DEE (CONT'D)
		The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of
		me...

He looks up, at the million stars shining overhead.

				DEE (CONT'D)
		They're beautiful, aren't they?

				KAY
		What?

				DEE
		The stars. We never just -- look. Anymore.
			(back to Kay)
		I'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase.

Kay pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it.

				KAY
		No. You won't.

EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- SOUTHERN EXPOSURE -- NIGHT

A shot of the clock on the Station's stately southern exposure. WE PAN
DOWN TO...

A pair of feet running. They belong to a man we will know as the
PERPETRATOR. As we track with him, he SPEEDS UP and OUT OF FRAME.

A new set of feet come into frame. These belong to JAMES EDWARDS, a NYC
COP in undercover street clothes. In the BACKGROUND, about ten feet
behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up.

Edwards is a lot faster, though. He pulls out his badge that hangs from a
chain under his shirt.

				EDWARDS
		Stop! NYPD!

He continues running, out of frame, and we stay on one of the other COPS,
overweight, who gives up the chase and drops to his knees, heaving air.

				COP
		All yours, Edwards!

The Cop fumbles in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes.

TRACK WITH EDWARDS AND THE PERP

As they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low Forties.
The Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it's
a thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail, and drops to Forty-first
Street below.

EDWARDS is surprised by this maneuver, but doesn't waste a second. He,
too, hurdles the guard rail and lands on...

EXT. 41ST STREET AND PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

A DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown
traffic. The bus, of course, is completely filled with JAPANESE TOURISTS,
and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera.

EDWARDS pushes through the crowd...

				EDWARDS
		Grand Central Station off to your left,
		folks...

With the bus still moving, he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs
out through the side door.

He spots the Perp, sailing east on Forty-first Street.

				EDWARDS
		Dammit, man, you're making me sweat up my
		gear!

Edwards spots one of those New York Post delivery trucks, the kind with
the open back door, rumbling by.  He runs and jumps into the back.

EXT. FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT

THE PERP, meanwhile, is running at top speed, when Edwards glides into
frame, leaning off the back of the truck.

				EDWARDS
		Yo, man, your luck just ran out.

He leaps from the back of the moving truck and tackles the Perp.

The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.

				PERP
		He's coming! He's coming!

				EDWARDS
		And when he gets here, I'll kick his ass
		too.

Edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the Perp blinks. Nothing
unusual about that, but then another set of translucent, milky white
eyelids, underneath his regular eyelids, blinks also.

Edwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the Perp needs to
pull out...

His WEAPON, which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen. Reacting
quickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp's hand.

THE WEAPON smashes into the stone wall surrounding Central Park and
SHATTERS into a million pieces.

				EDWARDS
		What the...

WHOMP! The Perp kicks him in the nuts, then scrambles to his feet and
takes off again. Edwards staggers after him, in pain.

The Perp leaps over a moving car, towards the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM. Edwards
tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. After it passes, the
Perp is gone.

EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- NIGHT

Edwards runs over to the Museum, leans over the wall that surrounds it,
and in the next instant...

The Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of
the Guggenheim. He scrambles up and over the ledge.

Edward reacts. He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open and
runs inside.

He runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim.

EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- ROOF -- NIGHT

On the roof, the PERP reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and CRUNCHES
to the gravel surface. He leaps to his feet and races over to a door. It's
locked.

He tugs on another. It's locked too. He pulls on a third. It swings open --

-- revealing EDWARDS on the other side, breathing hard. He aims his weapon
at the Perp.

				EDWARDS
		Wassup?

The Perp SCREAMS inhumanly and panics. He backpedals, toward the edge of
the roof.

				PERP
		He's coming! He's coming because I failed,
		and now he'll kill me too!

				EDWARDS
		Stop!

				PERP
		You don't understand. Your world is gonna
		end.

But the Perp has backed right into the edge of the roof, and now he starts
to fall over. The Perp blinks.

				EDWARDS
		What are you?!

The Perp looks down. He decides.

-- and he falls, SCREAMING, to his death.

								CUT TO:

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT

EDWARDS sits on one side of the table, a POLICE INSPECTOR and a UNIFORMED
SERGEANT (the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier), sit
across from him.

				INSPECTOR
		Perpetrator then blinked two sets of
		eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?

				EDWARDS
		No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then
		again with another completely different set.

				SERGEANT
		Sort of a low beam, high beam.

				INSPECTOR
		Was that before or after he drew the weapon
		which you claim evaporated into a million
		pieces?

				EDWARDS
		After, sir.

				INSPECTOR
		And why do you suppose none of the other
		officers saw either of these two events?

				EDWARDS
		'Cause some of the other officers are a
		little soggy in the midsection. And they
		couldn't keep up, sir.

				SERGEANT
		Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I
		am --

				EDWARDS
		What do you mean? I am half the man you are.

				SERGEANT
		What the hell is your problem?

				EDWARDS
		My problem is you being all up in my damn
		face all the time.

				SERGEANT
		I think he threw him off the roof. Ten
		minutes -- your best shot.

				INSPECTOR
			(cutting off the Sergeant)
		Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside.
		Now.

				EDWARDS
		You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you
		pudgy bastard.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT

A woman sneaks into the room. DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, thirtyish,
dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above
him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and
saw a spaceman (which she did).  She looks over her shoulder once, then
whispers to him.

				LAUREL
		Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I
		believe you. I opened him up. Find me at
		the morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I
		found.

				EDWARDS
		Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

				LAUREL
			(turning at the door)
		You have really pretty eyes.

She hurries to turn the corner, but is STOPPED by someone who remains just
offscreen.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Dr. Weaver, from the coroner's office?
		Working on the John Doe?

Edwards twists in his chair, to get a better look. All he sees is Laurel,
facing whoever it is in the hallway.

				LAUREL
		Yes. That's right.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Would you look right here, please.

The Someone says something else and Laurel steps forward, now also out of
Edwards's line of vision.

				LAUREL (O.S.)
		Look where?

Edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding FLASH
from the corridor. Really curious now, he starts to get up --

-- when KAY steps into the room and closes the door behind him. Edwards
rolls his eyes.

				KAY
		Some night, huh?

				EDWARDS
		Oh, yeah, some night.

He crosses to the door.

				KAY
		They were gills.

Edwards stops.

				KAY
		Not eyelids.

				EDWARDS
		Who are you?

				KAY
		Did he say anything to you?

				EDWARDS
			(scoffing)
		Yeah, sure. He said the world was coming to
		an end.

				KAY
		Did he say when?

				EDWARDS
		You're kidding, right?

				KAY
		Would you recognize his weapon if you saw
		it again?

				EDWARDS
		Absolutely.

				KAY
		Let's take a ride.

				EDWARDS
		Wait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.

				KAY
		It's all done.

At that point, the INSPECTOR sticks his head in, smiles and gives Edwards
the thumbs up.

				INSPECTOR
		Good work, Edwards.

Edwards looks at the Inspector, then at Kay. As they leave.

				KAY
		You ran that guy down on foot? That's tough.
		That's double tough.

								CUT TO:

INT. FORD LTD - A MOMENT LATER - DRIVING

In a plain, boxy Ford, Kay drives, silent. He raises his hand and nods to
a black MIB truck coming in the opposite direction.Edwards, in the
passenger seat, is still in his undercover outfit.

				EDWARDS
		So who you with?

Kay says nothing.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
		You got the plain clothes, the
		government-issued wheels. Secret Service?
		CIA?

Kay remains utterly silent.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
			(referring to the car)
		Yeah, well, whoever it is, you're short on
		funding.

				KAY
		Nothing is what it seems, kid.

				EDWARDS
		Oh, yeah, my bad '86 Ford LTD. That's a
		luxury ride. C'mon, who ya with?

Kay pulls the car to a stop.

				KAY
		I'm part of a secret organization that
		monitors and polices alien activity on earth.

Kay opens the door and gets out of the car. Edwards follows.

EXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

Edwards looks around. Sees they're standing in front of a PAWN SHOP.

				EDWARDS
		This is where we're going?

They get out of the car.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
		Jack Jeebs? Guy buys from chain snatchers.
		Doesn't even sell guns.

				KAY
		Really?

				EDWARDS
		All right, you think it's worth shaking him
		up, fine. I'll do my thing. Then I want some
		answers.

				KAY
		Do your "thing," kid.  Edwards goes inside.

INT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

JACK JEEBS is the sleazy, sarcastic proprietor of the Pawn Shop. He's not
easily intimidated.

				JEEBS
		Officer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how'd these
		get here? I thought I turned 'em in to the
		proper authorities.

He casually brushes some Rolexes off the counter.

				EDWARDS
		Way I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a
		little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.

				JEEBS
		Sure -- I'm a big crack dealer now. I just
		work here because I love the hours.

This pisses Edwards off. He grabs Jeebs by the collar.

				EDWARDS
			(getting angry)
		I'm talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech
		stuff.

				JEEBS
		C'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs.

At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming
over his face.

				JEEBS
		H-hiya Kay, how are you?

				KAY
		The imports, Jeebs. Now.

				JEEBS
		You know I got outta that business a long
		time ago, Kay.

				KAY
		Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you
		lie.

He pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs' forehead.

				JEEBS
		Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...

				KAY
		I'm going to count to three.

Edwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine.

				EDWARDS
		He'll do it, Jeebs.

				KAY
		One.

				EDWARDS
		I've seen him do it.

				KAY
		Two.

				EDWARDS
		Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's
		like this.

				JEEBS
		He's always crazy.
			(to Kay)
		Take a cruise. Get a massage --

				KAY
		Three.

KA-BOOM! Kay blows Jeebs' head off and Jeebs' body collapses to the floor.
Edwards is shocked.

Edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at Kay's head.

				EDWARDS
		Put down the gun and put your hands on the
		counter!

				KAY
		I warned him.

				EDWARDS
		Drop the weapon!

				KAY
		You warned him.

				EDWARDS
		You are under arrest. You have the right to
		remain silent.

				KAY
		Will you relax?

				JEEBS (O.S.)
			(irritated)
		Don't do that.

Edwards whirls around to see Jeebs' BODY, growing another head. Only takes
four or five seconds. Kay calmly shoves his gun up against Jeebs'
baby-soft new cheek.

				JEEBS (CONT'D)
		Do you know how much that hurts?

				KAY
		Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up
		another one.

Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which
promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with
junk --

-- but this is all alien junk. Weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly
weapons of all shapes and sizes.

				KAY
		Edwards?

Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the
weapons.

				EDWARDS
		Uh, this. This is what I saw.

Kay looks at Jeebs, pissed off.

				KAY
		You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity
		to an unlicensed cephlapoid.

				JEEBS
		He looked all right to me.

				KAY
		A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs.
		Who was the target?

				JEEBS
		I don't know.

Kay raises the weapon again, threatening.

				KAY
		Jeebs!

				JEEBS
		I don't know!

Kay lowers his gun, gestures to the shelf full of weapons.

				KAY
		This is all confiscated. All of it. I want
		you on the next transport off this rock. Or
		I'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.

Jeebs nods, point taken. Kay leaves.

				EDWARDS
		Yeah. I'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.

Shaken, Edwards follows.

EXT. PAWN SHOP -- NIGHT

Edwards staggers out of the shop, trying to get the day's events straight
in his head.

				EDWARDS
		The eyelids, fine ... and the jumping thing
		... and the gun ... okay, but the head?

				KAY
		Searching for a handle on the moment here?
		A place to file all this.

				EDWARDS
		See a head doesn't do that, it doesn't just
		grow back.
			(looking up)
		What's going on?

				KAY
		Can't help you, kid. Only comfort I can
		offer is that tomorrow, you won't remember
		a thing.

				EDWARDS
		Oh, no. This I'm gonna remember for a long,
		long time.

Kay pulls the neuralyzer from his pocket. He hesitates for the briefest of
moments -- as if this particular neuralyzation is different than all the
others.

Then he puts on his sunglasses.

				KAY
		Ever see one of these?

								CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

-- the flash dims on EDWARDS and KAY, sitting at a table in a Chinese
restaurant.

				KAY
			(finishing a joke)
		-- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know,
		but this one's eating my popcorn!

He busts out laughing. Edwards, across from him, is completely
disoriented. He looks down. There's a half-eaten order of broccoli beef
and several empty bottles of beer on the table in front of him.

				EDWARDS
		Huh?

Kay checks his watch.

				KAY
		Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.

				EDWARDS
		Where am I?

				KAY
		See what I mean about tequila? You're a
		bright young man, James. Just lay off the
		sauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m.
		sharp.

He turns and walks out. Edwards checks his watch. A WAITRESS appears.

				WAITRESS
		Another beer?

				EDWARDS
		Coffee. Please.

She walks off. Edwards looks at the table. There is a business card lying
next to his plate, on which Kay has handwritten "James D. Edwards,
Saturday, 9 a.m., 504 Battery Drive."

Edwards looks at it, puzzled. He turns the card over and looks at the
other side. There's not much there, no name, no phone or fax number, no
e-mail address. Just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card:

				MIB

								CUT TO:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

A lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate New York farm
country. Several lights are on and through a window we can see the
silhouette of a MAN sitting at the kitchen table, the silhouette of a
WOMAN hovering over him, bringing things to him.

The Man (EDGAR) waves his arms, ranting.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		I go out, I work my butt off to make a
		living, all I want is to come home to a
		nice clean house with a nice fat steak on
		the table, but instead I get this -- this
		-- I don't even know what you call this!

In the sky above, it's one of those brilliant star fields. But something
strange is happening with one of those stars -- it's getting bigger.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		I'll tell you what it looks like, it looks
		like poison. Don't you take that away, I'm
		eating that, damn it! It is poison, isn't
		it?!

No, that star isn't getting bigger, it's moving. Toward us. Fast. It goes
from a pinpoint to a dime, to a nickel, to a quarter, and works its way
into fruit metaphors.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		I swear to God, I would not be surprised if
		it was, the way you skulk around here like
		a dog been hit too much -- or ain't been
		hit enough, I can't make up my mind.

Okay, we're way past watermelon now, that thing is huge, and it's starting
to glow hot red as it enters the earth's atmosphere, headed straight
toward us, coming here, to Beatrice and Edgar's place.

The blazing fireball barrels through the sky, SNAPS off a couple trees --

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		You're useless, Beatrice! The only thing
		that pulls its weight around here is my
		goddamn truck!

-- and SLAMS right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. A
concussive BLAST follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		Stay here!

The silhouette of Edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws
it open. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty,
bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun. His mouth agape, he
walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck.
The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering
hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground.

				EDGAR
		Figures.

He walks to the truck and touches the door handle. Hot. Using his shirt
tail, he opens the door and peers down into the hole.

IN THE HOLE, he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few blinking lights.
Embedded into the ground is, indeed, a spaceship, maybe eight feet across.

BEATRICE calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully.

				BEATRICE
		What is it, Edgar?!

				EDGAR
			(turns to her)
		Get your big butt back in that house!

Beatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her. Edgar turns back
to the smoldering rock, raising his shotgun in defense. AN OTHERWORLDLY
VOICE comes from deep in the hole.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Place projectile weapon on ground.

Edgar staggers back a step, terrified. But then he regains himself, raises
the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole.

				EDGAR
		You can have my gun when you pry it from my
		cold, dead fingers!

There is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer. Finally, it
responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar's.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Your proposal is acceptable.

A long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and
pulls him down into the hole.

From deep in the hole, we hear a terrible RIPPING sound, like a bedsheet
being torn in half. There are some disgusting GUSHY sounds, then a moment
later, something flies out of the hole and FLOPS onto the ground next to
the truck.

It's Edgar. Well, sort of. His body parts still hang together -- face,
arms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now
he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the
prom.

The shotgun flies out and lands beside him.

								CUT TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears
from Edgar's diatribe. The door opens and EDGAR comes back into the
kitchen, seemingly fleshed out again, leaving the door hanging open behind
him. He carries the shotgun.

She looks up at him, anxious. But his face is a blank.

				BEATRICE
		What on earth was it?!

He looks at her strangely. When he speaks, his voice is different than
before. More refined.

				EDGAR
		Sugar.

Pause. She looks out the window, at the smoking truck.

				BEATRICE
		I've never seen sugar do that.

				EDGAR
		Give me sugar.

Puzzled, Beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar.
She holds it out to him.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		In water.

Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table. She dumps some of
the sugar into it.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		More.

She puts more, till the glass is brimming. She stirs it quickly with a
knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling.

Edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. Beatrice stares at Edgar, no
idea what to think. She notices something odd about the skin on his neck.

				BEATRICE
		Edgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just
		hanging off your bones!

Edgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. He
reaches up --

-- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, then tucks the
skin of his neck back into his shirt collar.  He looks at her.

				EDGAR
		That better?

Beatrice faints.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Stillness. Silence. A loud SCRAPING sound comes from the pit left by the
spaceship.

The nose of the ship itself rises up out of the pit, wavers, keeps moving,
and finally CRUNCHES to the ground outside the pit.

EDGAR climbs out of the pit, breathing heavily. He dusts himself off and
continues pushing the ship, along the ground, off into the darkness.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MIB BUILDING - DAY

The next morning. EDWARDS, holding the small MIB business card in his
hand, compares the address written down by Kay to the address on the
utterly nondescript building in front of him. It's seven stories high,
gray, windowless, perfectly square, squatting on a bridge over a road like
a fat guy on the john.
			   "504 Battery Drive."

INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY

EDWARDS steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre
room. One wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel
vent air intake. There is an elevator at the far end of the room and an
OLD SECURITY GUARD, the rent-a-cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding
metal chair halfway across.

Edwards walks across the room, his footsteps ECHOING. The Guard looks up.

				GUARD
		Help you?

				EDWARDS
		Maybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --

				GUARD
		Elevator. Push the "call" button.

And he goes back to his comic book. Edwards, maybe out of nothing more
than curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator.
As he draws close, the elevator doors WHOOSH open, expecting him.

INT. MIB BUILDING - ENTRANCE ELEVATOR - DAY

Edwards steps inside and turns around. The doors close. He pushes the
"call" button and waits, but the elevator doesn't move. Instead, doors on
the other side of the elevator slide open silently behind him. Edwards
waits, unaware.

From behind him, somebody clears their throat. Edwards turns around, and
finds himself standing in --

INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

This back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway.
Standing at the front of the room is ZED, a wire-haired career G-man, an
old school bureaucrat, wearing the exact same kind of suit Kay had on last
night. SIX OTHER HOT RECRUITS sit in egg-shaped chairs, staring at
Edwards.

One chair is empty.

				ZED
		You're late. Sit down.

Edwards takes the remaining chair. The elevator doors slide shut. Zed
continues addressing the Recruits.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		My name is Zed. You're all here because
		you're the best of the best. Marines, Navy
		SEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.

They all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly. He gives it back.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		And we're looking for one of you. Just one.
		What will follow is a series of simple
		tests designed to quantify motor skills,
		hand-eye coordination, concentration,
		stamina -- I see we have a question.

Edwards's hand is, indeed, up.

				EDWARDS
		Why, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one
		really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are
		we doing this?

Silence. Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand. Zed calls
on him.

				ZED
		Son?

				AMBITIOUS RECRUIT
			(loud and formal)
		Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate with
		honors. We're here because you're looking
		for the best of the best of the best, sir!

Edwards tries to stifle a laugh, but can't.

				ZED
		What's so funny, Edwards?

				EDWARDS
		I -- I don't know, sir. This guy. "Best of
		the best of the best of the best of the --"
			(realizing nobody is with
			him on this)
		It just struck me as --
			(totally serious)
		Humorous. Sir.

Short pause. Then Zed continues.

				ZED
		Okay. Let's get going.

INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER - DAY

The recruits scribble away at the written test. It's a thick document --
reasoning skills, general knowledge, diagrams.  The RECRUITS seem to be
really powering through it, filling in answer after answer.

But no desks have been provided for them, and they're all still in their
chairs, writing uncomfortably on their thighs or knees.

EDWARDS is really struggling. He writes two words on one answer, then
decides to erase it. The lack of a writing surface is driving him crazy;
his pencil even TEARS through the page.

He looks up. In the middle of the tile floor, there is an unused table.
Edwards gets up, goes to it, grabs hold --

-- and drags it, SCREECHING DEAFENINGLY, back to his chair. Everybody
looks up, wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room.

Edwards sits back down, now writing on the table.  That's better.

Zed raises an eyebrow. He stares at Edwards, then looks up, toward a
smoked glass window. Behind the dark glass, a FIGURE stands, staring,
unemotional.

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING -- SHOOTING GALLERY -- DAY

SEVEN WEAPONS rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty,
triangular room. The SEVEN RECRUITS stand in front of the table.

There's an odd moment -- where everyone sort of looks around: at each
other, at the blank walls...

				EDWARDS
		Anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're
		doing here?

				MARINE
			(clipped, unquestioning)
		Looking for the best of the best of the best.

				EDWARDS
			(can't help but smile)
		Well, yeah, I know, but...

And then .. suddenly --

The two far walls pull apart. The whole room pulsates and the air is
suddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of stroboscopic images, both
human and alien. Everywhere is color, light and movement -- a holographic
mass of strange shapes and characters moving simultaneously.

The Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim. SIX
SHOTS are fired at once. And then, a second later, a SEVENTH SHOT is
fired. Everyone sort of looks at Edwards, who puts his gun down last.

There's an awkward silence. Then the door opens. Light pours in, and ZED
with it. Even the highly competitive cadets can't help but feel some
sympathy as Zed walks straight to Edwards.

				ZED
		The hell happened?

				EDWARDS
		Hesitated, sir.

Zed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of
creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in
its chest. Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a
large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back
corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty
eight-year-old girl.

				ZED
		May I ask why you felt little Tiffany
		deserved to die?

				EDWARDS
		She was the only one who actually seemed
		dangerous. At the time.

				ZED
		And how did you come to that conclusion?

				EDWARDS
		Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can
		think with a hook for a head. Answer; it's
		not his head. His head is that butt-ugly
		bean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you
		look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not
		snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues
		in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow,
		the girl's books were way too advanced for
		an eight-year-old's. And besides, from
		where I'm looking, she was the only one who
		appeared to have a motive. And I don't
		appreciate your jumping down my throat about
		it.

Sideways glances from the other recruits. Zed sighs.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
		Or, uh -- do I owe her an apology?

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING - OBSERVATION ROOM/INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

ZED and KAY stand behind smoked glass, staring at the RECRUITS, who are
still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision.

				ZED
		He's got a real problem with authority.

				KAY
		So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed.
		On foot. Tenacity. That I can use.

				ZED
		I hope you know what you're doing.

Zed turns and walks away. Kay stares through the glass, at EDWARDS, who
stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group.

Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and
into the shooting gallery. As he talks, Kay turns and walks off.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		Congratulations, you're everything we've
		come to expect from years of government
		training. Now, if you'll just follow me, we
		have one more test to administer, an eye
		exam.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

The RECRUITS follow ZED out of the shooting gallery and into a long
hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. EDWARDS is the last one out of
the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway.

KAY is outside the door, waiting for him. Edwards recognizes him from last
night.

				EDWARDS
		You! Hey, what's goin' on?

The other recruits continue down the hall with Zed. Kay doesn't answer,
just gestures to Edwards to follow him down the hall, which he does.

				KAY
		Back in the mid-fifties, the government
		started a little underfunded agency with
		the simple and laughable purpose of making
		contact with a race not of this planet.

As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have
been herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from
his pocket.

				ZED
		Now, if you'll look directly at the end of
		this device.

He holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare
obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses.

Edwards stares, fascinated, but Kay's hand reaches in and yanks him away,
just as Zed's neuralyzer FLASHES WHITE.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

As KAY leads EDWARDS down an impossibly long corridor, he hands him a file
folder stuffed thick with eight by ten photographs.

He hands Jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine MEN in plain black
suits standing around a fifties-style office with metal desks and
fluorescent lights. DEE and ZED are there, much younger.

				KAY
		Everybody thought the agency was a joke.
		Except the aliens. They made contact on
		March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.

Another photograph, a grainy black and white image of two ships hovering
in the night sky -- classic flying saucer shapes.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		There were nine of us that night. Seven
		agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor
		kid who got lost on the wrong back road.

Yet another photograph, this one showing a young KAY, in a shirt and tie,
holding a bouquet of flowers, staring at the open door of the landed
flying saucer. ALIEN SHAPES are visible within.

				EDWARDS
		You brought the aliens flowers?

Kay steers Edwards to the right, down another corridor, just as long as
the first.

				KAY
		They were intergalactic refugees with a
		simple request. Let us use the earth as an
		apolitical zone for people without a
		planet.  Ever see "Casablanca?" Same thing,
		no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all
		evidence of their landing.

Another picture, this one of the 1964 World's Fair grounds, still under
construction. Giant models of rockets mark the Fair's theme of space
travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the
flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.

				EDWARDS
		The 1964 World's Fair was a coverup?

				KAY
		Why else would we hold it in Queens?
			(another hallway)
		Now left. More nonhumans arrive every year.
		They live among us, in secret.

				EDWARDS
		I see. Not to change the subject, but when
		was your last cat-scan?

				KAY
		Every six months; it's company policy.

				EDWARDS
		Well, thanks for the very amusing morning,
		but I'm hopin' you'll show me where I came
		in?  'Cause this is where I go out.

They have stopped next to an unmarked door. Kay throws it open and steps
inside.

				KAY
		Yeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee
		while we're right here.

As Kay walks into the kitchenette, Edwards' jaw drops, his eyes widen, and
he stares in wonderment --

-- at THREE WORM-LIKE ALIENS standing around a water cooler. Tall,
impossibly thin, most certainly not from New York, the aliens hold an
animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of
Esperanto and microphone feedback.

				KAY (CONT'D)
			(to the aliens)
		Don't tell me we've only got that powdered
		shit for cream again?

One of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to
the counter.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Oh.

He finds the cream sitting out on the counter where the alien indicated,
dumps some in his coffee, and comes back outside, closing the door behind
him. He reaches up and gently pushes Edwards' jaw up, closing his mouth.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		For future reference, this is a better look
		for you.

								CUT TO:

EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY

EDWARDS, thrown for a major loop, sits like a zombie alongside KAY on a
bench in Battery Park. Kay drinks his coffee while they talk.

				KAY
		Any given time, around fifteen hundred
		landed aliens are on the planet, the
		majority right here in Manhattan. Most
		aliens are decent enough, just trying to
		make a living.

				EDWARDS
		Cab drivers?

				KAY
		Not as many as you'd think. Humans, for the
		most part, don't have a clue. Don't want
		one, either. They're happy. They think
		they've got a pretty good bead on things.

				EDWARDS
		Why the big secret? People are smart, they
		can handle it.

				KAY
		A person is smart. People are dumb.
		Everything they've ever "known" has been
		proven to be wrong. A thousand years ago
		everybody knew as a fact, that the earth
		was the center of the universe. Five
		hundred years ago, they knew it was flat.
		Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans
		were alone on it. Imagine what you'll know
		tomorrow.

				EDWARDS
		So what's the catch?

				KAY
		What you'll gain in perspective, you'll
		lose in ways you're too young to comprehend.
		You give up everything. Sever every human
		contact. No one will know you exist. Ever.

				EDWARDS
		Nobody?

				KAY
		You're not even allowed a favorite shirt.
		There.  That's the speech I never heard.
		That's the choice I never got.

				EDWARDS
		Hold up. You track me down, put me through
		those stupid-ass tests, now you're trying
		to talk me out of it. I don't get it.

				KAY
		You got 'til sun-up.

				EDWARDS
		Is it worth it?

				KAY
		You find out, you let me know.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BATTERY PARK - DUSK

Almost nighttime now, and the park is empty. EDWARDS is still on the
bench. And still thinking. Above him, the stars are coming out.

Slowly, he looks up, into the vastness of the heavens.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GARAGE - DAY

The next morning. A door opens on a garage and an ORKIN MAN steps inside,
carrying a tank of toxic gas. The morning light spills on an abundance of
spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them
have moved in and taken over this dusty place.

The Orkin Man sighs and sets down his tank.

				ORKIN MAN
		Well, well, well. Movin' right in, are we?
		Think we own the place?

He unfurls a hose from the side of the tank.

				ORKIN MAN (CONT'D)
		Got a little eviction notice for you, boys.

He raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the
tank. LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Just what exactly do you think you're doing?

The Orkin Man turns around. EDGAR stands in the doorway to the garage,
staring at him disdainfully.

				ORKIN MAN
			(shrugs)
		Takin' care of your pest problem.

				EDGAR
		"Pest" problem? "Pest?"

				ORKIN MAN
		Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation.

Edgar advances on him, slowly.

				EDGAR
		You know, I have noticed an infestation
		here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing
		but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious
		pond scum. So convinced of their own
		superiority as they scurry about their
		short, pointless lives.

				ORKIN MAN
		Well -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of
		'em?

				EDGAR
		In the worst way.

Edgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the Orkin Man's face with
one hand --

-- and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other.

THE ORKIN MAN'S CAR KEYS drop to the garage floor, and Edgar picks them
up.

EXT. GARAGE - DAY

A six-by-ten sheet of plywood THUDS to the driveway outside the garage.
EDGAR raises one end of it so it's hanging off the back end of the Orkin
man's van -- now it's a ramp.

He walks off and we hear that familiar SCRAPING sound again. Edgar,
GRUNTING with the effort, slowly pushes his spaceship up the ramp and into
the back of the Orkin truck.

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY

EDWARDS stands in the middle of the tunnel vent room, the same one he
first came into yesterday. The elevator doors open and KAY, obviously
summoned by the OLD SECURITY GUARD, stands waiting for him.

				EDWARDS
		One thing you gotta know right now.

Edwards walks briskly forward and gets in the elevator with Kay.

INT. MIB BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

Inside the elevator, the doors WHOOSH shut, KAY turns a key in a certain
floor number, and the descent begins. EDWARDS continues.

				EDWARDS
		All right. I'm in because there's some
		next-level shit going on around here, and
		I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there
		are a couple of things we need to get
		straight. You chose me 'cause you recognize
		the skills. So as of now you can cease with
		all of that calling me "son" or "kid" or
		"sport." Cool?

				KAY
		Cool, slick. Now about those skills of yours,

The elevator doors --

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

-- slide open on Men in Black headquarters.

				KAY
		As of this moment, they don't mean much.

It's unlike anything we've ever seen -- huge, multileveled, of sixties
design, polished steel and glass. The workplaces are sleek and
uncluttered, manned by both HUMANS and ALIENS. Most of the Aliens stay in
the background, like the UPSIDE-DOWN GUY who walks on the ceiling,
shuffling papers.

KAY and EDWARDS step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out
over the whole place.

Kay leads him down into the complex. First, they walk past a sort of
passport control center, where a human BUREAUCRAT at a desk is checking
the documents of a line of ALIENS who've just arrived. There are a dozen
bizarre life forms in that line, CHATTING in half a dozen different alien
tongues.

Edwards slows as they pass, listening to the PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER as
he addresses an ARQUILLIAN, a large, humanoid visitor.

				PASSPORT OFFICER
		Purpose of trip?

				ARQUILLIAN
		Diplomatic mission.

				PASSPORT OFFICER
		Duration of stay?

				ARQUILLIAN
		Lunch.

				PASSPORT OFFICER
		Carrying any fruits or vegetables?

Edwards just stares, fascinated, but Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries
him along.

				KAY
		Let's go. He's a little...grouchy.

Kay moves him into the central hall.

				KAY
		A couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year
		flight would get on anybody's nerves.

				EDWARDS
		What branch of the government do we report
		to?

				KAY
		None. They started asking too many questions.

				EDWARDS
		So who pays for all this?

				KAY
		Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we
		confiscated from our out-of-state visitors.
		Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.

AT A STORAGE CAGE, Kay turns a key in the lock of a caged-in area and
throws the door open. Inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking
devices stacked on shelves and tabletops.

				KAY
			(picking something up)
		Here. A new recording device to replace
		CD's.  So now I gotta buy the White Album
		again?
			(something else)
		This is amusing. Universal translator.

He holds up a cylindrical metal tube and a small wire clip that looks like
a lapel microphone.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		We're not supposed to have it. I'll tell
		you why.  Human thought is so primitive
		it's considered an infectious disease.
		Makes you proud, doesn't it?

Edwards picks up a small yellow ball from one of the shelves.

				EDWARDS
		What's this?

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Don't touch that!

THE BALL ZINGS OUT OF EDWARDS' HANDS -- it flies out into the main complex
-- hits the ceiling and ricochets around the room, faster than the eye can
follow --

VARIOUS SHOTS OF HUMANS AND ALIENS ducking, dodging, and jumping out of
its way.

ON KAY as he calmly, a little wearily, slips an odd-looking metal glove
over his right hand...

He raises his hand and the yellow ball zings into it -- Kay catches the
ball, calmly.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Caused the '77 New York blackout. Practical
		joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it
		was funny as hell.

They leave the room.

				EDWARDS
		Sorry!

ON THE MAIN FLOOR, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant
screen on the far wall.

				KAY
		Observation, the heart of our little
		endeavor.

The screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights
blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		This map shows the location of every
		registered alien on earth at any given
		time. Some of them we keep under constant
		surveillance.

He hits a button on the console and the map is replaced by hundreds of
boxes, each with smaller video images.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Everyone on these screens is an alien. In
		public -- normal. In private -- you'll get
		the idea.

ON THE SCREENS, we see live images of aliens. Aliens who look alien are in
spots where they can't be seen.  Aliens who look human are functioning
right out in public -- including SAM DONALDSON. MICHAEL JACKSON. And TONY
ROBBINS.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Meet the twins.

Kay gestures to two small, bony CREATURES with eight arms each and a
single eye growing out of a central stalk in their heads. They turn around
and wave two or three arms each.

				EDWARDS
		I gotta be honest about something.

				KAY
		It makes no sense?

				EDWARDS
		It makes perfect sense. When I was a third
		grader in Philadelphia, they told me I was
		crazy 'cause I swore that our teacher was
		from, like, Venus or something.

				KAY
		Mrs. Edelson.

Edwards, stunned, looks at Kay as 4-Eyes boots her onto the screen: Mean
face, cat glasses. Bony fingers. Extremely well-hidden tail.

				KAY
		Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.

With their remaining arms, they punch button after button on the enormous
console. ZED, who was standing up close to the screen, walks over to
Edwards, sizing him up.

				ZED
		What's your jacket size, Edwards?

				EDWARDS
		Uh -- forty regular.

				ZED
		Then let's put it on.

				EDWARDS
		Put what on?

				ZED
		The last suit you'll ever wear.

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Like the rest of the place, the MIB locker room is all white. White walls,
white floor, white ceiling, white lockers. ZED'S VOICE comes over:

				ZED (O.S.)
		From now on, you'll dress only in attire
		specially sanctioned by MIB Special
		Services.

EDWARDS reaches out and opens a white locker, revealing a BLACK SUIT hung
from a hanger in the middle. Above it, on the shelf, a BLACK HAT and a
pair of BLACK SUNGLASSES. On the bottom, a pair of SHINY BLACK SHOES.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

KAY is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards's birth certificate,
driver's license, social security card, library card, everything. ZED'S
VOICE continues:

				ZED (O.S.)
		You'll conform to the identity we give you,
		eat where we tell you, live where we tell
		you, get approval for any expenditure over
		a hundred dollars.

INT. MIB BUILDING LASER BOOTH - DAY

EDWARDS stands in a cramped white booth.

He holds both his hands on a TEN-FINGERED KEYPAD, pressing down hard. The
pad glows red, a SEARING sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as
more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints.

				ZED (O.S.)
		You will have no identifying marks of any
		kind.  You will not stand out in any way.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

One by one, KAY deletes Edwards's identity cards.

On the computer screen is Edwards' full name -- JAMES DARREL EDWARDS III.
Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to
left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name.

				ZED (O.S.)
		Your entire image is carefully crafted to
		leave no lasting memory whatsoever with
		anyone you encounter.

INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Pants come off the hanger. The white shirt is removed.

More letters are eliminated from his name. It reads "JAMES DARREL ED..."
then "JAMES DARR..."

				ZED (O.S.)
		You're a rumor, recognizable only as deja
		vu and dismissed just as quickly. You don't
		exist; you were never even born.

The coat is removed. The hat comes off the shelf.

				ZED (O.S.)
		Anonymity is your name. Silence your native
		tongue.

"JAMES..." "JAM..."

				ZED (O.S.)
		You are no longer part of "the system."
		We're above the system. Over it. Beyond it.

Feet slip into black shoes. A belt is buckled. A tie pushed up.

				ZED (O.S.)
		We're "them." We're "they."

On screen, all that's left is the letter "J."

As the coat is buttoned, we notice the sleeve. Monogrammed on the cuff is,
simply, the letter "J."

				ZED (O.S.)
		We are the Men in Black.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, JAMES D EDWARDS
III -- or, rather, JAY -- steps into the doorway from the locker room. He
reaches into his pocket, takes out the sunglasses, and looks at KAY.

				JAY
		The difference between you and me?

He slips on the sunglasses.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		I make this look good.

								CUT TO:

EXT. NEW JERSEY - EARLY MORNING

We are looking at a telephoto shot of Manhattan in all its splendor.

We see the Orkin van topping a hill, heading towards Manhattan.

INT. MIB BUILDING - ZED'S OFFICE - DAY

Zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of
MIB headquarters. JAY and KAY sit across the desk from Zed. There are five
video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another
Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock
ticking in a corner of the image.

While Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk.

				ZED
		Okay, let's see.
			(to one of the monitors)
		Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of
		Sinalee touching down in the forest outside
		Portland tonight. I'm pulling you down from
		Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet.

BEE, an agent on one of the monitors, nods.

				BEE
		Humanoid?

				ZED
		You wish. Bring a sponge.
			(going through memos)
		What else -- everybody, we gotta keep
		Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system,
		he's scaring the rats. And Bobo the Squat
		wants to reveal himself on "Unsolved
		Mysteries." Bee, make sure he doesn't.

He turns a page, coming across a red memo.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		Red-letter from last night -- we had an
		un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate
		New York farm country. Keep your ears open
		for this one, Kay, we're not hosting a
		galactic kegger down here.

Next to him, his computer screen BEEPS importantly.  Zed looks over at it.

				ZED
		Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer.

				KAY
			(to Jay)
		Landed alien out of zone.
			(to Zed)
		Who is it?

				ZED
		Redgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan
		but he's way out of town right now, stuck in
		traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why
		don't you take Jay? This is a good one for
		him to warm up on.

EXT. MIB BUILDING - BATTERY PARK - DAY

JAY and KAY come out the front of MIB headquarters.

				JAY
		Yo, wussup with Zed?
			(imitating him)
		"Go get em, tiger. We're not hosting an
		intergalactic kegger..."

				KAY
		Zed was saving the world before you were
		born, son. Show some respect.

An MIB MECHANIC pulls up in Kay's black LTD and hops out, leaving the door
open. Jay sizes up the car.

				JAY
		We got the use of unlimited technology from
		the entire universe and we cruise around in
		this?

Kay glares at Jay. He's getting annoyed.

INT. MIB LTD - DAY

They get in and slam the doors. Kay starts the car and the engine HUMS
quietly.

				KAY
		Seat belt.

				JAY
		You know, ya'll gotta learn how to talk to
		people. You could be a little kinder and
		gentler.

Kay grits his teeth.

				KAY
		Buckle up, please.

				JAY
		Now did that hurt?

Kay shifts the car into reverse. The awesome power of the car kicks in and
Jay sails forward, THWACKING into the dash. Kay shifts into forward and
taps the gas, SLAMMING Jay back into his seat.

				KAY
		Makin' fun of my ride...

A LIGHTED PANEL rotates into place between the two front seats.  Jay's
hand falls by accident on a flashing red button in the panel.

				KAY
		Jay. The button?

				JAY
		Yeah?

				KAY
		Never push the button, Jay.

Jay jerks his hand away.

								CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY

The LTD is now stopped by the side of the road, dust swirling around it.
Ahead of it, another car has pulled over. KAY gets out, JAY follows a
moment later, shaky-legged. Kay walks up to the window of the car they've
stopped. The DRIVER, a guy in his mid-thirties with a WIFE in her
mid-thirties, rolls the window down.

				KAY
		License and registration, please.

The Driver hands over some documents. Kay flips through them.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Other license and registration, please.

The guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. Jay peers over
Kay's shoulder.

The photographs on the "RESIDENT ALIEN ID"cards are of two
friendly-looking reptile types, husband and wife, smiling atthe camera,
their long, skinny tongues dangling in a friendly sort of way.

Kay hands them back.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Your resident card has you restricted to
		the five boroughs only. Where do you think
		you're going?

				REDGICK
		It's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look!

Kay leans down and looks in the window. MRS. REDGICK is in front, MOANING
in pain, holding her swollen belly. Kay straightens up, fast.

				KAY
		Oh God. How soon?

Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS in pain. Real soon. For the first time since we've
seen him, Kay is nervous.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Okay. All right. No big deal.
			(to Jay)
		You handle it.

				JAY
		Me?

				KAY
		Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.

Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS again. Redgick gets out of the car, worried.

				REDGICK
		Are you sure he knows what he's doing?

				KAY
		Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time.
		C'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask
		you something.

Kay gives Jay a supportive SLAP on the back and leads Redgick away, to the
rear of the car. Jay stays in the background and opens the rear door,
tentatively. He leans down, into the car.

				JAY
		Oh God! I see it I see it I see it!

A few yards from the car, Kay turns Redgick to face him.

				KAY
		Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th.
		You were headed out of town.

				REDGICK
		Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone.

Suddenly a TENTACLE whips out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, CRACKS the
whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold.

				JAY
		Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see
		that?!

				KAY
			(still to Redgick)
		So? Who you meeting?

				REDGICK
		Well, it's -- a ship.

				KAY
		Really? I didn't see a departure clearance
		for today.

				REDGICK
		You didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.

Now a SECOND TENTACLE whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and
pulls tight. He GASPS, choking.

				JAY
		Guys -- guys --

				KAY
		Doin' fine, Ace.
			(back to Redgick)
		What kind of emergency? What's the rush to
		get off the planet all of a sudden?

				JAY
			(choking to death)
		Help?! HELP! Hello?!

He starts tugging for all he's worth, but the fight is sort of going
against him, as the tentacles pull him in even harder than he tries to
pull the baby out.

				REDGICK
		We just don't like the neighborhood anymore.
		Some of the -- new arrivals.

Redgick looks at Kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes
away.

				KAY
		What new arrivals? This have anything to do
		with the crasher from last night?

				JAY
			(Screaming)
		Can you guys do this later?!

But in that moment, Jay finally gets a foot up on the door frame, acquires
leverage, and RIPS the baby free. He falls, flat on his back in the dirt,
the multi-tentacled lizardlike baby resting squarely on his chest.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Oh -- oh -- oh -- man.

Kay turns and claps Redgick on the back.

				KAY
		Congratulations! It's a lizard.

Jay looks down at the creature COOING and nestling on his chest.

				JAY
			(misty)
		Hey, you know, it is sorta --

It vomits on him.

								CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MIB LTD - DAY

Back in the car, JAY wipes the last of the puke off his suit while KAY
starts up the car.

				KAY
		Anything about that seem unusual to you?

Jay just looks at him, very Jack Benny.

				JAY
		Pick.

				KAY
		What kind of "new arrival" would scare
		Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump
		with a newborn?
			(thinks)
		Let's check the hot sheets.

EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

CLOSE ON on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them.
There are headlines like "POPE A FATHER!"and "TOP DOCTORS BAFFLED -- BABY
BORN PREGNANT!" and "MAN EATS OWN HOUSE!" (the subhead on that one is "And
That's Just the Appetizer, Says Neighbor.")

KAY and JAY are at a downtown newsstand. Kay is furiously searching
through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed.

				JAY
		These are the hot sheets?

Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy
a buck.

				KAY
		Best damn investigative reporting on the
		planet.  But hey, go ahead, read the New
		York Times if you want. They get lucky
		sometimes.

				JAY
		You're actually looking for tips in a
		supermarket tabloid?

				KAY
		Not looking for. Found.

He SMACKS the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned
open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for
the Second Coming:

			     Farm wife says
		     "ALIEN STOLE MY HUSBAND'S SKIN!"

								CUT TO:

EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - ORKIN VAN - DAY

A flap of skin, now getting gray and crusty with age, hangs off EDGAR's
neck as he sits in the front of his Orkin van. He sucks as hard as he
possibly can on a straw stuck into a Jolt Cola ("Double the Sugar! Triple
the Caffeine!"), one of a six-pack that sits on the dashboard.

Across the street, Edgar sees a short, older man come out of one of the
jewelry shops on Thirty-Fifth Street. Edgar drops the soda and stares.

The Older Man (ROSENBERG), is carrying a cat and an ornate rosewood
jewelry box. Carefully, he sets the box down and lovingly places the cat
on top of it while he locks all five locks on the door to his distinctive
shop.

That finished, he picks up the cat, then the box, then waddles off down
the street, one under each arm.

Edgar drops the truck into gear and follows him, slowly, trolling along
behind him.

ON THE STREET, Rosenberg walks happily along, HUMMING to himself. He gives
his cat a little peck. As he rounds a corner, we recognize the tune he's
humming -- "I've Got the Whole World In My Hands."

The Orkin van rounds the corner behind him. Following.

								CUT TO:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

The LTD pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway that leads to
Beatrice's farmhouse, where the alien ship landed. The wrecked pickup
truck is still there. JAY and KAY get out, very undercover cop. Jay starts
up the driveway.

				KAY
		Not so fast. Walk up slow.

				JAY
		Why?

				KAY
		Part of the routine. Makes it look like
		we're sizing up the situation. Gives her
		time to get the wrong impression.

BEATRICE appears in the door to the house, curious.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Puts some fear into her. Makes things go
		smoother.

Beatrice calls to them.

				BEATRICE
		Can I help you gentlemen?

Beatrice looks much better than the last time we saw her -- more nicely
dressed, a touch of makeup, a smile on her face.

Kay pulls a black card from his wallet and extends it to her as she draws
close. As she reaches for it, the card reforms into an FBI badge.

				KAY
		How do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent
		Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a
		few questions about your visitor.

				BEATRICE
		Are you here to make fun of me too?

				KAY
		No ma'am. We at the FBI don't have a sense
		of humor that we're aware of. Mind if we
		come in?

				BEATRICE
		Sure. Lemonade?

								CUT TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

In the living room, KAY sips some of her lemonade and winces. JAY moves
through the room, checking it out as BEATRICE tells her story.

				BEATRICE
		And they said to me, "If he was murdered,
		how could he walk back in the house?" And I
		must admit, I was a little stumped by that
		one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him.
		It was more like something else that was
		wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.

A little GIGGLE escapes her at the thought. Jay, over by a bookcase,
notices a framed PHOTO OF EDGAR, kneeling in the woods, proudly about to
skin a deer.

				JAY
		Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an
		alien...

				BEATRICE
		Sorry?

				KAY
		Go on.

				BEATRICE
		Anyway, when I came to, he was gone.

				KAY
		Did he say anything?

				BEATRICE
		Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I
		remember.

				KAY
		Sugar water.

				JAY
		Did you taste her lemonade?

Kay nods, puts on his sunglasses. Takes out another pair, hands them to
Jay.

Kay draws his neuralyzer. FLASH! Beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead
as if hypnotized. Kay takes Jay's glasses off and hands them back to him.

				KAY
		Ray Bans.
			(pulling off Jay's
			sunglasses)
		Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the
		flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a
		UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was
		trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted
		the light from Venus --

				JAY
		Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you
		give her a new one?

				KAY
		Standard issue neuralyzer.

				JAY
		And that's the best you can come up with?

				KAY
		On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar
		ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at
		your mother's for a few days and get over
		it. Decide you're better off.

				JAY
			(butting in)
		Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never
		appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked
		him out, and now that he's gone, you ought
		to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a
		decorator or something...

								CUT TO:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

KAY is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating. He holds a pocket
spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth.  The analyzer shifts
colors.  Red. Then Yellow.

				JAY
			(from up outside the hole)
		Hey. Kay...when am I gonna get one of those
		memory things?

The spectral analyzer turns blue.

				KAY
		When you're ready.
			(re: analyzer)
		Please -- not green.

Purple. And then green.

Kay closes his eyes and sits back, leaning against the dirt. Above him,
JAY leans over, staring down. Kay looks up at him.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Do you know what alien life form leaves a
		green spectral trail?

				JAY
		Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the
		question on Final Jeopardy last night.

AT THE CAR, Kay snatches up the radio handset and keys the microphone.

				KAY
			(softly, into mic)
		Zed, we have a bug.

He turns off the radio and sighs. Jay stands next to him.

				JAY
		I'm gonna jump way past you and just guess
		that this is bad. Right?

				KAY
		Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They
		consume, infest and destroy. They live off
		the death and decay of other species.

				JAY
		So basically you have a racial problem with
		all insect-based life forms?

				KAY
		Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach
		five times smarter than Albert Einstein,
		four times stronger than an ox, nine times
		meaner than hell, strutting his stuff
		around Manhattan Island in his brand new
		Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?

				JAY
		What do we do?

				KAY
		With a bug in town? Watch the morgues.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

ROSENBERG, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing
district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. He heads into
Leshko's, a Russian diner.

A moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street.

INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

ROSENBERG comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative
darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an
enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid
fifties.

Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. The
man (an ARQUILLIAN, and if we're eagle-eyed, we recognize him as the alien
on a "diplomatic mission" from passport control) rises from his chair. He
steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table.
Immediately, ROSENBERG'S CAT jumps on top of it.

Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment --

-- and then embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to
it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and
both seemed choked with emotion.

Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre
alien tongue, which is subtitled. Rosenberg wipes away tears.

				ROSENBERG
		Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this
		planet are terrible.

				ARQUILLIAN
		Your majesty, you are in grave danger.

				ROSENBERG
		Yeah, and they overcharge you every time.

				ARQUILLIAN
		Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off
		the planet.

				ROSENBERG
		A bug? He must know why I'm here.

				ARQUILLIAN
		We think he does.
			(noticing the ornate box
			on the table)
		Is that what I think it is?

				ROSENBERG
		No, just some diamonds for your children.
		Do we have time to eat?

The Arquillian relaxes.

				ARQUILLIAN
		Sure. I ordered you some pirogi.

INT. LESHKO'S DINER - KITCHEN - DAY

In the kitchen, the Russian COOK slaps two orders of pirogi up on the
stainless steel counter --

				COOK
		Table six is up!

-- and turns away, back to the grill.

A HAND reaches in, takes the plates, and sets them on a tray. We follow
the tray, but see only the right arm and aproned midsection of the waiter
carrying it. He carries the tray along the counter toward a pair of
swinging doors that lead out into the restaurant.

The doors swing in as another WAITER sweeps into the kitchen, and our
waiter heads out into the dining area. As the doors swing closed behind
him, they reveal storage shelves crammed with bags of rice, cans of stewed
tomatoes --

-- and a DEAD WAITER, literally folded in half and stuffed in among the
shelves.

INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

ROSENBERG and the ARQUILLIAN raise their glasses in a toast.

				ARQUILLIAN
		To the continued reign of the Arquillian
		Empire.

				ROSENBERG
		To the safety of the galaxy.

They CLINK glasses and drink, just as the Waiter arrives. Still, we see
only his arms and midsection as he sets the tray on a stand and lifts the
plates of pirogi. He carries them to the table and sets them down.

Rosenberg, setting his glass down next to the plate, catches a glimpse of
the Waiter's hand --

-- just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the waiter's sleeve
and scurries across the table. The glass slips out of Rosenberg's hand,
dumping wine all over the table.

He looks up, slowly, and sees the Waiter's face.

It's EDGAR. Another half dozen insects of all variety tumble out of
Edgar's sleeves and scurry across the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian
freeze, paralyzed with fear. They seem to know what dire implications
Edgar's presence holds.

				ROSENBERG
			(in English again)
		You can kill us both -- but you will not
		find it.

Edgar smiles.

				EDGAR
		You're right about one thing.

Suddenly a long STINGER whips out from under the back of Edgar's apron and
zips under the table. First Rosenberg and then the Arquillian lurch
forward their chairs, their faces contorting in pain.

They both pitch forward, their faces slogging into fresh pirogi.

The stinger SNAPS out from under the table and whips back under Edgar's
apron. He moves quickly, searching their pockets, but he doesn't find what
he's looking for. The cat, still perched on top of the ornate box, HISSES
at him.

Edgar reaches out and BATS the cat away with one vicious swipe of his
hand. The animal HOWLS and flies across the room, landing in a WOMAN's
lunch.

The Woman SCREAMS. Now other DINERS' attention is drawn to Edgar's table,
where two obviously dead men are being robbed by a waiter. There are
SHOUTS of outrage, a few MEN rise out of their seats.

Edgar grabs the ornate box and tries to open it, but finds it locked. With
the furor rising around him, he shoves the box under one arm and bolts for
the door.

Rosenberg's cat leaps back onto the table and SNARLS at him as he goes.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

Later, and the Russian diner is now a crime scene, clustered with COPS and
flashing lights. THREE BODIES, now on stretchers and covered with sheets,
are being loaded into the back of ambulances.

ROSENBERG'S CAT races out of a UNIFORMED COP's arms and leaps onto one of
the stretchers, MEOWING mournfully. The Uniformed Cop turns to a POLICE
INSPECTOR who is questioning the WOMAN from the diner.

				COP
		What am I supposed to do with the cat?

				INSPECTOR
		I don't know. Send it with the stiff. Let
		family claim it.

The Cop nods and follows the stretcher with Rosenberg's body into the back
of one of the ambulances, allowing the cat to ride on the chest of its
dead owner for the time being.

The doors of the wagon SLAM shut.

								CUT TO:

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

The stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police
headquarters. ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the
stretcher approaches two doors with "City Morgue" written across them. The
words split in half as the stretcher BANGS through the doors.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

The city morgue is a crowded, brightly-lit, tiled place with corpses
parked left and right. Busy day in the Apple. The Cop wheeling the
stretcher calls out to the CORONER, who's hunched over another body.

				COP
		Where do you want contestant number three?

The coroner turns around. It's DR. LAUREL WEAVER, the woman who tried to
speak to Jay before. She sighs and waves a hand.

				LAUREL
		By the wall, I guess.
			(noticing)
		What's with the cat?

				COP
		Oh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat.
		Sign here.

Laurel signs his clipboard.

				LAUREL
		What's the problem with the cat?

				COP
		Your problem.

Laurel gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. She goes over to
the stretcher and bends down, petting Rosenberg's cat gently.

				LAUREL
		Are you having a bad day, baby?  Cheer up.
			(of Rosenberg)
		His is worse.

She sets the cat aside and wheels the stretcher under the lights.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		Okey-dokey. Shall we?

INT. MORGUE - LATER - DAY

Laurel is hunched over the corpse, the only light in the room coming from
the overhead spot that illuminates her work.

Fascinated by something, she digs deeper. And deeper. And looks up, her
face a mixture of alarm and excitement.

				LAUREL
		Oh, my God.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MORGUE - NIGHT

Kay's LTD pulls up in front of the morgue.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Two men in black suits hurry down the stairs and into the corridor outside
the morgue. They hasten down the hallway, their shoes CLICKING in perfect
lockstep, headed for those swinging doors at the other end.

JAY and KAY. Men in Black on a mission.

INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

In the morgue, LAUREL has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms.
ROSENBERG'S CAT sits on the desk next to her, licking its paws. Suddenly,
the cat looks up, MEOWING urgently.

Laurel looks up and, following the cat's gaze, turns around slowly in her
chair. JAY and KAY stand in the doorway, staring at her. Kay steps
forward, holding out that black card again. It reforms into another kind
of official ID, this time it says "DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH"

				LAUREL
			(into recorder)
		...approximately 112 degrees at time of
		autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a
		post-mortem increase in body temperature.
		Examiner attempted to verify result
		rectally, only to find subject was, uh,
		without rectum. Which can only be described
		as...well...as really...

				KAY (O.S.)
		Weird? Dr. Leo Menville, Department of
		Public Health. This is Dr. White.

She looks up. Jay and Kay are standing there.

				LAUREL
		Yeah, well whoever you are, I'm afraid I'm
		going to need to see some ID.

He hands her his CARTE NOIR, which changes to read "Dr. Menville,
Department of Public Health." She hands it back.

				LAUREL
			(checking her watch)
		You boys must not have much of a home life.

				KAY
		We watch the morgues very carefully. You've
		got something unusual?

				LAUREL
		I'd say so -- triple homicide.

She gets up and goes to the Arquillian's body, which is still out on a
table under the lights.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		The first corpse was perfectly normal,
		except that he was broken in half, but when
		I opened up the other two -- well, look.

She throws back a sheet, revealing (to them only, not us) the fully
dissected Arquillian. Kay raises an eyebrow; Jay nearly retches.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		There's a skeletal structure at work here
		unlike anything I've ever seen.

Kay steps past her, going straight to the body. He begins to examine it.

				KAY
		I'll have a look at this one. Dr. White,
		why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the
		other body?

				LAUREL
		This way, Doctor.

Jay and Laurel cross the room, to where ROSENBERG's corpse lies out on
another gurney.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		This one's even stranger. I did a full
		laparotomy. I started with the lesser
		curvature of the stomach -- though, if you
		want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal
		junction.

				JAY
		I think, uh, we should start at the same
		place you did.

				LAUREL
		All right.

Jay hears a MEOW and looks down. Rosenberg's cat is rubbing up against his
leg.

				JAY
		Your cat?

				LAUREL
		Guess it is now. Came in with the bodies.

She SNAPS one of her rubber gloves and reaches down (out of frame),
sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside. Just by the
look on Jay's face, one can imagine how disgusting it is.

Laurel digs in, up to her elbows. Jay winces. She pulls one bloody glove
out, to wipe a strand of hair out of her face. He looks at her --

-- and she winks at him. He's surprised. She laughs.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		Okay. Dive right in. God knows he won't
		mind.

Jay is reluctant, so she rolls her eyes and helps him, taking him by the
hand and guiding him into the thick of the corpse.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		You have very pretty eyes.

				JAY
		Thank-you, but is this really the time to
		uh -- you know, come on to me?

				LAUREL
		Hey, just walking the dog.
			(continuing)
		Feel that? Where the piloric junction would
		be?

				JAY
		Oh, yes. Exactly.

				LAUREL
		Now push that aside. Notice anything
		strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?

				JAY
		Nope. All fine.

				LAUREL
		Doctor, they're all missing.

				JAY
			(quickly)
		Well, of course they are. What I'm pointing
		out is that there are no pieces of them
		left. So they're intact, wherever they are.
		That we can be sure of.

				LAUREL
		Have we met before? I have the strangest
		feeling of deja vu.

				JAY
		You know, I was just going to ask you the
		same thing.

Laurel looks at him sideways, skeptical, but also intrigued. She whispers
to him. Confiding in him.

				LAUREL
		Okay. You wanna know what I really think?
			(re: Kay)
		But don't tell that guy. He looks like he's
		already under enough stress.
			(then)
		This body is not really a body, but it's
		actually some sort of transport unit for
		something else altogether. The question is:
		what?

Jay just looks at her intrigued.

				LAUREL
		By the way, stop me if I'm freaking you out.

				JAY
		No, no...not at all.

After a particularly gross GUSHY sound, he looks away, toward her. She's
staring at him.

Laurel leans over and lowers her voice, just for him.

				LAUREL
		You know what I like to do sometimes? When
		it's really late?

				JAY
			(freaked out)
		No...

From the other side of the room, Kay CLEARS HIS THROAT.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Excuse me.

He walks across the morgue to Kay, who is still examining the Arquillian.
But Jay never takes his eyes off Laurel.

				KAY
		What do you think?

				JAY
			(of Laurel)
		Very interesting. Got a real Queen of the
		Undead thing goin' on.

				KAY
		Of the body.

				JAY
		Great body.

				KAY
		The dead body?

				JAY
		Not a clue.

				KAY
		All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to
		sound too dumb.

ACROSS THE MORGUE, Laurel is still examining Rosenberg, now bent down next
to his head, carefully studying his left ear. She notices something
strange, turns, and calls over her shoulder to Jay.

				LAUREL
		Dr. White.

Jay, in conversation with Kay, does not respond to what is not his name.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
			(louder)
		Dr. White.
			(still louder)
		Dr. White.

He still doesn't answer.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
			(shouting)
		DR. WHITE!

Kay nudges Jay.

				KAY
		You're up, Slugger.

Jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her.

				LAUREL
		Look at this.

Jay leans down. There is strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's
ear.

				JAY
		What is that?

He reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it. With a soft
CLICK --

-- it pulls away from the head. Like a latch.

Jay and Laurel look at each other, astonished. Jay pulls again, and
Rosenberg's entire face PUSHES OUT with a mechanical HUM, then HINGES
OPEN, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial
skull.

A TINY LITTLE GREEN MAN SITS INSIDE ROSENBERG'S HEAD.

Though not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded. He
staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with
gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull.

				LAUREL
		Far -- freaking -- out.

They lean in closer. The Tiny Little Green Man (a BALTIAN) forces words
out of his mouth.

				BALTIAN
		Must -- to pre -- prevent --
			(searching for the word)
		-- contest? No...to prevent --

				JAY
		It's all right -- What are you trying to
		say? Struggle?

				LAUREL
		War?

The Baltian nods vigorously. That's it.

				BALTIAN
			(faltering)
		Galaxy on -- or -- or -- Orion's --
			(thinks)
		What is word? Be...?

				JAY
		Bed? Belt? Orion's Belt?

The Baltian nods again, falls, and dies. Jay and Laurel look at the little
dead alien, then at each other.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's
		Belt?"  The hell does that mean?
			(turns around)
		Hey! Kay! I mean, Dr., uh, whatever, come
		here!

Kay begins over. Laurel looks at them.

				LAUREL
		"Doctor Whatever"? You're not with the
		Department of Public Health, are you?

Jay shakes his head -- but is now paying more attention to Kay, as he
leads him toward the Little Man.

				JAY
		He's dead.

Kay looks at the mess -- the body, the little dead man.

				KAY
		Rosenberg. Damn. Good man.

				JAY
		You knew him?

				KAY
		One of the few I actually liked. Exiled
		High Prince.

				LAUREL
		I was right -- this is an alien life form,
		and you're from some government agency who
		wants to keep it under wraps...

Kay and Jay are not paying attention to Laurel.

				JAY
		He said "to prevent war, the galaxy is on
		Orion's Belt."

				LAUREL
		... This make total sense. How else do you
		explain New York? The other night I'm in a
		cab, this guy...

FLASH! Without even looking at her, Kay whips out his neuralyzer and
blanks her out.

				KAY
		He said there's a galaxy on Orion's Belt?
		That makes no sense.

				JAY
		That's what he said.
			(to the dazed Laurel)
		Didn't he? Right after he --
			(realizing)
		Oh, for Christ's sake, you did the flashy
		thing already.

				LAUREL
			(as if awakening)
		Uh, hi, whoever you guys are, I'm afraid
		I'm going to need to see some ID if you're
		going to be in the morgue, okay?

				KAY
		Sure thing, sweetheart. Here you go.

FLASH! He neuralyzes her again. Jay slaps his hand.

				JAY
		Stop that --

				KAY
			(to Laurel, ignoring Jay)
		Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.

				JAY
		-- that thing probably gives you brain
		cancer!

				KAY
		Never hurt her before.

				JAY
		"Never hurt her before"?! How many times
		have you done the flashy thing to this poor
		woman?!

				KAY
			(evasive)
		Couple.

				JAY
		Aren't you worried about, you know, long
		term damage?

				KAY
			(more evasive)
		Little bit.

				JAY
		What the hell happened to make you such a
		callous son of a bitch?

				KAY
		I took this job.

He heads out. Jay follows.

				JAY
		Hey, you never flashed me with that thing,
		did you?

				KAY
		Nah.

EXT. MORGUE - NIGHT

Jay and Kay exit the morgue and walk towards their car.

				JAY
		Hey, Kay, I really think I should be in
		charge of the flashy memory thing
		department.

				KAY
		Not while I'm around, Slim.

				JAY
		Yeah, well you're a menace with that
		thing...

An MIB containment vehicle pulls up, and four men dressed in black suits
get out.

				KAY
			(to an MIB Agent)
		We've got two dead aliens in there, and a
		deputy medical coroner in need of a new
		memory.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT

The Orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. From inside,
throaty WAILS of frustration can be heard. Two PASSERSBY hear the racket
and hesitate, wondering if they should get involved.

But an inhuman GROWL rattles the whole van and they wise up, hurrying on
their way.

INT. ORKIN VAN - NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT

Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its
various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his
way into it. Crammed into the back of the van along with his spaceship,
Edgar wedges a screwdriver into the thin opening between the top and the
rest of the box and SMACKS it with his right fist. Nothing doing.

He BELLOWS in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it
finally CRACKS a hinge. Edgar snaps it up, pries the rest of the hinge off
with the screwdriver, and wrenches the top off the box.

Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he
promptly tosses aside as worthless. But the rest of the box is empty.

				EDGAR
		No. No, NO, NO, NOOOO!

He rips the box apart with his bare hands. There's nothing else there.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MIB BUILDING - MAGIC HOUR

As lower Manhattan is waking up, Jay and Kay enter the building.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - EARLY MORNING

Despite the early hour, the headquarters is going full-blast. The large
screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the CONSTELLATION
ORION.

Jay and Kay hurry in -- Kay peels off to one of the monitors; Jay heads
for Zed.

				JAY
		Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around
		here?

				ZED
		The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time
		-- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months --
		you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a
		psychotic episode.

He points up at the screen with a laser pencil.

				ZED
		Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of
		stars in the northern sky...
			(pointing)
		and here's Orion's belt --

He indicates the three stars that make up the belt.

				JAY
		That's what the little guy was talking
		about, "To prevent war, the galaxy's on
		Orion's belt..."

				ZED
		There are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The
		belt is just these three stars; galaxies
		are huge, made up of billions of stars.
			(switches off the laser
			pointer)
		You heard wrong.

				JAY
		You're attracted to me, aren't you?

Jay starts to cross over to ANOTHER MONITOR, where Kay is sitting alone,
tie loosened, slightly disheveled. On the screen, the word "SEARCHING"
blinks, encouraging patience. The image changes to a satellite view of
North America, which quickly zooms in on the Southwest.

On screen, the satellite view zooms down to Arizona, then a city, then a
neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard. The printout changes to
"SUBJECT ACQUIRED."

The image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we
get a good look at a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.
			SUBJECT: ELIZABETH ANN RESTON
			 PRESENT LOCATION: RESIDENCE
			 553 FAIRFIELD AVE./TEMPE/AZ
Whoever Elizabeth Ann Reston is, she's lovely. She's setting a picnic
table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by
an eye in the sky -- just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind
him.

Jay notices the monitor with the Middle-aged Woman on it. He looks at
Kay's expression, then back at the monitor.

				JAY
		Pretty lady...

Kay clicks off the picture of her. Jay drags a chair and sits down.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		You were the guy with the flowers in the
		photo, (the night the aliens arrived.)
		(What, you were on your way to a dance or
		something and you got lost? And she never
		got those flowers, did she?]

Kay doesn't answer, just stares at the screen. Elizabeth looks up, as if
she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky,
wondering how many stars'll be out tonight.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Grumpy Guy's story comes into focus. She
		ever get married?

				KAY
		No.

It's more than Kay can bear. He reaches out and flicks a switch. The
monitor goes blank, except for a data screen:
			    SUBJECT LOST
Kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely. Jay looks at
him: "Is this me in thirty years?" A moment goes by. Finally:

				JAY
		Well, it's better to have loved and lost
		than never to have --

				KAY
		Try it.

				ZED (O.S.)
		Kay.

Jay and Kay cross back toward the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each
of the thousand or so Aliens who live on earth are represented by a
flickering LIGHT.

Some lights are starting to go out.

				KAY
			(quietly, with dread)
		They're leaving.

				ZED
		We've had twelve jumps in the last hour.
		Redgick was just the beginning.

				JAY
		What do they know that we don't know?

Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen. Another light flickers out.

				KAY
		Why do rats desert the ship?
			(to the twins)
		Go to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view
		of Manhattan.

ON THE SCREEN New York City is just a bright spot of light on the Eastern
coast of the United States.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Four hundred.

Now there's a view of the earth from space. Nothing unusual.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Four thousand.

Now we're looking at earth from far, far away -- and from here we can see
something that doesn't belong in this picture:

A BATTLE CRUISER far off to one side of the earth. The words "LEVEL FOUR"
flash in red letters on one side of the map.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.

				JAY
		And we've got a dead Arquillian prince.

A COMMUNICATION STARTS COMING OVER THE SPEAKERS -- a sound like a cat and
mouse caught in a blender.

				KAY
		Message coming in.

The communication continues.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Speak of the devil.

The communication continues.

				JAY
		They sound pissed.

				ZED
			(to the twins)
		Translate that and step on it!
			(to Kay)
		Meanwhile get down to Rosenberg's store and
		see what you can turn up.

Kay and Jay walk away.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		And Kay -- take a lot of fire power.

IN THE EQUIPMENT LOCKER Kay pulls out the ENORMOUS, MANY-BARRELED HAND
GUN. A small, clear, canister sprouts from underneath it, malicious
swirling gases visible through its walls.

				JAY
		I like that.

				KAY
		Series four de-atomizer.

Kay pulls out another weapon, the TINIEST GUN WE'VE EVER SEEN.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Here. We call this the "Noisy Cricket."

				JAY
		You get a series four de-atomizer and I get
		a "Noisy Cricket?!"
			(looks at the gun)
		I'm afraid I'm going to break it.

Jay follows Kay out, glancing back to see the huge gun turrets on the
Arquillian Battle Cruiser HUM and WHIR as they swing around into position,
pointed down at the unwitting planet below.

								CUT TO:

INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

SMASH! The window in the front door of Rosenberg's jewelry shop collapses
in a shower of glass. EDGAR reaches in and fumbles with the locks, undoing
them one by one. He gets them all and steps inside. Out the window behind
him, we can see his Orkin van, double parked in the street in front.

All the gems and jewels are under glass counters. Edgar starts SMASHING
the glass, grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside.

Outside, a New York City tow truck pulls up to the front of the Orkin van
and starts to hitch up.

Edgar, in his rage, starts to smash anything breakable, even the framed
pictures on the walls. He stops at one particular picture, staring
intently at it. It's a glamor shot of Rosenberg's cat, provocatively posed
on a satin pillow. There are a half dozen more pictures of the cat, some
posed with Rosenberg, some by itself. This animal was important to
Rosenberg.

From outside, the ROAR of an engine distracts Edgar. He turns around, in
time to see the Orkin van lurch as the tow lifts its front wheels off the
ground.

EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

EDGAR rushes outside as the tow truck DRIVER gets the van up on the hoist.

				EDGAR
		That's my truck!

				DRIVER
		And make sure you tell them that at the
		impound.

Edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve
gauge. He points it at the tow truck Driver. The tow truck driver looks at
him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun.

				DRIVER (CONT'D)
		I got worse.

He keeps hitching up the van. Two pedestrians walk past the dispute, very
fast, ignoring the debate, headed right for the shop. We go with them, and
realize that it's --

-- JAY and KAY. They stop at the smashed door of the jewelry shop and
exchange a glance. Kay pulls a very menacing-looking weapon, nods, and
they step inside.

INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

They look around and see the recent demolition caused by Edgar. Jay
furrows his brow.

				JAY
		Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the
		jewels?

				KAY
		Someone who's not looking for jewels.

Jay moves behind the counter. On the floor is an ornate, empty bowl and a
bag of cat food, next to a scrumptious pillow. There are several PHOTOS OF
A CAT on the wall.

There is also a pile of BEJEWELED CAT COLLARS. Jay picks up one of the
COLLARS, inspects it closely, shaking his head.

				JAY
		This guy had a serious crush on his cat.

Jay's attention is broken by something through the window. Outside,
lumbering straight for the store, is EDGAR.

Jay thinks for a moment -- where does he know that face?

Suddenly, Edgar raises his arms, pointing both the farmer's rifle and the
driver's shotgun. Before Edgar can shoot, Jay YELLS...

				JAY
		Kay! GET DOWN!

And then Jay FIRES, shattering the storefront window, and BLOWING UP A CAR
on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, SLAMMING
him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar turns and rushes away down
the street as Jay picks himself up.

				JAY
		The bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck
		from the picture! That's him!

Jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar.

				KAY
			(picking himself up)
		Damn it.

Kay runs out after Jay.

EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

Edgar doesn't bother sticking around to continue his fight. He jumps
behind the wheel of the tow truck, starts it up, and hits the gas. The
engine ROARS.

Jay sprints after him, FIRING his noisy cricket. He is thrown back into
some pedestrians, while his SHOT...

Hits the rigging between the Orkin Van and the town truck, separating the
two. Jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it
accelerates too quickly.

Edgar is just about to turn the corner when Jay leaps onto a parked CAR to
try and get some height. As Jay prepares to shoot, EDGAR DISAPPEARS AROUND
THE CORNER, and a HUGH TRUCK backs into his line of fire.

JAY FIRES, the TRUCK EXPLODES and Jay flies BACKWARDS, hurtling through
the air and CRASHING through the window of a car, his rear end right in
the woman driver's face.

When Jay looks up, Kay is standing before him. He yanks Jay out of the
car.

				KAY
		We do not discharge our weapons in view of
		the public.

				JAY
		Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's
		an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up
		the world if we don't...

				KAY
		There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or
		a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic
		plague about to wipe out life on this
		planet, and the only thing that lets people
		get on with their hopeful little lives is
		that they don't know about it.

Kay gestures to a group of ONLOOKERS, drawn by the curious blasts from the
store. There's smoking rubble everywhere.

				KAY
		Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving
		town. We've got his ship.

After gesturing to the back of the Orkin van, where Edgar's spaceship is
neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone.

				KAY
			(into phone)
		Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew
		down here at McDougal, south of Houston.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Back at Men in Black Headquarters, the little lights on the world map
which indicate aliens' locations are going out, one by one, about one
every five or ten seconds. A WARNING BUZZER is sounding, over and over,
and HUMAN STAFFERS are rushing left and right.

ZED is in his office.

				ZED
		Containment may be a moot point, my friend.
		The exodus continues. It's like the party's
		over and the last one to leave gets stuck
		with the check.

Zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with
suitcases walking across the floor.

				ZED
		You sorry little ingrates!

				KAY (O.S.)
		What about the Arquillians?

				ZED
		We've only translated a part of the message
		so far: "Deliver the Galaxy."

				KAY (O.S.)
		No, they don't want much, do they?

				ZED
		Oh, it gets better... They're holding us
		responsible.

He looks up at the screen. It reads:
				   MIB
			   DELIVER THE GALAXY.

				ZED
		Another contestant has entered the ring.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET (OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE)

As Kay puts away his phone, turns to Jay

				KAY
		All right, kid. The Arquillians want the
		galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We
		need help. A professional. Someone with
		years of experience in intergalactic
		politics. I just hope the little prick
		hasn't skipped town.

								CUT TO:

EXT. UPTOWN NEWSSTAND - DAY

The tow truck SQUEALS to a halt at a curb.  EDGAR gets out and walks away,
fast, CURSING under his breath. He rants, livid, thinking hard. As he
passes a newsstand, he grabs the NEWS VENDOR by the collar.

				EDGAR
		Where do you keep your dead?

				VENDOR
			(thinks)
		I don't have any dead.

				EDGAR
		Where?!

				VENDOR
		I don't know, the city morgue!

Edgar shoves him away roughly. But before he leaves, his eye catches a
postcard display marked "LANDMARKS OF THE NEW YORK CITY AREA." Edgar
stares, fascinated, but we don't see what he's looking at. He reaches out
and picks up a color postcard.

He raises it to his face, thinking, then shoves it in his pocket and
hurries off.

								CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - KEY KIOSK - DAY

Kay's LTD SCREECHES to a halt in front of the kiosk on Orchard Street. JAY
and KAY leap out and Jay spots the VENDOR, closing up the shop. He's
wearing a dirty cardigan, watch cap, and fingerless gloves, his face
aquiver with ticks and mannerisms. He has a small dog in front of him.

Jay rolls his eyes as they step up to the counter.

				JAY
		Of course that guy's an alien. That's gotta
		be the worst disguise I've ever seen.

A voice answers him, but not the Vendor's.

				FRANK THE PUG
		You don't like it, you can kiss my furry
		little butt.

Jay looks down. The voice is coming from the dog. This is FRANK THE PUG.
Kay approaches, motioning to Jay to make sure no one hears.

				KAY
		You busy, Frank?

				FRANK THE PUG
		Sorry, Kay, I can't talk right now, my
		ride's leaving in --

Kay grabs Frank. He yelps like, well, a dog.

				KAY
		Call the pound. We got a stray.

				FRANK THE PUG
		Hey! Get your paws off me!

PASSERBYS glare at Kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor
little dog. Jay tries to explain.

				JAY
		The, uh...dog owes my friend some money.

				KAY
			(to Frank)
		Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?

				FRANK THE PUG
		I know nothing.

				KAY
		Not a thing?

Kay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to force an answer.

				FRANK THE PUG
		Stop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn't some
		two-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of
		a galaxy. They thought he would be safe
		here on earth.

				KAY
		And the bug had other plans.

				FRANK THE PUG
		The galaxy is the best source for subatomic
		energy in the universe. If the bugs get
		their slimy claws on it, kiss the
		Arquillians goodbye.

				JAY
		Ask him about the belt.

				KAY
			(to Frank)
		Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on
		"Orion's belt." What's he talking about,
		Frank?

				FRANK THE PUG
		Beats me.

Kay shakes Frank the Pug once more.

				JAY
			(to a person passing by)
		They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

				FRANK THE PUG
		The galaxy is here.

				KAY
		Here?

				JAY
		The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars
		and planets? How's it here?

If a dog can smirk, Frank does.

				FRANK THE PUG
		You humans, when're you gonna learn that
		size doesn't matter? Just 'cause something's
		important, doesn't mean it's not very, very
		small.

				KAY
		How small?

				FRANK THE PUG
		Tiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a jewel.
		Now if you'll excuse me, I need to be walked
		before the flight.

Kay lets go of Frank, turns to Jay, who is lost in thought.

				KAY
			(to Frank the Pug)
		Get out of here.
			(then to Jay)
		The galaxy's here. It's not on Orion's belt.

Jay suddenly notices Frank the Pug bark at a cat farther down the
sidewalk.

				JAY
		Kay...

								CUT TO:

INT. MORGUE - DAY

In the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG'S CAT
leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the
middle of the file she's studying.

Laurel jumps.

				LAUREL
		Boy, when you want attention --

She pets the cat. As she does, the cat's collar shines in the light.
Laurel turns the name tag to face her.

CLOSE ON A PRECIOUS JEWEL, AND THE WORD "ORION."

As it is written across the collar of the cat.

				LAUREL (O.S)
		"Orion." That's a pretty name.

From out in the corridor, a bell rings -- DING, DING.

Laurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar -- a CIRCULAR ICON
of a strange and beautiful metal. The center is some sort of hardened,
translucent material, light green in color.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		What's this?

She peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement.

INT. ICON - DAY

It's as if Laurel is sucked into another universe. Her face goes
beatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield, millions of
stars, billions of green, verdant planets, all racing by her at the speed
of light.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

				LAUREL
		Wow.

Outside, the bell DINGS again. Orion looks up, as if knowing who's out
there, and not liking it. She SNARLS at the door and leaps off the desk,
scurrying across the lab and disappearing under some equipment.

INT./EXT. LTD - MANHATTAN - DAY

Jay and Kay barrel through town.

				JAY
		So two galaxies have been fighting for
		years. And the only people who've been
		benefiting are a race of creatures called
		bugs. Then the two galaxies decide to make
		peace...and the bugs send this guy down to
		make sure the fighting never stops.

				KAY
		By killing the emissaries, and stealing the
		galaxy they've been fighting about.

				JAY
		And if we don't get it back before he
		leaves the planet...we're history.

				KAY
		We're not even history. 'Cause history
		implies there's someone around to remember
		it.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

On a counter in the morgue corridor, a gray, peeling hand BANGS on a bell
on a countertop, over and over. The hand belongs to EDGAR, who is carrying
his shotgun, concealing it behind one leg. The morgue attendant, TONY,
emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of Atlas
Shrugged and a fly swatter.

				TONY
		Thank you for making sure the bell works.

Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a
BUZZING FLY. Edgar winces.

				TONY (CONT'D)
			(to Edgar)
		What's up, Farmer John?

				EDGAR
		A man came in here earlier. A dead man.

				TONY
		And this means what to me?

				EDGAR
		He was a very dear friend of mine. And I
		believe he had an animal with him. A gift
		I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to
		me. I would like it back.

				TONY
		I'll need a picture ID, written proof of
		ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of
		kinship with --

WHACK! Tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its
maker. Edgar grits his teeth.

				TONY (CONT'D)
		-- the deceased.

				EDGAR
		Don't -- do that.

WHACK! Still another fly goes down.

				TONY
		Do what?

Tony looks down, to where Edgar's hands rest on the counter. Half a dozen
cockroaches stream out of his sleeve.

				TONY (CONT'D)
		Shit!

He ducks under the counter --

-- and comes up with a can of Raid. Edgar's eyes bug out.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MORGUE - DAY

Kay's LTD pulls to a stop in front of the morgue and JAY and KAY jump out.

				JAY
		I'll handle this one, you wait outside.

				KAY
		What the hell for?

				JAY
		Because all we have to do is walk in and
		get a cat, it's not that hard. But if you
		go in, you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on
		her and flash your brain ray in her face
		and she's gonna end up with leukemia or
		some shit. The woman's a doctor, she
		doesn't need you erasing half her med
		school classes. Take me five minutes.

And he continues into the morgue, leaving Kay waiting outside.

				KAY
		Two minutes!

INT. MORGUE - DAY

LAUREL SLAMS into a wall on one side of the morgue, thrown there by EDGAR.
He leans in, close, furious.

				EDGAR
		Where is the animal?!

				LAUREL
		I told you, I don't know, it ran under some
		equipment! Over there.

				EDGAR
		Get it!

He grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue, toward the equipment
she pointed to. As they draw close, ORION the cat bolts from underneath
it, races between their legs, and leapfrogs over several small cabinets,
landing on top of a very tall one with only six inches clearance between
it and the ceiling. A very tough hiding place.

Edgar just starts to turn when they hear the BELL and a VOICE from the
corridor outside.

				JAY (O.S.)
		Hello? Anybody here?

Edgar looks up at the cat's hiding place. No time to get it. The bell
DINGS again.

				JAY (O.S.)
		Hello?

Roughly, Edgar pulls Laurel close and puts a finger to his lips --
"Shhhhhhh."

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

In the corridor, JAY looks around. No Tony, no answer to the bell.  He
DINGS once more, then heads into the back.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

JAY comes into the morgue. LAUREL is in there, standing right up next to
an examination table, but there is no corpse on the table, just a sheet
draped over it. She just stands there, in the middle of the room, staring
at Jay.

				JAY
		Uh, hi.

				LAUREL
			(oddly)
		Hello.

				JAY
			(flashes a badge)
		I'm Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth
		precinct. They brought a cat in here with a
		corpse the other day, might have said
		"Orion" on the cat's name tag?

				LAUREL
		Yes. That's right.

				JAY
		Right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a
		witness in a murder case and I'm going to
		need to take it with me.

				LAUREL
		I don't know where the cat is at the moment.

				JAY
		You don't?

				LAUREL
		No.
			(lowers her voice to a
			whisper)
		Maybe you could take me with you instead.

Jay looks at her.

				JAY
		Excuse me?

				LAUREL
		I said, maybe you could take me with you
		instead.

				JAY
		Damn, you do start fast, don't you?

				LAUREL
		I'd really like to go with you. Now.

Jay just looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this
woman. He looks over his shoulder, to make sure he has a few more seconds
alone.

				JAY
		And, uh, why exactly is that?

Laurel rolls her eyes. She seems irritated with him, but it doesn't go
with what she's saying.

				LAUREL
		I just do.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

KAY comes down the stairs and into the morgue corridor.  He checks his
watch, then leans against the counter and pulls out a pack of cigarettes.
Waiting.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

Jay is thoroughly enjoying himself, but Laurel seems to be going crazy.

				LAUREL
		I have something I need to show you.

She looks down, pointedly, in the direction of her waist.

				JAY
		Now slow down, you don't have to hit the
		gas like that.

She leans in and lowers her voice.

				LAUREL
		You don't understand. You really need to
		see this.

				JAY
		And I will. But we gotta get something
		straight here -- I'm gonna drive. It's not
		some kind of macho trip, it's just the way
		I'm used to doing things, okay?

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it
to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a sharp
SIZZLE.

Kay furrows his brow. Odd.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

Laurel is at the end of her rope.

				LAUREL
		Look, Stud, I don't know how many more
		times I'm going to get to tell you this.
		There's something --

She points, sharply, at the examination table directly in front of her.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		-- that you have to help me with.

Jay's smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out.  He starts to
reach for his gun.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

Kay raises another lit match to his cigarette, but as this one gets close,
a BIG GLOB OF GOO drops from the ceiling and onto the match, dousing the
flame.

Kay looks up, sharply.

Above him, TONY, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the
ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen
look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand.

From inside the morgue, Laurel SCREAMS.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

Kay races into the morgue just as the examination table EXPLODES into the
air, revealing EDGAR, who was hiding beneath it.

Now everything happens at once. Jay leaps back and draws the Noisy
Cricket, Kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and Edgar holds his
shotgun under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own.

				KAY
		Freeze it, Bug!

				JAY
		Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

				LAUREL
			(to Jay)
		CHRIST, are you THICK!

				JAY
		How was I supposed to know!?!

				LAUREL
		What did I have to do, SING it for you!?!

				JAY
		Maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken
		prom date!

				LAUREL
		Oh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman
		shows the slightest hint of sexual
		independence, men just --

				EDGAR
		Everybody shut UP!

				KAY
		Let her go, Shit Eater.

				EDGAR
		Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that
		kind of talk in my end of the universe, but
		compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on
		the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all
		right?!

				KAY
		You're breakin' my heart. Move six inches
		to your left and I'll solve all your
		problems.

ORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and
landing on Edgar, HISSING and scratching and clawing for all she's worth.
Edgar snaps an arm up and whips her off. The cat squirms in his arm, the
icon jangling. Edgar grabs the icon, holds onto it, and flings the cat
away, across the morgue. The icon comes free, remaining in his hand.

He drops it into his mouth and swallows. He shoves the gun hard against
Laurel's cheek.

				EDGAR
		That's better. Now put down your weapons.
		We're leaving.

Kay freezes, teeth clenched, gun still in front of him. Standoff.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?

Edgar cranks one of Laurel's arms behind her back, hard, and she CRIES OUT
in pain.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		Would you care to see the fly get even?

				KAY
		How far you think you'll get without your
		ship? If that's what you call that hunk of
		space crap we've got back at our office.

				EDGAR
		Put the weapons down!

				KAY
		Never gonna happen, Insect.

Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass
window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. Jay and Kay advance,
slowly, cornering him.

				JAY
		It's okay, Laurel!

				LAUREL
		HOW is it okay?!

				JAY
		I mean it's going to be okay!

				EDGAR
		Don't bet on it, meat sack.

And with that he turns, leaps --

-- and CRASHES right through the window, into the air shaft.

EXT. MORGUE (SIDE STREET) - DUSK

EDGAR, still clutching LAUREL, EXPLODES up over a railing.

Nobody looks twice as Edgar, dragging Laurel (with his arm over her
mouth), races toward the nearby busy Manhattan Street.

INT. MORGUE - AIR SHAFT - DUSK

Jay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and
the walls are smooth anyway.

				KAY
		Damn it!

They turn and run out of the morgue.

EXT. THE NEARBY BUSY MANHATTAN STREET - DUSK

EDGAR, with LAUREL, RUNS right in front of a CAB, which screeches to a
halt inches from them. The CABBIE sticks his head out and YELLS something
in an unknown language. And KEEPS yelling as --

Edgar reaches through the passenger side and pulls the Cabbie out the door
(cigarette and wooden seat-beads and all).

The Cab Driver is still yelling as Edgar leaps in, pushing Laurel in
before him, leaving her behind the wheel.

He removes a POSTCARD -- the one he took from the display on the
newsstand.

				EDGAR
		Take me here.

				LAUREL
		What???

Edgar just cranks the car into gear -- opening his mouth and swallowing
the icon -- and in so doing revealing a TRIPLE ROW OF SERRATED BUG-TEETH,
he SLAMS HIS FOOT on the gas pedal.

Laurel's head snaps back as the car rocks forward. She has no choice, but
to grab the wheel and start steering as --

The car screeches out into traffic, swerving wildly as Laurel is forced to
make a 90-degree turn. The car fishtails wildly, swiping an oncoming car
as it straightens and heads into the traffic.

The furious Cab Driver runs off after it, still yelling as he disappears
around the corner.

A second later, KAY and JAY rush out into the street. The cab is nowhere
to be seen. Jay runs into the street, noticing the wooden beads, the
ripped pine-scented green deodorizer, and the still-burning cigarette.

				JAY
		They're in a cab.

And Jay starts running down the street, where DOZENS of cabs are waiting
at the intersection.  He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows,
scaring the living shit out of people --

				JAY
		Hey! Laurel!? Hey!

-- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found. Up ahead the light turns
green and the tide of taxis wash away, leaving Jay on the street. He turns
as a car screeches up behind him, its headlights shining in his eyes. As
it gets closer, Jay sees it's Kay in the LTD.

				KAY
		Stop wasting time. He's not getting off the
		planet in a cab.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Jay and Kay rush in from the door under the World's Fair mural, and head
toward the main display screen; all around them, the MIB staffers are in
frenetic activity in response to the threat from above.

				KAY
			(to tech at a desk)
		Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way
		around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's

		What've we got from our friends upstairs?

				ZED
		Same thing: "Deliver the galaxy."

				KAY
		Yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but
		we've got his ship. He's got to be looking
		for a way out.

Just then, a loud ALARM wails.

AT THE MAIN VIEWING SCREEN, A GREEN LINE shoots out from the Arquillian
ship, striking a region of planet earth.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

-- headquarters, where every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going
off.

				JAY
		WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US FOR?!

				ZED
		Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get
		an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we
		have a galactic standard week to respond.

				JAY
		A galactic standard week? How the hell long
		is that?

				KAY
		One hour.

				JAY
		One hour?

Viewing the screen, it now reads:

                                   SORRY

				ZED
		To keep the bugs from getting it, the
		Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and
		whatever planet it's on.

				JAY
		You're talking about US!

				ZED
		Sucks, doesn't it?

				KAY
		Pull up the locations of all land-based
		interstellar vehicles.

				ZED
		They're all gone. Frank the Pug took the
		last ship on the planet.

As Kay and Zed watch as the machine scrolls through the data, Jay walks
back towards the center of the room, deep in thought. Over him we hear:

				KAY
		Atlantic City?

				ZED
		Gone.

				KAY
		That landfill on the Jersey Shore?

				ZED
		Gone.

				JAY
		Uh, gentlemen.

				KAY
		Epcot?

				ZED
		Gone.

				KAY
		Miami Beach?

				ZED
		Gone.

				JAY
		Fellas.

				KAY
		Hartford?

				ZED
		Gone, thank God.

				JAY
		Hey. Old guys.

Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Do those still work?

They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall
in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the
enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the
mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped
by --

-- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand
there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

-- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing
Meadows. A taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards
away. EDGAR shoves LAUREL out through the driver's door and follows behind
her, still holding his weapon on her.

				EDGAR
		You're coming with me.

				LAUREL
		What?! Why?!

				EDGAR
		It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

And he shoves her ahead of him, off in the direction of the space ships.

Behind him, abandoned on the front seat of the cab, we finally see the
front of the postcard he's been carrying around. "FLUSHING MEADOWS, SITE
OF THE 1964 WORLD'S FAIR," it says, with a distinctive photograph of the
spaceships.

So that's how he knew.

								CUT TO:

EXT. COLUMBUS CIRCLE - NIGHT

Nighttime now, and the city hums along, just another Thursday night.  The
clock in Columbus Circle says it's 7:45.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT

TVs in the window of an appliance store show a rerun of "Cheers." PEOPLE
laugh.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

The news ticker in Times Square announces the latest shattering news:
		RAIN LIKELY -- TEMPS DROP TO 60'S

EARTHLINGS pass left and right, blissfully unaware of their impending
doom.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT

KAY and JAY leap into Kay's LTD and SLAM the doors. Kay jams the key in
the ignition, the car ROARS to life, and he turns to Jay.

				KAY
		Whaddya say we bag us some bug?

He hits the gas and the car ROCKETS away from the curb.

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

The LTD tears through the city.

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Kay turns sharply to the right, SMACKING Jay around. Looking up ahead, he
sees the entrance to the midtown tunnel.

				JAY
		You're taking the tunnel?!

				KAY
		You know a better way to Queens?

				JAY
		It's usually jammed?!

EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT

The LTD races through the tunnel at top speed. It's clear driving for a
few seconds, but then they round a bend --

-- and there's a traffic jam up ahead.

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Kay approaches the line of cars at top speed, with no intention of slowing
down. Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life.

				JAY
		I told you!

				KAY
		Jay. The button?

				JAY
		Yeah?!

				KAY
		Push the button, Jay.

A LIGHTED PANEL rotates into place between the two front seats, and that
red button flashes underneath its plastic shield again. Jay flips back the
plastic cover and JAMS his finger down on the red flashing button.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		And you may want to throw on a seat belt.

EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - MIB LTD - NIGHT

As the LTD rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve,
its shape actually changing. The sides and back extend as some sort of
endoskeleton pushes the "normal" panels out. It becomes a larger, wirier
machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and
metallic tendons.

Kay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last
possible moment it swerves off to the side, a SUCKING SOUND coming from
underneath it.

Instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the LTD actually clings to
it. It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic
below.

It keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels
clinging to the roof of the tunnel.

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Jay falls from his seat with a CLUNK, onto the upside down ceiling of the
car. Balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they
tear through the tunnel, ZOOMING over the bottlenecked traffic underneath.

As they race through the tunnel, they have a minute to kill.

				KAY
		Mind if I smoke?

				JAY
		What?!?

				KAY
		In the car, I mean.

				JAY
		I don't care!!

				KAY
		Hey, just a common courtesy. It bothers
		some people if you smoke in a car.

He lights a cigarette and blows the smoke out leisurely, one hand on the
wheel, just waiting out the tunnel. Jay gives up struggling to right
himself and closes his eyes, suffering through this.

EXT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

From outside the car, we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel.
We can hear KAY'S VOICE as he goes on. And on.

				KAY
		Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke
		anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I
		should quit. I've tried. Never took,
		though. I'm beginning to think I lack
		self-control.

And they disappear out the other end of the tunnel --

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

-- and flip over, BANGING back down onto the road on the other side. Jay
falls off the ceiling and SLAMS into his seat.

				KAY
		Well, back to work.

He flips his cigarette out the window and cranks the wheel to the left.

EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - TOLL BOOTH - NIGHT

Approaching a toll booth, the LTD shoots across nine lanes of traffic and
through the only open booth, SHATTERING the gate. Traveling at about two
hundred miles an hour, Kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window --

-- and it CHINKS in the basket as their taillights disappear.

								CUT TO:

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - LANDING TOWER - NIGHT

EDGAR climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships,
pushing LAUREL up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top.

				LAUREL
		Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat
		me. I'm a very important person on my
		planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even.
		There are those who worship me, yes. I'm
		not trying to impress you with this, I'm
		just letting you know. It could start a
		war.

				EDGAR
		Good. War means food for my family, all
		seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot
		of mouths to feed, your highness.

				LAUREL
		You're a wonderful dad.

And with that she KICKS him squarely in the face. He reels, momentarily
losing his grip on her. She takes advantage of the moment and FLINGS
HERSELF out, into the air.

Edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach. She falls, tumbling through the
air --

-- and lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches
rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the
ground.

Above, Edgar just keeps climbing.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Over at the fence, the LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the
fairgrounds.

AT THE TRUNK, JAY and KAY flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever
weapons look most dangerous. Kay grabs a black box, UNSNAPS a row of
latches, and opens it, revealing --

-- the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet.

Three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump
action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. The
shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. Kay loads up
the clip.

				JAY
		You know how to work that?

Kay pumps it once, with extreme confidence.

				KAY
		No idea whatsoever.

He SLAMS the trunk, revealing the flying saucers sitting atop their
columns in the distance.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Let's bag us some bug.

As if on cue, one of the saucers begins to HUM. Then it starts to spin,
faster and faster. The ship begins to rise.

				JAY
		Oh, shit.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - TREE - NIGHT

Laurel sits in her tree, watching with amazement.

EXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT

At Shea Stadium, a Mets game is in progress. Behind the home plate side,
the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible.

But at that very moment, the batter CRACKS into a fastball, hard. The
crowd rises to its feet, SHOUTING, staring out at center field, where the
ball is headed.

All eyes in the house are on the Mets' CENTER FIELDER, except for his
eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. His eyes widen,
his jaw drops --

-- and the catchable ball sails over his head, THUDDING into the wall
behind him. The crowd BOOS viciously.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Kay raises the weapon he took from the trunk; looks over at Jay.

				KAY
		Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic
		implosion factor --

				JAY
		What?

				KAY
		Press the little green button, on three.

Jay raises his weapon; they press their green buttons.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		One...two...

They pull their triggers.

For a moment, nothing happens, as if it were a misfire. But then, there is
a VACUUM WHUMP, like all the air in the immediate area being sucked into a
space the size of a dime, and a tremendous shock wave rolls out from the
barrel of the guns.

Jay and Kay are sucked to the ground by the bizarre force, THUDDING to
their stomachs like magnets to a refrigerator.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship,
then it HITS the ship --

-- and it too is sucked back down. Hurtling back toward them.

EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT

She flinches as the flying saucer shoots overhead.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The saucer CRASHES through the Unisphere, an enormous steel globe, and
THUDS to the earth, CRASHING through brush, dirt and rock...

Jay and Kay come to their feet...

In front of them, the dust clears... Trees uprooted, stones and dirt
thrown everywhere...a dumpster has been cast to their left...

And the saucer is there, embedded in the earth, tipped off-kilter in a
mound of debris...

A hatch comes up...revealing Edgar, walking slowly toward them, with
contained fury.

				EDGAR
		You don't get it. I've won. It's over.

				KAY
		You are under arrest for violating number
		4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand
		over any galaxy you might be carrying.

				EDGAR
		You milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a
		few seconds you won't even be matter!

				KAY
		Move away from the vehicle and put your
		hands on your head.

He pumps the gun for emphasis.

				EDGAR
		Put my hands on my head?

Edgar stares at him. Then flexes his arms, still encased in flesh. His
giant pincers RIP free of the rotting skin.

He extends both pincers to the sides, and, my God, his reach must be
twelve feet across.

Now the skin and clothes on Edgar's legs begins to CRACK and SHRED. They
BURST APART, revealing two hideous, doubled-over insect legs. The bug
raises himself aloft on his legs.

He sucks in a deep breath of air, and now the rest of the Edgar suit goes
the way of the arms and legs. The torso EXPLODES in great rendering of
cloth and skin, and finally

Edgar's head simply BURSTS apart, SPATTERING against the walls. Edgar now
reveals himself as he really is: a hairy, bug-like exoskeleton, a scaly
tail with a long stinger, a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a
small nose, and two horse-like feet with three toes each.

He raises his pincers in the air, resting them on his head. The GALAXY
hangs on a chain around his neck.

				BUG
		Like this?

Kay and Jay pump their guns and aim at the Bug.

Suddenly the Bug SPITS. And a HUGE, SLIMY WAD OF GOO shoots from him and
engulfs both shotguns. The Bug snorts it back, tearing them from Jay and
Kay's grasp, then swallowing them.

Jay and Kay have only a second to react before --

The Bug SWIPES at them with the back of his clawed hand, like someone
brushing aside a gnat -- and SENDS THEM FLYING FIFTEEN FEET IN THE AIR.

EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT

She flinches as she sees them hit the ground. She starts to climb the
tree.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Jay and Kay hit the ground with loud grunts.

				JAY
		That did not go at all like I had planned.

They look up to see the Bug moving for the second tower -- and the second
flying saucer. Kay gets to his feet.

				KAY
		This guy's really starting to bug me.

Kay starts walking after the Bug.

				KAY
		Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on
		that ship.

				JAY
		Where are you going?

				KAY
		Getting my gun back.

				JAY
		What!?

Kay steps forward and yells at the departing Bug.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Hey, Bug!

The Bug just keeps moving toward the ladder.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many
		of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?

The Bug turns toward Kay. Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off
against the giant alien hug.

EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT

She quietly makes it to the ground -- hurries off to the darkness of the
woods.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON KAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT

Kay has himself in the Bug's face, its dripping fangs inches from Kay's
face.

				KAY
		You're just a smear on the sports page to
		me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal
		parasite! Eat me!

The Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening HISS,
lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth.

The Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back. Kay
slides down the Bug's throat, bending it sideways as he kicks and SCREAMS
his way down into its abdomen.

JAY looks on, in stunned horror...

AS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a
HIDEOUS SCREAMING HOWL OF TRIUMPH.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Laurel is still watching.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT

Jay watches as the Bug continues its HOWL OF TRIUMPH...He feels totally
defeated. But...

He can hardly believe his eyes as he looks down at the Bug's stomach...

CLOSE ON BUG'S STOMACH. Through the leathery pouch of the Bug's stomach,
we can just make out the distended outline of the two atomizers...and just
a few inches from it, a HUMAN HAND is reaching toward the gun... KAY!

INT. BUG - NIGHT

Kay, swimming in the Bug's intestinal fluid, tries to make his way to the
gun, Holding his breath. Eyes stinging.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Jay knows what he has to do. He picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete
dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the Bug.

				JAY
		Hey! Come over here and try that!

The concrete THUNKS off the Bug's shell -- he doesn't seem to notice; just
keeps moving.

Jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the Bug.

				JAY
		Stop right there, or I'll start wailing on
		your waxy, pointed ass!

Jay starts pounding on the Bug with the metal pole.

INT. BUG - NIGHT

Kay almost has his fingers around the stock of the gun -- The POUNDING on
the outside distracts him and he turns -- the gun shifts away.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The Bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of Jay's hands. He swings at
Jay -- Jay dodges the blow and falls to the grass.

The Bug slices down with razor-sharp claws at Jay --

-- Jay rolls out of the way, just as the mean-looking claws dig into the
grass.

Jay rolls right underneath the Bug's legs. His hand falls on something in
the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a
dagger. He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug's apparently
vulnerable underbelly, right above him.

He grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up,
into the Bug's gut, when;

The Bug bends its head down between its legs.

BUG'S POV of Jay there, upside-down from this perspective, lurking between
the Bug's legs.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The Bug opens its jaws and SNAPS at Jay -- who propels himself backward
out of harm's way.

The Bug starts climbing the tower. Jay howls in frustration.

				JAY
		What are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand
		and fight like an arthropod!

In frustration, Jay screams and throws himself on the Bug, hanging onto
its back, trying to drag it down.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		You want a piece of this, huh?! Maybe
		you're a badass in your hive, but this is
		New York City. You're just another tourist
		here!

The Bug flicks him off with his tail -- sending him SAILING twenty feet
through the air.

Jay CRASHES into the dumpster, landing on a heap in front of the garbage.

But, scratched and beat-up, Jay still doesn't quit -- he stands to yell at
the Bug, extending his arm at the creature.

				JAY
		You're messing with the wrong species, Bug --

He notices something on his arm...a cockroach running down his sleeve. He
flicks it off...

Looks down at the ground...sees another roach...looks over to the dumpster
behind him...there are more of them...a whole mob, in fact...fifty or
sixty of the critters, climbing out of a rusted hole in the dumpster...

Jay has one last desperate idea...He kicks at the dumpster -- part of the
side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and crumbles to pieces.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ROACHES pouring forth from the dumpster, crawling
like a black glittering river, away from the garbage...

Jay leaps to his feet and moves to the glistening mob of insects...

				JAY
		Hey, Bug!

CLOSE ON JAY'S FOOT as he steps on the roach.  CRUNCH.

ON THE BUG as he flinches on the ladder -- he hates that sound.

ON JAY. He smiles.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		If I'm not mistaken, that was a cousin of
		yours.

He knows he's getting to him. He steps toward the Bug -- moving his foot
over another roach.

CRUNCH! He crushes another one.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Whoa! That had to hurt. And, what d'you
		know, here's your old Uncle Bob!

He steps forward again -- CRUNCH!

ON THE BUG. He turns around, anger burning in his eyes.

INT. BUG - NIGHT

Kay's hand reaches closer and closer to the gun...

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY - NIGHT

Jay keeps moving toward the Bug, finding new roaches to tread on -- holds
his foot over another one.

				JAY
		What's that? Can you hear what he's saying?
		'Help me! Help me!'

CRUNCH. [ON] THE BUG as he starts climbing down the tower and moving
toward Jay.

ON JAY. They are moving toward each other in a show down -- Jay moves on,
poising his foot over another roach.

				JAY
		Ooh! There's a pretty one. That one looks
		kinda familiar, don't you think? I know who
		that is!

The Bug is right over Jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up.

				BUG
		Don't do that!

Jay stares right back at the Bug. Inside, he sees Kay's hand, closing
around the trigger of the shotgun. He brings it around, pointing up,
straight at the Bug's head.

				JAY
		That's your Momma!

He moves to CRUNCH the roach -- The Bug moves to chomp Jay -- Jay stares
up at him, unflinching...

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Didn't she ever teach you not to bite off
		more than you can chew?

and at that very moment...

Kay BLASTS a hole right in the middle of the Bug's midsection. The front
of the Bug's thorax EXPLODES in a shower of bug juice all over Jay.

The Bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end sailing one way; the head
flying behind Jay.

Kay falls out of the Bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping
the atomizer from his slippery fingers.

The other gun sails off into the darkness.

The ICON drops to the ground, rolls over to Jay's feet, and CLATTERS to
rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor.

He calmly bends down and picks it up. Jay is pissed and starts in on Kay.

				JAY
		You son of a --

Kay holds up a finger in a 'wait a minute' gesture -- pulls out his pocket
phone and hits a number.

				KAY
		Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians.  We
		have the galaxy.

INT. MIB HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Zed is standing at the console, a smile on his face. He glances over at
the console that displays alien arrivals and departures on the earth. The
red lights are coming back on.

				ZED
		I think the word's already out. Our friends
		are coming back.
			(then)
		Got an authorized landing at Times Square.
		You and Jay check it out on the way back...
		And pick me up one of those soft pretzels,
		while you're at it. Extra salt. I feel like
		celebrating.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Kay flips the phone closed.

				KAY
		You were saying?

				JAY
		Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?

				KAY
			(shrugs)
		Worked.

As they argue, behind them, unseen, THE FRONT HALF OF THE BUG RAISES
ITSELF UP on its forearms, eyes gleaming with hate, jaws dripping -- ready
to lower itself onto Kay and Jay.

				JAY
		After I got the shit beat out of me!

				KAY
		And I almost got digested. It goes with the
		job.

				JAY
		You coulda told me what you were doing.

				KAY
		There wasn't time, sport!

HISSS! The Bug attacks, swinging its head down on them. They turn to see
it, and just before the jaws snap down on their heads...

BOOM! The Bug's head explodes into a million bits. Bug juice showers down
everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching Kay and Jay even further.

They turn to see...

LAUREL standing behind the dead Bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the
barrel smoking, the weapon and Laurel dripping the Bug innards.

				LAUREL
		Interesting job you guys got.

ON THE SKY. Bits of Bug juice still flying through the air.

INT. A CAR ON THE ADJOINING FREEWAY - NIGHT

The driver sees something tumbling toward the windshield. He winces.

-- AND THE BUG'S REMAINS SPLAT AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD.

The driver grimaces at the mess.

				DRIVER
		Damn bugs.

He reaches down and hits a button. Wiper fluid squirts onto the windshield
and the wipers spread the bug goo everywhere.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT

Kay's LTD is parked outside Men in Black headquarters. LAUREL leans her
back against the car.  We see JAY and KAY walking away in the distance.

				JAY
		Look, I know we got rules, but she did just
		bust the Bug for us.  And so maybe you
		don't have to flashy thing her.

Kay pulls out the neuralyzer.

				JAY
		Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only
		hangs out with dead people.

				KAY
		Not her. Me.
			(looking up at the sky)
		They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars.
		I never just look anymore and they're
		beautiful.

				JAY
		Kay, you're scaring your partner.

				KAY
		I haven't been training a partner -- I've
		been training a replacement.

				JAY
		Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.

				LAUREL
			(walking towards them)
		Hey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment.
		We're not even on the right island.

				KAY
		Maybe you won't have to.

Kay starts dialing back the neuralyzer.

				KAY
		Days. Months. Years. Always face it
		forwards.

He hands the neuralyzer to Jay. Taps his pocket. Indicates for him to put
his glasses on. Jay resists.

				KAY
		I've just been down the gullet of an
		interstellar cockroach. That's one of a
		hundred memories I don't want.

Jay takes the neuralyzer. Slips on his glasses.

				KAY
		See you around, sport.

Jay raises the neuralyzer. With a brilliant FLASH, the screen turns white.

				JAY
		No, you won't.

								CUT TO:

EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

CLOSE ON various tabloid headlines as a hand flicks through them. Here's
one:
			 Mets' Centerfielder Says:
		     "UFO MADE ME MISS HOME RUN BALL!"
And here's another one:
		    DETROIT HAS CAR THAT DEFIES GRAVITY!
			Secret Tests in N.Y.'s Tunnel
And a third:
			MAN AWAKENS FROM 30-YEAR COMA
		        Returns to Girl He Left Behind

A large photograph shows a smiling KAY, arm-in-arm with ELIZABETH RESTON,
his long-lost fiancee, in her back yard in Tempe, Arizona.

She holds a large bouquet of flowers, the same kind he brought but never
gave her thirty years ago.

JAY, who's reading the paper, smiles.

AT THE CURB, Jay hurries back to the LTD with the newspapers. ELLE,
(formerly Laurel), is waiting, leaning against the hood. Tailored black
suit. Black shoes. Short-cropped hair. The look never looked better.

				ELLE
		Zed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9
		emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks --
		Bulls game.

				JAY
		I'll talk to Dennis Rodman, it's his damn
		planet.

				ELLE
		Let's roll.

Both car doors SLAM, Jay drops it in gear, and the LTD BLASTS away from
the curb.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY BLOCK - DAY

The LTD is just one of many cars in a jam-packed Manhattan city block.

FROM UP IN THE CLOUDS

Manhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and suburban sprawl.

FROM THE STRATOSPHERE

The east coast of the United States is just part of a much larger land
mass.

FROM THE EOSPHERE

North America is just a small portion of the planet Earth.

FROM SPACE

Earth is just a tiny ball in our solar system.

FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE MILKY WAY

Our solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star field.

FROM OUTSIDE OUR GALAXY

The Milky Way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other creamy
spirals.

FROM THE OUTER REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE

There seems to be an edge to what we see, a curved border that seems to
close in on things around the perimeters, until everything that exists
seems to be contained in one tiny ball --

-- which is actually a marble resting on a strange-looking patch of red
dirt.

An ALIEN HAND reaches down and flicks the marble, sending it skittering
and bouncing across the dirt, where it CLICKS into a dozen other big blue
balls just like it.

				FADE OUT.

          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MIRROR AVIATOR SUNGLASSES

          Standard issue throughout the south to abusive, racist prison
          guards.

          Widen to reveal that, indeed, these glasses are on the
          sneering face of just such a man.
          We follow the guard

          DOWN A DINGY PRISON HALLWAY

          Paint peeling off the rusty bars. Somewhere, someone is
          playing harmonica. Prisoners yell complaints as he passes.
          He meets them all with--

                         GUARD
          Shut up, convict! Get yer hands
          off the bars!

          The guard passes through several levels of security doors,
          deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison --
          home of the scum of the scum.
          Meanwhile...

          PRISON VISITING ROOM

          The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read
          magazines, watch TV. Footsteps -- someone's here. Which
          pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do
          their jobs.

          The unseen visitor buzzes for help. They take their time
          getting off their asses. When they finally look up, their
          gaze becomes a leer. Follow it to:
          DEVIL GIRL, the visitor. Too tall, too muscled, but hot if
          you're into that kind of thing -- an R. Crumb drawing come to
          life.

          She holds a CAKE -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake
          right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook.

                         GUARD 2
          Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I
          guess even a turd gets flies to
          land on it.

                         GUARD 3
          Me, I like a big girl.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          They smirk, hoping for a reaction. Devil girl emits a low,
          sinister growl like an angry Doberman... The guards look at
          each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS:

                         GUARD 2
          I.D., visitation papers.

          BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH THE GUARD
          He reaches the end of the hallway. The biggest, most
          absurdly-reinforced double security door. He punches in a
          code.
          The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it
          squeaking and groaning the whole way. Whoever's behind this
          thing must've done something REAL bad.

          WITH DEVIL GIRL
          Going through the metal detectors, waved over with security
          wands. The guards are being thorough. Maybe more thorough
          than they need to be. They check everything -- even the
          cake. The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED.

                         GUARD 3
          She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but
          you know.
          They laugh, buzz her through.

          WITH THE GUARD
          The giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the
          hallway. Stops in front of a cell. Yells in:

                         GUARD
          Hey, Yaz! You got a visitor.
          Let's go, pretty boy.

                         VISITING ROOM
          Spare. Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured
          concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face
          of a guard.
          The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks
          like they're not taking chances.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake. She
          hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HER

                         BELOVED --
          YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider. A
          huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a
          grubby unshaven face...
          Everything about him seems strangely independently alive --
          every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the
          way Elvis was in his prime.
          He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING. A smirk plays on
          his mouth that says -- I'm smarter than you, asshole.
          The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and
          MANACLES. They dump him into one of the chairs. Devil Girl
          jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long.
          A guard pokes them with his billy club --

                         GUARD 2
          This ain't a conjugal visit.
          quit yer conjugating.

                         YAZ
          When's the last time you conjugated
          anything?

                         DEVIL GIRL
          I brought you a cake.

                         YAZ
          Thanks, darling.

                         (TO GUARDS)
          Hey could you cut this up for us?
          It's our anniversary. I'm romantic
          like that.
          A guard picks up the cake. Smirks and takes a dirty three-
          fingered scoop of frosting.

                         GUARD 2

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          Not great. She must.be good at
          somethin' else.
          They all LAUGH. He goes back for another scoop.

                         YAZ
          I wouldn't do that.

                         GUARD 2
          Why's that, convict?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         GUARD POV:
          Where he scraped away the frosting, REVEAL A HORRIBLE ALIEN

                         MOUTH

                         GUARD 2 (CONT'D)

                         WHAT TH--
          But in a flash, the mouth SPRINGS OUT -- IT BELONGS TO A
          VORACIOUS ALIEN -- another springs out behind it -- they
          consume the guard's entire face.

                         YAZ
          That's why.
          The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of
          grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as
          their master, snarling and hungry for blood.
          The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER.-- he
          launches his aliens, taking them all out.
          Yaz "holsters" the aliens and...

          THE PRISON BREAK IS ON!!
          One guard, badly wounded, crawls to SOUND THE ALARM
          In the reflection of a pair of blood-spattered aviator
          glasses -- Devil Girl puts the guard down with his own
          weapon.
          She uses one of the cake-aliens like a saw to get Yaz out of
          his chains.

                         YAZ
          There's nothing sexier than a girl
          killing for me.

          She runs a hand over his bicep.

                         DEVIL GIRL
          You got so strong in prison.

          Yaz notices the almost-dead guard:

                         YAZ
          I'm not just a man of brute force,
          you know. I prefer to be known for
          my rapier wit--
          His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier --
          impaling the guard--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         YAZ (CONT'D)
          --and tongue.
          The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl KISS.
          They collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to saw
          open the door.

          YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL ESCAPE
          Prisoners go nuts, guards scramble -- smoke, screaming,
          chaos.
          Yaz and Devil Girl, armed with weapons they took off the dead
          guards, BLAST THEIR WAY OUT.
          He's a sociopathic badass... and she's no slouch either.
           Along the way, Yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs
          an armload of weapons -- Shotguns, pistols, and a Rocket-
          Propelled grenade (RPG).
          He uses and discards them as he goes.
          They head for the front gate and FREEDOM...
          But..
          They turn the corner and find 50 GUARDS in FULL RIOT GEAR --
          Plexiglass shields, helmets, shotguns -- all aimed at Yaz.
          All Yaz has left is his RPG.

          GUARD ON MEGAPHONE
          Give it up, Yaz! There's no way
          out!
          A beat of stand-off -- Yaz and Devil girl facing off against
          the 50 Guards... No one blinking...
          Prisoners. watching... what's gonna go down?

                         GUARD
          You can't win. You've only got one
          shot in there!
          Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it. The
          guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear.

                         YAZ
          You look hot. Mind if I open a
          window?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          The guards share a look - huh?? Yaz grins, turns his RPG
          towards the wall behind the guards. The guards' faces go

          WIDE WITH TERROR.

                         GUARD
          Hey! Whoa! What are you doing?
          Don't do that!

          SLAM!
          Yaz blasts a hole in the wall -- the guards are IMMEDIATELY
          SUCKED OUT like from a hole blown in an airplane.
          What the...?
          Yaz steps through the hole.

                         ON YAZ
          As he and Devil girl step through the hole, take a deep,
          satisfied breath of FREEDOM.
          Reveal we are on...

          THE SURFACE OF THE MOON
          The signage on the prison reads INTERGALACTIC DEPARTMENT OF

          CORRECTIONS, LUNAR DIVISION
          Yaz looks up at the BLUE MARBLE OF EARTH, smiles.
          As Yaz fixes his gaze on our planet, his hair, his fringes
          INDEPENDENTLY ARTICULATE YAZ'S MALEVOLENT EMOTIONS... they
          also seem drawn here. Like bees, they express a collective
          intelligence.

                         YAZ
          I'm coming for you...
          Following Yaz's gaze to the Earth, we launch into...

          MiB credits fly us through the Galaxy.
          Ending on a PARTICULARLY INHOSPITABLE LOOKING PLANET
          As it revolves, we observe its strange craters and surface,
          where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases...

          KAY'S VOICE (V.0.)
          When you really think about it, the
          universe is a pretty awful place.
          Full of danger, brutality, and ten
          million kinds of scum. So the
          trick is to find one or two things
          that make life in this cesspool
          worth living.
          And reveal we are actually looking at...

                         PEKING DUCK
          Rotating on a spit.
          JAY and KAY watch this awful duck rotate.

                         JAY
          That? That nasty, greasy thing
          makes your life worth living?
          There's people eating here, younger
          than that duck.

                         KAY
          I was talking about the noodles.
          Best noodles in town.
          And we are in

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - CHINATOWN, NYC - NIGHT

          Tanks everywhere filled with strange fish. An eclectic NY
          crowd eats -- Wall Street guys, hipsters, a Chinese family or
          two, a couple of NYU professor types who love the
          "authenticity" of this place.
          KAY flashes a badge to the OWNER, Chinese.

                         KAY

          The tanks in the back, Wu.

          Oh... so sorry... please no

          Hey, save the chop socky bullshit
          for the locals, Wu. We need to see
          the kitchen.

          MR. WU

          Why are you busting my balls, Jay?

          Jay, take a look at this.
          Wu protests, Jay blows by him.

          Jay taps on the glass -- the fish SNARLS, making Jay JUMP.

          Look, Wu. You can serve it to

          locals get earth fish. REAL earth
          fish. The kind that doesn't jump
          out of their stomach and get
          everyone asking a lot of annoying
          questions. Like, "Why is my lunch

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

          Wu walks them to a table, seats them.

          (for benefit of customers)
          Allow me most honorable benefit of
          get you noodles.

          Wu walks off. Jay CLOCKS the other diners.

                         JAY
          Something about this strike you as
          weird?

          Yeah, look -- clean fork.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         JAY
          Look at table two over there. They
          haven't ordered a thing. When's
          the last time Wu let someone sit at
          a table without ordering? And
          table five over there just drank
          his third cup of duck sauce.
          Now Kay's radar is up --

                         KAY
          Come to think of it... Why is Wu
          getting our noodles... outside?

                         JAY
          Because it's about to go down.
          Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.

          MR. WU
          Sorry, guys.
          Wu leaves, quickly pulling the door behind, him. The guys
          reach for their weapons.
          And IT GOES DOWN --
          It's a SET-UP, and everyone in the restaurant is in on it --
          The hipsters, the families, the wall street guys -- all draw
          various forms of ALIEN WEAPONS and ATTACK
          It's like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping
          truckloads of ordnance at each other. Close hand-to-hand
          combat. Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and they're not
          taking any chances.
          Right ahead of the onslaught, JAY GIVES KAY A HAND SIGNAL --
          He nods, and they dive in opposite directions, SAVING

          THEMSELVES FROM GETTING HIT.
          But not for long...
          An explosive lands between them --
          Kay gets BLOWN OUT THE FRONT WINDOW, rolls to a stop in the
          middle of the

                         DESERTED STREET
          Silhouetted at the top of the block -- a biker on a
          motorcycle. As he pulls into the light -- YAZI

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          Kay's eyes go wide with recognition.
          Yaz grins a murderous grin...

                         YAZ
          Some things are worth waiting for.

                         KAY
          Then come get it, you worthless

                         PIECE OF--
          Yaz guns the engine and BEARS DOWN ON KAY.

          INSIDE WITH JAY
          Getting the worst of it.
          A messy battle THROUGH THE KITCHEN.
          The Giant fish's tank gets shot -- the FISH IS FREE! And he
          goes RIGHT AFTER JAY!

                         JAY
          You probably took that whole
          catfish thing the wrong way --
          The fish SNARLS AFTER HIM -- lunges and BITES!

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          I was jealous, you know? Because
          you're so pretty!
          Jay BATTLES THE FISH-- throwing pots and pans in its mouth,
          squirting hot sauce -- working like a lion tamer to keep it

                         AT BAY--

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay! KAY!!! Little help! Little
          help!

          OUTSIDE WITH KAY
          Yaz getting closer. He pulls out a CANNON of a gun, fires
          into the air.

                         YAZ
          This time you don't have your
          friends to tell you what happens
          next.

                         KAY
          Oh, I know what happens next.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Kay draws his EQUALLY BADASS-LOOKING WEAPON --

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          I've been waiting forty years for
          another shot at you, scum.
          Kay takes aim and... CLICK! Empty.

          you survive this encounter, please

          Kay throws the gun at Yaz.
          Yaz laughs. Gets Kay in his sights.

                         YAZ
          All I wanted was justice, Kay.
          Justice for my brothers. But you
          had to meddle, didn't you?

                         KAY
          They deserved what they got.

                         YAZ
          Why don't you say that to their
          faces when you see them...
          Puts the barrel in Kay's face and BOOM!!!
          Yaz goes up in a GIANT EXPLOSION!!
          Reveal Jay, just fired the shot.
           Jay looks like total hell, beaten up, covered with 8 kinds of
          slime and alien guts.
          He stumbles over to Kay, who in contrast looks perfectly
          pressed.

                         JAY
          So I was thinking about making a
          chart for each time I save your
          ass. And when I do it ten times,
          you buy me lunch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          Kay lets out a long, weary sigh.

                         KAY
          Will you settle for a drink?

          INT. DESTROYED CHINESE RESTAURANT

          Kay reaches behind the counter for a couple of beers. Jay is
          on his phone.

                         JAY

                         (INTO PHONE)
          We're gonna need a cleanup on the
          corner of Canal and Mott. And
          bring a net. Biggest one you've
          got.
          Follow Jay's gaze -- the giant fish flops its way down Canal.
          Jay and Kay back in their booth, Jay grabs a couple noodles
          off another table and starts eating.
          Through the scene, various MiB clean-up crew people work the
          crime scene.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          Why aren't you eating?

                         (GETS NOTHING)
          So what the hell was that guy?
          Kay's quiet. Ominously quiet. Weighing his words:

                         KAY
          Yaz. Put him away a long time ago.
          Biggest mistake I ever made.

                         JAY
          Why? Was he the wrong guy?

                         KAY
          No. Should've killed him.

                         JAY
          Yeah, well, don't worry, I think I
          took care of him.

                         KAY
          That was too easy.

                         JAY
          I make it look easy. That's the
          problem with being my partner.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         JAY (CONTD)
          You get used to my game. It's what
          Dr. Phil would call taking for
          granted.

                         KAY
          You don't get it, hoss. This guy
          is different. Worse than anyone.
          He tried to blow up the Earth but I
          stopped him. He developed a
          dislike for me and for certain
          behaviors of mine, such as being
          alive.

                         JAY
          C'mon, you know better {than anyone.
          What does an MiB agent call it when
          12 alien species try to kill him?
          Tuesday.
          Jay laughs at his own joke. Kay just stares.

                         KAY
          Maybe.
          (calling off to cleanup

                         GUYS)
          Make sure you get all of him, I
          mean it! He's an assembler!

                         CLEANUP GUY
          Yes, sir, Agent Kay.

                         JAY
          Seriously, man, those noodles'll
          kill you before he does. I got
          your back.

                         KAY
          I know you do.
          Stares at his noodles a while, like there's answers in there:

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          I used to play a game with my
          daddy. What would you want for
          your last meal. Could do worse
          than this.

                         JAY
          Oh, yeah? I used to play a game
          with my dad, too. Called catch.
          I'd throw the ball, and then it'd
          hit the house `cause he WASN'T

          THERE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         KAY
          Do me a favor, don't badmouth your
          old man.

                         JAY
          Hard to badmouth someone you don't
          know.

                         (CHECKS HIMSELF)
          Alright, forget it. The past is
          the past. And right now we have
          something much more important to
          talk about. Bowling Night.

                         KAY
          I'm tired.

                         JAY
          Tired? What -- you afraid I'm
          gonna take that MVP trophy away
          from you?

                         KAY
          Petrified. See you later.
          Kay takes a few tired steps and turns back --

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          And slick? Watch yourself. A guy
          like Yaz can come after you when
          you least expect it. Anywhere,
          anytime.
          Jay watches Kay walk away. Looks like he's carrying a heavy
          load. Turns his attention to the clean up crew:

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          What part of clean up everything
          don't you understand? There's a
          spleen on that car!

                         CLEANUP GUY
          On it, sir.

                         DARK ALLEY
          A glow of a cigarette illuminates the face of... Devil Girl!
          She reaches down. We see -- a finger with the distinctive
          Skull, inching its way along the road.

                         DEVIL GIRL
          You okay, baby? Momma's got you.
          now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

          MIB HQ - LATER THAT NIGHT
          Jay at his desk -- papers and folders everywhere -- SEARCHING

          FOR SOMETHING.
          We see what he's looking through -- KAY'S OLD CASE FILES.

                         JAY
          Yaz... Yaz... Yaz... Where are you,
          Yaz...?
          And he FINDS IT!

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Here we go...
          Jay opens the YAZ INCIDENT REPORT

                         INSIDE:
          - Pictures of Yaz
          - A type-written report telling us YAZ APPREHENDED BY AGENT

          KAY... JULY 16, 1969
          - Farther down on the page, a CASUALTY REPORT: ONE

          CASUALTY... HUMAN DEAD AT THE SCENE...

          ZED (O.S.)
          Ready to bring the pain?
          Reveal Zed in his ridiculous bowling outfit.

          BOWLING ALLEY - LATER THAT NIGHT
          A sign says: CLOSED FOR LEAGUE NIGHT
          We follow a couple normal-looking BOWLERS into

          INT. BOWLING ALLEY

          Safely inside, the Bowlers remove their heads -- which become
          their bowling balls.
          It's the LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME -- ALIENS VS. MIB AGENTS
          MiB agents and aliens say hi, exchange trash-talk.
          We see shots of games in progress:
          An alien rolls a ball -- when it gets to the end of the lane,
          it sticks out arms, taking down all the pins.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          The aliens cheer, slap tentacles, clink beers and swallow
          them whole. A many-armed alien re-sets the pins.
          A giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul
          line... and -- gutter ball! He gets mad and shoots the pins
          with his laser-eyes.
          We end up with JAY AND THE MIB TEAM, NOT BOWLING BECAUSE

          THEY'RE WAITING FOR KAY --
          Zed paces, wearing way too much bowling regalia.

                         ZED
          Where's Kay? We either roll or
          forfeit -- and I didn't put this on
          to forfeit!

                         JAY
          Alright, Bowling Robot, do what we
          built you for.
          Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those
          white trash T-shirts that reads "10 reasons why Bowling is
          better than Women."

                         ROBOT

                         (ROBOT VOICE)
          This is my time to shine.
          Robot fires a ball directly down into the floor. An awkward
          beat as we hear the ball puncture four floors. Then a car
          alarm.

                         ROBOT (CONT'D)
          There goes my perfect game.

                         (ROBOT LAUGH)
          Ha ha ha.

                         JAY
          Guess it's on me.
          Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches, willing it towards
          the pins -- which SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY! But Jay's roll is
          too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- a

          STRIKE!
          Jay and his teammates triumphant! The frame of a lifetime!
          Jay looks around --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Of course -- the one time Kay isn't
          here...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          MIB HQ - TUNNEL VENT ROOM
          Jay enters -- looks a little worse for wear, like somebody
          who did some celebrating last night.
          We see why -- when he hoists his GIANT, RIDICULOUS MIB

          BOWLING TROPHY.

                         JAY
          Check it out--
          The trophy raises a triumphant fist -- we realize it is in
          fact AN ALIEN.

                         TROPHY
          We're number one! In your face!
          Suck it!

                         JAY
          Look who's league MVP.

                         GUARD
          Big surprise, you win every year.
          That's weird...

                         JAY
          I... huh?

          MIB HQ - HEADQUARTERS
          Jay, in a good mood, flaunts his trophy to everyone in the
          office. The trophy continues its stream of obnoxious trash
          talk.

                         JAY
          Where are you, Kay? I think you
          want to see this. It's the bowling
          MVP trophy with MY name on it.
          Jay works his way to his desk.
          Kay's already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his work,
          his back to Jay.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Maybe you want to think twice next
          time you ditch me.
          Kay, absorbed in work, doesn't answer.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

          KAY (O.S.)
          (back still to camera)
          Yeah?

                         JAY
          Yeah, I just wanted to show you
          this so I could say--

                         (SEEING HIM)
          Who the hell are YOU???
          Reveal -- CLINT EASTWOOD
          I'm agent Kay.

                         JAY
          You new around here?

                         " KAY"

                         (LAUGHS)
          Good one, partner.

                         JAY
          Yeah, okay, but I need the other
          Kay. You know, craggy old white
          guy... well, DIFFERENT craggy old
          white guy.
          I got you something.
          He hands over a "World's Best Partner" mug --

                         "KAY" (CONT'D)
          Have I told you today how much I
          appreciate working together?

                         JAY
          What the HELL is going on here?
          Why are you pretending to be Kay?

                         " KAY FR
          You seem upset. Let's go get some
          coffee and talk about our feelings.

                         JAY
          How about instead, you go find me
          THIS guy?
          Jay opens the YAZ file and pulls out a picture of KAY. But
          now, splashed across Kay's photo, the words:

          KILLED IN ACTION -- JULY 16, 1969

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          Jay stares at the photo --- in it, we notice Kay is NOW

          WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Killed? In 1969?
          Jay grabs the YAZ FILE -- the one he looked through last
          night -- but now everything is different.
          We see -- the incident report stating ONE CASUALTY - AGENT

          KAY, DEAD AT SCENE...
          Jay can't believe it, he keeps reading...
          Snatches of the typewritten incident report
          The casualty report

          ONE CASUALTY... AGENT KAY, DEAD AT SCENE...
          A photo of Kay WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION.
          Jay stares, struck by this --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay's dead? How? Why?
          The Men in Black Computer/Big Board sounds the alarm!

          done for. Sorry, kid, it's been a
          good ride.

          A GENERAL FREAK-OUT ENSUES
          Jay remains calm:

                         JAY
          Whoa, what's everyone freaking out
          about? We had one of these last
          week.
          "Kay" hides under a desk, weeping.

                         "KAY"
          We're all gonna die!

                         JAY
          Wait - what is everyone's problem?
          What about that pan-galactic
          missile shield thing?

                         ZED
          Sure, great idea, if we had one.

           COMPUTER (V.0.)
           Now running pan-galactic shield

          I wanted to build one years ago,
          but Kay talked me out of it.

                         JAY
          Kay talked you out of it? Kay
          wouldn't do that. He's the most
          distrustful person in the galaxy.
          He personally set up that system to
          defend our planet from the scum of
          the universe.

                         " KAYÂ
          I thought we didn't have any
          enemies anymore. A stranger's just
          a friend you haven't met.

                         JAY
          Yeah, that's working out great.
          Look, I don't know what's frying
          everyone's brains, but I remember
          the missile shield --- Kay -- the
          real Kay -- loved that thing. He
          wouldn't shut up about it. I mean,
          that thing was all Kay.

                         (REALIZING)
          But Kay's dead. He's been dead for
          years. But I knew him yesterday.
           Jay looks at the YAZ file. Gears turning. He grabs a
          picture of Yaz --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Where the hell did he.get an iPhone
          in 1969?

          EXTREME CLOSE UP ON PICTURE --
          Peeking out of Yaz's jacket -- an iPhone.
          Something clicks --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (REMEMBERING)
          Kay said Yaz can get you anywhere,
          anytime. Any TIME. So Yaz killed
          Kay in 1969 and now there's no
          missile shield.
          Jay realizes something and RUNS OFF

                         OKAY"
          I love you, Jay!

                         JAY
          You're definitely not Kay!

          JAY RUNS THROUGH MIB
          He runs by people dealing with the world coming to an end:

          COMPUTER (V.0.)
          Nine minutes to impact. I always
          loved you, microwave...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.
          On the microwave -- it beeps plaintively.
          Jay runs off with purpose...

          STREETS OF NYC
          July in the city. A perfect summer day. Kids eat ice cream.
          Old ladies head to matinees. The streets of New York team
          with humanity, blissfully unaware that they are about to die.
          In other words, a Tuesday.
          Jay runs through Time Square, where guys sell stuff on
          blankets.
          Desperately looking for someone...
          Among the sellers, a suspicious-looking guy wearing a strange
          mixture of anachronistic clothing -- tri-cornered hat.
          As soon as he sees Jay, his eyes go wide and HE FLEES.
          Jay grabs something off the blanket and smacks him -- lays
          him out.

                         JAY
          Where you going in such a hurry,
          Obadiah? The past?

                         OBADIAH
          What are you talking about?
          He throws his arms up, revealing a pocket watch and a
          telescope.

                         JAY
          I know you've been time-travelling.

                         OBADIAH
          No way, man. I've just been here,
          totally legit, here in New
          Amsterdam. I mean -- Manahatta ... n
          I'm legit.

                         JAY
          Yeah? What's this?
          Reveal the thing he just hit him with -- a ship's bell with
          S.S. TITANIC on it.

                         OBADIAH
          I swear, I'm out of that. That's
          my grandmother's.

          What else you got here?

          Nothing, nothing man.

                         JAY
          Oh, yeah?
          Off a Dodo in a cage.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Is that a dodo bird?

                         OBADIAH
          Family pet.

                         JAY
          I think he'd be happier free.
          Jay frees the bird -- it runs, squawking...

                         OBADIAH
          Oh, come on, man!

                         JAY
          Interesting.
          Jay picks up Spider-Man 8 off the blanket. Featuring
          chubby, bald 50-year-old Tobey Maguire.

                         OBADIAH
          That's pirated, man. That ain't
          nothing.
          Jay rips open his jacket --

                         JAY
          And this?
          Reveal a copy of the Declaration of Independence..

                         OBADIAH
          Okay, okay, maybe I've been time
          travelling a little -- just for
          personal use, man, just enough to

                         GET BY--

                         JAY
          Listen -- I'll look the other way
          if you tell me who's selling time
          travel these days. I just want
          your supplier.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         OBADIAH
          No way, man. You don't mess with
          that guy. He'll kill you, me, and
          then he'll go after our families!

                         JAY
          Don't worry, he won't have time.

                         OBADIAH
          What do you mean?
          Jay forces the guy to look up-- we see the missiles.

                         JAY
          Those hit the sun in 8 minutes.
          You want to live out those minutes?
          Or you want me to take you out of
          your misery?
          Jay picks up an ancient weapon -- crossbow, blunderbuss --
          off the blanket and puts it to the criminal's head.

                         OBADIAH
          Okay, okay, but don't say I didn't
          warn you, man. You just signed
          your own death warrant.

                         JAY
          I just want a name.

                         OBADIAH
          Fine, but it's the last one you'll
          ever hear.

          AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM
          It'll only take a minute. You see,
          my nanny's phone number got erased
          from my favorites and I have to ask
          her what my daughter wants for her
          birthday.
          Jay takes the phone.

                         JAY
          Oh, I see the problem.
          He CHUCKS THE PHONE across the store, where it SMASHES TO
          PIECES. She leaves in a huff.

                         TREVOR
          I've always wanted to do that.
          okay, so here's what you do...
          Trevor pulls Jay in, ready to lay this top secret information
          on him...

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
          Okay, so go to the clock app. And
          shake it.

          That's it?
          Jay does it.

          Now you just type in the year you
          want to travel to...
          On the phone -- it's "augmented reality" -- the image through
          the phone is the image of the targeted time period.

                         JAY
          Okay, thanks.

                         TREVOR
          Now listen. This is highly
          crucial: Time travel is nothing to
          mess with. You can't change
          anything, you can't use new
          technology or all of space-time can
          just -- kablooey!

          Yeah, well, is it ok if I change

          THAT?

                         TREVOR
          Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's cool.
          Jay is about to "enter" time travel...

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
          Wait -- hold on a second. If you
          go -- I'm just gonna stay... and be
          dead?

                         JAY
          Don't worry, I'll fix it. You'll
          only be dead for a little while.
          Jay DISSOLVES INTO A TIME TRAVEL EFFECT...
          Cera is left alone. The missiles get EVER CLOSER...
          Trevor opens a "Voice Recorder" app:

                         TREVOR

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Trevor's last words. Dear
          posterity... Should anyone find
          this, let history remember that
          Trevor was a man of noble bearing,
          quiet dignity --

          (IMPACT!)

                         OH FUUUUUU-----

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          And the world is vapor.

          EVERYTHING GOES WHITE...

                         WHITE
          Pure white.
          Jay comes to, groggy, like he has the worst hangover of all
          time, brain bigger than his skull, trying to make his eyes
          focus.
          Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white
          environment -- Is this the afterlife?
          The reverie disrupted by a TOILET FLUSH
          The white resolves into

          INT. BATHROOM

          Jay realizes he's in a men's room, sitting in a urinal. The
          music transitions: Whatever hip-hop featuring a 60s sample
          was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s
          song itself, played over a tinny portable radio.
          He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of
          one of the stalls, washes his hands... and flips Jay a
          quarter.
          Jay stares at it a beat, confused. Misreading his confusion,
          the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter.

                         OFFICE WORKER
          What the heck, you're doing a great
          job.
          The kid leaves.
          Jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in...

          INT. HIGH 60'S OFFICE

          White guys on IBM Selectric typewriters as far as the eye can
          see -- like the office in the Apartment.
          Jay stops in his tracks, taking in the 1969-ness of it all.
          An officious guy, annoyed, runs up--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         OFFICIOUS GUY
          You're late! Where's Mr. Watkins'
          lunch?

                         JAY

                         OH--

                         OFFICIOUS GUY
          Did his girl not put in the order?
          The officious guy glares at the "girl" -- in her 60s.

          OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D)
          (shoves a bill in Jay's

                         HAND)
          Run down to Woolworth's -- Two
          hamburger sandwiches, fries, egg
          cream, and a pack of luckies. If
          you're back in half an hour, you
          can keep the change.
          Jay looks at the SINGLE DOLLAR BILL.

          OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D)
          On the double, OK?

                         JAY
          Yeah.
          Jay's moves to the elevator, waits for it. Pockets the
          profits of the racist misunderstandings.
          Elevator opens, the elevator operator opens the door -- Jay
          climbs in with a car full of older executives.
          Jay shakes his head, just taking this all in.

                          JAY (CONT'D)
          Wow. 1969. You're all dead now.
          Just as the elevator's about to close, a leggy blonde tosses
          him a set of keys.

                         BLONDE
          The Big Man wants his caddy. Chop-
          chop.
          The doors close.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

          EXT. PARKING LOT NEXT DOOR

          Jay's got the keys. He looks at the parking tag, walks down
          a row of beautiful classic cars, looking for the right car --
          stops and smiles.

          THE BIG MAN'S CADDY - JAY DRIVING
          Reveal Jay cruising in the most gorgeous 1964 Coupe deVille
          convertible. Fins, chrome, a thing of beauty.
          From the seat next to him -- a fedora. He puts it on,
          completing the look.
          In the background we notice the Leggy Blond getting yelled at
          by the guy who must be "The Big Man" Jay HONKS and waves --
          thank you!
          Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a
          minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York.
          A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS' "Can't Get Next to You"
          comes on the radio. Jay is swept up in the music and soon is

          SINGING ALONG AT FULL BLAST.
          At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian
          couple. They give him a disapproving look. The woman
          clutches her pearls just a little more protectively.
          He smiles and leans towards them.

                         JAY
          Guess what? Black president!
          He laughs and drives off.
          Pulls up at...

          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING

          The secret entrance to MiB HQ, familiar from the first movie.
          Jay strides up to the entrance and... can't open the door.
          Bangs on the door -- nothing. Shaking the knob, calling to
          the guard... nothing. From behind him:

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Help you? Look a little lost.

                         JAY
          Yeah, thanks, listen--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Jay turns and is face-to-face with two grinning Staten Island
          cops. He instantly realizes what's about to go down.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (SIGHS)
          Yeah, guess I knew this wasn't
          gonna be just people handing me
          money and Cadillacs.

                         COP 1
          'Scuse me?

                         JAY
          Nothing, officer. I'll be on my
          way.

                         COP 2
          That's an awful nice car.

                         JAY
          Thanks.

                         COP 1
          Kind of work you do, individual of
          your particular... ethnic
          persuasion... to buy a car like
          that?

                         COP 2
          Wouldn't be anything illegal, would
          it?

                         COP 1
          You an athlete or something?

                         JAY
          Yeah, I'm the North American
          champion of kiss my ass.
          The cop loses his smile, turns to his partner:

                         COP 1
          That sound like resisting arrest to
          you?

                         COP 2
          Sure did.
          They grab him, start to frisk him --

                         COP 2 (CONT'D)
          Well, well. Boy, you're gonna have
          a little problem explaining THIS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.
          The cop holds up Jay's HIGH-TECH GUN -- the NOISY CRICKET
          and his NEURALIZER.
          A BLACK CROWN VIC SCREECHES UP between the cops and JAY.
          Out steps KAY -- but 40+ years younger.

                         KAY
          (flashes a badge)
          I'll take it from here.

                         COP
          Who the hell are you?

                         KAY
          Agent Kay, Division 2, special...
          (gives Jay a look)
          .black ops. Thank you for your
          cooperation, if I could ask you to
          look here for a moment --
          Kay pulls out what looks like a NEURALIZER -- and swiftly
          beats each one over the head -- it's just a BLACKJACK -- they
          crumple.

                         JAY
          Kay? Kay, is that you? Oh, man
          it's good to see you, buddy!
          Jay hugs Kay -- who remains stony-faced. Jay gets a little
          choked up to see his friend alive -- Kay is a rock.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Look at you, all... sort-of-
          young... Kay!

                         KAY
          That's got to be the first time an
          unregistered alien caught sneaking
          onto Earth was happy to see me.
          Jay pulls away, realizing--

                         JAY
          Oh! You think -- aw,that's funny.
          No, it's not like that. You see,
          I'm your partner.

                         KAY
          If I had a partner I'd know it.

                         JAY
          There's a simple explanation for
          that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         KAY
          I'm all ears.

                         JAY
          You see I'm your partner...
          (knows he's about to sound

                         CRAZY)
          In the future. And I came back to
          save you.
          A longdry stare.

                         KAY
          Well, thank you very much.

                         JAY -
          Hey, no problem, man. I got you--

                         KAY
          Yeah, thought I'd heard them all.
          Usually, they offer a great gift to
          the people of Earth in exchange for
          refuge. Time-travelling partner
          from the future -- that's some
          extra-credit right there, and I do
          appreciate you bringing some much-
          needed variety to what can be a
          very dull job. But I'm still gonna
          have to bring you in.

                         JAY
          Yeah, ok, I know it sounds a little-

                         KAY
          It sounds a LOT--

                         JAY
          That's why I'm going to prove it to
          you... Because if I weren't from
          the future, would I know about --
          your little top-secret headquarters
          right HERE??
          He tries to force the door open. Nothing.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          I said -- HERE?
          (tries - nothing)

          HERE??!?
          Jay finally kicks the door open --
          And inside... we SEE...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          An abandoned building, filled with spiders, etc.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Right. Not here yet. But it will
          be. Gonna need to get rid of the
          raccoons and bats and stuff, but...
          it'll be real nice. Game room over
          there for your pinball, you love
          your pinball. Lotta good times
          there -- I'm going for an extra
          ball, Jay! you'd say. And I'd be
          there. With you. Partners.
          Long stare from Kay.

                         KAY
          Let's go. And word of advice -= I
          don't know what it's like on your
          planet, but around here, a guy with
          your... complexion in a car like
          that is gonna get some attention he
          doesn't want.

          EXT. NEW JERSEY STATE PARKWAY

          We hear the way-too-loud death-rattle exhaust note of what
          sounds like ten Harleys at once.
          Reveal -- Yaz, the nightmare biker, looking like Dennis
          Hopper meets Satan, riding a badass custom skull-themed rig
          that might have dropped out of the brain of Stanley Mouse.
          His skull ring gleams on his pinkie. Devil Girl sits behind
          him, hands on his shoulders.
          We ride with them a beat, tearing down the highway...
          They STOP AT A LIGHT -- even with a brightly-painted microbus
          full of hippies.
          One of the hippies leans out --

                         HIPPIE
          Hey, you guys like to party? Care
          to make a trade for the mama?
          Yaz pulls out his alien "guns." The stoned hippie smiles
          serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths. Makes a
          peace sign.

                         HIPPIE (CONT'D)
          Make love, not war.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          Yaz "fires" the alien -- it launches into the microbus --
          followed by its brother.
          The microbus rocks, hippies scream, the bus dents from the
          inside-out. On a bumper sticker: If This Van's a-rockin',
          don't come a knockin'.
          The guns, finished, return to Yaz.
          Yaz surveys the carnage, picks up a medallion off one of the
          hippies. But looking at it more closely, frowns and throws
          it away.
          The head back on their way... Blood drips over the Ass, Gas
          or Grass bumper sticker...
          We dissolve from the blood to a deep red STRAWBERRY SUNDAE.
          Widen to reveal we are in...

          INT. HORN AND HARDART'S

          A great NYC automat...
          The kind of place you go when you like to be alone.
          Loners and weirdos populate the tables, minding their own
          business. Immigrants read foreign papers.
          Jay follows Kay as they walk by the glorious deco machines
          offering pies... pastries.., beverages...

                         JAY
          Is this your favorite place? Makes.
          sense. Zero human interaction.
          Kay ignores him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          So how old are you?

                         KAY
          Twenty-six.

                         JAY
          Really? Wow, you got some city
          miles on you.
          Jay laughs. Kay ignores him, stops in front of a machine
          offering "SPECIALS".
          Jay grabs a paper off a nearby table: We see headlines about
          Nixon, Vietnam, the Apollo Launch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          Jay looks at the date: July 14, 1969.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          The fourteenth. Then we have two
          days.
          Kay really takes his time, picking out the right sandwich.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Hey, look, I know your lunch is
          important, but like I said, we only
          have two days here.

                         KAY
          Here we go...
          Kay puts some money in the machine -- is about to make his
          selection. Jay reacts to it -- GROSS!
          We see -- the most unappealing ham sandwich ever. The meat
          is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy. No
          one in their right mind would buy this sandwich.

                         JAY

          A BEAT of undignified hand-slap-fighting--

          INT. MIB 1969 HQ

          A cloud of smoke... It clears and reveals
          Mid-century futurism with a martini lunch office vibe. It's
          how Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury would have imagined the MiB
          offices.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.
          The cloud of smoke comes from everyone smoking. Aliens run
          around with ashtrays, cocktail shakers and cigarettes. The
          alien smokers smoke from surprising orifices.
          The !liB agents have the feel of ivy league privilege. Very
          male and very white. Women are there to be secretaries and
          eye candy.
          Two many-armed aliens stock the automat. Kay tosses one the
          sandwich, it goes right back into the automat.
          Jay recognizes the aliens -- it's the twins!

                         JAY
          Hey! [long alien name] and Bob!
           Don't worry, you guys get a big
          promotion in, like, 20 years.
          Kay takes Jay down an escalator. Quick atmospheric
          establishing shots of MiB '69:
          - A wall of Black and White TVs monitoring the aliens of the
          times: Castro... Yoko... Hendrix...
          - A cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very
          high-tech camera. Reveal they're using it to watch a
          secretary's ass. She gets wise, turns -- they raise their
          martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible!
          - Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool.
          - Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go
          clean something up.
          - An MiB barbershop quartet practices.

          Typical interrogation room table in the middle.
          Kay pulls out a giant form -- it looks like 10 tax returns

          Oh, we're gonna do the forms now.
          Listen, Kay, I know you're gonna do
          what you're gonna do, but we're

          There's a killer out there. Goes

          Never heard of any Yaz.

                         JAY
          You will. Here's what to look for.
          Long hair, leather, looks kind of
          like a biker. You'll know him from
          the skull ring on his pinky. He's
          trying to blow up the Earth and you
          get in his way somehow so he kills
          you. This Friday. In Florida.
          So, if you want to live -- do not
          go to Florida.

                         KAY
          Florida? I hate Florida. I hate
          everything South of Virginia. If
          that's what you came to tell me,
          you're wasting your time.

                         JAY
          Man, you're as stubborn as you
          always were. I mean -- always will
          be. Look, It's not just about you.
          Because he kills you, you don't
          live long enough to build the
          defense shield. And without a
          defense shield, the Earth gets
          destroyed. You get it? He kills
          you, the Earth gets destroyed. I
          have to save you from him so we can
          save the planet.

          It's down to Jay and Kay.

          grab him roughly, force him onto the gurney. Jay keeps
          flailing.

          Damn. You will! I swear!
          Kay signals -- the Neuralizer powers up.
          And Jay is on the conveyor belt into the machine. This is
          all about to be over. Jay thinks desperately for a way out,
          THEN-- Eureka!!

          TERRIFYING POV -- as he slides through the claustrophobic
          Neuralizer chamber -- the tubes powering down just in time,
          inches away from him.
          Jay crawls out of the Neuralizer, shaken.

          You see, Kay? It's me--

           Kay leads a "LOBOTOMIZED" Jay through HQ.

                          KAY
           'Scuse me, boys. Just did a code
           43 on this one.

                         JAY
          How's it going, fellas? Look, I
          put on my pants.
          He feels one of the agent's faces.
          Kay leads him to the exit. He talks to Jay as if Jay is a
          dim 3rd-grader who speaks little English:

                         KAY
          You are a tourist from Kansas. A
          city slicker took your wallet at
          the bus station...
          Kay leads Jay to a SET OF DOORS MARKED "EXIT to STREET" --

          MANNED BY MIB AGENTS.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Two out.
          The agents nod to Kay and WAVE HIM THROUGH-THE EXIT...
          Which deposits them in...

          INT. SHOWWORLD CENTER

          The peepshow megaplex from the bad old days of time square.
          A creepy pervert sits in a booth. Puts money into the
          machine.
          The wall SLIDES UP -- and to his surprise, instead of a
          peepshow...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          Jay and Kay climb out. Off the creep's reaction:

                         JAY
          Aww. Did I spoil the mood?

          INT. CROWN VIC - KAY DRIVING

          On the New Jersey State Parkway --

                         KAY
          You'd better not be wasting my time-

                         JAY
          Yeah, yeah. Window out of my head.
          But hey -- if I don't save you, I'm
          dead anyway. So do what you want
          to me -- just make sure you watch
          out for yourself.
          They pull up to...

          EXT. VINCENZI BROTHERS WASTE MANAGEMENT - OFFICES

          A squat shack on the edge of a dump, home office to a
          "legitimate local business."
          The windows are bloodied and broken from the inside.
          Corpses of wiseguys litter the front of the building, all
          showing disturbing spore growth. [please see
          http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuKjBIBBALS for reference]
          The corpses DEMATERIALIZE and disappear.

                         JAY
          This doesn't look like a mob hit.

                         KAY
          That's a hell of an observation.
          What gave it away?

                         JAY
          Spores. Dematerializing corpses.
          And THAT.
          Jay points beyond the building... a SHEER DROP
          Which is the edge of a HUGE SMOKING CRATER --
          And how did this crater get here?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.
          In the center, a GIANT ROCKET, all chrome and Flash Gordon.
          It formed the crater on landing.

                         KAY
          We're going in.
          Kay draws his weapon.

                         JAY
          Aren't you gonna give me a.gun?

                         KAY
          Right.
          He pulls out a Smith and Wesson, dumps the bullets, and hands
          it over.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Try not to get in my way.

                         JAY
          You try not to get in MY way.
          Jay and Kay move towards the building... BAM! BAM! BAM!!
          Someone's firing at them -- they dive for cover.
          More GUNSHOTS --
          Jay gives Kay THE SIGNAL, WE SAW IN THE CHINESE RESTAURANT

                         KAY
          What the hell is that?

                         JAY
          Stay behind me. You need to stay
          alive.

                         KAY
          The hell I will.
          Jay tries to go in -- Kay pushes him out of the way and goes
          in first.

                         VINCENZI BROTHERS
          Jay and Kay bust in -- almost fall into the room because
          they're squabbling over who's first --
          Then - BAM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          Someone's hiding under a desk, holding a gun over his head,
          firing randomly.
          Kay gets GRAZED --
          They dive for cover. Kay's right hand is bleeding.

                         JAY
          Huh. So that's how you got the
          scar.
          Jay tosses his EMPTY GUN into the corner -- the guy under the
          desk fires FIVE TIMES - EMPTYING HIS GUN!
          Jay sprints at him, flips the table -- it's a terrified,
          quivering WISEGUY. Jay grabs him and DISARMS HIM.
          The guy is FREAKED OUT.

                         WISEGUY

                         [TERRIFIED BLUBBERING]

                         JAY
          What'd he look like?

                         WISEGUY

                         [BLUBBERING]

                         JAY
          Pull it together!
          Jay SLAPS THE GUY.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          The guy who did this --- what'd he
          look like?

                         WISEGUY
          Looked like a biker... And he had
          a... He had a skull ring...
          Jay and Kay share a look.

                         JAY
          That's him.

          BACK WITH JAY AND KAY
          Walking up to Kay's car.
          In the background, MiB puts up a facade around the rocket --
          "Rocket Waste Disposal", techs take samples.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         JAY
          What about the witness? We don't
          have time to take him back to HQ to

                         NEURALIZE HIM--

                         KAY
          We've got something new. Portable
          Neuralizer.
          With a rumbling and BLASTS OF AIRHORNS, 18-wheelers drive up,
          housing the "portable" Neuralizer.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Can you believe how small these
          things are getting?

                         JAY
          Yeah.

                         KAY
          Okay, slick. I'm making a decision
          to believe you. Not because I do,
          but because I have to, you get me?
          He walks to the trunk, pops it open.
          He flips a switch, revealing a HIDDEN ARSENAL.
          He grabs a COOL GUN and gives it to Jay. Jay admires the

          DEADLY FIREARM.

                         JAY
          Aw, this means you like me, doesn't
          it?

                         KAY
          Let's go get this sunovabitch.
          They climb in but -- SCREECH!!!
          A Crown Vic swerves to a stop in front of them. Out pops an

          APOPLECTIC EX --

                         EX
          Kay! Don't move a goddamn muscle!
          I have you on 12 protocol
          violations!
          Kay looks to Jay.

                         KAY
          Make it thirteen.
          He GUNS IT -- THEY TEAR OFF...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         YAZ'S BIKE
          Widen - he's on his bike, pulling into

          NEW YORK CITY - TOLLBOOTH ON THE BRIDGE
          Yaz approaches the tollbooth, manned by a gruff NY no-BS, no-
          time for anyone TOLLBOOTH COLLECTOR.

                         TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER
          Exact change only.

                         YAZ
          Can you help a stranger, please?

                         TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER
          Oh, sure. That's what I'm here
          for. You see that thing behind
          you? That's New Jersey. Go home
          and get some change.

                         YAZ
          There's been a great injustice in
          the Universe. I must make it
          right.

                         TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER
          You know what's also a great
          injustice? Sitting in this box all
          day listening to people try to get
          out of paying the toll.

                         YAZ
          Let me ease your pain.
          On Yaz's evil grin...

          KAY AND JAY DRIVE INTO THE CITY

                         KAY
          Now tell me everything you know
          about this Yaz scumbag.

                         JAY
          In two days he's gonna kill you in
          Florida.

                         KAY
          Two days. Doesn't give me a lot of
          time. You couldn't have come back
          a week ago?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         JAY
          Sorry, I was distracted by the
          Earth blowing up.

                         KAY
          So we have two days to kill him
          before he kills me. Alright,
          there's one cesspool everyone
          washes up in sooner or later.
          Someone'll know something there.
          Come on. Let's take a drive to
          Alien Town.

                         JAY
          Alien Town?
          They drive under a sign indicating: EAST VILLAGE

                         WITH YAZ
          Cruising through NY. Devil Girl on the seat behind him. He
          pulls even with a patrol car.

                         YAZ
          Excuse me, officers of the law.
          Like you, I care a great deal. about
          justice and I'm looking for some
          people. Maybe you can help me.

                         OFFICER
          Okay -- get a shave and a haircut..
          They laugh.
          Yaz smiles sadly.

                         YAZ
          Have you ever lost someone close to
          you? I have. I've lost everyone.
          Everyone except them. Can you help
          me find them?
          He gives the cops a picture, they take it grudgingly -- we
          see it: a half dozen hippies wearing medallions.
          The cops look at each other and raise eyebrows.

                         OFFICER
          Only one part of town where people
          like that hang out...

          The historic Village landmark.
          Jay and Kay approach... 60s freaks eyeball the squares...

          IN THE ELEVATOR
          Jay and Kay ride to the sixth floor.

                         JAY
          There's gotta be something that
          connects you to Yaz. What cases
          are you working on?

                         KAY
          Well, I'got this whole dry ice
          thing.

                         JAY
          Dry ice? What's that? Someone get
          killed over some dry ice?
          Smuggling something in some dry
          ice?

                         KAY
          No. We just can't figure out what
          it is.

                         JAY
          Wow, you're pretty low on the totem
          pole, aren't you? The great Kay,
          looking for dry ice.

                         KAY
          Don't push your luck.
          The doors open, and we're in...

          A WAY-OUT 60'S PARTY
          Kay's on the hunt for someone. They weave their way through
          the far-out types, hear snippets of high-60s party
          conversations.
          Someone notices Jay's suit --

                         PARTY SNOB
          What are you, a time traveller?

                         JAY REACTS--

          PARTY SNOB (CONT'D)
          That suit is SO five years ago.
          Kay sees who he's looking for, grabs him:

                         KAY
          We need to talk.
          Reveal ANDY WARHOL -- and this is the Factory, and this is
          one of Warhols' famous parties.
          Draped on Warhol -- a bunch of strange hangers-on, his
          "stars."

                         ULTRAVIOLET
          Yum, pigs are getting cute.
          Jay smiles -- she looks skeeved out.

                          ULTRAVIOLET (CONT'D)
          I meant the young one.
          Warhol speaks with his strange -- yes, almost alien --
          affect.

                         WARHOL
          It's not really a good time to
          talk. I'm creating a party.
          (sighs, totally put out)
          But... Maybe if he asks me.

                         JAY
          What - me?

                         WARHOL
          I would never say no to anything
          that came out of that beautiful
          mouth...
          Jay is visibly uncomfortable. Kay nudges Jay - do it.

                         JAY
          [Grumbles about what he has to do
          for his partner].
          (then, to Warhol)
          We need to talk. Please.
          Warhol and his Stars ooh and ahh over Jay. Someone snaps a
          picture.

                         WARHOL
          Amazing, just amazing. Alright,
          you talked me into it. Follow me.

          PRIVATE STUDIO LOFT
          From here, a window looks out over the whole scene.
          Warhol leads the guys in, shuts the door and LOCKS IT.
          Immediately, his ENTIRE AFFECT CHANGES -- he rips off his
          WIG, lights a cigarette, and talks like a hard-nosed cop.

                         WARHOL
          Damnit, Kay, are you TRYING to blow
          my cover?

          Take it easy agent W, your cover is
          perfectly safe.

          Perfectly safe? Are you out of

          A sound... it. grows louder... we start to be able to make out

          slumming socialites to Black Panthers to the freakiest
          freaks...
          They surround a SKANKY GUY -- and whatever they're watching
          on TV is so mesmerizing it's like they're seeing the face of
          God...

          Jay walks around the TV -- REVEAL:
          They're watching CLASSIC EARLY 70S PONG.

          The SKANKY GUY controls it via a BIG MEDALLION hooked up to
          the TV antennae terminals. He's playing against a young
          clean-cut square.
          Jay grabs the wires and rips them out, cutting off the game.
          Everyone JEERS him.
          ON KAY, hearing the noise, turns to see what's going on.

          Just wondering where you got that.

                         SKANKY GUY
          Your mother.
          The crowd laughs.

          technology that hasn't been

          INVENTED FOR SEVEN YEARS?
          Jay grabs him by the throat.
          Partygoers react. Someone takes pictures. Someone claps in
          delight.

          Now how about you tell me where you
          really got it?
          The skanky guy knows he's in trouble.

                         SKANKY GUY
          Oh... uh... okay, no hassles,
          man... I got it from that dude over
          there... With the beard.
          Jay turns, lets go just long enough for the guy to LEAP OUT

                         THE WINDOW
          Jay takes off after him -- Kay joins
          And the CHASE IS ON

          CHASE THROUGH THE VILLAGE
          Jay and Kay chase the guy through various 60s locations - a
          commune, an ashram, a folk club, a protest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          Everywhere they are mistaken for "pigs" - people get in their
          way.
          To Jay's surprise, young Kay is a hell of a runner, in
          incredible shape. It gets competitive between them...
          Until Jay can't keep up -- Kay takes off...
          Kay runs the Skanky Guy down -
          Jay huffs and puffs his way over, grabs the medallion.

                         JAY
          Alright, one more time. Where'd
          you get this?

          Bullshit.
          Kay puts a gun on him.

          I stole it, okay?

          I heard they were Archanans.

          BACK IN THE CAR
          Jay and Kay head back to HQ. Kay drives, Jay stares at the
          $100 bill, squinting at it, turning it over --

                         JAY
          How about bible verses?
          Coordinates? Airplane flights?
          Shoe sizes?

                         KAY
          So this is how you do it in the
          future, huh? You just keep
          guessing until you figure it out?

                         JAY

                         (EUREKA)
          Phone numbers!
          They stop at a light.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          Suddenly -- WHAM! WHAM! Someone FRANTICALLY POUNDS on the
          trunk -- a frightened 12-year-old prostitute wearing what is
          basically Jodi Foster's Taxi Driver hooker costume --
          hotpants, mary janes, halter top. There's something familiar
          about her face...

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          For God's sake! Help me, would
          you? There's some maniac after me -

                         JAY
          Slow down -- who's after you?

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          He was like nothing I ever saw --
          crazy eyes, and this freaky skull
          ring.
          Jay and Kay look at each other:

                         JAY
          Get in.

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          Thank you so much. This is a
          dangerous city for a girl.
          The light turns green -- we're on the girl's face. Jay and
          Kay looking straight ahead.

                         JAY
          So where can we take you?

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          Just make a left up here.
          Kay does it... There's a rushing noise...
          In the back seat, Hot Pants Girl IS "INFLATING" AND BECOMING

          DEVIL GIRL!
          The car turns down a dark, deserted alley.

                         JAY
          Are you sure? Seems dangerous.

                         DEVIL GIRL
          Not for me.
          Reveal -- the girl has fully "inflated" into her natural form
          -- DEVIL GIRL! The outfit is grotesque on her.

          DEVIL GIRL ATTACKS

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.
          SET PIECE FIGHT in the car. Employing cool MiB tech built
          into the car.
          Devil Girl subdued, locked into the trunk in a "CONTAINMENT
          SACK" -- like what you'd use to stuff a raccoon into.
          The fight's over, the guys slump against the car.

                         JAY
          What the hell was that?

                         KAY
          I don't know, but I'd bet you two
          to one Yaz sent her.
          Beat. Light bulb moment for Jay --

                         JAY
          Say that again!

                         KAY
          I think Yaz sent her.

                         JAY
          No, the whole thing!

                         KAY
          I'd bet you two to one Yaz sent
          her.
          On Jay, realizing--
          He grabs the $100 bill --

                         JAY
          I know where they are!

          ON JAY AND KAY
          Walking -- we hear sounds of crowds, of cheering, REVEAL we

                         ARE AT--

          EXT. AQUEDUCT RACETRACK


                         JAY
          How are we going to find them? Any
          idea what an Archanan looks like?
          And then -- they see --

          AMID THE SEA OF GUYS IN SUITS, HATS, AND SKINNY TIES...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          A circle of what looks like Tibetan monks -- colorful,
          playful, dressed in robes.
          They could only be -- the Archanans.
          The group comprises one older Archanan -- the LAMA -- and
          three younger ATTENDANTS.

                         KAY
          I think I found them.
          They step into

          THE ARCHANANS' AURA
          Within the space around the Archanans, the chaos and noise of
          the crowd melts away. Deflected.
          There are three Archanans and one distinctive older one --

          THE LAMA.
          In the middle -- a giant pile of winnings.
          All is peaceful within this space. Faint chimes.
          They greet Jay and Kay happily, chant a strange mantra:

                         ARCHANANS

                         (CHANTING)
          King Lady Big Trouble Classy...
          The faint sound of an announcer:

          ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
          Results for the sixth race: King,
          Sweet Sophie, Big Trouble and Red
          Gent!

                         ARCHANANS

                         (CHANTING)
          Superba pays 3200 to one...

                         JAY
          You're in danger--

                         ARCHANANS
          You're in danger... you're in
          danger...
          Jay thinks they're playing the "echo game" like little kids:

                         JAY
          Very cute, but--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         LAMA
          In eight seconds, please do us the
          kindness of ducking.

                         JAY
          Huh?

                         KAY
          Yaz!
          They turn to see YAZ -- he levels a WEAPON AT THEM -- FIRES!
          Jay and Kay DUCK -- the weapon just misses.

                         JAY
          Thanks.

                         KAY
          Let's get into trouble.
          Jay and Kay engage him --
          As they run off, the Lama calls --

                         LAMA
          Remember, please, to take the
          bridge.
          And we begin

          BIG FIGHT SET PIECE.
          Try to include motorcycle and horse elements. Could also
          involve the actual aqueduct, which is close by.
          At one point, Jay and Kay seem stuck, they remember...

                         JAY
          Take the bridge...
          They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz.
          At one point, Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz BLASTS HIM -- Jay is
          knocked down. Looks DEAD! But he shakes it off reveal
          the PONG medallion blocked the shot.
          Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz
          compressed into .a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of
          a garbage truck.
          The guys give chase -- they want him captured, but no luck.
          The truck drives off...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         KAY
          He's gone.

                         JAY
          Only a matter of time before he
          comes back. And this time he might
          be really mad.

          AQUEDUCT RACE TRACK
          Jay and Kay return to an EMPTY RACE TRACK...
          It's like a ghost town.
          No Archanans to be found...

                         JAY
          Damn, we lost them. They come all
          the way across the universe and
          just when we're about to figure out
          what all of this is about--
          Then, faintly... a CHEER

                         KAY
          Hold that thought.
          They follow it out to

                         THE TRACK
          Which is empty. No spectators, no horses. Just the
          Archanans...
          Who stand near the track watching... nothing.
          And yet --
          They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race
          ever.
          Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell?" Look and approach
          them.

                         JAY
          Everybody OK?

                         ARCHANANS
          Everybody is everybody.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         JAY
          Yeah... guess I can't argue with
          that. So listen up -- Yaz is down
          but he won't be for long, so we
          need to start coming up with some
          answers. First of all--
          The Archanans CHEER. Jay shakes it off.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         FIRST
          The Archanans CHEER AGAIN.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          What are you cheering about?!

                         ARCHANANS
          The races.
          Jay and Kay keep approaching... Puzzled -- the track is
          empty...

                         JAY
          What races?
          Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura... and now--
          The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHING

          AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING RACE.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Where are we?

          LAMA.
          We are tomorrow.
          Jay steps backwards, out of the aura -- back to empty ghost
          town.
          Steps back in -- tomorrow's rabid fans, cheering the race.
          From the Archanans' POV -- we see ALL VERSIONS/ALL AGES OF

          JAY AND KAY..
          The effect is -- THEY SEE ALL TIME AT ONCE.

                         JAY
          You... can see the future.

                         LAMA
          It is what you call the future.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         ATTENDANT
          Ah, the future. An illusion of the
          time-bound, borne of the fallacy
          that one moment follows another.

                         LAMA
          Yaz suffers from this greatly. And
          so he must have revenge on your
          planet.

                         JAY
          Revenge?, For what?

                         LAMA
          He mourns the past because he can
          not see the dead are still as alive
          as they ever were. Just not now.

                         JAY
          Okay, someday you're gonna explain
          that to me, but right now you need
          to stop the riddles because there's
          about two minutes until Yaz crawls
          out of his hole and gets back to
          trying to kill you. So help me
          out. I need to know IN ENGLISH why
          Yaz is trying to kill you and what
          that has to do with saving the
          Earth.

                         ATTENDANT
          We know what he will know.

                         JAY
          You know what... he will know...
          (figuring it out)
          You know his plans.

                         (REALIZING)
          And you're going to stop him. He
          wants to kill you because you stop
          him.

                         LAMA

                         (CHEERFUL)
          Yes, if he does not kill us first.

                         KAY
          Don't you know if he's going to?

                         LAMA
          Sometimes he kills us, sometimes he
          does not. There are many futures.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         JAY
          Okay, which future is the one where
          you live and the Earth doesn't blow
          up?

                         LAMA
          The one where you take us home.
          Jay and Kay exchange a look --

                         KAY
          Alright, let's get these freaks
          home, and pronto.

                         LAMA
          You must let go of your. attachment
          to time, beginning with your
          concept of "pronto."
          And on that -- THUP THUP THUP --
          12 Blacked-out helicopters...

           EX (V.0.)

                         (MEGAPHONE)
          Illegal aliens -- you are
          surrounded... Do not attempt to
          flee...
          Jay and Kay YELL INTO THE BACKWASH OF THE ROTORS:

                         JAY
          No! We need to get them home!
          But it's all drowned out in the wind and dust...
          MiB "squad cars" -- pull up and surround them.
          Jay and Kay look for an escape route -- but MiB cars and
          trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere.
          MiB agents descend on ropes, round up the Archanans--

          EX (V.0.)

                         (MEGAPHONE)
          Agent Kay! Return to your vehicle!
          Rendezvous at headquarters in 20
          minutes! We will escort you by
          air!
          And from the noise and chaos of the choppers...
          To silence...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          INT. MIB HQ - BENCH OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM

          Jay and Kay watch through a glass wall.
          Inside the conference room -- the Archanans sit around a
          table.
          Ex paces, clearly talking ABOUT the Archanans to the other
          agents.
          Body language tells us the MiB reach some kind of consensus.
          Ex comes out -- Jay and Kay hop up.
          Ex notices Jay for the first time --

                         EX
          What's he doing here? Didn't we
          just bust you?

                         KAY
          That was someone else. All these
          mooners look alike, right?
          A beat -- and Ex buys it completely.

                         EX
          Yeah... So look. We've talked
          about it. And you are to be
          commended, Agent Kay. You did a
          fine job bringing these illegals
          in. Now it's our job to get them
          out of the city for containment.
          Somewhere where if someone decides
          to blow them off the map, the
          collateral damage will be
          insignificant. Toronto.

                         KAY
          But they're in danger. One of the
          most dangerous beings in the
          universe is out to kill them--
          (looks to Jay)
          And if that happens, we're all
          going with them, because they're
          our only hope of survival.

                         EX
          Christ, if we listened to every
          Mooner who showed up telling us how
          they were gonna save the world,
          that's all we'd do. Do you know
          why Earth is still standing?

          74.

                         EX (CONT'D)
          Why we're not a smoldering chunk of
          nothing? Because we don't stick
          our nose into other people's
          business. Especially people in
          danger, because they have enemies,
          and those enemies destroy Earth.
          Now. Are you going to execute my
          order or not?

                         KAY

                         (COLD)
          I thought we were supposed to be
          the good guys.

                         EX
          Careful, Agent Kay. That sounds
          like insubordination.
          Kay walks up to Ex, looks him DEAD IN THE EYE

                         KAY
          It sounds like you need to cut some
          eyeholes in your stomach, because
          your head is so far up your ass,
          that's the only way you could
          possibly see.

                         EX
          That's it. You're off this case.
          Stick to dry ice. If I catch you
          near them -- or him -- again, I'll
          have your badge.
          (to a bunch of other

                         AGENTS)
          You four -- take the Archanans to
          transpo.
          One of the agents looks up--

                         YOUNG AGENT
          Me? I'm just an accountant---

                         EX
          Go!!!

                         (TO JAY)
          And you... You just get out of
          here!
          The MiB agents GRAB the Archanans and hustle them out.
          Kay leans in to them--

                         KAY
          Don't worry, we'll--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         LAMA
          Yes, we know.
          Kay looks up -- sees Jay smiling at him.

                         KAY
          What?

                         JAY
          I knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna
          lie down. So what's the plan?

                         KAY
          You heard the man. We've got dry
          ice to investigate.

          GARBAGE COMPACTOR TRUCK
          It's the truck that "compacted" Yaz. We follow it to the

                         MIDDLE OF

          GIANT STATEN ISLAND DUMP
          Where the truck dumps its load... Including YAZ...
          Who gets PROCESSED AND PRESSED INTO A CUBE.
          On the cube -- it begins to swell and force itself back into
          its natural shape.
          Around the piles of garbage, other Yaz parts SEEK EACH OTHER

          OUT...

                         DUMP EXIT
          Workers stop what they're doing -- get out of the way of
          something, disturbed.
          We see Yaz and understand the reaction -- Yaz might be back
          together, but NOT AT ALL RIGHT -- a leg stuck in the wrong
          place, the head at a weird angle.
          He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself...
          Pops out an eye, swaps an arm...
          He unfurls his tongue, smells the air --

                         YAZ
          Where did you go...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         SHOWWORLD CENTER
          A SLEAZY GUY is suprised to see not just an agent... but four
          agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his
          peep show window.
          One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him:

                         ATTENDANT

                         (CHEERFUL)
          You will die alone.

                         SLEAZY GUY
          Yeah, I know.
          The agents lead the Archanans through the world's greatest
          emporium of sleaze.

          EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION

          The hustle and bustle -- cabs picking up and dropping off

                         PASSENGERS --
           We find a LONG LINE OF UNHAPPY KIDS, MAKING UNHAPPY PARENTS --
          Kids crying, pulling on Mom's dress...
          We see -- it's the line to an ICE CREAM TRUCK.
          And the line isn't moving because KAY IS QUESTIONING THE

          PAPER-HATTED VENDOR.
          DRY ICE SMOKE rises from the freezer:

                         KAY
          Just a few more questions about dry
          ice and I'll be out of your hair...
          A BIRD CALL makes Kay turn --.he sees Jay waving him over,
          pointing at something -- The MiB agents lead the Archanans
          into the Station!

                         VENDOR
          I told you ten times -- I got no
          idea what dry ice is!

                         KAY
          (not listening).
          Thanks, you've been very helpful.
          Jay and Kay peel off, follow the MiB agents, leaving the
          Vendor scratching his head. He turns back to the kids.
          Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

          INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION

          The Men in Black blend in easily with the guys going home to
          Greenwich, but the Archanans are easy to spot.
          Jay and Kay tail them -- and lose them for an instant!
          They spot a glimpse of robe, run after them, turn a corner --
          And it's just some Hare Krishnas.

                         KAY
          Damn. Wrong freaks.
          But Jay spots the Archanans...

                         JAY
          Over there, Kay!
          As they run off --

                         HARE KRISHNA
          Perhaps you'd like to join us for a
          vegetarian meal?
          Jay and Kay chase after the MiB agents and Archanans --
          The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs
          warning WET PAINT!
          The agents look around, then slip pass the ropes and through
          a NARROW DOOR marked "WET PAINT" or "MEN WORKING"
          Jay and Kay follow...
          Through the skinny half-painted door...

          THROUGH THE.SKINNY DOOR
          An EQUALLY SKINNY ESCALATOR descends 100s of feet. A
          problem: it's going the WRONG WAY -- bringing incognito
          aliens and MiB agents UP INTO GRAND CENTRAL.
          Jay and Kay muscle their way down -- lots of 'scuse me --
          pardon me -- hey, don't grab that!
          But once they power past the crowds, Jay's jaw drops as we
          reveal...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

          SECRET TRAIN STATION
          A MUCH-BIGGER station under Grand Central, a secret hub for
          sending aliens back and forth all over the country.
          It's basically a series of GIANT PNEUMATIC TUBES --people-
          sized versions of the vacuum tubes that used to beeverywhere
          in banks, offices, etc.
          A mix of ALIENS and MIB AGENTS put on helmets and pads, board
          the tubes and FWOOP off...
          Quick shots -- a shoeshine stand set up for many-limbed
          aliens... a newsstand with strange papers... The Beatles in
          line for Liverpool with a blue meanie... Kareem Abdul-
          Jabbar...

                         KAY
          On your 2 o'clock.
          They spot the MiBers and the Archanans next to the TUBE TO

          CANADA.

          TUBE TO CANADA
          The MiB agents put helmets and pads on the Archanans.
          They're about to load them into the tubes --
          Jay and Kay approach:

                         KAY
          Hold up.

                         MIB
          You're off this case, Kay.

                         MIB 2
          Yeah, but I heard there's some dry
          ice in Queens. Magic show at a
          kid's birthday party. Better
          hustle, you can get there before.
          the cake.
          They all LAUGH at Kay.

                         KAY
          Change in plans.

                         MIB
          What? We didn't hear about any
          change in plans.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         KAY
          Yeah, Ex just gave us the new
          orders -- check this out --
          Kay gestures them closer -- he reaches for something in his
          jacket pocket...
          The MiBers lean in...
          And Kay GRABS THEM AND SHOVES THEM BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE

          TUBE!
          The MiB agents stumble, surprised --
          The Archanans, not surprised, step deftly out of the way, the
          MiBers FWOOP FWOOP FWOOP into the tube...
          Jay and Kay exchange a smile and realize... One last VERY
          YOUNG agent is still standing there, wide-eyed:

                         YOUNG AGENT
          Don't hurt me! I'm just the
          accountant!
          He reaches for his radio... Jay talks him down:

                         JAY
          I know you're a little freaked out
          and you want to call for backup,
          but listen: When you've done this
          job for a while, you realize
          there's one rule -- things aren't
          what they seem. These are innocent
          beings that need our protection.
          Are you gonna do the right thing or
          are you gonna be a company man and
          send them off to die in Toronto?
          The young agent thinks -- puts down the radio.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Good, good. What's your name?

                         YOUNG AGENT
          Agent Zed, sir.

                         KAY
          You're gonna be okay, kid.
          Jay can't help laughing --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         JAY
          He's gonna be better than OK. I'm
          not gonna give you so much shit
          anymore.
          The radio CRACKLES --

          EX (V.0.)

                         (ON RADIO)
          Zed, what's your status?

                         ZED
          Detainees are on the tube to
          Toronto. No sign of Kay. Over.

          EX (V.0.)
          Copy that, good work, Zed.
          Zed crosses off...

                         JAY
          Be nice to him. Trust me.
          Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Okay, you all wanted to go home.
          Well here we are. So how do you
          want to get off this rock? You
          guys have the spaceport on Long
          Island yet?
          Kay just looks at him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          That place is a dump anyway. Best
          Margaritas in the Universe, my ass.
          What about the one in Ohio?
          The Archanans smile.

                         ATTENDANT
          Here is the way home.
          The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and
          hands it to one of his attendants.
          The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT... it passes
          through all the attendants and then to JAY.
          Jay gives it a look.

                         JAY
          Here, huh? You're sure?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         LAMA
          The only future that ends with life
          begins there.

                         JAY
          I'll take that as a strong "yes."
          Okay, then. Follow me.
          Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the
          terminal. Kay catches up --

                         KAY
          Where are we going?
          Jay looks at him a beat.

                         JAY
          Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the
          biggest T-bone you ever saw when we
          get there. So -- you head over to
          the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help
          these guys over here for a second.
          But I'll meet you in a minute. By
          the Omaha tube.
          They stare at each other --

                         KAY
          Sounds good. See you there.
          Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and
          reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card --

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Omaha, my ass.
          Kay looks at the card: GREETINGS FROM SUNNY FLORIDA -- a
          tourist post card with palm trees, oranges and beaches.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Let's go.

                         JAY
          No, no, no. No way. Florida, Kay.

                         KAY
          That's what it says.

                         JAY
          Don't you get it?

                         KAY
          Yeah, it's hot and muggy. The old
          people drive slow.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          We'll stay somewhere air-
          conditioned and only drive after
          three when they're at dinner.

                         JAY
          This is why you were there. In
          Florida. Because of them. You
          were helping them and that's why...
          that's why you get killed. Today,
          July 16. I saw the report myself.
          Agent Kay, dead at the scene.
          Killed by Yaz.

                         KAY
          You know what an MiB agent calls it
          when he faces death? Besides I got
          you to watch my back, right?
          They walk to the FLORIDA TUBE

                         JAY
          I just want you to know, I'm doing
          this out of love, man.

                         KAY
          Doing what?
          He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM.

                         JAY
          You stay home and stay alive.
          But Kay isn't down.

                         KAY
          I told them I'd help them -- I'm
          honor-bound to do it.
          Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney.
          Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus.
          Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard.

                         JAY
          Damn, you used to have some abs.
          They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches:

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          I can't let you go to Florida.

                         KAY
          I make my own future! Besides --
          I'm younger and stronger than you!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          They both attempt an identical spin kick at the same time --
          feet collide.

                         JAY
          Bet you're sorry you taught me
          that.
          The fight continues... They're wearing down, circling each
          other...
          And then Kay fakes a left ---

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          You always lead with your--
          But this time Kay connects with his right, knocking Jay down
          hard.

                         KAY
          Had enough yet?
          On Jay -- gasping, spent -- using every last reserve of
          strength to lift himself off that floor.

                         JAY
          I can't let you go -- I love you!
          Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN. Kay LUNGES AT JAY.
          They CLINCH... it's a stalemate...

                         KAY
          Aw, hell, look at that-- behind you-

                         JAY
          I'm not falling for that.

                         KAY
          I'm not kidding --
          Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see...
          The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the

          FLORIDA TUBE.
          Jay and Kay share a look -- and both run INTO THE TUBE!

          THROUGH THE TUBES
          Jay, Kay and the Archanans hurtle through the MiB system of
          pneumatic tubes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          The Archanans fly through the tubes, relaxed and happy,
          moving gracefully, like fish through water...
          Kay is in perfect controlled tube position -- everything
          clenched, hands by his sides, looking like he's in an "air
          luge"...
          Jay is SCREAMING and ricocheting off the sides of the tube
          like a pinball...
          They shoot SOUTH, passing landmarks of the Eastern
          seaboard...
          Intercut with Jay's face -- blown back like Right Stuff
          astronauts in a G-Force simulator.
          Jay FLAILS towards the Archanans, grabs onto the Lama's robe:

                         JAY
          (yelling over the wind

                         NOISE)
          I have to know -- can I really
          prevent Kay's murder?

                         LAMA
          Yes.

                         JAY
          Oh. Okay, then. Thanks, good to
          hear.

                         LAMA
          But where there was death, there
          will be death.

                         JAY
          What does that mean?
          The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current. Jay gets
          CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube.

          EXT. FIELD

          Sugar cane workers pick crops next to a GIANT IRRIGATION

          PIPE.
          They look up as SCREAMS DOPPLER THROUGH THE PIPE -- what the
          hell was that?
          We follow the SCREAM...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

          BACK IN THE TUBE
          Jay CONTINUES TO SCREAM --

          TUBE P.A. (V.0.)
          All passengers, prepare to de-tube.

                         JAY
          De-tube?

          TUBE P.A. (V.0.)
          Please make sure all helmet and
          crash suit straps are securely
          fastened.
          On Jay -- no helmet, no crash suit.

                         JAY
          Helmet? No one said anything about

                         A--

          POOP!

          EXT. FLORIDA SWAMP/MANATEE PRESERVE - END OF THE TUBE

          Jay, Kay and the Archanans are launched from the tube like
          human cannonballs...
          The Archanans land gracefully, floating down air currents
          like kung fu masters...
          Kay hits with both feet and rolls...
          Jay face plants into the water.
          Jay looks up -- FIVE MANATEES STARE HIM DOWN. The ALPHA
          MANATEE emits along, lowing manatee song which RESOLVES INTO

                         COUGHING --

                         ALPHA MANATEE
          Sorry, I have something in my
          throat. They went that way...

                         JAY
          Thanks.
          Surrounded by thick brush, trees. Jay staggers out of the
          water, looking beat to hell.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay? Archanans? Everyone OK?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Reveal -- Everyone else looks clean and pressed. Jay looks
          around -- nothing but brush and swamp.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Listen, your, uh...
          Arachaness...ness? I don't think
          this here is the way back to your
          planet.
          The Archanans smile and WALK OFF... Jay and Kay follow --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Hey wait -- we can't help you get
          home, if you don't tell us how...
          He trails off as they EMERGE FROM THE BRUSH
          And stop dead...

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Whoa. So that's how you're getting
          home.
          Reveal -- A GLORIOUS SHOT OF THE APOLLO ROCKET
          And they head towards destiny...

          CAPE CANAVERAL - LAUNCH SITE
          Jay and Kay take in the MASSIVE SCENE...
          The huge crowd, the security, the press. HISTORY IN THE

          MAKING.
          T-Minus 30 minutes.

                         JAY
          Okay. So we've got... 30 minutes
          to get past security. Get into
          Mission Control. Reprogram the
          flight path, pull the Astronauts
          off the launch and get them in that
          rocket.

                         KAY
          Well, then. Better get started.

                         JAY
          Weird. I feel like I've been here.

                         (BEAT)
          Okay, I've got a plan to get
          through security. We just need to
          be invisible.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

          YAZ ON HIS BIKE
          Hurtling down the highway on his superfast bike, kicking up a

          HUGE DUSTSTORM...
          He gets STUCK BEHIND AN 18-WHEELER. Yaz REVS -- and SPEEDS

          RIGHT THROUGH THE TRUCK, SPLITTING IT IN HALF.
          Down the CAUSEWAY -- the rocket in the distance...

          EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE

          Heavily guarded by AIR FORCE SECURITY -- people with a lot of
          guns and very little sense of humor.
          And up steps Jay, leading Kay and the Archanans.

          JAY (O.S.)
          'Scuse me... I need to get
          inside... I've got the big man's
          Cadillac... all washed and ready to-
          Before the words are out of Jay's mouth, he's down on the
          ground with a submachine gun stuck in his neck.

                         GUARD
          Move and it's the last thing you
          do!
          The security is on Kay and the Archanans, forcing them down.
          Kay gives Jay a look --

                         KAY
          Good work. It's like we're not
          even here.

                         GUARD

                         (INTO RADIO)
          Sir, this is unit 3 bravo -- we
          have an attempted perimeter breach
          into mission control subhallway
          Charlie. One caucasian, one
          negroid, four... other. Yes, sir.
          We'll hold them here, sir.

                         JAY
          You've got it wrong, let me explain-

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         GUARD
          Shut up! Anything you have to say,
          you can say to my superior officer!
          And boy does he hate your kind...
          A click... click... click... Someone is approaching. Someone
          who walks like they mean business.

                         GUARD (CONT'D)
          Lt. Colonel! Here are the
          intruders, sir!
          Jay cranes to see the Colonel -- he's African American. Jay
          grins, relieved --

                         JAY
          Finally, someone I can talk to--
          But the Colonel is on him before you can blink, an equal-
          opportunity hardass to the extreme:

                         COLONEL
          The only thing we're gonna talk
          about is what specific breed of
          dumbass you have to be to try to
          penetrate my launch site!
          He begins patting Jay down. Eyes widen --

                         COLONEL
          Weapon! You are going away for a
          long time...
          (to his men)
          Get them into holding. We'll
          interrogate them after the launch.
          A beat... and Jay goes for it:

                         JAY
          Sir, before you do that --- my name
          is Agent Jay. I appreciate your
          position, but I'm from a top-secret
          government agency in charge of
          protecting the world from the scum
          of the universe and right now, on
          behalf of the people of Earth, I.:
          need to commandeer your rocket so

                         THEY--
          (points to Archanans)
          --can board it. Can we count on
          your help?
          The Colonel stares at him for a beat..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         COLONEL
          So you want us to stop the most
          massive endeavor in American
          history, an event being watched by
          the entire world, the moment that
          will be the culmination of a
          challenge put to us by President
          John F. Kennedy himself... so a
          bunch of Hare Krishnas can take a
          joy ride?

                         JAY
          Would it help if I told you I'm
          from the future?

                         COLONEL
          Get them out of here!
          He motions to the other MPs, who move to roust the group...
          But the Lama takes the Colonel by the arm--

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)
          Hey!
          --and PULLS HIM INTO HIS AURA.
          On THE COLONEL'S face... He sees something POWERFUL
          The Lama releases him...
          The officer is stunned for a moment. Blinks back into focus
          and turns to the other guards --

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)
          You men are no longer needed here.
          Report to delta gate.

                         GUARD
          Sir?

                         COLONEL
          Go!

                         GUARD
          Yes, sir...
          The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans:

                         COLONEL
          The rest of you, come with me.
          The Colonel heads into the building. They follow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         JAY
          Things change when you can see the
          future, right?

                         COLONEL
          They sure do. This is definitely
          about some next-level shit.
          The PA crackles:

          P.A. (V.0.)
          T-minus seven minutes to launch...

          MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE - UNDERGROUND HALLWAY
          Mission control is an underground hub with hallway "spokes".
          Jay, Kay and the Archanans follow the Colonel down the
          hallway towards the main Mission Control center.

                         MISSION CONTROL
          A hive of activity leading up to the launch.. Miles and
          miles of white guys in buzzcuts and shortsleeve button-down
          shirts. Thick glasses, slide rules, pocket protectors -- a
          sea of IBM men.
          Everyone smoking, RUSHING AROUND, LAST-MINUTE CHAOS...
          Hunkered over computer monitors... reel-to-reel data tapes
          spinning. Less computing power than an iPhone, but we put a
          man on the moon.

          P.A. (V.0.)
          T-minus six minutes...

                         JAY
          Attention, everyone! We've got a
          change in plans!
          Everyone's consumed with the launch and wearing headsets --
          they ignore him -- he keeps trying --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Hey! Attention over here! I need
          to talk to the man who can re-
          program this rocket!
          Still nothing --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Can anyone hear me? Hey! You in
          the glasses!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          25 people in identical giant black plastic glasses turn.

           COLONEL (O.S.)
          Agent Jay! Over here!
          They see the Colonel with an Engineer at a workstation.

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)
          This is your man.
          The guys approach the Engineer --

                         ENGINEER
          You see this card? The rocket's
          flight path is all on cards just
          like this one. Right here --
          He indicates a long metal rack, like a mail-sorting machine,
          that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a
          processor.
          An Archanan approaches and BLOWS ON THE CARDS -- it hits the
          cards like a mini-whirlwind. The cards spiral everywhere
          like bats pouring out of a cave -- chads fly off -- they're
          magically re-programmed! And fly back into the rack.
          The engineers are STUNNED. And then PANIC:

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)
          The trajectory has been altered!
          A BIG LOW-TECH GRAPHIC APPEARS on the BIG LOW-RES MONITOR:

          TRAJECTORY CHANGE.

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)
          Abort launch! Abort launch!

                         JAY
          Slow down there! Everyone be cool!

                         ENGINEER
          Coolness is an inappropriate
          response!
          The Engineer flips the SAFETY off a red button marked "ABORT"

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)
          Aborting in 5...

                         JAY

          92.
          The Engineer raises his ABORTING HAND -- About to slam it
          down in the button!

                         - KAY
          This might help.
          Kay reaches into his jacket, takes out WHAT APPEARS TO BE A

                         NEURALIZER

                         JAY
          What's that? You been holding out
          on me?

                         KAY
          Little something I've been working
          on. Glasses if you've got 'em.
          Jay and Kay put on their glasses...

                         ENGINEER

          2.
          Jay and Kay in sunglasses -- for a moment, it's the iconic
          look of the posters...

                         JAY
          Ha ha, just like old times...

                         KAY
          Oh, and you might want to get under
          a desk.

                         JAY
          Get under a--?

                         ENGINEER
          One!
          The engineers hand comes down... but before he can hit the

                         BUTTON --
          Kay hits the trigger --
          But instead of a FLASH --
          A MILLION PELLETS EXPLODE OUT OF THE NEURALIZER -- bouncing
          everywhere, knocking out the engineers.
          The pellets KEEP WHIZZING EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING:
          Jay and Kay have to talk over the sounds of people getting
          KO'd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         JAY
          What the hell was that??

                         KAY
          It's a high-velocity non-lethal
          pellet-gun. The boys in the lab
          call it the "hiv-nol-pog."

                         JAY
          Catchy.
          The Archanans deftly step out of the way -- or the pellets
          swerve around them.
          EX RUNS IN, flanked by security and/or MiB agents.

                         EX
          It's Kay! There he is! Take him
          down! Shoot him if you have to!
          EX catches a PELLET TO THE GROIN, crumples.
          The pellets settle... quiet...

          P.A. (V.0.)
          T-minus... Five minutes.
          The engineers start COMING TO, dazed, wondering WHAT THE HELL
          JUST HAPPENED -- Kay and Jay give them a "neuralizer" cover

                         STORY:

                         JAY

                         (TO CROWD)
          What the hell is wrong with you
          people? Raquel Welch comes by for
          a personal tour of Mission Control
          and you faint like a bunch of
          schoolgirls!

                         KAY
          What a waste.

                         ENGINEER
          Raquel Welch was here?

                         JAY
          Five minutes to get to the rocket.
          And keep your eyes open for Yaz.
          They head out.

          94.

          ON THE TARMAC
          With only a few minutes to go, service trucks CLEAR THE
          TARMAC -- dozens of fuel trucks, etc., Driving to get a safe
          distance away from the blast.
          The all SWERVE OUT OF THE WAY
          As one car cuts through them GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, parting
          the waters -- it's a military jeep -- THE COLONEL at the
          wheel, Jay, Kay and the rest, barely hanging on.

          That's one little step that I did,
          one big step for the rest of you...
          Wait, that's not it. Did that
          sound weird to you guys?
          The driver SLAMS ON THE BRAKES

          What in Sam Hill is going on?

          them off.

                         KAY
          No disrespect meant, [major]. I'm
          a big fan. (Especially of the
          haircut.)

                         JAY
          But we've got some bigger fish to
          fry. Hand over the flight suits.
          They start pulling the astronauts off the truck.
          The astronauts protest.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Let's go, people. Why don't you
          take one giant leap out of there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.
          They look at Jay and Kay... at the Colonel...

                         COLONEL
          That's right, gentlemen. You need
          to listen to them. We're going to
          protocol twelve.
          The astronauts acquiesce.

                         BUZZ ALDRIN
          I didn't want to get in that death
          trap anyways.

          EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE

          The same guards who stopped Jay and Kay are back on duty.
          They hear something -- they draw weapons --
          And it's Yaz. Still looking like evil incarnate. The guards
          take in this unholy picture...

                         GUARD

                         WHAT THE--

                         YAZ
          I want in.
          The guards look at each other --

                         GUARD
          Should we radio the Colonel?

                         GUARD (CONT'D)
          You wanna get yelled at again?
          They wave him by.

                         GUARD (CONT'D)
          Go ahead.

          Jay works like a secret service agent -- scanning for all
          possible threats.
          Jay checks his stop watch -- Four minutes to go...
          Kay works'with the Archanans--

                         JAY
          We good yet, Kay? I don't like
          being out here in the open -- too
          many ways for Yaz to get to you...

                         KAY
          I'm almost there.
          Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Hey, tech guys -- get back here and
          help me with the door.

                         TECH
          It's called-a hatch.

                         KAY
          Whatever, just get over here.

                         JAY
          Oh, come on -- what's going on?

                         KAY
          This door is complicated.

                         JAY
          Oh, for...

                         KAY
          What? It's an Apollo rocket, not a
          Plymouth Valiant, OK? It's
          complicated.
          Jay goes over to help Kay with the door.
          They both fuss and fight over the door.

                         JAY
          Lift it. You have to lift it.

                         KAY
          No, I am lifting it. You have to
          hold the lever.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         JAY
          No, if I hold the lever, the rubber
          thingie won't... go in the thing
          where the thingie goes...
          Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass.

                         KAY
          Jay... Why do you think a highly
          trained NASA technician would leave
          the back of his suit unzipped?
          They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the
          Chinese restaurant...

                         JAY
          Because it's about to go down.
          They turn around, draw weapons on the tech -- it's YAZ!

          NOTE TO READER:
          Welcome to the good stuff
          From here, we launch into a GIANT SET PIECE that will take us
          up and around the Apollo Rocket...
          As Jay and Kay battle Yaz and Devil Girl in a super-high-
          stakes confrontation to protect the Archanans...
           We will pay off that YAZ ISAVIRUS, bentonDESTROYINGTHE
          EARTH to avenge the deaths ofhis brothers --smallpoxand
          bubonic plague.
          The launch clock ticks down -- the action moves around pipes
          breathing fire, the gigantic scaffolding, liquid oxygen
          spewing from the rocket... All on top of a rocket taller than
          a 30-story skyscraper.
          With T-minus 25 seconds to go, Jay and Kay corner Yaz against
          the lunar capsule.

          BACK TO SCENE:
          Yaz laughs at Jay and Kay.

                         YAZ
          You can't stop me! Nothing on
          Earth can stop me!

                         JAY
          Nothing now.
          Yaz raises an eyebrow...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          Jay draws his NOISY CRICKET -- the gun he brought from the
          future.

                         KAY
          What's that?

                         JAY
          Little something I brought with me.
          Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS --
          As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5... 4...

                         YAZ
          Try it! You wouldn't dare! One
          false shot and you'll rip space and
          time!

                         JAY
          That's a chance I'll have to take.
          Jay BLASTS YAZ
          Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE... The hatch SLAMS him in!
          Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF--

          HUGE FLAMES - HUGE CLOUDS OF SMOKE THREATEN TO ENGULF JAY AND

                         KAY -

                         KAY
          Uh oh --
          But the Archanans surround them with their aura -- where the
          flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them...
          And then it's over...

          BIG VICTORY MOMENT
          As they watch the rocket carry Yaz off...

                         JAY
          We did it, partner. I hope you
          remember this when you recruit me --
          you won't give me such a hard time.

                         KAY
          You know I will.

                         JAY
          Yeah.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         KAY
          I guess we'll have to build a
          prison on the moon or something.
          Jay realizes -- grabs Kay --

                         JAY
          Do a better job this time, OK?
          That needs to be one hell of a
          prison. You don't want that guy
          coming back, or I'm coming back.
          Look, once was enough, OK?
          Jay turns to The Colonel --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Thank you for your help, sir. Hope
          we don't get you fired.

                         COLONEL
          Not too worried about that.

                         JAY
          Can I ask you -- what did the Lama
          show you in there that made you
          help us? Was it the Earth being
          destroyed?

                         COLONEL
          No -- it was my son. All grown up.
          As a matter of fact, I'm late to
          see him -- I promised I'd watch the
          launch with him.

                         JAY
          Oh. Thanks. He's a lucky kid.

                         COLONEL
          I'm a lucky dad. Take care.
          Jay offers him a handshake. The officer takes it -- and
          pulls Jay into a hug.

                         JAY
          Okay...
          The Colonel leaves. Jay and Kay congratulate each other,
          smile over a job well done...
          But then they see the Archanans... And realize...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         KAY
          We're sorry we didn't get you home,
          guys. It was the only way to get
          rid of Yaz.

                         JAY
          But we'll make sure you're safe
          here. And the next rocket out...

                         LAMA
          All is well. You have done well.

                         JAY
          No we didn't. You wanted to go
          home...

                         LAMA
          There is what we desire and what
          must be... And now our gift to
          you...

                         JAY
          Gift? But we didn't get you home.

                         ARCHANANS
          There is the action and there is
          the intention. It is the intention
          we reward.

                         LAMA
          You did the right thing. And if
          humans are capable of such
          sacrifice, such friendship...
          perhaps we ARE already home.

                         JAY
          So then what's the gift?

                         LAMA
          You already have it.
          Jay looks at pong.

                         JAY
          This? Pong?

                         LAMA
          Yes. PONG. The Pan-Galactic
          Ordnance Negation Grid. Agent Kay
          will use this technology...

                         JAY
          To make the missile defense system.
          You use this to save the world.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         ARCHANANS
          Yes. Don't drop it.
          They take the PONG and drape it around Kay's neck
          The Archanans leave, chanting...

                         ARCHANANS (CONT'D)

                         (CHANTING)
          Bip... Bip... Bip...
          And it's just Jay and Kay.
          Jay looks at Kay wearing the PONG... just like in the case
          file picture...

                         JAY
          Hey. My watch stopped.
          We see -- a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something
          about it bothers him...

                         KAY
          C'mon. Let's go watch that bastard
          leave the atmosphere.

                         JAY
          Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a
          second.

          KAY GETS INTO THE ELEVATOR
          Jay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the
          scaffolding.

                         JAY
          So you guys understand all this
          time stuff, right? So is
          everything going to be okay now? I
          mean, if I saved everything, and
          Yaz is really gone, why am I even
          here? Shouldn't I not have come in
          the first place? And why do I
          still have time left on my watch?

                         UNDERGROUND
          The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of
          underground hallways.
          Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          ,He sees a WALL CLOCK -- 3:59.

                         JAY
          3:59. But Kay didn't get killed
          until...
          And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          He didn't come yet! Kay, he didn't
          come yet!!!
          Jay races to find Kay.

                         WITH KAY
          Unaware that his appointment with death is near...

          WITH YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL
          Racing down a hallway... hunting Kay...

                         WITH JAY
          Running... running... searching... where is Kay?

          INTERCUT BETWEEN KAY... YAZ... JAY...
          All converging on destiny...

                         WITH JAY
          Running... more frantic now...
          And then he sees him!
          Kay -- at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to
          the outside...

                         JAY
          Kay!
          And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there!
          Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot!
          Yaz pulls his guns...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to
          know HE'S ABOUT TO DIE!
          Yaz FIRES!!
          But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead! He catches the
          bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes.
          And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ AND
          KILL HIM, blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY
          LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch.
          They look at each other -- it's over.

                         KAY
          See? I knew you had my back.
          Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL

          MAN -- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JAY'S OWN SILHOUETTE.
          As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller,
          shrinking to KID SIZE. It's a boy.

                         KID'S VOICE
          Dad? What's going on?
          The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape
          of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG

          JAY.

                         JAY
          Where there is death, there will
          always be death. He saved your
          life. He swapped his for yours.
          He saved the world.
          Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --

                         KAY
          I'll take it from here.
          Kay steps away... but turns back.
          In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses
          Kay a modern Neuralizer.

                         JAY
          Leave me some memories this time,

          OK?

                         KAY
          Sure, partner. I'll see you
          around.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         JAY
          Yes you will.
          Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand.
          Jay watches them from a distance:
          Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body
          was -- hands it to the son.

                         KAY
          Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to
          have this.
          Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain.
          Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and
          worn.

                         YOUNG JAY
          Where is he?

                         KAY
          Your daddy had to go -- he's part
          of the space program, now. He's
          okay, he just had to take a trip up
          to the stars, but you'll be just
          fine. I'll keep an eye on you...
          They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo
          launch...
          Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE...

          PURE WHITE LIGHT...
          And it resolves into...

          NEW YORK - BACK TO PRESENT DAY...
          Jay comes to in the Apple Store, looks to the sky and

          THE MISSILES ARE STILL COMING!!!

                         JAY
          Noo!!!!
          And then...
          A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and

          PONGS THE MISSILES BACK INTO SPACE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING

          Jay is walking on air -- thrilled to see the deadpan security
          guard.

                         JAY
          It's good to see you, man.
          He gives him a hug-- gets a "what the hell?" face.

          INT. MIB HQ

          Jay is thrilled to be back -- hugging everyone he can.
          No one else knows what he's talking about -- from their POV
          he never left... It all seems the same except for quick shots
          of Ex the bitter janitor, aged Devil Girl pushing the coffee
          cart...
          Jay bounces through the MiB HQ -- it's just a regular day to
          everyone else, but it's HOME SWEET HOME to Jay.
          He even gives the worm guys a big, gushy hug.
          A crowd of people gathers around Kay, congratulating him on
          winning the Bowling trophy... AGAIN.
          Kay looks up -- SMILES BIG when he sees Jay.

                         KAY
          Alright, everyone, give me and my
          partner here a minute.
          They leave the guys alone. A beat -- and Jay just wraps him
          in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.

                         JAY
          It's good to see you, man. So
          good. I just... do you remember...
          I mean, do you know what I've been
          through?
          Kay just stares at him.

                         KAY
          You mean, do I remember that you
          travelled back in time to save my
          life and the world? Not bad,
          slick. Not bad.

                         JAY
          No problem. You'd do the same for
          me. I just have one question...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          When you disappeared... Why didn't
          I forget you when everyone else
          did?

                         KAY
          Well, I don't know exactly.
          Because I was dead. But in a
          quantum reality, objects can exist
          in contradictory states... So
          multiple timelines with varying
          probabilities can exist, and the
          one you're closest to

                         MATHEMATICALLY--

                         JAY
          Oh, you're talking about our
          closeness... you're talking about
          our love... Across timelines!
          You're saying our love will go on!
          Kay swats him away -- but the love couldn't be more clear.
          Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain. Takes it
          out.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          He was a good man.

                         KAY
          Yes he was.

                         JAY
          I'm glad I know that.

                         KAY
          So you travelled back in time, huh?

                         JAY
          Yep.

                         KAY
          Wow. And you didn't change
          anything?

                         JAY
          No.

                         KAY
          You're sure? Because the littlest
          thing can have huge repercussions.

                         JAY
          I was very careful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         KAY
          Good man, good man. Well, let's
          get you a uniform.

                         JAY
          Excuse me?
          We PULL BACK --
          Revealing PRESENT DAY MIB IN ALL ITS KICKASS GRANDEUR.
          Eternally vigilant in the struggle to protect the Earth and
          all its inhabitants...
          And every one of those agents wearing BLUE SUITS WITH SHORTS.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Even I can't make that look good.

               CLOSEUP OF SCOTT ROPER

               He's listening to the stretch call of a horse race, and he's 
               into it.

                                     TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                         ...at the top of the stretch it's 
                         Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack 
                         coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, 
                         Backtrack closing...

                                     ROPER
                         Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...

               The CAMERA GRADUALLY pulls back to reveal that Roper is 
               driving his Trans Am across the Bay Bridge. HELICOPTER SHOTS 
               give a soaring view of the San Francisco skyline.

                         At the eighth pole it's Cozy Girl by

               Roper's police radio SQUAWKS.

                         One-one-four to Roper.

               He picks up the radio.

                                     ROPER
                         Dig in, Cozy Girl...
                              (into the radio)
                         Roper go.

                         One-four, Roper. Code 2.C.P. 4th and

                         I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.

               He tosses the radio down. Punches the accelerator.

                                     ROPER
                         Stay up there, Girl...

               Weaving through traffic on the bridge.

                                     ROPER (V.O.)
                         Where's the damn wire?!

                                     TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                         Here comes the wire... and... 
                         Backtrack gets up in the last jump. 
                         Cozy girl a very game second.

                                     ROPER (V.O.)
                         SHIT!

               The Trans Am streak off toward the city.

               EXT. BANK - DOWNTOWN - DAY

               A hostage situation. Police barricades. Dozens of squad cars, 
               ambulances, spectators, SWAT team. It's a stalemate. Roper's 
               Trans Am pulls to a stop at the barricades. He hops out, 
               weaves through the spectators and past the barriers.

               A FEMALE DETECTIVE, EIKO KIMURA, rushes up to him.

                                     KIMURA
                         Hi, Roper.

                                     ROPER
                         Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?

               Kimura points to the diner in the middle of the block. Roper 
               heads toward it. As they walk Kimura briefs him...

                                     KIMURA
                         The suspect came in shortly after 
                         the bank opened. Botched robbery. A 
                         teller hit the silent alarm. He took 
                         seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. 
                         He's still alive. So far he's asked 
                         for...

                                     ROPER
                         ...a car.

                                     KIMURA
                         That's right, and a plane waiting at 
                         the airport. If he doesn't...

                                     ROPER
                         ...get 'em, he's going to start 
                         shooting hostages in five minutes...

                                     KIMURA
                         That's right.

                                     ROPER
                         What's the suspect's name?

                                     KIMURA
                         Earl.

               INT. DINER - DAY

               Across from the bank. This is where the "command post" is 
               setup. About a dozen cops and the accompanying support staff 
               are here. Lieutenant SAMUEL BAFFERT is in charge. Roper 
               saunters in.

                                     ROPER
                         Hello, guys.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Hello, Roper. Glad you could join 
                         us.

               Roper walks over to the counter where Baffert is standing.

                                     ROPER
                         Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl?

               Baffert hands him a folder. Roper opens it.

                                     BAFFERT
                         This guy is no genius.

               Roper scans the profile.

                                     ROPER
                         They're not usually graduate students.

                                     BAFFERT
                         SWAT wants to go in.

                                     ROPER
                         What's the rush? They haven't killed 
                         anybody yet this week?

               Roper refers to the folder.

                                     ROPER
                         We got a guy who's probably on drugs. 
                         He's got a record of 459's and he 
                         was busted on possession. But he's 
                         never been busted on a major felony. 
                         What's his demeanor?

                                     KIMURA
                         Well he's a little fucking agitated -- 
                         he ripped the phone out.

                                     ROPER
                         I have to go face to face.

                                     BAFFERT
                         No -- you can't do that.

                                     ROPER
                         You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of 
                         them's wounded -- We don't know how 
                         bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone 
                         out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to 
                         the head of a female hostage. If 
                         SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna 
                         lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go 
                         in. Maybe I can see what's going on 
                         in there.

                                     BAFFERT
                         I don't know.

                                     ROPER
                         He's never offed anybody. His rap 
                         doesn't show any violence.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Not that we know of.

                                     ROPER
                         We don't know how much time we have. 
                         If I can get in to talk to him -- 
                         maybe we won't lose anyone.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Maybe we can get a throw phone in 
                         there.

                                     KIMURA
                         SWAT says it's broken -- The perp in 
                         the last situation rendered it 
                         inoperable.

                                     BAFFERT
                         What do you mean?

                                     KIMURA
                         He urinated on it and shorted out 
                         the circuits.

                                     ROPER
                         We gonna stand here and talk about 
                         it or let the guy in there bleed to 
                         death.
                              (beat... beat)
                         Give me a dozen donuts.

               Roper pulls out his gun and places it on the counter.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Roper eats the donut as he crosses toward the bank.

               EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET - DAY

               A team of two SWAT TEAM MEMBERS, FORBES IS A SPOTTER AND 
               MCCALL IS A SHARPSHOOTER. KEVIN MCCALL, is the one we're 
               interested in. He's 25 years old, handsome, all American. 
               He's the best the SWAT team has.

               He crouches motionless, staring through the scope of his 
               rifle, watching as Roper calmly walks toward the bank.

                                     FORBES
                         What do you think he's got in the 
                         bag?

                                     MCCALL
                         Donuts.

                                     FORBES
                         You can't take a guy down with a 
                         donut.

               INT. BANK - DAY

               A tense situation. A wild-eyed, white punk, fuck-up of a 
               BANK ROBBER, EARL, is holding a pretty, young TELLER around 
               the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple.

               The other bank employees are cowering on the floor. A few 
               are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half-conscious 
               and oozing blood from his side.

               Roper strolls right through the front door and walks toward 
               Earl, very sociable.

                                     ROPER
                         Hi, Earl, I'm Scott Roper. Wanna 
                         donut? I ate the glazed but there's 
                         a bunch of chocolate and a --

               Earl swipes the donuts out of Roper's hand and starts frisking 
               Roper for weapons with his free hand. The other hand still 
               has the gun poised at the young teller's head.

                                     ROPER
                         I'm a negotiator, Earl. I don't carry 
                         a weapon.

               Roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller. It seems to 
               help. Earl finishes patting Roper down, straightens back up 
               and puts his hand around the teller's neck.

                                     EARL
                         Where's the car?

                                     ROPER
                         I need to get something straight 
                         first.

               Roper looks over at the other bank employees huddled on the 
               floor.

                                     ROPER
                         Who's the manager?

               A balding, middle-aged MAN sheepishly raises his hand.

                                     MANAGER
                         I am.

               Roper takes a step toward him.

                                     ROPER
                         When did you start keeping longer 
                         hours?

                                     MANAGER
                         Last spring.

                                     ROPER
                         Really! Because I've been thinking 
                         of moving to this branch. It would 
                         be really convenient for me --

                                     EARL
                         HEY, SHUT UP!

               Earl wags his gun against the Teller's ear.

                                     EARL
                         Do you want me to start killing 
                         people?!

               Roper holds his hand up defensively.

                                     ROPER
                         It's my job to see that no one gets 
                         killed, Earl... Including you.

                                     EARL
                         Then where's my FUCKING car!

               Earl is pouring sweat. His gun hand is shaking uncontrollably.

                                     ROPER
                         I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to 
                         do this the right way.

               Roper keeps his eyes locked on Earl. His voice is calm.

                                     ROPER
                         First I need you to point that gun 
                         away from --
                              (to the teller)
                         What's your name?

                                     TELLER
                              (voice trembling)
                         Debbie...

                                     ROPER
                         Point the gun away from Debbie.

                                     EARL
                         Debbie's brains are going to be 
                         splattered all over the floor if I 
                         don't see a car in five minutes!

               Roper takes a long look at Earl. The guy is a hair trigger.

                                     ROPER
                         Alright! But let's be clear about 
                         one thing. If you kill someone, I 
                         can't help you. The SWAT guys will 
                         take you out.

               Earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside. Reflects 
               for a moment on the reality of the situation.

                                     EARL
                         What are my chances of getting out 
                         of here?

               Roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying.

                                     ROPER
                         Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a 
                         bank in Daly City...

               Roper crouches down, smiles at the blurry-eyed guard.

                                     ROPER
                         How ya doin'?

               The guard groans. He's not doing very well. Roper peels back 
               the bloody handkerchief, takes a look. Winces.

                                     ROPER
                              (to Earl)
                         ...Cops gave him a car, and he lost 
                         them on the freeway.

               Earl is encouraged by that.

                                     EARL
                         Really?

                                     ROPER
                         Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally 
                         your smartest criminals.

               Roper looks directly into Earl's eyes.

                                     ROPER
                         He didn't kill anybody, though.

               Roper bends over the guard.

                                     ROPER
                         This is gonna hurt.

               He grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him 
               across the floor. The guard MOANS piteously.

                                     EARL
                         Hey, leave him alone. What are you 
                         doing?

               Roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door.

                                     ROPER
                         It's part of my negotiator's oath. 
                         If there's an injured party and I 
                         can help them, I'm duty bound by my 
                         oath to do that. You can shoot me if 
                         you want, but the next negotiator in 
                         here is going to tell you the same 
                         thing.

               Earl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath. 
               He lets Roper drag the guard to the door.

                                     ROPER
                         I'll be right back, Earl. Point that 
                         gun away from Debbie.

               Earl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head, 
               then re-thinks and jerks it back against her temple.

               EXT. BANK - DAY

               Roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on 
               the sidewalk. Two SWAT OFFICERS rush up to give aid. One of 
               them is Jennings.

                                     ROPER
                              (whispering to Jennings)
                         Give me your gun.

               (NOTE: The method of disarming Earl is still to be determined) 
               Jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to 
               him. Roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband 
               under his shirt and vest.

                                     ROPER
                         I haven't had to shoot anyone in 
                         three years.

                                     JENNINGS
                         Why not keep the streak alive?

                                     ROPER
                         Because this strung-out junkie is 
                         too stupid to get out of this without 
                         killing somebody.

               INT. BANK - DAY

               Earl watches Roper through the window. He can only see Roper's 
               back. He's getting very agitated.

                                     EARL
                              (yelling)
                         HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OUT 
                         THERE!

               The two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and Roper 
               calmly walks back into the bank. Stops about five paces from 
               Earl.

                                     ROPER
                         As a rule, I need one hostage released 
                         as show of good faith.

               Roper glances at Debbie. Gun pressed against her head. Tears 
               start rolling down her cheeks. She's being tremendously brave.

                                     ROPER
                         Give me Debbie.

               Earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her 
               head.

                                     EARL
                         Take the old guy.

               The other hostages watch this exchange tensely.

                                     ROPER
                         The Old Guy? What kind of show of 
                         faith is that? I want Debbie.

                                     EARL
                         Am I gettin' the car?

                                     ROPER
                         You're gettin' the car.

               Earl thinks about it, his gun hand twitching. He points at 
               two of the female employees cowering against the counter.

                                     EARL
                         Take them.

               Roper decides that this is the best he's going to get.

                                     ROPER
                         You two, leave.

               The two women don't need any extra encouragement. They jump 
               up and rush out the front door.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

               McCall and Forbes watch through their rifle scopes as the 
               two released hostages are whisked away by uniformed cops.

                                     FORBES
                         This guy is good.

                                     MCCALL
                         That's what they say.

               INT. BANK - DAY

                                     ROPER
                         That was fine, Earl. Now I'm going 
                         to get your car.

               Roper turns around and walks toward the front door. He stops 
               and looks over his shoulder.

                                     ROPER
                         Oh, there's one last thing.

               Earl looks like he's right on the edge.

                                     EARL
                         What?!

                                     ROPER
                         You want a convertible or hardtop?

               Earl thinks about that for a beat...

                                     ROPER
                         Hardtop.

               Roper turns around, starts walking again. He keeps his eyes 
               focused on the reflection of Earl in the front window of the 
               bank.

                                     ROPER
                              (without turning around)
                         Manual or automatic?

                                     EARL
                         Automatic.

                                     ROPER
                         You got it.

               In one swift motion, Roper turns, aims and FIRES!...

               One SHOT. It tears into Earl's shoulder. One inch from 
               Debbie's neck. Earl is blown back against the counter. Debbie 
               shrieks at the top of her lungs.

               SWAT guys pour in from every entrance. YELLING for everybody 
               to "GET DOWN"! Pointing guns. They pounce on Earl.

                                     EARL
                         I give up! I give up!

               Roper goes to Debbie, puts his arm around her and gently 
               leads her out of the bank.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

               McCall and Forbes still have their rifles trained on the 
               bank door. Their police radio squawks...

                                     RADIO
                         The situation is secured. Suspect in 
                         custody. Repeat. Situation secured.

               McCall lowers his rifle as Roper guides Debbie through the 
               wave of cops rushing into the bank.

               EXT. STREET - SHORT TIME LATER

               Roper is exiting the bank and putting back on his gun when 
               he hears the sound of a CAMERA SHUTTER. He turns to see 
               VERONICA (RONNIE) TATE holding the camera. She snaps one of 
               Roper with Earl in the b.g. being placed in a squad car.

                                     RONNIE
                         There's one for the front page.

               Roper puts his hand over his heart as if stricken with love... 
               which he in fact is.

                                     ROPER
                         Ronnie, why are you torturing me? I 
                         can't live without you.

               Ronnie rolls her eyes. She doesn't take Roper all that 
               seriously.

                                     RONNIE
                         Don't start.

               She slings the camera over her shoulder and starts to walk 
               off. Roper dogs her.

                                     ROPER
                         This baseball player you're going 
                         out with...
                              (shaking his head)
                         He's no good for you.

                                     RONNIE
                         Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He 
                         makes two million a year, and he 
                         worships me.

                                     ROPER
                         I worship you.

                                     RONNIE
                         You worship yourself.

                                     ROPER
                         Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.

                                     RONNIE
                         Greg.

                                     ROPER
                         Did you know he's already got a bad 
                         knee? In another 10 years you're 
                         going to be pushing him around in a 
                         wheelchair.

               Ronnie stops. Looks him in the eye.

                                     RONNIE
                         You know what I think? I think you 
                         only want me now, because I'm with 
                         somebody else.

                                     ROPER
                         Who cares what you think. I want you 
                         back and that's all that matters.

               Ronnie smiles, but offers no response.

                                     ROPER
                         Let me take you out tomorrow night... 
                         Pleeease.

                                     RONNIE
                         I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.

                                     ROPER
                              (frowning)
                         This Greg is really getting in my 
                         way.

               Roper gets down on his knees.

                                     ROPER
                         Please. I'm begging you.

                                     RONNIE
                         Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.

               She takes the lense cap off her camera. Roper primps his 
               hair to make sure he looks good for the picture... CLICK! 
               Suddenly Roper notices that his Trans Am is being towed. He 
               rushes over to his car.

                                     ROPER
                         Hey, that's my car.

               A REPO MAN stands off to the side watching dispassionately.

                                     REPO MAN
                         Not anymore. Now it belongs to Silver 
                         Hills Financial.

               Roper sadly watches the tow truck drive off with his beloved 
               Trans Am.

               INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY - RAINING

               Lots of activity. Officers in cubicles; talking on phones; 
               typing reports on computers. Most are plain-clothed. Roper 
               weaves through the room. Passes by Baffert's desk.

                                     ROPER
                         Hey, Baffert, what's the story for 
                         tonight?

               Baffert pulls two tickets for the Warriors' game out of his 
               pocket.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Floor seats.

                                     ROPER
                         You're my hero.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Dinner's on you.

                                     ROPER
                         Deal.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING

               A quiet contrast to the squadroom. This is the executive 
               branch of Metro. All the big-wigs are officed here. Roper 
               walks down the carpeted hall. No one here except Kevin McCall 
               quietly sitting outside Captain Solis' office. Roper and 
               McCall make brief eye contact. Roper thinks nothing of it. 
               He goes into the Captain's office.

               INT. CAPTAIN SOLIS' OFFICE - RAINING

               CAPTAIN FRANK SOLIS is on the phone. There's a file on the 
               desk in front of him. He motions Roper to sit down.

                                     SOLIS
                         He just walked into my office.
                              (looks over at Roper)
                         The Chief says, "Good work this 
                         morning. Congratulations."

               Roper smiles as he sits down.

                                     ROPER
                         Tell him to give me a raise.

                                     SOLIS
                              (into the phone)
                         He says, "Thank you very much."
                              (a beat)
                         I'll discuss it with him right now... 
                         Good-bye, Chief.

               Solis hangs up. Looks across the desk at Roper. A long pause. 
               He knows he's got leverage.

                                     SOLIS
                         Roper.

                                     ROPER
                         What?

                                     SOLIS
                         Are you going to make this hard for 
                         me?

                                     ROPER
                         Depends. What's up?

                                     SOLIS
                         There's been some concern about you 
                         continuing to work without back-up.

                                     ROPER
                         Define concern.

               Solis dumps his cards on the table.

                                     SOLIS
                         What if you die and no one can do 
                         what you do as well as you do it?

                                     ROPER
                         Your concern is heartwarming.

                                     SOLIS
                         It's been decided that you take on 
                         another partner and train him to be 
                         able to take over for you.

                                     ROPER
                         Is that what the guy in the Sunday 
                         School suit is doing outside?

                                     SOLIS
                         His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro 
                         Captain agrees that he's their top 
                         sharp-shooter and most likely to 
                         succeed.

               Roper grabs McCall's folder off the desk.

                                     ROPER
                         Let me see that.

               Roper scans it.

                                     ROPER
                         Tested high on his intellectual 
                         aptitude... Not as high as me but...

               INT. HALLWAY - SAME - RAINING

               McCall turns around in his chair. He can see Roper and Solis 
               through the glass walls of the office, but he can't hear 
               their voices.

               INT. SOLIS' OFFICE - SAME - RAINING

                                     ROPER
                         "Additional Skills": Biathelete, 
                         marathoner, lip-reading, speaks 
                         Spanish...

               Roper throws the folder back on the desk.

                                     ROPER
                         Great, send him to the Marines. This 
                         guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit 
                         in two weeks.

                                     SOLIS
                         You let us worry about that.

                                     ROPER
                         Is there going to be an expression 
                         of your appreciation?

                                     SOLIS
                              (gloomily)
                         What kind of appreciation are we 
                         talking about?

                                     ROPER
                         The financial kind. I figure I'm 
                         going to be working extra hours. All 
                         sorts of overtime... training 
                         sessions... Not to mention the extra 
                         stress...

                                     SOLIS
                         What do you think would be in order?

                                     ROPER
                         Like ahh... I don't know...
                              (boldly)
                         Five thousand dollars.

                                     SOLIS
                              (calmly)
                         Okay, I think I could swing that.

               Uh-oh, Roper thinks maybe he sold short.

                                     ROPER
                              (quickly)
                         And a car.

                                     SOLIS
                         Hey, you just got a five thousand 
                         dollar raise. Get a car of your own.

                                     ROPER
                         You know you've got nothing but cars 
                         down there in impound.

                                     SOLIS
                         Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.

                                     ROPER
                              (firmly)
                         The car is part of the deal.

                                     SOLIS
                         What happened to your Trans Am?

               Solis gets up and taps the glass, motions for McCall to come 
               in.

                                     ROPER
                         Repoed this morning.

                                     SOLIS
                              (relenting)
                         I'll provide you with transportation.

                                     ROPER
                         And even if this doesn't work, I 
                         want all the money. These SWAT guys 
                         don't have the temperament. They 
                         don't have the background...

               McCall enters the office.

                                     ROPER
                              (instant character 
                              change)
                         Hey, glad to meet you. I've heard 
                         nothing but good things about you...

               Roper reaches out. They shake hands.

                                     MCCALL
                         Same here. I've watched you in action. 
                         Very impressive.

                                     ROPER
                         You've got a lot of hard work ahead 
                         of you if you want to be a negotiator.

                                     MCCALL
                         I'm ready to do it.
                              (a beat)
                         And I'm going to be here more than 
                         two weeks.

               Roper's face darkens.

                                     ROPER
                         Don't go reading my lips, man. That's 
                         an intrusion. Save that shit for the 
                         sniper school. Comprende?

                                     MCCALL
                         Sorry... Habit.

                                     SOLIS
                              (intervening)
                         Let's move past this, gentlemen.

               Roper smiles.

                                     ROPER
                         We're already past it, aren't we, 
                         Kevin?

                                     MCCALL
                         If you say so.

                                     SOLIS
                         Then you'll have to excuse me. I 
                         have other work to do.

               Roper and McCall head out the door.

                                     SOLIS
                         Roper...

               Roper turns back around.

                                     SOLIS
                         About the transportation issue... 
                         You check with the impound sergeant.

               Roper smiles. Total victory.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING

               MOVING with Roper and McCall.

                                     ROPER
                         You ever been in a hostage situation?

                                     MCCALL
                         Only at the very end.

                                     ROPER
                         How do you feel after a shooting.

                                     MCCALL
                              (self-assured)
                         Like it had to be done.

               They enter the squadroom, wind through the cubicles.

                                     ROPER
                         It rarely has to be done.

                                     MCCALL
                         I've rarely shot anyone.

                                     ROPER
                         SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.

                                     MCCALL
                              (flatly)
                         I know.

                                     ROPER
                         Try to remember that.

               They arrive at Roper's desk.

                                     ROPER
                         Okay, "Dead Eye", lesson one...

               Roper grabs an empty soda bottle from a neighboring desk. He 
               takes the cap off a ball point pen and drops it into the 
               empty bottle. He places the bottle on his desk.

                                     ROPER
                         Extract that pen cap without touching 
                         or moving the bottle.

               McCall looks at the bottle quizzically.

                                     MCCALL
                         What's the point of this?

                                     ROPER
                         A little exercise in lateral thinking. 
                         The obvious solution isn't always 
                         the only solution... See you tomorrow.

               Roper grabs his jacket and walks off, leaving McCall to ponder 
               the problem. McCall looks over at another cop who has been 
               observing. The cop shrugs his shoulders. He hasn't got a 
               clue. McCall sits down and thoughtfully peers into the bottle.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

               Roper and Baffert walking past the row of cars, including 
               Solis' cadillac, searching for Roper's "new" transportation... 
               Roper is holding the keys in his hand.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Mind if we make a stop on the way? 
                         We busted Frank Antonucci on 
                         possession. He gave us a lead on 
                         that Polk Street jewelry heist.

                                     ROPER
                         "Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your 
                         time. He'd tell you his granny was 
                         in on the Kennedy assassination if 
                         he could dodge a collar.

                                     BAFFERT
                         I still gotta do it. Wasting time is 
                         half my job.

                                     ROPER
                         Yeah, okay.

               Roper is looking at the numbered parking spaces.

                                     BAFFERT
                         This SWAT guy might be a good idea. 
                         He may be able to take a little 
                         pressure off you. I worry about you.

                                     ROPER
                         You worried about me, too? The chief's 
                         worried about me. Solis is worried 
                         about me. Maybe you guys should start 
                         some kind of organization.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Speaking of which. I saw you talking 
                         to Ronnie this morning. Why can't 
                         you get it back together with her. 
                         You've gotta be out of your mind not 
                         to get with that one.

                                     ROPER
                         It's not me. It's her. She's going 
                         out with this baseball player -- 
                         Greg Barnett.

                                     BAFFERT
                              (impressed)
                         No shit! He's good!

                                     ROPER
                         Fuck him. He swings at anything in 
                         the dirt. I could strike him out.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Don't give up on her. You're getting 
                         to the age when you ought to be 
                         thinking about these things.

               Roper bends over like an old man.

                                     ROPER
                         Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up.

               They arrive at their destination. A parking space with a 
               1957 DODGE PICKUP.

                                     BAFFERT
                         This is it. Space 742.

               Roper looks at the pickup truck in disbelief.

                                     ROPER
                         Then he didn't say 742. He must have 
                         said 724 or something, because this 
                         can't be right.

               Baffert unlocks the pickup and offers the keys to Roper who 
               is crossing to the truck.

                                     ROPER
                         Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx? I'm not 
                         riding in this shit. I can't roll in 
                         no shit like this.

               He takes the keys from Baffert who moves around to the 
               passengers side. He opens the door.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Where's the stereo?

                                     ROPER
                         Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?

                                     BAFFERT
                         Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.

               EXT. MARKET STREET - NIGHT

               The pickup in traffic.

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. KORDA'S BUILDING - NIGHT

               It's a four story twenties style walk-up. It's evening now. 
               The pickup pulls to a stop out front.

               INT. PICKUP - NIGHT

               Baffert pulls out a slip of paper.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Apartment 306.

                                     ROPER
                         You want me to go up with you?

                                     BAFFERT
                         Nah, It probably won't turn up 
                         anything. I'm just gonna talk to 
                         him.

                                     ROPER
                         Good. I don't want to be late.

               Baffert gets out. Roper grabs his cell phone.

                                     ROPER
                         You want anything on the game?

               Baffert turns back around.

                                     BAFFERT
                         What's the line?

                                     ROPER
                         It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.

                                     BAFFERT
                         I'll take half of your action.

               Baffert goes into the building. Roper dials his cellular 
               phone. Beep! Beep!

               DETAIL SHOT

               A message on the display reads: RECHARGE BATTERY.

               Roper looks around. There's a payphone across the street. He 
               gets out of the truck and crosses to it.

               INT. BUILDING - NIGHT

               Third floor hallway. Nice, middle class place. Well kept up. 
               Baffert walks over to room 306. Knocks.

               INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT

               Jazz is playing. MICHAEL KORDA sits motionless in a chair 
               listening to the music. There's a KNOCK. Korda responds as 
               if pulled from a trance. He rises and moves to the door.

                                     KORDA
                         Who is it?

                                     BAFFERT (V.O.)
                         It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the 
                         San Francisco Police Department.

               A slight hesitation from Korda. He glances around the 
               apartment. For what reason, we don't know. Maybe to make 
               sure there's nothing incriminating around. He opens the door.

                                     KORDA
                         What happened? Is there a problem?

                                     BAFFERT
                         May I come in? I would just like to 
                         ask you a couple of questions.

               Korda steps aside and lets Baffert enter. Korda closes the 
               door. Baffert scans the place. Not bad. He listens to the 
               music. A smile grows on his face.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Count Basie?

               Korda smiles back. Another jazz aficionada.

                                     KORDA
                         Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What 
                         They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 
                         1945.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.

               Korda goes to the stereo, turns it down. Duke Ellington plays 
               low.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Where did you find an old recording 
                         like that?

                                     KORDA
                         Used record shop down on Turk Street. 
                         I was in there looking for some Robert 
                         Johnson.
                              (searching for the 
                              name)
                         Memories... Memory Lane or 
                         something...

                                     BAFFERT
                         I've got to stop in there... Mr. 
                         Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?

                                     KORDA
                         You mean Frank who owns the bakery 
                         down the street?

               Baffert smiles.

                                     BAFFERT
                         No, this is a different Frank. This 
                         is a man who deals in jewelry. Stolen 
                         jewelry usually. You wouldn't know 
                         anybody like that?

               Korda drifts to the other side of the room. Takes a look out 
               his front window...

               HIS POV

               Nobody there. Just the truck.

                                     KORDA
                         I certainly wouldn't.

               He says it as if the very idea disturbs him. He turns away 
               from the window. Baffert feigns a coughing spell.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Could I please have a little water?

                                     KORDA
                              (the perfect host)
                         Of course.

               Korda heads toward the kitchen area. Baffert uses this as an 
               opportunity to drift around the room. Do a little snooping.

                                     BAFFERT
                         The reason I'm asking you is because 
                         we arrested him with some stolen 
                         jewelry. It was traced to the robbery 
                         of a store down on Polk Street. He 
                         said he was fencing it for you.

               Baffert notices something in the trash can.

               HIS POV

               Several glassine envelopes used for raw jewels. They have 
               jeweler's markings on them indicating gem weight and grade.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Korda, pouring the water, notices Baffert's discovery, but 
               his face betrays nothing.

                                     KORDA
                              (calmly)
                         There's obviously some mistake. I 
                         have a cousin who has had run-ins 
                         with the law.

               Korda re-enters the room with the glass of water.

                                     KORDA
                         Perhaps for his own reasons he 
                         entangled me in this... situation.

                                     BAFFERT
                         This cousin of yours... What's his 
                         name?

                                     KORDA
                              (forthrightly)
                         Clarence Teal.

               They look at each other a beat. Korda is still holding the 
               water.

                                     KORDA
                         Your cough seems to be better.

               A real repressed tension here. Someone's about to get hurt. 
               Baffert takes the glass of water.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Thank you.

               He takes a sip. Korda watches him like a cobra. Baffert puts 
               the glass down on the table.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Well, I'm on my way to the game. I 
                         appreciate your cooperation, Mr. 
                         Korda.

               Korda smiles. Baffert walks to the door. Opens it to leave...

                                     KORDA
                         Lieutenant...

               Baffert turns back around.

                                     KORDA
                         Do you believe that story about Robert 
                         Johnson...? That he made a deal with 
                         the devil at the crossroads?

               Baffert muses along with Korda.

                                     BAFFERT
                         Could be.

               Baffert moves off down the hall and Korda closes his door.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Baffert gets into the elevator.

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               Baffert takes out his cell phone. Dials.

                                     BAFFERT
                              (as the elevator 
                              descends)
                         Hello, Judge Stone... This is 
                         Lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a 
                         suspect's residence. I'm requesting 
                         a telephonic search warrant in 
                         connection with an armed robbery at 
                         a jewelry store. There's visible 
                         evidence on the premises. Glassine 
                         envelopes with jeweler's markings 
                         were seen in the trash can...

               The elevator hits the first floor.

                                     BAFFERT
                         ...I believe a full search of the 
                         premises will turn up some stolen 
                         property...

               The elevator opens.

               Korda is standing there with a knife.

               Baffert has no time to react...

               The knife hand slashes forward... Stabbing the chest and 
               slashing across the throat.

               EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

               Korda calmly exits the building as Roper crosses the street, 
               returning from the payphone. Neither of the men take any 
               particular notices of each other. A WOMAN carrying her 
               groceries enters the building.

               Roper gets to the truck. A SCREAM from inside the building.

               INT. BUILDING - NIGHT

               Baffert is laying in the open elevator, knife wounds to his 
               neck and chest. Roper rushes over to him. It doesn't look 
               good.

               The woman with the groceries is standing halfway up the first 
               flight of stairs. Frozen. Roper pulls out his gun and rushes 
               by her up the stairs.

                                     ROPER
                              (to the woman)
                         Get an ambulance!

               INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Roper arrives at the top of the stairs. Korda's door is ajar. 
               Duke Ellington can be heard faintly.

               INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT

               Roper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready... 
               No one there. Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a 
               door. Roper races out.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Roper sprints to the door at the end of the hall, KICKS it 
               open. Gun aimed.

               INT. APT. 302 - NIGHT

               A five year old stares up at him. Scared stiff. Roper holds 
               up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he 
               leaves.

               EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

               Roper burst out the front. Down the stairs to the sidewalk. 
               Looks both ways down the street... Realizes in dismay that 
               Korda is long gone. A SIREN approaches.

               INT. SOLIS OFFICE - NIGHT - RAIN

               Angle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window 
               looking out to the rain. Solis is in the b.g. on the phone.

                                     SOLIS
                              (on the phone)
                         Yes sir. Every resource will be 
                         brought to bear. We will find this 
                         guy... Yeah, he's here now. I'll 
                         tell him.

               Solis hangs up the phone.

                                     SOLIS
                         The chief says to tell you how sorry 
                         he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a 
                         good man.

                                     ROPER
                              (still looking out 
                              window)
                         He said he was just going up to talk 
                         to him. He said...
                              (beat; turning to 
                              Solis)
                         I want to be put on this case.

                                     SOLIS
                         I can't do that.

                                     ROPER
                              (emphatic)
                         I want to be put on this case.

                                     SOLIS
                         You know I can't assign you to this. 
                         You're much too close to it. You 
                         were much too close to Sam. The 
                         department will take care of it.

                                     ROPER
                         Who's running it?

                                     SOLIS
                         Roper...

                                     ROPER
                         Who's running it!

                                     SOLIS
                         Kimura and Glass will head the 
                         investigation.

               Roper turns to leave.

                                     SOLIS
                         Scott. Go home. Get some sleep.

               Roper pauses at the door. Then pulls out two basketball 
               tickets and lays them on the table in Solis' office. He exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. METRO OFFICE AREA - NIGHT

               Two detectives. A female named KIMURA and a tall guy named 
               GLASS, try to make a getaway as they see Roper coming.

                                     ROPER
                         Hey, hey, hey...

               Roper intercepts them.

                                     ROPER
                         Anything on Korda so far?

                                     KIMURA
                         Solis said to keep you clear of this.

               Roper responds louder than necessary with a half turn toward 
               Solis' hallway.

                                     ROPER
                         I don't give a damn what Solis said.
                              (to the detectives)
                         If you get a lead, I want to know.

               EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NIGHT - RAINING

               Roper's pickup drives by.

               INT. PICKUP

               Thru the windshield. We see Roper as the windshield wipers 
               flap back and forth. His face seems dazed and lost.

               INT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Roper knocks. Ronnie's cheerful voice can be heard.

                                     RONNIE (O.S.)
                         Just a minute.

               Roper makes no effort to pull himself together. The door 
               opens and Ronnie's face registers surprise. She's dressed 
               casually in jeans, a nice shirt, but wears make-up and 
               earrings.

                                     RONNIE
                         Hey.

                                     ROPER
                         Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.

                                     RONNIE
                              (like hell)
                         A little late for that, Scottie. 
                         He's asleep.
                              (smells his breath)
                         Jack Daniels?

                                     ROPER
                         I'm not drunk. Yet.

                                     RONNIE
                         Maybe you should be.

                                     ROPER
                         You heard.

               She nods, sympathetic, but doesn't leave the doorway.

                                     RONNIE
                         Yeah. I'm sorry.

                                     ROPER
                         Can I come in?

               Ronnie opens the door reluctantly.

               INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Roper enters. Instantly we see he's at home here. He hangs 
               his coat in the closet, puts his keys on the table, notices 
               a photograph on the wall. Quite imposing. Very unique style.

                                     ROPER
                         That a new picture?

                                     RONNIE
                         About 4 months old. I'm working in a 
                         new style.

               Roper gazes at it indifferently. He falls silent. Thoughts 
               turned inward. Suddenly, TROY, (the dog), bounds in. He's 
               ecstatic to see Roper. He puts his front paws on the couch 
               and his head in Roper's lap.

                                     ROPER
                         Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy?
                              (to Ronnie)
                         He heard my voice.

               Roper smiles briefly, pats the dog, taking comfort from his 
               presence. His words are light. His tone isn't.

                                     ROPER
                         How's the good dog. I miss you buddy. 
                         You miss me?

               Ronnie watches them, suddenly showing the sadness she's 
               carefully buried.

                                     ROPER
                         He misses me.

               She nods. A moment's silence.

                                     ROPER
                         I won't stay long. I had to talk to 
                         someone.

                                     RONNIE
                              (a bit surprised at 
                              his openness)
                         You don't usually talk to anyone 
                         when you're hurting.

                                     ROPER
                         It was my fault. I was right 
                         downstairs. I should have gone up 
                         with him.

                                     RONNIE
                         Scott, You can't save everyone.

                                     ROPER
                         I've proved that, didn't I?

               She's not coming closer. She wants to, but she won't do it. 
               She seems uneasy, glances towards the door. Roper rises.

                                     ROPER
                         Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.

                                     RONNIE
                              (gentle)
                         What do you want from me?

                                     ROPER
                         Something I guess I can't have 
                         anymore.

                                     RONNIE
                         Don't try to make me feel guilty. 
                         The whole time we were together, you 
                         went out of your way to prove you 
                         didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for 
                         one night, you need me again. I can't 
                         do it. I can't be more than your 
                         friend. Because I know what will 
                         happen. In a few weeks you'll be 
                         back on top, and you'll shut me out 
                         just as soon as you don't need me 
                         again.

                                     ROPER
                              (surprised, hurt)
                         You think I didn't need you?

                                     RONNIE
                         If you did, you never showed it.

                                     ROPER
                         Ronnie...

               He reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to 
               him, but at that moment there's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Ronnie 
               pulls back, confused and guilty.

                                     ROPER
                         You expecting someone?

               Her silence is the answer... A flash of pain from Roper.

                                     ROPER
                         This day just keeps getting better.

               Ronnie watches as he searches for his keys in his pockets.

                                     RONNIE
                              (soft)
                         They're on the table where you always 
                         leave them.

               He grabs the keys as she opens the door. GREG stands outside 
               waiting. He's a big, good looking guy with a smile on his 
               face.

                                     GREG
                         Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were...

               Greg's smile fades as he sees Roper.

                                     ROPER
                         I was just leaving.

               Roper strides past Greg who remains in the doorway. Ronnie 
               makes brief eye contact with Greg, but then moves past him 
               to follow Roper. She calls after him.

                                     RONNIE
                         Scottie... take care of yourself.

               Roper doesn't look back. He just goes.

               EXT. PIER 26 - EARLY MORNING

               A huge warehouse. Sun coming up over the East Bay, CLARENCE 
               TEAL rides up on a HARLEY MOTORCYLE, carrying a large cup of 
               coffee to go. He enters the warehouse.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME

               Car and Boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high. Clarence 
               shuffles through to his watchman's quarters which are 
               connected to the end of the warehouse.

               INT. WATCHMAN'S QUARTERS - SAME

               Built on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay. Korda is 
               waiting behind the door as Clarence enters. He seizes Clarence 
               from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him 
               around. Hot coffee soaks the front of Clarence's shirt.

                                     KORDA
                         If you weren't family I'd kill you.

               Clarence is scared. He offers no defense.

                                     KORDA
                         You told Antonucci that shit came 
                         from me.

                                     CLARENCE
                         So that we could get the best price. 
                         He's got respect for you. He's gonna 
                         try to lowball me, Mike.

               Korda tosses Clarence down onto the cot.

                                     KORDA
                         You fucking idiot! Why do you think 
                         I use you?... To be a walking 
                         advertisement.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of 
                         LaMarra flipping on anyone before. 
                         He said he had the cops paid off. 
                         Antonucci never flipped on anyone 
                         before. He had the cops paid off.

                                     KORDA
                         Not the fucking cop that showed up 
                         at my door!

                                     CLARENCE
                         What happened, Mike.

                                     KORDA
                         You don't want to know.

               Tears start to come to Clarence's eyes.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I'm sorry, Mike.

               Clarence sincerely feels bad. It's kind of touching in a 
               twisted way. Korda moves over to the window to keep from 
               striking Clarence again. He looks off across the bay.

                                     KORDA
                         God damn it! I still needed to case 
                         that fucking store. It's too risky 
                         to show my face now.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I got a couple thousand bucks. You 
                         could leave town.

                                     KORDA
                         Leave town? They're going to know me 
                         in fucking Des Moines now!...
                              (a beat)
                         They got over ten million in jewels 
                         in that place. That's freedom, man. 
                         I could go anywhere I want.

               Clarence watches Korda warily. Things are beginning to add 
               up in his head.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Did you kill him, Mike?

               Korda turns to Clarence with a penetrated stare that answers 
               the question. Clarence is shaken by that. He starts to whimper 
               again.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I'm sorry, Mike. I'm really sorry...

               We're talking major fear here...

               Korda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around 
               again, but, surprisingly, he hugs Clarence's head against 
               his chest.

                                     KORDA
                         It's not your fault you're stupid.

               Tears of relief from Clarence.

               INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               Roper enters the squadroom. His mood is contained. He walks 
               to a desk where Kimura and Glass are huddling.

               A couple desks over, McCall is reclining in Roper's chair, 
               reading a book entitled, "Strategies and Counter Measures in 
               Hostage Situations". On the desk in front of him is the bottle 
               with the pen cap still in it.

                                     ROPER
                              (to Kimura and Glass)
                         What do you got on Korda?

                                     KIMURA
                         We ran a search on relatives. He has 
                         a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. 
                         Smalltime thief. Last known address 
                         was on Pine Street. He moved out a 
                         month ago. We've got a couple leads 
                         on him to check out.

                                     ROPER
                              (rapid fire)
                         Did you check out DMV for any vehicles 
                         registration?

                                     KIMURA
                         Being faxed over now.

                                     ROPER
                         How about the record room for any 
                         incident reports? He might be a 
                         victim. We can get medical records. 
                         Check with burglary detail and see 
                         if anyone else knows him, knows his 
                         habits.

                                     KIMURA
                         Roper...

                                     ROPER
                         And what about bars? We can talk to 
                         neighbors to see what bars he 
                         frequents.

                                     KIMURA
                         Roper, we're into it...

               Suddenly Solis appears at their side.

                                     SOLIS
                         We've had this conversation once, 
                         Roper. You're not active on this 
                         case.

               Roper looks at him icily.

                                     SOLIS
                         It's in everyone's best interest.

               McCall, Kimura, Glass all watch this confrontation tensely. 
               After a beat, Roper gives in. Indicates his compliance. Solis 
               heads back to this office.

                                     ROPER
                              (softened)
                         You guys are doing good work.

               He moves toward the desk. McCall gets up when he sees him 
               coming.

                                     MCCALL
                         I'm sorry about your friend. I had a 
                         friend in SWAT killed. I know how it 
                         can be.

                                     ROPER
                         I appreciate your concern. Let's 
                         leave it at that.

               McCall respectfully drops it. Roper looks down at the soda 
               bottle.

                                     ROPER
                         I don't see much progress here.

               McCall holds up a finger. Not so fast. He picks up a pot 
               from a nearby "Mr. Coffee" machine. It's filled with water. 
               He takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle.

               CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE

               The pen cap floats to the top and McCall plucks it out without 
               touching or moving the bottle.

                                     ROPER
                         Very nice... You get an "A". Notice... 
                         No force required. No damage.

               Just then a SERGEANT calls to Roper across the squadroom.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Roper, domestic disturbance at 472 
                         6th Street. Possible hostage 
                         situation.

               McCall grabs his duffel bag. Roper starts away from the desk, 
               then notices the book on "Hostage Strategies". He looks at 
               the title, then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the 
               trash can. He and McCall head out.

               EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY

               The pickup is weaving through traffic.

               INT. PICKUP - DAY

               Start on one of those air freshener evergreen trees hanging 
               from the rear view mirror. PULL BACK to show a police bubble 
               flashing on the dashboard.

               Roper weaving through traffic. McCall is sitting calmly as 
               ever.

                                     ROPER
                         So, McCall, how come you ended up in 
                         San Francisco?

                                     MCCALL
                         They recruited me. Promised me fast 
                         advancement.

                                     ROPER
                         Recruited you from where?

                                     MCCALL
                         National Marksman Competition.

                                     ROPER
                         With your qualifications you must 
                         have had a lot of offers. Why here?

                                     MCCALL
                         Furthest point I could find from New 
                         York.

                                     ROPER
                         You don't like New York?

                                     MCCALL
                         Spent my whole life there. I just 
                         wanted to get out for a while.

                                     ROPER
                         You'd never been out of New York?

                                     MCCALL
                         Been to Toronto. My mother was born 
                         there.

                                     ROPER
                         How did you like Toronto?

                                     MCCALL
                         It was okay.

                                     ROPER
                         You're a real excitable sort, aren't 
                         you?

                                     MCCALL
                         You caught me on an "up" day.
                              (a beat)
                         How about you? How did you end up in 
                         San Francisco?

                                     ROPER
                         I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the 
                         Bay Bridge and here I was.
                              (a beat)
                         So you're looking for "fast 
                         advancement".

                                     MCCALL
                         Is there something wrong with that?

                                     ROPER
                         I'm not sure.

               EXT. 6TH STREET - DAY

               Several Patrol Cars are parked in front of an unappealing 
               apartment building. A crowd has begun to gather. UNIFORMED 
               POLICEMEN hold them back. TWO COPS are questioning a man 
               wearing only green slacks. No shirt. No shoes. Just the 
               slacks. He is very agitated.

               The pickup screeches up. Roper and McCall hop out. Roper 
               flashes his badge to the OFFICER in charge. (OFFICER #1)

                                     ROPER
                         Roper. Metro Division. Hostage 
                         Negotiator. Give me the short version.

                                     OFFICER #1
                         Husband came home. Found that guy 
                         and his wife "in flagrante". Now 
                         he's holding her at knife point.

                                     ROPER
                         Which apartment?

               The Officer points up to the third floor.

                                     OFFICER #1
                         That one with the bars on the windows.

               Roper nods. Walks back over to the pickup. Looks up. Eyeballs 
               the building.

                                     ROPER
                         How are we gonna get him out of there?

                                     MCCALL
                         We could fill it with water.

               Roper throws him a look. McCall walks to the back of the 
               pickup, reaches into the cab and digs around in his duffel 
               bag.

                                     ROPER
                              (to Officer #1)
                         Have you evacuated anyone?

                                     OFFICER #1
                         Only that floor.

                                     ROPER
                         Is the hostage injured?

                                     OFFICER #1
                         Don't know. She keeps screaming to 
                         stay out. He keeps screaming to stay 
                         out. We decided to stay out.

                                     ROPER
                         Well, there's a good amount of 
                         agreement on that.

               McCall slams the truck door, sniper rifle in hand.

                                     MCCALL
                         I'll take "highground" until SWAT 
                         gets here.
                              (surveying the area)
                         I can get a good sight-line from 
                         that roof across the street.

               McCall marches off across the street.

                                     ROPER
                         Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying 
                         to limit the force here.

               McCall calls back over his shoulder.

                                     MCCALL
                         I know my job.

               At that moment, a scream echoes down from the third floor 
               window. Roper heads for the front door of the building.

               INT. APT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - (ACROSS THE STREET)

               McCall bounds up the stairs of the building to the rooftop.

               INT. 6TH ST. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

               The screams are getting more panicky. Roper comes down the 
               hall quickly. The door to the apartment is open. It's been 
               that way since the guy in the green slacks fled. Roper hurries 
               toward the door.

               INT. APARTMENT - DAY

               The WIFE is in bra and panties and the HUSBAND is 6'4". He's 
               giving her a good beating. It's a studio apartment. Unmade 
               bed. Belongings strewn all over. Window open with sun 
               streaming in, and a good view of the building across the 
               street. We hear ROPER'S VOICE from out in the hall.

                                     ROPER (V.O.)
                         I'm coming in. I'm not armed.

               The husband snatches his wife by the hair and holds a knife 
               to her throat.

                                     WIFE
                              (shrieking)
                         No, Raymond!

                                     RAYMOND
                              (to Roper)
                         Stay the fuck out of here!

               But Roper steps into the apartment. Sees the wife. Face 
               swollen. Knife to her neck. The enraged husband, contemplating 
               murder. One inch from committing the act. Roper doesn't bat 
               an eye.

                                     ROPER
                         I know how you feel, Ray.

                                     RAYMOND
                         You don't know shit, and I suggest 
                         you leave.

               He presses the knife against the wife's throat. She winces. 
               Her chest heaves.

                                     ROPER
                         I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my 
                         negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the 
                         room with the hostage, I have to 
                         stay.

                                     RAYMOND
                         You don't want to see what I'm going 
                         to do to her.

                                     ROPER
                         Let me show you something, Ray.

               Roper reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wallet. He 
               extracts a photo.

               CLOSEUP PHOTO

               Wife. Two kids. A little dog-eared. Nice touch.

               ROPER

               holds it up so Raymond can see it.

                                     ROPER
                         Same thing happened to me, man. She 
                         cheated on me, but I forgave her. 
                         You know why?

                                     RAYMOND
                         I ain't interested in your life story.

                                     ROPER
                         Because I was partially to blame. I 
                         wasn't around as much as I should 
                         have been. I forgot how to love her.

                                     RAYMOND
                         She's the one to blame. Not me.

               EXT. ROOF ACROSS THE STREET - ON MCCALL

               In prone position. Rifle in hand. Eye to scope.

               POV THROUGH SIGHT

               of Raymond's open window.

               INT. RAYMOND'S APARTMENT

               Everyone where we left them. Roper looks at Ray with utter 
               sincerity.

                                     ROPER
                         Ray, think about how she looked when 
                         you married her. Think about how 
                         happy you were. Don't lose that, 
                         man. Don't give up everything.

                                     RAYMOND
                         What am I giving up? I'm laid off 
                         last year. I'm down to my last 
                         unemployment check. I'm out on the 
                         streets looking for work and this 
                         bitch is banging some asshole in my 
                         bed.

               And now Ray is crying. Blubbering actually. And he's not 
               that coherent.

                                     RAYMOND
                         I'm down at Consolidated and I'm 
                         begging. I'm saying I'll take half 
                         my pay. Eight years, man. I don't 
                         even have to work the loading docks 
                         anymore. I'll do maintenance. "We're 
                         cutting back. We're streamlining, 
                         Ray. West Central's running things 
                         now. It's out of our hands" Fuck 
                         them! Fuck them! FUCK THEM!
                              (deep sigh)
                         I'm gonna kill her and then I'm gonna 
                         kill myself, 'cause I don't wanna 
                         live anymore.

               Roper reaches out to him.

                                     ROPER
                         Ray, if you walk out of here with 
                         me, I'll get you a job.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Doing what? Cleaning toilets?

                                     ROPER
                         I can't guarantee you what it will 
                         be. But I swear on my life, I'll 
                         find you work.

                                     RAYMOND
                         And why the fuck would you do that 
                         for me?

                                     ROPER
                         Not for you, Ray. For me. A close 
                         friend of mine was killed this week. 
                         The way I figure it, I stop you from 
                         doin' what you said, I'm one up on 
                         body count.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?

                                     ROPER
                         My name's Scott Roper.

               Ray stares blankly at Roper's outstretched hand, the knife 
               clutched tightly in his fist... The wife squeezes her eyes 
               closed. Everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat... 
               Then...

                                     RAYMOND
                         I need my coat.

               It's on a coat rack in the corner. But to get there he has 
               to pass by the window. Ray drops his wife on the bed, turns 
               and goes to get his coat.

               He crosses in front of the window... Reaches for the coat. 
               POP! A bullet slams into his skull. Ray falls to the floor. 
               The wife runs out of the room, screaming!

                                     ROPER
                         NOOOO!!

               He rushes over to Ray. Circle of blood soaking into the 
               carpet. Ray's empty eyes. His hand still wrapped in his coat. 
               He was dead instantly. Roper slams his fist into the wall. A 
               couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway. Roper 
               bolts out of the room... Pounds down the hallway... Pounds 
               down the stairs... down another flight...

               EXT. APT. BLDG.

               McCall comes across the street. Roper sees McCall, cool as 
               ever. Rifle slung over his shoulder. Roper steps into his 
               path.

                                     ROPER
                         WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

               McCall gives no answer. He pushes past Roper and continues 
               into the building.

               INT. APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

               Roper follows, screaming his head off.

                                     ROPER
                         Do you think because the police 
                         department issued you a sniper rifle, 
                         it makes you God! What the fuck goes 
                         on in your head?

               McCall, still stone-faced, reaches the apartment. Yellow 
               "crime scene" tape is being placed across the doorway. Cops 
               are tiptoeing around, surveying evidence. McCall ducks under 
               the tape. Roper follows.

               INT. APT. - DAY

               McCall goes over to Ray's body. Crouches down. Roper comes 
               up behind him. McCall picks up the coat covering Ray's arms. 
               Clutched in Ray's hand is a gun "Saturday night special" 
               variety. McCall looks up at Roper.

                                     MCCALL
                         SWAT is a lifesaving unit, remember? 
                         I just saved a life. Yours.

               Roper doesn't miss a beat.

                                     ROPER
                              (still angry)
                         You think I've never had a gun pulled 
                         on me?! You think every fucking time 
                         someone pulls a gun they use it?!

               McCall gets to his feet.

                                     MCCALL
                         Eighty-five percent of domestic 
                         disturbances of this nature end in 
                         murder/suicide.

                                     ROPER
                              (fiercely)
                         Not the ones I'm at.

               McCall and Roper glare at each other. Toe to toe. A beat. 
               McCall's face softens just perceptibly.

                                     MCCALL
                         Sorry. My mistake.

               He walks out of the room. Roper whips the sheet off the bed, 
               contemplates the gun gripped in Ray's hand... Then tosses 
               the sheet over Ray's dead body.

               INT. METRO DIVISION - NIGHT

               Roper seated in the hallway, waiting outside a door marked 
               "Internal Affairs". Things are quiet. Roper stares at the 
               floor. Waiting.

               The door opens. McCall comes out, escorted by two internal 
               affairs INVESTIGATORS. One of the investigators pats him on 
               the back.

                                     INVESTIGATOR
                         Looks like a clean shoot. Go home 
                         and get some rest.

               McCall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear 
               back into the office. Roper approaches McCall. He's cooled 
               off considerably. Even a tad friendly.

                                     ROPER
                         Come on. Let's go for a drink.

                                     MCCALL
                         I don't really like to drink.

                                     ROPER
                         You have to. It's a tradition.

                                     MCCALL
                         Well, if I have to, I have to.

               INT. BILLY GOAT TAVERN - NIGHT

               A neighborhood bar. Roper and McCall are playing pool. Half-
               finished beers are on a nearby table. McCall is bent over 
               the table trying to make a particularly tricky shot. Roper 
               studies him.

                                     ROPER
                         You got a girlfriend?

                                     MCCALL
                         Why? You like my ass?

               McCall misses the shot.

                                     ROPER
                         Better than your pool game.

               Roper lines up his shot.

                                     ROPER
                         You wouldn't want to put a small 
                         wager on this, would you?

                                     MCCALL
                         I don't gamble.

               Roper smiles. Sinks his shot. Moves around the table.

                                     MCCALL
                         Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.

                                     ROPER
                         You living together?

                                     MCCALL
                         She's back in Jersey... going to 
                         graduate school.

                                     ROPER
                         Explain how that works.

                                     MCCALL
                         She's going to come here when she 
                         graduates and then we're gonna get 
                         married.

                                     ROPER
                         She grow up in Livingtston, too?

                                     MCCALL
                              (as if that were 
                              unthinkable)
                         No, no, no...
                              (a beat)
                         She's from Hoboken.

                                     ROPER
                         Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long 
                         for companionship with her such a 
                         long way away in New Jersey?

                                     MCCALL
                         We see each other every couple of 
                         months.

                                     ROPER
                         Every couple of months, huh?

               A couple of months sounds like an awful long time to Roper.

                                     ROPER
                         That's a lot of commitment. I admire 
                         that.

                                     MCCALL
                         Do you really?

                                     ROPER
                         No. Actually I think it's fucking 
                         crazy, I don't know if I could do 
                         it.

                                     MCCALL
                         Thanks for clearing that up.
                              (a beat)
                         I hear your former girlfriend is 
                         going out with Greg Barnett.

                                     ROPER
                         Where did you hear that?

                                     MCCALL
                         Around. Barnett's tough competition.

                                     ROPER
                         Yeah, well that's a sore subject, 
                         and therefore out of bounds to a 
                         young sprout of a hostage negotiator 
                         under my tutelage.

               A beat and then McCall realizes that this comment is a major 
               acknowledgement of acceptance from Roper. Roper misses his 
               shot. Picks up his beer glass.

                                     ROPER
                         Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should 
                         have been lesson one. Never exchange 
                         yourself for a hostage.

                                     MCCALL
                         I think I can handle that one.

                                     ROPER
                         Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.

               Roper takes a drink of beer. Nears the bottom of his glass. 
               Calls to the BARTENDER.

                                     ROPER
                         Zack, another round.

               Roper turns back to McCall.

                                     ROPER
                         My partner gave himself in exchange 
                         for a ten year old girl. He got caught 
                         in the crossfire. Two dead. My partner 
                         and the bad guy...
                              (takes the last sip)
                         Weird thing is, if he was alive, 
                         he'd probably do it again.
                              (a beat)
                         Some people never learn.

               Roper puts down his glass.

                                     ROPER
                         You think you can learn, McCall?

                                     MCCALL
                         I think so.

               Roper nods. Maybe he can.

               INT. ROOM - DAY

               We're looking at a door. It's not clear where we are. McCall 
               enters. We only see his face. Determined.

                                     MCCALL
                         I'm Officer McCall, what's going on?

               REVERSE ANGLE

               It's a training room. It's built to approximate a convenience 
               store. Several mannequins are placed around the room to 
               represent a hostage situation. The "BAD GUY" has a walkie-
               talkie strapped around his neck. Roper's voice CRACKLES out 
               of it.

                                     BAD GUY
                         What the fuck do you think is going 
                         on, turdhead? I'm about to waste 
                         everyone in this place.

               McCall hesitates, trying to figure out a response. He seems 
               stiff and awkward.

                                     MCCALL
                         H... how can I help you? Tell me 
                         what...
                              (looks off to his 
                              right)
                         I feel stupid talking to a dummy.

               Roper enters the training room from a side door. He's holding 
               the other walkie-talkie.

                                     ROPER
                         What did you think? I'm going to let 
                         you practice on real people?

               Roper comes up beside him.

                                     ROPER
                         First things is, don't say, "What's 
                         going on?" Everybody knows what's 
                         going on. I come into this situation, 
                         I say,
                              (addressing the 
                              mannequin)
                         "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's 
                         good. I'm here to help you."
                              (turns back to McCall)
                         Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. 
                         If you're thinking, talk while you're 
                         thinking, or else he's going to think 
                         you're plotting. Which you are. If 
                         he thinks you're plotting, you're 
                         going to make him nervous. You don't 
                         want him nervous. Got that?

                                     MCCALL
                         No.

                                     ROPER
                         It'll come. Try again.

               INT. TRAINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               ANGLE ON THE DOOR. McCall comes in. The room has the same 
               set-up. McCall takes a look around. Launches immediately 
               into...

                                     MCCALL
                         My name's McCall. I'm a hostage 
                         negotiator. I'm here to help you.

               Roper's voice crackles back at him hostilely.

                                     ROPER (V.O.)
                         How are you going to help me?

               McCall's confidence is growing.

                                     MCCALL
                         Tell me what you need.

                                     ROPER (V.O.)
                         I need you to bring me the scumbag 
                         who ran off with my wife so I can 
                         cut off his nuts.

               Now he's stumped.

                                     MCCALL
                              (hesitantly)
                         I can't do that.

                                     ROPER (V.O.)
                         Then get out of my face you worthless 
                         piece of frogshit.

               McCall looks up to his right.

                                     MCCALL
                         Is all the name calling necessary.

               Roper re-enters the training area.

                                     ROPER
                         Nah, I just throw that in because I 
                         enjoy it.

                                     MCCALL
                              (exasperated)
                         So what do I say to this guy?

                                     ROPER
                         You could say something like,
                              (addressing the dummy)
                         "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. 
                         Maybe we can work something out."

                                     MCCALL
                         What? Bring somebody in so he can 
                         cut his nuts off?

               Roper turns to McCall.

                                     ROPER
                         If you want to be a successful 
                         negotiator, you've got to learn to 
                         lie.

                                     MCCALL
                         I'm not good at lying.

                                     ROPER
                         Get good at it.

                                     MCCALL
                         It's against my nature.

               Roper gives him an amused smile.

                                     ROPER
                         You know the ten commandments?

                                     MCCALL
                         Yes.

                                     ROPER
                         What's the first commandment?

                                     MCCALL
                         Thou shall have no other God before 
                         me.

               That's not the answer Roper wanted.

                                     ROPER
                         Okay, forget that. What's the main 
                         one.

               McCall is tired of guessing.

                                     MCCALL
                         You tell me.

                                     ROPER
                         Thou shall not kill... You've killed, 
                         right?

                                     MCCALL
                         Yes.

                                     ROPER
                         Why?

                                     MCCALL
                         To save lives.

                                     ROPER
                         So why would you hesitate to lie to 
                         save lives?

               McCall can't argue with that one. Roper turns and heads back 
               to the side door.

                                     ROPER
                         Let's try it again.

               INT. TRAINING ROOM - LATER

               McCall comes through the door. Hands in the air. The setup 
               in the room has been changed a bit. The bad guy is behind 
               the counter. Several hostages in various positions on the 
               floor.

                                     MCCALL
                         My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.

                                     ROPER (V.O.)
                         Okay, stop.

               Roper comes through the side door.

                                     ROPER
                         Close your eyes.

               McCall is surprised by the command but closes them. Roper 
               turns him away from the hostage scene.

                                     ROPER
                         What did you see?

                                     MCCALL
                              (rapid-fire)
                         A dirtbag behind the counter holding 
                         a sawed-off. A Berretta nine 
                         millimeter in his belt. A female 
                         hostage, red dress, on the floor in 
                         front of the cereal display. Male 
                         hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, 
                         three feet to her right. Another 
                         male hostage, white pants, green 
                         shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the 
                         magazine rack. A female dirtbag with 
                         a gun under her shirt, sitting against 
                         the beer cooler, trying to pass 
                         herself off as a hostage, and there's 
                         a special on toilet-paper, four for 
                         a buck twenty-nine.

               McCall opens his eyes. Roper's impressed.

                                     ROPER
                         Very good. You've got good eyes. 
                         That's important.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Roper and McCall are sitting in the dark watching a video 
               tape. It's grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting 
               goods store. A negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a 
               ten year old girl hostage. The negotiator holds his hands 
               out imploringly... Carefully moves toward the gunman. The 
               negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl. The gunman 
               grabs the negotiator around the neck, holds the gun to his 
               head. The little girl runs out of the picture to safety.

               Roper remains dead silent during all this. McCall looks over 
               at him. The blue light flickers over Roper's motionless face.

                                     MCCALL
                         Was that your partner?

               Roper nods.

                                     MCCALL
                         Why did he do it?

                                     ROPER
                              (quietly)
                         Because he knew the little girl had 
                         zero chance of survival and his 
                         chances would be a little better... 
                         We had a plan, but SWAT opened up 
                         too early. He got caught in the 
                         crossfire.
                              (a sad beat)
                         Let's move on... Notice this. Always 
                         use the eyes to keep the connection. 
                         It almost like hypnosis. That's the 
                         most important thing. Create a 
                         connection. You're always on their 
                         side...

               McCall watches him for a beat, then turns his attention back 
               on the screen.

               EXT. GOLDEN GATE RACETRACK - DAY

               Beautiful day. Roper and McCall leaning against the rail at 
               the walking ring. The horses are being paraded and saddled. 
               Roper scrutinizes them with an expert eye. McCall seems 
               totally disinterested.

                                     ROPER
                         You know why I like the track?

                                     MCCALL
                         You're a compulsive gambler?

               Roper ignores that.

                                     ROPER
                         Because there are a multitude of 
                         possibility's. Everything is there 
                         to see if you know what to look for. 
                         You have to read the conditions, 
                         just like in a hostage situation.

               Roper points across the ring to a particular horse.

                                     ROPER
                         See the four horse. Dropping in class. 
                         No works. Front wraps. Looks like 
                         he's broken down. But notice the 
                         woman in the sun hat. She's the owner. 
                         She wouldn't have come if her horse 
                         was broken down. He's live. We use 
                         him.

               McCall listens indifferently.

                                     ROPER
                         See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He 
                         doesn't want to run today. Cross him 
                         off... Now the Six looks good. On 
                         his toes. Coat shiny. This 
                         trainer/jockey combo does well. We 
                         can't leave him out.
                              (turns to McCall)
                         What do you think?

                                     MCCALL
                         I have two words for you... Seek 
                         help.

                                     ROPER
                         I have three words for you... Ex-ac-
                         ta.

               INT. BETTING WINDOWS - DAY

               Roper is buying tickets. McCall is with him, watching the 
               other bettors, the odds board, all the monitors... Strange 
               place. Roper finishes and turns away from the window. Hands 
               McCall a ticket.

                                     ROPER
                         I bought you a four-six exacta box. 
                         You owe me twenty bucks.

                                     MCCALL
                              (puzzled)
                         I do.

               EXT. SEATING AREA - DAY

               Roper and McCall pass by a gambler.

                                     GAMBLER
                         Hey, Roper.

                                     ROPER
                         How you doin', Marv?

               They sit down in a box right up front.

                                     ROPER
                         We need the 4 and 6 to finish to 
                         first and second.

                                     MCCALL
                              (no enthusiasm)
                         Fine.

               Roper uses his binoculars to watch the horses warm up on the 
               backstretch.

                                     MCCALL
                         I'm told that newspaper photographer 
                         is your former girlfriend.

               Roper looks over at him. What's this about?

                                     ROPER
                         Ronnie... Yeah, so.

                                     MCCALL
                         Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?

                                     ROPER
                         So what do you want?... An autograph.

                                     MCCALL
                         I don't know why she'd pick him over 
                         you.

               Roper throws McCall a skeptical look.

                                     MCCALL
                              (straight-faced)
                         I'm just practicing my lying.

                                     ROPER
                         Still needs work.

                                     MCCALL
                              (downcast)
                         You're right. I'll never be as good 
                         a liar as you.

                                     TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                         And they're racing!

               ON THE TRACK

               The horses spring from the gate. (The track announcer's call 
               plays through race)

               IN THE STANDS

               Roper watches intently through the binoculars. McCall sits 
               impassively.

                                     ROPER
                         Okay, we're in good shape. We're in 
                         good shape.

               McCall looks across the track.

                                     MCCALL
                         The 6 horse is last.

                                     ROPER
                         That's okay. That's his style.

                                     MCCALL
                         To run last?

                                     ROPER
                         To run late!

               Roper follows the horses into the turn.

                                     ROPER
                         The favorite's fading. I told you he 
                         wasn't going to run today... The 
                         four horse has got the lead!

               McCall sits like a wax figure.

                                     MCCALL
                              (cynically)
                         The 6 horse is still last.

                                     ROPER
                         He'll be running at the quarter pole.

               ON THE TRACK

               The horses head into the stretch. The FOUR is on the lead 
               and the SIX is starting to unleash a big run. Passing horses 
               with every stride.

                                     ROPER (V.O.)
                         There he goes.

               IN THE STANDS

               McCall sits forward slightly.

                                     MCCALL
                         They need to run first and second?

                                     ROPER
                         Yeah, first and second.

               Roper gets to his feet.

               ON THE TRACK

               The horses thunder down the stretch. The FOUR horse is in 
               front and the SIX is coming on from behind.

               IN THE STANDS

               Roper is on his feet screaming.

                                     ROPER
                         Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell.

               McCall jumps to this feet and joins him.

                                     MCCALL
                         COME ON RUSSELL!...
                              (to Roper)
                         Who the fuck's Russell?!

                                     ROPER
                         The jockey!

                                     MCCALL
                         COME ON, RUSSELL!

               Roper and McCall cheer together.

               ON THE TRACK

               The FOUR horse crosses the finish line in front. The SIX 
               horse is flying... Needs to beat one horse to be second... 
               He's running out of room... With one last surge he hits the 
               wire and... It's too close to call.

               IN THE STANDS

               McCall, really excited, turns to Roper.

                                     MCCALL
                         We won!

                                     ROPER
                              (disheartened)
                         We lost.

                                     MCCALL
                              (confidently)
                         We won.

                                     ROPER
                         How much you wanna bet?

                                     MCCALL
                         You want to bet on whether you won 
                         your bet? This is getting sick.

               ANGLE ON TOTE BOARD

               As the photo finish light goes out and the numbers come on... 
               4-6-8. They won.

               IN THE STANDS

                                     ROPER
                         Yes!

               High fives.

                                     ROPER
                         That's eight hundred bucks.

               INT. BET/CASH WINDOW - DAY

               Roper and McCall collect their money. Four hundred a piece, 
               not bad. McCall pockets his money.

                                     MCCALL
                         How long you been coming here?

                                     ROPER
                         About six years. My partner took me.

                                     MCCALL
                         Is it always like this?

                                     ROPER
                         Occasionally you lose.

               Suddenly Roper's BEEPER goes off. He checks it, takes out a 
               cellular phone and dials.

                                     ROPER
                              (into the phone)
                         Roper here.
                              (he listens)
                         I'm on my way.

               He hangs up and turns to McCall.

                                     ROPER
                         We gotta go.

               EXT. JEWELRY STORE - UNION SQUARE - DAY

               Marble facade. Tastefully reinforced windows and door. 
               Choppers circle overhead. Both ends of the street are sealed 
               off. Barricades are up. Spectators and news crews crowd behind 
               those. Numerous police circulate. This is a major operation 
               in full swing.

               INT. TRAVEL AGENCY - COMMAND CENTER - DAY

               It's across the street from the jewelry store. Second story. 
               The walls are plastered with travel posters. A poster of 
               Tahiti is the most prominent. Members of police and SWAT are 
               standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on 
               a table. Right behind them is a TV monitoring the front of 
               the store. Solis is at another desk, on the phone. He's 
               talking to the suspect.

                                     SOLIS
                         We're working on that, Joe. These 
                         things aren't quite that simple.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Roper and McCall push through the barricades and come walking 
               down the cordoned-off street. McCall takes a look at the 
               jewelry store. Well fortified, foreboding.

                                     MCCALL
                         This does not look good.

               Roper looks over there, gives no reaction. They reach Solis' 
               convertible Cadillac. It's parked out front of the travel 
               agency building.

                                     ROPER
                         See this. Solis has me driving the 
                         shit-mobile, and he picked this up 
                         straight out of impound for fourteen 
                         grand. Probably worth thirty.

                                     MCCALL
                         Police corruption. It's everywhere.

               INT. COMMAND POST - DAY

               Roper and McCall enter. McCall joins the men who are studying 
               the blueprint. Roper stands by Solis and listens, takes note 
               of the poster of Tahiti. Looks inviting.

                                     SOLIS
                         This will take time to setup. I'll 
                         have to get authorizations.
                              (he listens)
                         Okay, you relax, and I'll --

               Solis pulls the phone away from his ear. Joe has obviously 
               hung up.

                                     ROPER
                         What do we got?

                                     SOLIS
                         32 minutes ago the silent alarm went 
                         off, then the fire alarm. A unit was 
                         a block away, and the suspect got 
                         trapped inside.

                                     ROPER
                         Any verification on numbers.

                                     SOLIS
                         We've only seen and talked to one 
                         suspect. He calls himself "Joe". 
                         There's two jewelers, two salespeople, 
                         the manager, a security guard, and 
                         an elderly woman. This particular 
                         store is where they do a lot of 
                         jewelry making and repair. They have 
                         anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw 
                         stones on any given day, so they 
                         sure as shit didn't just wander in. 
                         They knew what they were coming for.

                                     ROPER
                         What have you promised them?

                                     SOLIS
                         Just that I'd talk to my superiors.

               McCall returns from checking out the blueprints.

                                     ROPER
                         Any good points of entry?

               McCall shakes his head.

                                     MCCALL
                         The place is designed to be a vault.

               Roper picks up the cellular phone. It dials automatically.

                                     ROPER
                              (into the phone)
                         My name's Roper. How are you people 
                         doing in there?
                              (he listens)
                         Solis is off the job now, Joe. I'm 
                         the guy authorized to give you 
                         whatever you want.
                              (listens)
                         That's right, but first I need to 
                         come down there to talk to you.

               INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

               We don't see anything but the suspect on the other end of 
               the phone. He's wearing a ski mask and gloves. Totally 
               unrecognizable to the audience. We will find out soon that 
               he is, in fact, Korda. He appears very cool and collected.

                                     KORDA
                         You don't have to come here.

                         Yes, I do. That way there's no 
                         misunderstandings. I need to make 
                         sure no one's hurt, then we can take 
                         care of business.

               A long pause... Then a bit sinister.

                                     KORDA (V.O.)
                         Alright, Roper. You want to come... 
                         come.

                                     ROPER
                         Good. I won't be armed. We gotta 
                         operate on trust here. We're going 
                         to wrap this up and have you guys 
                         out of here as soon as possible.

               Roper clicks off the phone. He already doesn't like the sound 
               of this guy.

               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE - DAY

               Roper, bulletproof vest, hands in the air, walks across the 
               eerily deserted street straight toward the jewelry store. 
               It's quiet now. The choppers have been pulled back.

               Roper reaches the sidewalk right in front of the store. Korda 
               cracks the door open.

                                     KORDA
                              (warningly)
                         Stay there.

               Roper stops in his tracks.

                                     ROPER
                         I'm going to put my hands down, okay.

               Roper slowly lowers his hands.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               Everybody watching through the window.

               EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

               Korda takes a half step out the doorway. The gloved hand 
               that is visible is not holding a weapon. The other half of 
               his body is hidden inside the doorway. He wears jeans, a 
               black shirt, and black Nike tennis shoes. He stares fiercely 
               from behind the ski mask. There's no sign of fear in him.

                                     KORDA
                         Are you in charge, Roper?

                                     ROPER
                         Yep.

                                     KORDA
                         I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. 
                         I want it in perfect condition. I 
                         want a uniformed cop to drive it up 
                         right here. I want him to leave the 
                         engine running and walk to the end 
                         of the street. Then we'll come out. 
                         I don't want any remote control 
                         devices in it. I know all the tricks. 
                         If it's not in perfect condition, 
                         and I mean if its even low on wiper 
                         fluid, I'm going to kill somebody 
                         and we're gonna start again.

               Korda lets that sink in.

                                     KORDA
                         I want a plane waiting at the airport.

                         when I get there.

                                     ROPER
                         Is that all?

                         For now that's all.

                         You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you 
                         to do something for me. Let me take 
                         a look around inside. Make sure 
                         everybody's okay.

                         No. You just do shit for me right 
                         now.

               Korda's eyes glare from behind the ski mask. He's an ominous 
               figure.

                                     ROPER
                         Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think 
                         you could give me something to cement 
                         the deal... One hostage.

                                     KORDA
                         I'll give you something.

               Korda pulls a wadded-up handkerchief out of his pocket and 
               tosses it to Roper. Roper unwraps the handkerchief.

               DETAIL SHOT

               It's a human ear.

                         In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger 
                         piece. I assume there are no 
                         "misunderstanding".

               Roper is as serious as we've ever seen him.

                                     ROPER
                         I understand you completely.

               Korda disappears back behind the door.

               EXT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY

               Roper trudges back in. Things are more active now. Logistical 
               officers are making flow charts. Photos of the hostages are 
               being posted on a bulletin board. Roper approaches Solis, 
               McCall and the SWAT CAPTAIN who are anxiously waiting for 
               his report.

                                     ROPER
                              (flatly)
                         We're going to have to take this guy 
                         out.

               That draws a long silence. That's something Roper rarely 
               says.

                                     SOLIS
                         Can't we wear him down?

               Roper hands Solis the handkerchief with the ear in it. Solis 
               eyes it with dismay.

                                     ROPER
                         I believe there's at least one 
                         fatality in there already. The fire 
                         alarm was probably set off by gunfire. 
                         I believe he's working alone, both 
                         from his conversation and the fact 
                         that he wouldn't come out beyond the 
                         doorway. He was holding a gun on the 
                         hostages while he was talking to me. 
                         His demeanor is calm and controlled, 
                         that's what really scares me. The 
                         other bad news is that he also 
                         indicated a familiarity with our 
                         techniques.
                              (a beat)
                         So, do you want to go in or wait for 
                         him to come out?

               McCall calmly offers his opinion.

                                     MCCALL
                         Let him come out. Too many unknowns 
                         in there.

               Solis nods. That'll be the plan.

                                     MCCALL
                         When we drive up the car, make sure 
                         it's at an angle about three feet 
                         from the curb.
                              (to SWAT Captain)
                         Put our best man "highground", Twenty 
                         degree down angle.

               The SWAT Captain motions and turns to one of his UNDERLINGS.

                                     SWAT CAPTAIN
                         Have Anderson prep it and notify us 
                         when he's on line.

               The underling hurries off to take care of it. Solis looks at 
               Roper dejectedly.

                                     SOLIS
                         I feel this thing going sideways on 
                         us.

               Roper tries to buck him up.

                                     ROPER
                         There is some good news. He's wearing 
                         a ski mask, so he's protecting his 
                         identity and hasn't determined to 
                         kill all the hostages...
                              (big pause)
                         Yet.

               INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

               The jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is Korda. 
               His face is sweaty. Hair matted. ANGLE WIDENS to show five 
               very scared hostages: A JEWELER, middle-aged, balding. The 
               male MANAGER, good-looking, thirties, three piece suit. TWO 
               SALESGIRLS, nicely dressed, late twenties. A FEMALE CUSTOMER, 
               gray-haired Hillsborough matron. They are all seated against 
               the wall. There are two fatalities lying on the floor. The 
               guard and one of the jewelers.

               Korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler 
               and motions to the dead bodies.

                                     KORDA
                         Drag them behind the counter.

               The two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the 
               grim task. The two salesgirls watch Korda fearfully. The 
               older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of 
               reality. Her eyes are a bit far away.

               Korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't 
               been looted. With the barrel of his gun, He SMASHES the glass, 
               reaches in and picks out the jewelry. He dumps it in an open 
               satchel already half-filled with packets of raw gemstones 
               and gold chains. Suddenly, the older woman customer gets to 
               her feet. She seems fairly out-of-it. Maybe in shock. She 
               starts walking toward the front door frowning with 
               dissatisfaction.

                                     WOMAN CUSTOMER
                         I'm not staying here another minute.

                                     SALESGIRL #1
                              (panicky)
                         No, Mrs. Dotson.

               Korda rushes around the display case.

                                     KORDA
                         Come here, hag.

               He grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags 
               her away from the door. She shrieks. The manager takes a 
               step toward Korda.

                                     MANAGER
                         Leave her alone!

               Korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her 
               unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager.

                                     KORDA
                         You're a brave one, aren't you?

               The manager glares at him. He's about Korda's size. He thinks 
               about making a run at him.

                                     SALESGIRL #2
                              (pleading)
                         Sit down, Doug.

               A long beat... The manager sits back down on the floor with 
               the other hostages. Salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old 
               woman. Korda looks down at her.

                                     KORDA
                         If she's not conscious when it's 
                         time to leave, I'll have to kill 
                         her.

               Korda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of 
               the gems.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Cops clear spectators out of the way as a green FORD EXPLORER 
               RUMBLES through the barricade and heads down the deserted 
               street.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY

               Roper and McCall at the window, attention fixed on the store. 
               The Explorer crawls to a stop in front of the jewelry store. 
               Parks at a slight angle. The uniformed police officer gets 
               out, leaving the engine running, and walks off back to the 
               barricade.

                                     ROPER
                         Okay. Time to give this fucker a 
                         call.

               Roper picks up the phone, waits. Everybody tensely watching 
               the store.

               A sniper team watching the store from a third floor window.

               Roper holding the phone. It's still ringing.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - DIFFERENT BUILDING - SAME

               Another sharpshooting team. Poised. Waiting.

               And still another sharpshooter team.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

               The phone is still ringing.

                                     ROPER
                         This fucker's not answering.

               Just then, the front door of the jewelry store swings open. 
               A spray of white vapor shoots out the doorway. Korda is 
               discharging a fire extinguisher.

                                     MCCALL
                         There's your answer. He's smart.

                                     ROPER
                         He's cutting down the visibility.

                                     MCCALL
                         And doing a very good job of it.

               A thick cloud of white hangs over the sidewalk obscuring the 
               front of the jewelry store. Roper puts down the phone.

                                     MCCALL
                         Come on. Give us one clean shot.

                                     SWAT CAPTAIN
                              (into his radio)
                         All positions, you have the green 
                         light.

                                     MCCALL
                         They're out.

               Roper grabs a pair of binoculars.

               HIS POV

               Through the haze, we catch glimpses of the hostages circled 
               around the figure in the ski mask. They slowly shuffle toward 
               the Explorer.

               McCall watches intently.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME

               A sniper watches through his scope. Finger poised on the 
               trigger.

               ANGLE THROUGH THE SCOPE

               Low visibility through the haze. The figure in the ski mask 
               wavers in and out of the crosshairs, shielded momentarily by 
               the jeweler, then he flashes back into the crosshairs. The 
               sniper tries to lock him in.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER - ROPER'S POV - BINOCULARS - SAME

               The figure in the ski mask leans slightly and Roper catches 
               a glimpse of the hostage right behind him. Roper recognizes 
               him instantly.

                                     ROPER
                         It's Korda.

               McCall sees him now, too.

                                     MCCALL
                         They switched clothes.

               Roper drops the binoculars and grabs his police radio.

                                     ROPER
                              (urgently)
                         Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

               Too late. A SHOT rings out. The figure in the ski mask goes 
               down, hit by the bullet.

                                     ROPER
                         Shit! Where'd that shot come from? 
                         Hold your fire!

               More SHOTS ring out.

               DOWN ON THE STREET

               The white vapor cloud swirls. The hostages, spattered with 
               blood, scream and scatter. The figure in the ski mask lies 
               dead on the sidewalk. Korda, dressed in the manager's three 
               piece suit, holding the satchel of jewels in one hand and 
               his gun in the other FIRES back at the snipers. He grabs 
               salesgirl 1 and drags her into the Explorer.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               Roper sees Korda move toward the car with one of the hostages.

                                     MCCALL
                         He's got the girl.

                                     ROPER
                         Damnit!

               As Roper turns into the room he notices a set of keys on 
               Solis' desk.

                                     ROPER
                              (grabbing the keys; 
                              to Solis)
                         Are these yours?

                                     SOLIS
                         Yeah, they are but...

                                     ROPER
                              (to McCall)
                         Come on!

               As Roper and McCall move toward the door...

                                     SOLIS
                         Roper, what are you going to do? 
                         Don't take my...

               And Roper and McCall are gone.

                                     SOLIS
                         ...car.

               DOWN ON THE STREET

               Police come rushing onto the street. Guns drawn. The Explorer 
               ROARS off down the block. Roper and McCall burst out of the 
               command center building, leap into Solis' Cadillac and tear 
               off after the van. McCall is behind the wheel.

               The Explorer comes barreling toward it. Spectators scatter. 
               Two squad cars SCREECH up behind the barricades, trying to 
               block Korda's escape. The Explorer PLOWS through the metal 
               barricades. BASHES the squad cars out of the way. And screams 
               off around the corner.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               The Explorer careens up an alley and bursts into the congested 
               traffic of a side street. HONK-SCREECH! A Toyota swerves to 
               miss it and broadsides a parked car. The Explorer fishtails 
               off down the street.

               INT. VAN - DAY

               The salesgirl is terrified. Korda checks the rear view mirror. 
               No one on his tail... At first. Then the Cadillac comes 
               speeding up behind...

               INT. CADILLAC - DAY

               Roper and McCall have the Van in sight, about a block ahead. 
               Roper picks up the radio.

                                     MCCALL
                         Suspect heading west on Sutter now 
                         passing Jones. Can we get an 
                         intercept?

               A voice comes back.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         R-32-David. We are proceeding south 
                         on Hyde. Will intercept.

               INT. VAN - DAY

               Korda has one eye on the road and the other on the rear view 
               mirror. The Cadillac is making up ground.

               UP AHEAD

               a squad car SCREECHES into the intersection and smokes to a 
               stop. Korda jerks the wheel, pulls a SCREAMING right turn 
               and heads up the hill.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               The Cadillac is only about a hundred feet behind the van... 
               Brakes SQUEALING, it swerves around the corner in pursuit.

               THE VAN

               hits the top of the hill and goes airborne... SLAMS back 
               down to the pavement.

               INT. VAN - DAY

               Korda floors it, and we get a frightening view out the 
               windshield as they head straight downhill. The salesgirl is 
               beyond petrified.

               THE CADILLAC

               reaches the top of the hill. Going fast.

               INT. CADILLAC

               As it rocks forward violently. Front bumper slamming against 
               the pavement. McCall sees the van ahead. Hammers the 
               accelerator. No fear.

               VAN

               Korda sees traffic ahead... Intersection jammed. He pulls a 
               hard left.

               THE VAN

               cuts straight across the corner... up on the sidewalk... 
               shears a mailbox... a row of newspaper machines fly through 
               the air... The van speeds off down a one-way street...

               THE CADILLAC

               arrives at the intersection a few seconds later... 
               Intersection still jammed... People now standing on the corner 
               gawking at the damage. The Caddy SCREECHES to a stop. McCall 
               HONKS... The people scatter... The Cadillac drives through 
               the corner.

               THE VAN

               Wrong way down a one-way street. Cars coming right at us in 
               every angle. Frantic HONKING. Salesgirl SHRIEKS. Tires 
               SMOKING... No way to avoid collision... Except Korda pulls a 
               left an instant before impact... The van speeds back up the 
               hill.

               THE CADILIAC

               Down the same one way street... Comes up on the head-on 
               traffic, now stopped, paralyzed with fear from the near 
               collision with Korda...

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               The Cadillac roars around the corner and heads up the hill.

               INT. VAN

               Korda, checking the rear view mirror. The Caddy is a short 
               distance behind. Attention still focused behind, Korda enters 
               an intersection, running a red light... CROSS-TRAFFIC... 
               Korda stiffens... Pulls on the wheel

               THE STREET

               The van swerves... But not quick enough... GRINDING metal... 
               SHATTERING glass... The van rolls over another car...

               BRIEF CUT - LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

               Korda and the salesgirl tossed about as the van does a 
               dizzying roll...

               THE VAN

               ...and CRASHES back down to the street upside down. After a 
               beat, Korda crawls from the wreckage carrying the satchel of 
               jewels. The salesgirl does not emerge. He spots a cable car 
               reaching the top of the hill and starting its long descend. 
               He heads toward it...

               INT. CABLE CAR

               As Korda comes toward them from the wreckage, some of the 
               passengers view him uneasily.

               THE CADILLAC

               hits the top of the hill just in time for Rope and McCall to 
               see Korda leap onto the moving cable car.

               CABLE CAR

               other passengers give Korda room. They can sense that he is 
               not here merely for the ride. Korda looks out the back...

               Roper and McCall haven't lost track of him. The Cadillac is 
               making up ground on the cable car.

               Korda moves to the back exit, pulls his gun and FIRES off a 
               couple of shots at the Caddy.

               INT. CADILLAC

               A bullet fractures the windshield. McCall swerves.

               BACK ON THE CABLE CAR

               That makes up the minds of many of the passenger. They leap 
               off the cable car.

               Korda takes aim on the Caddy again and FIRES!

               The brakeman charges down the aisle while Korda has his 
               attention focused out the back and tries to shove him off 
               the cable car...

               Almost works... but Korda is able to hang on by one hand... 
               He swings around toward the Brakeman who turns involuntarily 
               as he sees the barrel of the gun pointed at him... BANG! 
               Korda shoots him in the back.

               The brakeman staggers down the aisle and slumps across the 
               brake lever, releasing it more.

               EXT. UNDER CABLE CAR

               The brakes are stressed.

               EXT. STREET

               Now driverless, the cable car picks up speed... Broadsides a 
               car... Pushing it into parked cars...

               THE CABLE CAR

               Korda and the remaining passengers are rocked around.

               THE CABLE CAR

               THUNDERS towards us... Filling the FRAME...

               A SIDE ANGLE

               Shows the cable car leaving the wreckage in its wake.

               CADILLAC

               It passes the smashed car. McCall looks at the speedometer 
               as he paces the cable car. It's going at 45 mph.

                                     MCCALL
                         What the fuck is going on.

                                     ROPER
                         I don't know, but I've got to get on 
                         there.

                                     MCCALL
                         You're crazy.

                         Pull up alongside.

               EXT. INTERSECTION

               The cable car barrels through... Plows into two cross-traffic 
               cars... Knocks them aside... Keeps picking up speed.

               THE CADILLAC

               Weaves through the wreckage... Makes up ground on the cable 
               car, trying to pull alongside.

               THE CABLE CAR

               For the moment, Korda is not shooting at the Caddy. His 
               attention is now focused downhill as...

               KORDA'S POV

               The cable car nails another vehicle sending it spinning off 
               to the side.

               THE CADDY

               dodges the spinning car... Jumps up onto the sidewalk... 
               Mows down parking meters... Jumps back onto the street.

               THE CABLE CAR

               Korda leans out the door, takes aim at the Caddy... Another 
               jammed intersection up ahead...

               INT. CAR OF MAN TRAPPED IN INTERSECTION

               He sees the cable car coming in his rear view mirror. He 
               bails out...

               THE CABLE CAR

               SLAMS into the back of the car. Major impact.

               THE CABLE CAR

               Korda and the passengers are thrown to the floor.

               THE REAR-ENDED CAR

               Tumbles down the hill... Hits a car coming uphill and rolls 
               into a parked car.

               THE CADILLAC

               Speeds up alongside the cable car. Roper climbs over the 
               windshield, onto the hood and leaps onto the cable car.

               INT. CABLE CAR

               Korda sees him coming. FIRES. Roper dives out the other side 
               of the cable car.

               CABLE CAR

               Roper hanging off the side. He gets his gun out of his 
               holster...

               Up ahead, a car pulls away from the curb...

               Roper swings around to get back into the relative safety of 
               the cable car. As he does his gun is raked out of his hand 
               by the car which avoids a collision by a millimeter.

               CABLE CAR

               Korda aims as Roper re-enters...

               CABLE CAR

               As it CRASHES into the back of a car turning left.

               Everyone is thrown toward the front of the car. Korda's gun 
               goes flying. Roper dives on top of him. They trade punches. 
               McCall is in b.g. with the Caddy pacing the cable car.

               INTERSECTION

               Pedestrains bolt out of the way as the cable car streaks 
               through...

               THE CABLE CAR

               Roper hammers Korda into unconsciousness. Outside McCall is 
               honking and yelling like crazy. Roper looks over... McCall 
               points ahead...

               ROPER'S POV

               The cable car.

               ROPER

               Leaps to the brake lever. Pulls on it.

               ANGLE UNDER THE CABLE CAR

               The clamp tries to slow the descent. It whine and smokes... 
               Then disintegrates before our eyes.

               THE CABLE CAR

               Roper feels the lever go slack in his hands. The cable car 
               is speeding toward the end of the line... No way to stop 
               it... Roper turns and takes a running leap into the Caddy...

               INT. CADDY

               He lands in the passenger seat. Roper pounds his foot down 
               on the accelerator. The Caddy lunges ahead of the cable car... 
               McCall can't figure out what he's doing. Roper yanks the 
               steering wheel hard right...

               EXT. STREET

               The Caddy collides with the front of the cable car. Tires 
               SCREAM. The steel wheels CLATTER. A cloud of burning rubber 
               forms. The cable car grinds forward pushing the Cadillac... 
               But it's working. The cable car is slowing.

               BOTTOM OF STREET

               The crowd now sees the Caddy and cable car bearing down on 
               them. General hysteria as they flee.

               THE CABLE CAR

               Korda regains consciousness. Sees what's going on. He grabs 
               the satchel and bails out of the cable car...

               STREET

               ...Onto the hood of a passing taxi. The taxi slams on its 
               brakes. Korda rolls off the hood, picks himself up and runs 
               into an underground garage.

               THE CABLE CAR

               Grinding to a halt just short of the end of the line. Roper 
               grabs McCall's gun off the seat and leaps out of the Caddy 
               to pursue Korda. People approach to ogle the two vehicles in 
               astonishment.

               INT. GARAGE - DAY

               Roper moves up an interior stairway, gun in "ready" position. 
               He knows Korda is somewhere in the parking structure. He 
               glides up the stairway to the third level. Checks back over 
               the rail... No one around... Then a sound from inside the 
               garage... Footsteps maybe.

               Roper carefully opens the door... Swings in with his gun...

               INT. THIRD LEVEL - GARAGE

               Lots of cars, but no one in sight. Roper moves quickly to 
               the protection of a row of cars... He crouches down. Scans 
               beneath the cars... No sign of Korda.

               Roper searches between two rows... Comes up beside a van... 
               Thinks he hears something stirring inside. Whirls a gun toward 
               the window.

               A dog lunges at the CAMERA... Snarling... baring teeth... 
               Roper moves on.

               NEW ANGLE

               As a BMW crawls through the parking structure. Roper steps 
               into the FOREGROUND, right into its path, gun visible. The 
               BMW rolls to a stop. Roper approaches with caution.

               Roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30 
               year old blonde. Roper takes a check out of the backseat.

                                     ROPER
                         Sorry, go.

               INSIDE THE CAR

               The woman rolls up the window and hits the gas. She drives 
               off.

               INT. GARAGE

               Roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final 
               scan... He has the discouraging feeling that Korda might 
               have escaped.

               He heads toward the exit... Suddenly a SCREECH of tires... 
               Roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him. He drives 
               and FIRES! Bullets shatter the windshield.

               The car continues toward Roper. He has to roll out of the 
               path of the car. The car swerves past Roper. Tries to make 
               it down the ramp. Roper fires again, taking out the rear 
               window and a rear tire. The car slides along the guard rail 
               and continues down to the next level. Roper runs after it.

               GARAGE - 2ND LEVEL

               As the car reaches the next level, Korda loses control and 
               piles into a parked car.

               Korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel 
               of jewels. Dazed, he staggers away from the wreck.

               Roper moves to him with a face grim as death. He strips the 
               satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car 
               door. Korda goes to his knees. Roper holds the barrel of his 
               gun right up between Korda's eyes.

                                     ROPER
                         Give me one reason why I shouldn't 
                         kill you right here.

               Korda stares back at Roper defiantly. He knows a cop won't 
               kill him in cold blood...

               What he doesn't know is that Roper doesn't give a shit about 
               those rules at this moment.

                                     ROPER
                         You know Sam Baffert was a friend of 
                         mine. He had a wife... and he had a 
                         daughter.

               Korda stares past the barrel of the gun.

                                     KORDA
                         I don't give a shit about you or 
                         your fucking friends.

               And that makes Roper even angrier... But he keeps it all 
               inside. His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night.

               He yanks back hard on Korda's hair. Pushes the gun tighter 
               against Korda's forehead. He's on the verge of executing 
               this guy.

                                     KORDA
                         You can't kill me like this.

                                     ROPER
                         What if you and me got into a 
                         struggle... and my gun went off?

               In a flash, Roper points the gun upward and fires off a SHOT!

                                     ROPER
                         Could I kill you then?
                              (beat, beat)
                         Could I kill you then?

               Roper jams the gun back under Korda's chin. A pull of the 
               trigger would send a bullet straight up through Korda's skull. 
               And now Korda is fully convinced. He squeezes his eyes closed. 
               Face straining so hard, he looks like he's going to burst 
               out of his skin.

               ANGLE - MCCALL

               moving across garage into position.

                                     MCCALL
                         Roper! Put it down!... Put it down 
                         man, we got him.
                              (beat)
                         Come on... Put it down.

               Long, long beat. Roper eases up and Korda smiles. Just when 
               we feel the scene is over, Roper turns back quickly and kicks 
               Korda in the stomach, then grabs Korda by the hair, pulls 
               his head back and shoves the gun in his face.

                                     ROPER
                         We do this shit by the book, but you 
                         ain't gonna be smiling.

               Korda is doubled up coughing, spitting up blood. Roper walks 
               away as McCall moves in to put the cuffs on Korda.

               INT. METRO DIVISION - NIGHT

               Roper is sitting in a cubicle doing paperwork. A group of 
               reporters and photographers move down the hallway adjoining 
               the squadroom. One of them is Ronnie. Through the glass walls, 
               she notices Roper sitting alone at the computer. She bids 
               good-night to the reporters and comes into the squadroom.

                                     RONNIE
                         You weren't at the press conference.

               Roper keeps tapping away at the computer.

                                     ROPER
                         I wanted to get this out of the way.

                                     RONNIE
                         You got a bet on the game tonight?

                                     ROPER
                         As a matter of fact, I do.

               She nods knowingly.

                                     RONNIE
                         It's already started.

                                     ROPER
                         I was going to catch the last half 
                         on TV.

               Ronnie watches him for a moment. He stops typing, looks at 
               her and smiles. She suddenly becomes self-conscious. Guess 
               it was something she was thinking.

                                     RONNIE
                         Good-night.

               She turns abruptly to leave. Roper finds himself rising from 
               his chair.

                                     ROPER
                         You having dinner with Mr. Baseball?

               She turns back around.

                                     RONNIE
                         Greg is on a road trip. I was just 
                         going to make some pasta.

               He takes a few steps toward.

                                     ROPER
                         That kind with the garlic and the 
                         oil that I like so much?

                                     RONNIE
                         No. The kind from Kraft, with the 
                         macaroni and the cheese.

                                     ROPER
                         I've been craving that stuff all 
                         week.

                                     RONNIE
                         And it's hard to get.

               He looks at her innocently.

                                     RONNIE
                         Just dinner.

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Ronnie is making macaroni. Roper helps to prepare a dressing 
               to go with the salad. He is mixing oil, vinegar, sugar and 
               spices. He lets her have a taste.

                                     ROPER
                         What do you think?

                                     RONNIE
                         Mmm, needs a little something.

                                     ROPER
                         What are you talking about? This is 
                         it. This is the stuff right here.
                              (beat; he tastes)
                         Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.

                                     RONNIE
                         Yeah that's it.

                                     ROPER
                         Why don't you just stick your finger 
                         in and stir it up.

                                     RONNIE
                              (laughing)
                         Scottie...

               There is a long pause as he looks at her.

                                     ROPER
                         What would you say if I quit gambling?

               Ronnie stirs the macaroni.

                                     RONNIE
                         I'd say you'd be miserable... It's 
                         not the gambling. It's what the 
                         gambling got in the way of. The track 
                         is where you'd take your troubles 
                         instead of sharing them with me...

               Ronnie puts the lid on the macaroni. There is a beat before 
               she continues.

                                     RONNIE
                         Scottie, remember the day you lost 
                         that hostage in union square. You 
                         came over that night and we made 
                         mad, crazy love. But I didn't even 
                         know what happened... 'til I heard 
                         it on the news the next morning.

                                     ROPER
                         It's because I wanted to keep you 
                         away from that world.

                                     RONNIE
                         It's not that world. It's your world. 
                         It's part of who you are.

                                     ROPER
                              (beat)
                         Veronica, it's not easy for me... I 
                         don't know if I can change overnight. 
                         But what I'm telling you is that I 
                         want to share everything with you, 
                         because I don't ever want to be 
                         without you again.

               The dog yawns. They laugh. Roper moves closer to her. He 
               kisses her and she responds.

               INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The lovemaking is over. Roper is gazing at the ceiling, 
               thinking. Ronnie is cuddled around him. A comfortable 
               moment...

                                     ROPER
                         What about Greg? What are you gonna 
                         tell him?

                                     RONNIE
                         It's okay. We broke up.

                                     ROPER
                              (surprised)
                         When?

                                     RONNIE
                         Just now.

               INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY

               Clarence Teal, Korda's cousin sits in front of the plexiglass 
               wall. He's edgy, fidgety. Clarence doesn't like to make visits 
               to jail.

               Korda, wearing prison clothes, is led in by a guard. Korda 
               takes a seat at the other side of the plexiglass wall and 
               picks up the receiver. Clarence picks up his receiver.

                                     CLARENCE
                         How ya doin', man?

               Korda grips the phone, leans forward and stares through the 
               wall.

                                     KORDA
                         You gotta do something for me... 
                         this fucker, Roper, he's gotta 
                         girlfriend. She works at the 
                         newspaper. I want you to take care 
                         of her.

               Clarence is totally unnerved by this request.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Hey, Michael, that's not my thing.

               Korda glares at him murderously.

                                     KORDA
                         You gotta do this for me. I'm in 
                         here because of you.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Man, what's this about? Ya know, you 
                         were robbing a store. It wasn't 
                         personal. It was his job.

                                     KORDA
                              (exploding)
                         Fuck you! You know what he did to 
                         me?!...

               Korda starts to draw the attention of the guard. He controls 
               himself, lowers his voice. But the viciousness is still there.

                                     KORDA
                         He held a gun to my head and said he 
                         should kill me right then... He made 
                         me...

               He doesn't finish that thought.

                                     KORDA
                         You do this for me Clarence.

               Clarence is getting very upset.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Don't make do it, Mike.

                                     KORDA
                         Are you going to turn on me too? Who 
                         helped you when you were strung out? 
                         Who gave you money? Who bailed you 
                         out of jail?

                                     CLARENCE
                         I won't get away with it.

                                     KORDA
                         Nobody knows who you are. Make it 
                         look like a robbery.

               Clarence holds back tears, because he knows he's going to 
               have to do this.

               EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               A gray San Francisco evening. It starts to rain.

               INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               She's cooking some kind of sauce. She has a taste.

               EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               A subjective POV watching through the window as she moves 
               around the kitchen.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Ronnie pours some oil in a pan. The phone RINGS. She crosses 
               the kitchen to answer it.

               INT. PICKUP - NIGHT

               Roper on his cell phone. Paco is on the seat beside him.

                                     ROPER
                         Hi, I'm going to stop at the corner 
                         for some wine.

               Roper notices the rain, searches for the windshield wiper 
               switch.

               INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

                                     RONNIE
                         How's Paco doing?

               INT. PICKUP - NIGHT

                                     ROPER
                         He was going nuts at the park. He 
                         met this very attractive poodle. 
                         They made plans to meet again next 
                         weekend.

               Paco sits there panting. Roper pulls the pickup over in front 
               of the store.

               INT. KITCHEN - STORE

                                     RONNIE
                         Okay, dinner will be ready when you 
                         get here.

               She hangs up.

               EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Through the window we watch her cross back to the stove.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Ronnie lifts the lid on the sauce. Stirs. It spatters on her 
               blouse. She regards the stain with dismay. Puts the lid back 
               on and leaves the kitchen.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Ronnie unbuttons her blouse as she moves to the...

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               She takes off the blouse, goes to the closet door... throws 
               it open. She looks around. Something's not right. She takes 
               a step into the closet and finds what she's looking for -- A 
               laundry basket -- tucked away in the corner. She puts the 
               soiled blouse in the hamper and takes a fresh one off a 
               hanger. She buttons the clean blouse as she walks to...

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Dark. She turns on the light. She goes to the mirrored 
               medicine cabinet.

               IN THE REFLECTION

               Behind her the shower curtain is drawn, fluttering ever so 
               slightly. She opens the medicine cabinet. Takes out some 
               perfume. Dabs some on her neck. She puts back the bottle and 
               closes the cabinet. We fully expect someone to be standing 
               right behind her in the reflection... There's no one there. 
               She turns off the light as she walks out of the bathroom.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Ronnie walks back to the kitchen... Notices something on the 
               floor further down the hallway... What is it? She moves 
               closer... And now we get to the POV that tells us someone is 
               in the house... Watching her through a cracked doorway.

               BRIEF CUT

               A hand opening a buck knife. Water drips from the fingers.

               BACK IN THE HALL

               Ronnie bends down. It's a wet spot. Like half a shoeprint. 
               She reaches down to touch it...

               BUZZZZZ!!!! The oven timer. She hurries back to the kitchen.

               INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               She turns off the timer and pulls some chicken out of the 
               oven. She puts it down on the counter and cross to the 
               refrigerator. She opens the door and looks inside. The 
               refrigerator door obscures half the FRAME... She digs around 
               for something... We're sure that when she closes the door, 
               he's going to be behind it... She takes out a head of lettuce 
               and... Closes the door... Still no one there.

               She turns... Clarence is standing there. Dripping wet. Ronnie 
               shrieks... The knife flashes forward... She grabs the lid 
               from the sauce pan and CLANG... Fends off the blade. She 
               bolts for the hallway. Clarence grabs her by the blouse... 
               RIP! She pulls away.

               IN THE HALLWAY

               She races down the hall. Clarence lunges into FRAME. She 
               goes down... He goes down... the knife goes skidding down 
               the hallway... Ronnie scrambles to get it... Clarence has 
               her by the ankle... She claws for the knife... Just out of 
               reach.

               EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Roper's pickup pulls up in front. He gets out. Paco jumps 
               out behind him. It's raining harder. They hurry up the walkway 
               toward the house. Suddenly Roper realizes he forgot the wine. 
               He goes back to the truck. Paco pads after him.

               Roper opens the driver's side door, reaches in and grabs the 
               wine. He closes the door, starts away, but pauses to check 
               himself in the window.

               Suddenly, a floodlight comes crashing through Ronnie's front 
               bay windows. It SPARKS and FLASHES. Still plugged in, it 
               bungees to a stop hallway down the front of the house. 
               FLICKERING and FLASHING.

               Roper rushes toward the house... Crashes through the front 
               door... Up the stairway... Paco bounds after him... Roper 
               hits her front door running... Wham! He bounces off. He 
               shoulders it again... The door doesn't give... He pulls out 
               his gun... BAM! BAM! Shoots off the lock.

               INT. RONNIE'S APT. - NIGHT

               A QUICK SHOT of Clarence's hand grabbing the knife.

               INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT

               Roper kicks open the door. Charges in.

               INT. RONNIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Ronnie is laying on the floor, gasping for air. Choke marks 
               around her throat. Roper rushes to her side. Paco is on his 
               heels.

                                     ROPER
                         You okay?!

               She nods. Points out the back way.

                                     ROPER
                              (to Paco)
                         Stay.

               The dog obediently stays with Ronnie. Roper dashes out the 
               back.

               EXT. BACK OF RONNIE'S - NIGHT

               Raining more heavily now. Roper bursts out onto the back 
               porch. Sees Clarence leaping off the last rung of the fire 
               escape to the alley. Roper flies down the fire escape... 
               Vaults the last flight and races after Clarence.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Clarence sprints down the block... Through the intersection... 
               HONK! SCREECH! A car barely misses him. It does a one-eighty 
               on the rain-slick pavement. Clarence disappears into the 
               shadows. Roper arrives a beat later... Streaks through the 
               intersection... Into the shadows.

               EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT

               This one is steep. Clarence huffs and puffs as he labors. He 
               shoots into a doorway. Tries the door. Locked. He looks back. 
               Roper is coming. Relentless. He rushes across the steep 
               street. Almost slips on the reflective asphalt. Roper spots 
               him crossing and picks up the pace. He can see that Clarence 
               is faltering.

               NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL

               Clarence staggers into an alleyway...

               EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

               Narrow, dark and dripping with rain. Roper arrives at the 
               mouth of the alley. Gun ready, he moves cautiously, eyes 
               adjusting to the darkness. The PATTER of rain off the 
               rooftops. His FOOTSTEPS. No other sound.

               He reaches the end of the alley... A brick wall. No way out. 
               Or so it would seem. However, Clarence is nowhere in sight. 
               Roper turns back. Brick walls tower on both sides, rising 
               into darkness. Roper checks a steel door. Locked. He checks 
               another one on the opposite side of the alley. Also locked. 
               Where did Clarence go? He moves back toward the misting light 
               of the street... Slowly...

               The FAINT RATTLE of a fire escape... And Clarence leaps down 
               out of the shadow. Slashing with the knife. He catches Roper 
               across the arm.

               Rips through his clothes right down to the skin. Roper's gun 
               CLATTERS under a parked car and into the street. Clarence 
               has first jump. He scrambles into the street, around the car 
               and grabs the gun...

               Roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks Clarence 
               down before he can aim. They roll into the middle of the 
               street. Both have a death grip on the weapon. Clarence fights 
               like a trapped animal. Thrashing desperately. Roper pins him 
               on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers.

               WIDER SHOT

               Headlights radiate over the crest of the hill. Coming quickly. 
               Roper sees this. He rolls out of the way, abandoning the 
               battle for the gun. Clarence struggles to his knees. Turns 
               the weapon on Roper... A speeding cab lunges over the top of 
               the hill. Clarence turns, trapped in the searing headlights. 
               Tires squeal. Brakes lock. Clarence is transfixed... WHAM! 
               He's launched through the air like a ragdoll... His body 
               lands limply 30 feet down the street. The CABBY gets out of 
               his vehicle.

                                     CABBY
                         Jesus Christ. What was he doing?!

               Roper walks down the hill to the body. The cabby follows.

                                     CABBY
                         There was no way I could miss him.

               Roper ignores the cabby. He looks down at Clarence's body, 
               contemplating something.

                                     CABBY
                         This isn't my fault.

                                     ROPER
                         Shut the fuck up!

               The cabby immediately clams up.

                                     ROPER
                         Get on your radio and get the police 
                         here.

               Roper stares at Clarence's body, steel-eyed.

               INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY

               Korda is led in again. An expression of surprise registers 
               on his face when he sees who's waiting for him.

               KORDA'S POV

               Roper is sitting stoically behind the plexiglass wall.

               KORDA

               Dons a smug expression and takes a seat. He picks up his 
               receiver as Roper picks up his.

                                     ROPER
                         If you try again to hurt me or anyone 
                         I know, I'm going to have you killed.

               Korda feigns total innocence.

                                     KORDA
                         What in the world are you talking 
                         about, Mr. Roper?

               Roper takes out a photograph and holds it up against the 
               glass.

                                     ROPER
                         Here's a picture of your cousin 
                         Clarence. That gentleman standing 
                         over him is the coroner.

               Korda's face tightens. He drops the innocent act. His 
               countenance is now a study in hate.

                                     KORDA
                         I used to have an apartment, a car, 
                         jewelry. I had a fucking eight 
                         thousand dollar watch. Now look what 
                         I have.

               He motions around.

                                     KORDA
                         You're threatening me? You think I 
                         give a fuck? You think you can scare 
                         me off?
                              (a laugh)
                         Why don't you come in here and kick 
                         my ass? Get some of your guard friends 
                         in here to help. I'd like that.

               Roper glares at him mounting rage.

                                     KORDA
                              (smirking)
                         He really shook you up, didn't he?... 
                         I've got ten years worth of appeals 
                         to figure out how to fuck with you. 
                         Who knows? Maybe some scumbag lawyer 
                         will get me out on a technicality.

               Roper sits there, suddenly feeling powerless.

                                     KORDA
                         You came here to threaten me? That's 
                         a laugh. Maybe you should BEG me... 
                         Go ahead. Get down on your knees.

               Roper leaps from his chair and smashes the receiver against 
               the plexiglass wall.

                                     ROPER
                         You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill 
                         you!

               The guard rushes over and restrains Roper. Wrestles him away 
               from the glass wall. Roper pushes him off and gathers himself. 
               He gives Korda one last stare. Korda sits there smirking 
               back at him... Roper turns his back and walks out.

               INT. ROPER'S OFFICE - DAY

               McCall is practicing his negotiating techniques in a mirror.

                                     MCCALL
                         I'm here to help you.

               Not quite right. He adjusts his stance. This time puts a 
               little hand movement into it.

                                     MCCALL
                         I'm here to help you. Talk to me.

               He's still not satisfied.

               Captain Solis pokes his head in the door, he's been looking 
               for McCall.

                                     SOLIS
                         We got a situation at the V.A. 
                         Hospital. The responding officer has 
                         requested a negotiator.

                         He's on his way. Get over there.

               EXT. VETERAN'S HOSPITAL ROOFTOP - DAY

               A VETERAN wearing green fatigue is dangling another WHEELCHAIR 
               BOUND VET over the edge. Fourteen floors up. The two front 
               wheels are literally hanging out there in space.

                                     VET #1
                              (rambling incoherently)
                         I can't fight this technology. They 
                         have microprocessors made in totally 
                         sterile environments. I've seen those 
                         places. Everyone is dressed in white. 
                         It's like paper clothing, man. They're 
                         not even human.

               Vet 2 is struggling to stay in the chair and not be tipped 
               into the street 150 feet below. He is, needless to say, very 
               panicky.

                                     VET #2
                         Dave, don't do this, bro. Pull me 
                         in. We'll do a few laps in the park 
                         and figure out some other way.

               But he's not getting through to his friend.

                                     VET #1
                         I can't help this, man. Do you have 
                         any idea what those microchips look 
                         like? How small they are when they 
                         put them in your brain?

               INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

               Leading to the roof. A COUPLE OF COPS and MEMBERS OF THE 
               HOSPITAL STAFF peek out at the vet as he continues to rant 
               and rave. McCall arrives at the top of the stairs. OFFICER 
               #4 sure looks happy to see him. McCall takes a peek out onto 
               the roof. He isn't happy about what he sees.

                                     OFFICER #4
                         When we got here, he was already 
                         doing his balancing act. I was talking 
                         to him, but it made him more agitated 
                         so I backed off.

                                     MCCALL
                         Why is he up there?

                                     OFFICER #4
                         Something about a microchip in his 
                         brain.

                                     MCCALL
                         Who is he?

               A NURSE answers him.

                                     NURSE HERRIN
                         David Adler. He likes to be called 
                         Dave. The other guy is Walter 
                         Sinclair.

               We hear the urgent cry of the vet in the wheelchair.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Somebody help me out here. Somebody 
                         stop him.

               The nurse turns to McCall.

                                     NURSE HERRIN
                         What are you waiting for?

                                     MCCALL
                         Another negotiator is on his way.

                                     NURSE HERRIN
                         We can't wait for another negotiator. 
                         You have to do something.

                                     MCCALL
                         What about the doctors?

                                     NURSE HERRIN
                         He hates all the doctors. He says 
                         they're in on the conspiracy.

                                     VET #1 (O.S.)
                         Where is everybody? He's going to 
                         kill me!

               McCall takes a deep breath and steps out onto the roof.

               EXT. ROOF - DAY

               McCall moves slowly across the tar paper roof. Clouds overhead 
               threaten rain. Vet 1 turns to him suddenly, wobbling the 
               wheelchair. Vet 2 shrieks and nearly goes over. McCall's 
               heart jumps into his mouth.

                                     DAVE
                         Get the fuck out of here!

               McCall is tense and stiff. He stammers.

                                     MCCALL
                         I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help 
                         you, D... Dave.

                                     DAVE
                         You can't help me, man.

               So much for McCall's opener. Now what?

                                     WALTER
                         He's high on something, man. Give 
                         him some thorazine or something.

               Dave ignores Walter.

                                     DAVE
                         No one can help me. They're 
                         controlling my mind.

               McCall moves a couple steps closer.

                                     MCCALL
                         Who's controlling your mind?

                                     DAVE
                         Whoa!... The government. They control 
                         everybody's mind. You're too fucking 
                         stupid to know that?

               McCall fumbles for the right response.

                                     MCCALL
                         This has nothing to do with Walter.

                                     DAVE
                         They want Walter dead!

               EXT. STREET BELOW - DAY

               Cops keep spectators back from the building. Fire trucks and 
               rescue vehicles are on the scene. Everybody looking straight 
               up watching the wheelchair with its occupant dangling over 
               the side of the building.

               EXT. ROOF - DAY

               Walter sits stock still in the wheelchair drenched with sweat, 
               eyes closed, praying.

                                     MCCALL
                         Dave, look at me.

               Dave obliges. He looks at McCall with eyes that have lost 
               the battle for sanity. McCall is momentarily frozen by those 
               eyes. Beads of sweat have formed on his forehead.

                                     MCCALL
                         Tell me what's wrong.

                                     DAVE
                         Particles, man. I feel them all the 
                         time. I feel them in my arms and 
                         legs man, that's how they punish me.

                                     MCCALL
                         How can I help you with the particles?

                                     DAVE
                         It's not just the particles man, 
                         it's the whole fucking machine, this 
                         is how they get assassins to operate. 
                         It's been this way since the cuban 
                         missile crisis.

               Dave starts to look over into the street, he tips Walter 
               forward, Walter shrieks in mortal fear. White knuckles the 
               armrests of his wheelchair and then:

                                     MCCALL
                              (blurting out)
                         They have less power over you if you 
                         look into my eyes.

                                     DAVE
                         Huh?

               McCall even surprises himself with that one. It was a sheer 
               act of desperation. He holds his breath and waits to see 
               what the effect is. Dave turns back around.

                                     DAVE
                         Huh?

               EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

               Roper's truck comes speeding down the street, lurches to a 
               halt. He leaps out and speaks to a FIREMAN.

                                     ROPER
                         Whata ya got?

                                     FIREMAN
                         Some nuts dangling a guy over the 
                         edge in a wheelchair.

                                     ROPER
                         Can you get a net out here?

                                     FIREMAN
                         Negative. It's 14 floors up. No nets 
                         gonna hold a fall from that high up.

               EXT. ROOF - DAY

               McCall nods slowly. Sweat pouring off him.

                                     MCCALL
                         We've been onto them for a long time.

               A glimmer from Dave. Maybe McCall is a kindred spirit.

                                     MCCALL
                         Let me show you something.

               Now he's got Dave's interest. McCall slowly takes out his 
               beeper.

                                     MCCALL
                         See this. I'm jamming them, Dave. 
                         I'm jamming their frequency so they 
                         can't control your mind anymore. 
                         Don't you feel that? You don't have 
                         to do what they say.

               Dave listens to his head.

                                     WALTER
                         He's jamming them, Dave. Pull me 
                         back in.

                                     MCCALL
                         You see, the particles are gone, 
                         they can't punish you anymore.

               Dave tries to feel for particles. Tears form in Dave's eyes.

                                     DAVE
                         Tell my dad.

                                     MCCALL
                         Tell him what, what do you want me 
                         to tell him?

                                     DAVE
                         Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.

                                     MCCALL
                         I'll tell him. Where does he live. 
                         We'll get him on the phone right 
                         now.

               Dave is suddenly lost in thought again. His expression turns 
               to a frown:

                                     DAVE
                         I hate fucking Springfield.

                                     MCCALL
                         Is that where you're family lives?

               Then with sudden swiftness.

                                     DAVE
                         I still hear them, man. You can't 
                         jam them. They've got the technology, 
                         man. They've got the satellites, 
                         Jack. They keep shooting beams off 
                         those satellites. What power do I 
                         have?

               Dave pushes the wheelchair forward. McCall LUNGES for the 
               wheelchair but doesn't make it. Walter SCREAMS as he falls.

                                     MCCALL
                         NOOOO!

               WALTER AND HIS WHEELCHAIR

               freefall down toward earth in SLOW MOTION. The wheelchair 
               turns end over end. People SCREAM as Walter IMPACTS with the 
               pavement. The wheelchair CRASHES down nearby.

               EXT. ROOF - DAY

               McCall looks over the edge at Walter's twisted body below. 
               Then he grabs Dave and wrestles him down, cuffing his hands 
               behind his back. The Cops and Medical Staff Members rush out 
               to restrain.

               INT. LOBBY - DAY

               The crowd is dispersing. Roper is talking with some of the 
               other cops. McCall storms out of the Vet Hospital and down 
               the stairs. Roper moves toward him.

                                     ROPER
                         McCall!

               No response. McCall gets into his ND Sedan car and fires it 
               up.

                                     ROPER
                         McCall!

               Roper races over and manages to jump in just as the car 
               screeches away from the curb.

               BAY BRIDGE - DAY

               McCall doesn't even seem to have registered that Roper is in 
               the car with him. He drives. Stone-faced. Roper studies him 
               for a beat.

                                     ROPER
                         Where are we going?

               INT. CAR - DAY

               Moving POV thru windshield of car, we see a freeway sign 
               that says "Golden Gate Racetrack."

               EXT. RACETRACK

               Establish grand stands.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. BETTING AREA - DAY

               McCall pounds over to the betting window. Roper leans up 
               against the window beside him. Watches.

                                     MCCALL
                         Give me a twenty dollar four-six 
                         exacta.

                                     TELLER
                         The six is scratched.

               This throws McCall for a beat.

                                     MCCALL
                         Then give me a fucking four-seven 
                         exacta.

               The teller punches out the ticket. McCall takes the ticket 
               and pounds over to box seat area. Roper follows a couple of 
               steps behind, giving him some space.

               EXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY

               McCall sits down in the same box as the last time. Roper 
               sits down next to him.

               EXT. TRACK - DAY

               The horses go into the gate.

               EXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY

               McCall watches intently as the horses spring from the gate. 
               (The track announcer's call plays over the scene.)

                                     MCCALL
                         Come on four horse! Come on Seven 
                         horse!

               Roper isn't watching the horse. He's watching McCall. Watching 
               him redirect all his pent up emotion. Understanding exactly 
               how he feels.

               McCall is screaming his head off.

                                     MCCALL
                         Come on four-seven... Come on... 
                         Come on... Come on...

               The horses cross the wire. The four and seven finish mid-
               pack. McCall hangs his head in despair. He didn't give a 
               shit about the race. He looks inconsolable.

                                     ROPER
                         It might have happened no matter who 
                         was up there.

                                     MCCALL
                         Bullshit! Would it have happened to 
                         you?

                                     ROPER
                         Maybe... There's one thing you have 
                         to remember... You don't create the 
                         situations. You can only try to save 
                         people from them.

                                     MCCALL
                         I thought I could do it. I was so 
                         damn sure of myself. But I didn't 
                         know what to say. The words wouldn't 
                         come. My mouth turned to mush. You 
                         make it look so easy, Roper. But it 
                         is not. It's not easy.
                              (beat)
                         It's a different job than looking 
                         through the rifle scope.

                                     ROPER
                         That it is.

               A long silent beat.

                                     MCCALL
                         How many have you lost?

                                     ROPER
                         I look at it as how many I've saved. 
                         That's the way you've got to look at 
                         it.

                                     MCCALL
                         And what about the ones you don't 
                         save?

                                     ROPER
                         You live with it... and they haunt 
                         you. It doesn't leave.

                                     MCCALL
                         And what if you can't live with it?

                                     ROPER
                         You've got to decide that for 
                         yourself.

               McCall squeezes his eyes closed. He can still see that vet 
               falling to his death. Roper can see McCall's pain.

                                     ROPER
                         I've lost three. One of them was my 
                         partner. I think about them every 
                         time I go into a situation.
                              (a beat)
                         There's a million people in this 
                         city with all kinds of twisted shit 
                         going on in their heads, and the 
                         bitch of this job is that we expect 
                         to go out every day and do the 
                         impossible -- to somehow control all 
                         this craziness... and we can't.
                              (a beat)
                         Nobody's faulting you for this, 
                         McCall. My advice is you let yourself 
                         off the hook.

               McCall hears him but is still undecided.

                                     MCCALL
                         I don't know... I don't know...

               Roper gets up, stands over McCall, puts a hand on his 
               shoulder.

                                     ROPER
                         Let's get out of here.

               McCall slowly gets up and they walk out.

               INT. JAIL - DAY

               It's a small interview room. Korda sits opposite bail bondsman 
               JOHN HAWKINS (white, grizzled, forty).

                                     HAWKINS
                         What the fuck... You bring me all 
                         the way over here to tell me you've 
                         got no collateral! What do I look 
                         like to you -- Santa Claus? I'm a 
                         bail bondsman!

                                     KORDA
                         No, no, see what I'm sayin' is, I've 
                         got the --

                                     HAWKINS
                         Pick up a fucking phone for chrissake! 
                         You think I got time for this crap?

                                     KORDA
                         Hey, hey, I got shit on the outside. 
                         I got somebody cashing it in for me 
                         and --

               Hawkins gets up and goes to the door.

                                     HAWKINS
                         Gimme a fuckin' break.

                                     KORDA
                         Alright, alright, look, man, look, 
                         just leave me your card. I can get 
                         it to you by tomorrow night.

               Hawkins looks at him skeptically for a beat. Then pulls out 
               his BUSINESS CARD and hands it to him. He walks out the door 
               as we HOLD on Korda -- pocketing the card.

               EXT. POSTRIO - NIGHT

               Establishing shot.

               INT. POSTRIO - NIGHT

               CLOSE-UP of a glass of wine being poured. PULL BACK to reveal 
               Roper and Ronnie all dressed up for a special evening. The 
               waiter hovers as Roper tastes the wine.

                                     ROPER
                              (snootily)
                         It has a nice "nose".

                                     WAITER
                         The special this evening is braised 
                         sweetbreads with a white truffle 
                         sauce on cracked bulgar.

               Roper looks at him a long beat.

                                     ROPER
                         That's my favorite.
                              (smiles)
                         Why don't you give us a minute.

               The waiter retreats. Roper looks across the table at Ronnie 
               as she sips her wine.

                                     ROPER
                         You like this place?

                                     RONNIE
                         It's very nice.

                                     ROPER
                         I guess you realize that there's 
                         something special that I want to 
                         talk to you about.

               She didn't realize that. Now she's getting nervous.

                                     RONNIE
                         There is?

                                     ROPER
                         For the last week things have been 
                         going pretty well between us. I think 
                         we've been doing a good job getting 
                         intimate and all that stuff...

               Now she's really worried.

                                     RONNIE
                         Yeah?

                                     ROPER
                         ...Let me just show you.

               Roper reaches into his coat pocket.

                                     RONNIE
                         Scottie, we should think this over 
                         before we...

               He pulls out two airline tickets.

                                     ROPER
                         Tahiti.

               Ronnie is immensely relieved.

                                     RONNIE
                         Ohhh... A vacation... Yeah that sounds 
                         like a great idea.

               Roper notices her relief and for the first time realizes 
               what she was thinking.

                                     ROPER
                         Oh you thought I was going to ask 
                         you...

               Ronnie averts her eyes, a bit embarrassed.

                                     ROPER
                         Oh, no-no-no-no-no... Let's go to 
                         Tahiti first and see if that works 
                         out...

               Roper picks up his menu and peruses it.

                                     ROPER
                         I assume you're having your usual -- 
                         the "air dried venison".

               INT. HALLWAY JAIL - DAY CLOSE ON

               The wheels of a laundry cart, moving slowly down the hall. A 
               white metal door slides open, and the cart passes through.

               INT. PROPERTY ROOM JAIL - CONTINUOUS

               As the cart rolls into the room TILT UP to see

               KORDA

               pushing the cart. He stops. A GUARD (guard #3) stands with 
               his back to Korda. He's on the phone.

                                     KORDA
                         Got another load.

                                     JAIL GUARD #3
                         Rack 'em up.
                              (into the phone)
                         Look, man, if it doesn't make it 
                         down here by five it's not my problem.

               As the guard continues, Korda hangs several garment bags, 
               zipped and tagged, onto an ELECTRIC TROLLEY -- similar to 
               the kind used by dry-cleaners to move clothing.

                                     KORDA
                         All done.

               Korda pushes a button and the trolley STARTS TO MOVE. The 
               guard, still on the phone, buzzes open the door.

               ON THE GUARDS BACK

               We hear Korda wheeling the cart out the door.

               CLOSE ANGLE

               on the door sliding shut.

               ON THE GUARDS BACK - CLOSE

               Hold a beat. PANNING SLOWLY around the room to FIND -- suit 
               bag's moving on the trolley. BOOM DOWN to FIND Korda's feet 
               just as they lift off the ground and disappear behind the 
               bags.

               ANGLE ON KORDA

               hanging onto the trolley as it moves along the wall and then 
               down through an opening in the floor and into...

               INT. BASEMENT JAIL - CONTINUOUS

               as it loops around a large room, carrying him toward the 
               back wall. The metal ridges of the trolley CUT into his 
               fingers, drawing blood. Then he drops down, and quietly 
               rummages through other bags of clothing. He tries on a pair 
               of pants but they come up to his ankles. He looks like he's 
               about to go wading. As he rips them off and reaches for 
               another pair...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LONG HALLWAY JAIL - LATER

               Korda appears around a corner, dressed in street clothes, 
               holding a CLIPBOARD -- moving steadily toward camera.

               KORDA'S POV - DOWN THE HALLWAY

               A female civilian EMPLOYEE heading in his direction. As they 
               pass he nods and she nods back. Then Korda passes through a 
               door at the end of the hallway and into...

               INT. CELL BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

               The door closes behind him and locks with the loud SNAP of 
               metal.

               Slowly, with deliberate steps, he moves down the corridor 
               toward the door at the other end, past the first GUARD (guard 
               #3) -- enclosed in bullet proof glass.

               TRACKING - KORDA'S FEET

               step by step. The voices of prisoners, muffled behind thick 
               glass.

               CLOSE ON KORDA'S FACE

               trying to stay cool, his heart pounding. Then...

                                     A VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hey!

               Korda FREEZES, then slowly turns to FIND... A prison GUARD 
               (#1) moving toward him.

               THE GUARD POV - MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO KORDA

                                     KORDA
                         ...Yeah?

               The guard then stops in front of him and holds up his hand.

                                     JAIL GUARD #1
                         You dropped your card.

               Korda takes THE CARD given to him by the bail bondsman.

                                     JAIL GUARD #1
                         You guys are the scum of the earth.

                         Just tryin' to make a living.

               Korda turns and walks out the door into...

               INT. SECURITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               It's the final step before getting out of the building. A 
               small room with another GUARD (Latino; guard #2) behind glass, 
               and several TV monitors. A BLACK WOMAN (forty-five) is arguing 
               with a LATINO GUARD.

                                     JAIL GUARD #2
                         I don't know what to tell you, mam, 
                         your brother ain't here. Try San 
                         Bruno.

                                     WOMAN
                         I just came from San Bruno -- they 
                         sent me here!

                                     JAIL GUARD #2
                         I'm sorry. Then I don't know where 
                         he is.

               Korda, fidgeting behind the woman impatiently, holds up his 
               card...

                                     KORDA

                         where he is?! You can't just lose 
                         somebody!

                              (to Korda)
                         Who are you again?

                         Johnny who?

                                     WOMAN
                              (to Korda)
                         Can you believe these people?

                                     KORDA
                         It's the criminal justice system. 
                         What can I tell ya? It's a mess.

               The guard shoves the sheet under the glass.

                                     JAIL GUARD #2
                         Alright, alright, just sign.

               Korda signs the sheet. The guard pushes a button. The metal 
               lock SNAPS, and the door POPS open. Korda takes his card and 
               sticks it in the woman's coat pocket.

                                     KORDA
                         If you find him, gimme a call.

               And Korda walks out.

               EXT. JAIL SALLY PORT - CONTINUOUS

               It's a small parking area, with security gates on either 
               end, and a ceiling of heavy steel wire open to the sky. There 
               are three or four CARS parked against the wall. Korda checks 
               inside the first car, looking for keys and finds none. Then 
               the second, and the third until...

                                     A VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hey!

               Korda turns sharply to find the LATINO GUARD (guard #2), 
               holding a clipboard, walking quickly toward him.

                                     JAIL GUARD #2
                         Hold on a second here.

                                     KORDA
                         Is there a problem?

               The guard walks up to him. They're standing between the cars.

                                     JAIL GUARD #2
                         You signed out twice.

                                     KORDA
                         I what?

                                     JAIL GUARD #2
                         Look, why don't you just come on 
                         back inside for a second.

                                     KORDA
                         Wait a minute, lemme see that.

               As the guard shows him the sign-in sheet, Korda removes the 
               PEN from his own clipboard.

                                     KORDA
                         Well, that's funny, I wonder how 
                         that happened.

               In a flash, Korda PLUNGES the pen DEEP into the guard's 
               throat. The BLOOD jumps out of his throat, onto the window 
               of the car as the guard, gagging in stunned silence, slumps 
               to ground. He then falls backward between the two cars, 
               drowning in his own blood.

               INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Empty. New front door. Unpainted. Frame splintered from when 
               Roper shot it open. We hold a beat... HEAR ROPER & RONNIE 
               coming up the stairs. Laughing. The door opens. They enter.

                                     ROPER
                         How come in those foreign movies the 
                         young girl is always with some fat, 
                         old guy.

                                     RONNIE
                         In Europe women find older men very 
                         sexy.

               Roper closes the door.

                                     ROPER
                         When I get old and fat, I'm moving 
                         to Europe.

               Ronnie suddenly remembers something.

                                     RONNIE
                         I forgot to leave food for Paco. 
                         He's probably starving.

               She walks back toward the kitchen. Roper takes a seat on the 
               couch. Flips on the TV. Rubs the back of his neck.

                                     ROPER
                         Damn, my eyes are tired from reading 
                         that movie.

               FOLLOWING RONNIE

               She moves down the hall to the kitchen.

                                     RONNIE
                              (doggie voice)
                         I'm sorry, Paco. I forgot --

               But Paco isn't lying on his pillow like she expected. Curious.

                         Paco?

               She turns around walks back down the hall... Where could he 
               be?... She walks into the bedroom.

                         Paco?

               He's not in here either... She walks back into the hallway. 
               Frowns.

               SUDDEN CUT

               A figure leaps out of the bathroom doorway!... Big scare. 
               It's Paco. He nearly knocked her over. He stands on his hind 
               legs, paws on her shoulders. Breathing in her face.

               RACK FOCUS

               Roper standing at the other end of the hallway. Tense as a 
               wire. Gun at his side. One look at his demeanor tells Ronnie 
               something is very wrong.

                                     RONNIE
                              (very concerned)
                         What is it, Scottie?

               Roper untenses. Puts away his gun.

               Her voice trails off. He can see she's worried now, too.

               A suitcase THUMPS to the ground. Looks like somebody packed 
               for a six month trip around the world.

                         I sent that ahead, wise guy.

               Paco is on the sidewalk exploring from tree to tree. Roper 
               calls to Ronnie from the stairway.

                         Why don't you come back up with me, 
                         Ronnie.

                                     RONNIE
                         I think I'll stand out here in the 
                         sun.

               INT. STAIRWAY - DAY

               Roper is still very edgy.

                                     ROPER
                         It's better if you stay inside.

               She climbs up the stairs toward him.

                                     RONNIE
                         You've got to calm down --

               INT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - SAME

               Roper reaches the top of the stairs.

                                     ROPER
                         Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go. 
                         Time to get movin'.

               INT. RONNIE'S APT. - SAME

               Roper moves into the room, listening. There's no response.

                                     ROPER
                              (continuing)
                         Ronnie?

               She doesn't answer. He calls out again, moving through the 
               living room.

                                     ROPER
                              (continuing)
                         Ronnie, where are you? Time to go.

               No answer, the room is very quiet. Roper eases his PISTOL 
               out from under his shirt, moving more urgently now, checking 
               out the bathroom, bedroom...

                                     ROPER
                              (continuing)
                         Ronnie.

               Then he HEARS Paco, WHINING. He moves around the entrance to 
               the kitchen. The back door is open, Paco standing in the 
               doorway. Roper rushes forward, quickly looking outside, the 
               alley way empty. He senses a presence behind him, spinning... 
               McCall standing in the doorway to the kitchen.

               Roper's lowers the weapon...

                                     ROPER
                              (continuing)
                         She's gone.

               McCall sees on the kitchen table, a folded piece of GLASSINE 
               PAPER, just like the one Korda gave Roper at the jewelry 
               store.

                                     MCCALL
                              (nodding)
                         Scott...

               Roper sees it, approaching, barely able to unfold the edges, 
               a momentary tremble in his hand.

                                     ROPER
                         That son of a bitch. If he...

               We PUSH IN as his fingers open the paper... revealing inside 
               a MICRO CASSETTE TAPE.

                                     ROPER
                              (continuing; to himself)
                         He's fucking with you, Scott, be 
                         cool... keep your head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE ON a TAPE RECORDER, Korda's VOICE heard over the

                              (laughs)

               Roper and McCall are listening closely to the tape.

                                     KORDA (V.O.)
                              (continuing)

                         me, and I want it back.

                         be sending you parts of this bitch 
                         for a month.

               Roper punches off the tape.

                                     ROPER
                         He's gonna kill her no matter what. 
                         If I take him these jewels he's gonna 
                         kill me and her.

                                     MCCALL
                         So what do you want to do?

                                     ROPER
                         That's a chance I gotta take.

                                     MCCALL
                         Then we better get moving... But 
                         there's no way we can get the jewels 
                         out of evidence.

               Roper stares at him, the wheels beginning to turn...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE PROPERTY/EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

               Roper is standing at the counter to the steel-caged property 
               room. On the other side is FRANK, the property sergeant on 
               duty. The two men speak in hushed, urgent tones...

                                     FRANK
                         Scott, we go back a long way but you 
                         can't expect me to do this!

                                     ROPER
                         Frank, this guy is a psychopath and 
                         he's got Ronnie. It's the only way 
                         I'm going to get close to him.

                                     FRANK
                         Then go to the Lieutenant or the 
                         D.A. with it, for Christsakes. You're 
                         asking me to put my fucking job on 
                         the line!

                                     ROPER
                         They'll never approve it, you know 
                         that. Besides, I involve the 
                         department and she's dead. I got one 
                         chance with this guy, Frank, alone.
                              (beat)
                         He killed Sam and he'll kill her.

               Frank just stares at him, compassion and anger tearing at 
               him.

                                     ROPER
                              (continuing)
                         What if it were Mary?
                              (beat)
                         You'd break every fucking rule in 
                         the book... wouldn't you?

               Frank continues to stare at him, a long beat.

                                     FRANK
                         I hope to God I never have to make 
                         that decision...

               He pushes back from the counter.

                                     FRANK
                              (continuing)
                         ...and this conversation never 
                         happened. I never saw you today. Now 
                         I gotta go take a leak.

               He turns and walks away. Roper looks down, SEEING that the 
               drawer beneath Frank's counter has been left slightly open.

               Roper reaches over, easing it further open -- inside a set 
               of KEYS. He looks around, then takes the keys.

                                     ROPER
                         I owe you one, Frank.

               He walks down the hallway.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROPER'S PICKUP - DAY

               CLOSE ON the SATCHEL Korda used in the robbery.

               WIDEN TO REVEAL Roper and McCall, Roper at the wheel, McCall 
               reading a folded MAP featuring MARE ISLAND.

                                     MCCALL
                         Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, 
                         cranes, high buildings... he'll be 
                         in place where he can see everything.
                              (to Roper)
                         How are we going to get me in there?

                                     ROPER
                         Good question.

               Roper thinks a moment, then turns, looking out the back of 
               the pickup, in the bed a loose CANVAS TARPAULIN. He and McCall 
               study the tarp a beat, then turn, looking at each other...

               EXT. MARE ISLAND - DAY

               WIDE VIEW reveals the immensity of the abandoned facility. 
               At one end near the chain link fence, Roper's pickup 
               approaches the gate.

               EXT. MARE ISLAND - NORTH GATE - DAY

               Roper cautiously drives toward the gate -- the CHAIN securing 
               the gate has been cut. Roper swings open the gate.

               As he drives past we see that the bed of the truck has been 
               loosely covered with a TARP.

               Roper drives on, winding through the maze of roadways, huge 
               buildings and equipment dwarfing the truc PRODUCTION NOTE: 
               The idea is to take us into the facility to sell that it's 
               abandoned, immense, eerie in it's scale -- a ghost town. We 
               end up wherever we want for the next scene.

               INT. ROPER'S PICKUP - DAY

               As he rounds a corner, approaching the dry dock area, huge 
               CRANES and mothballed SHIPS in the b.g. He parks near a 
               building, a weathered SIGN reading: BLD 28. Roper shuts off 
               the engine, leaving the keys in the ignition. Taking the 
               satchel he opens the door.

               EXT. DRY DOCK AREA - DAY

               Roper steps out, eyes scanning the buildings, the cranes... 
               Korda could be anywhere up there, watching.

               INT. BUILDING - UPPER LEVEL - DAY

               KORDA'S POV through the filthy windows, Roper far below, 
               standing beside his pickup.

               EXT. ROPER - DAY

               As he moves away from the truck, holding the satchel.

                                     ROPER
                         Korda!

               In response he HEARS Korda's VOICE, eerie, almost a whisper, 
               coming from everywhere and nowhere as if emanating from the 
               ground and the buildings all at once.

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                              (filtered)
                         Nice of you to make it, Roper. Take 
                         your jacket off, put it on the hood.

               Roper complies, his eyes searching the buildings, where is 
               his voice coming from?

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         Now, over to the chains, to your 
                         left.

               Roper SEES a chained off section nearby. Roper takes a few 
               steps when Korda's voice stops him...

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         But first, let's have a look under 
                         the tarp. Pull it back.

               A momentary anxious look from Roper, then he walks to the 
               bed of the truck, pausing a moment, gripping the cover before 
               whipping it back, revealing... Ronnie's LUGGAGE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK

               McCall supported under the frame by a makeshift HARNESS around 
               his waist and legs.

                         All right, move it.

               McCall watches as Roper heads away, then releases the harness, 
               lowering himself to the ground. Quickly he moves the SMOKING 
               LEATHER GLOVES he was wearing, burned by contact with the 
               hot exhaust pipe.

               ROPER

               Reaches the the chained area, REVEALING an empty DRY DOCK, 
               easily one hundred feet deep and five hundred long.

               At the bottom of the dry dock is a PORTABLE RADIO, the 
               acoustics of natural amphitheater so intense you could hear 
               a whisper -- the source of Korda's voice.

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         Throw in and your piece.

               Roper tosses his PISTOL into the dry dock.

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                         And your back up.

               Roper removes the PISTOL from his ankle HOLSTER, tossing it. 
               Korda's VOICE cuts the eerie silence.

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         Walk under the cranes and down the 
                         alleyway. At the end, turn right. 
                         Building thirty-six.

               The RADIO CLICKS OFF.

               Roper walks towards the megalith CRANES, passing under them, 
               then heads down the alleyway created by the tall buildings.

               EXT. ROPER'S TRUCK - DAY LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK

               McCall, his RIFLE CASE on his chest, watches as Roper turns 
               the corner and heads down the alley way.

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               McCall rolls out, scrambling for the cover of the building. 
               Slinging the case over his shoulder he finds a LADDER leading 
               up the side of the building, beginning to climb.

               EXT. ROPER - DAY

               Walking down the alley way, nearing the end.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY

               McCall moving along the edge, looking down. He spots Roper, 
               moving fast to keep him in sight.

               He comes to the edge of the building, having to walk across 
               a narrow RAMP to get to the next building.

               He looks down, Roper turning the corner, McCall moves on, 
               removing the RIFLE from its case as he goes.

               EXT. ROPER - DAY

               Leaves the alleyway, a complex of hanger-like buildings 
               revealed. To his far right is a building, a SIGN reading: 
               BLD 36. He clutches the satchel, heading towards it.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY

               McCall negotiating another precarious crossing between 
               buildings. He spots Roper, eyes quickly searching the roof 
               tops and buildings for the sniper's position. He sees it, 
               across the way, a location covering the buildings where Roper 
               is now walking. He heads out.

               EXT. ROPER - DAY

               Walking towards building 36, passing by a towering, glass 
               fronted building on his right, his eyes are searching the 
               roof tops of the buildings around him.

                                     ROPER
                              (to himself)
                         Where the hell are you, McCall?

               As Roper passes a set of partially open ROLLING DOORS to the 
               glass-fronted building, he's startled by Korda's VOICE from 
               within:

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                         Right there, Roper.

               Roper's eyes go to building 36, still fifty yards away.

                                     ROPER
                         Shit.

               Roper stops, slowly turning towards the doors.

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                         Come on in, there's someone just 
                         dying to see you.

               Roper hesitates. He turns a bit in profile, eyes searching.

                                     ROPER
                              (loudly)
                         Where are you?

               POV TELESCOPIC SIGHT: Focusing on Roper, his lips moving... 
               McCall, heaving for breath, has just dropped down into 
               position, providing a view of Roper and the inside of the 
               glass fronted building.

                                     MCCALL
                         Right here, Scott.

               He touches the LASER SIGHTING attachment to his scope, a red 
               beam activated...

               ROPER - DAY

               From inside the building Korda's VOICE:

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                         Get your ass in here, Roper.

               Just as Roper starts to move he SEES the red laser DOT on 
               the back of his hand -- McCall is up there, right behind 
               him. Roper moves inside.

               MCCALL - DAY

               Lying prone inside the operator's booth, steadies his RIFLE, 
               looking through the scope.

               TELESCOPIC POV: He can see Roper enter, his field of vision 
               limited inside the building where the light penetrates, the 
               room cast in HARD SHADOWS.

               He MOVES to the windows, all either painted white or so 
               obscured with grime and dirt he can only see vague shapes 
               and shadows inside. He MOVES BACK to the opening, Roper now 
               just inside.

                                     MCCALL

               Cavernous and dark, a jungle of huge MACHINES, LATHES and 
               EQUIPMENT once used in the design of nuclear submarines.

               Roper moves a few feet inside, remaining in the light and 
               keeping his face in three-quarter profile to McCall's 
               position.

                                     ROPER
                         Where is she, Korda? I want to see 
                         her.

               From the darkness beyond...

                         Walk to the table.

               Roper walks to a steel SHOP TABLE.

                              (continuing)

                                     ROPER
                         I'm not wearing a wire. This is just 
                         between you and me.

                         Shut the fuck up and do what I say!

               Roper puts down the satchel, unbuttoning his shirt, holding 
               it open.

                                     ROPER
                         Satisfied?

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                         Open the bag, dump everything on the 
                         table.

               Roper opens the bag, the JEWELRY and the dozens of GLASSINE 
               ENVELOPES spill out onto the table. He lays the satchel on 
               its side, the bottom facing Roper. Taped to the bottom is a 
               short barreled .45 AUTOMATIC.

                                     ROPER
                         It's all there.

                         Spread it out.

               Roper spreads the pile out across the top of the table.

                                     ROPER
                         Only the jewels, Korda, you've got 
                         my word.

               A long beat...

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                         Show me something.

               Without looking Roper reaches to the pile of GLASSINE 
               ENVELOPES...

               CLOSE ON ROPER'S HAND

               Palmed in his hand, the ENVELOPE containing Ronnie's diamond.

               Roper, without looking, 'digs' into the pile, holding up the 
               GLASSINE ENVELOPE between his fingers, still holding the 
               palmed envelope. He starts to toss the envelope in his 
               fingers...

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         Not that one.

               Roper hesitates, then drops the envelope, his hand moving 
               over the pile...

                                     ROPER
                              (continuing)
                         Right there, the one in front... 
                         yeah, that one. Toss it.

               Roper reaches for the envelope.

               CLOSE ON ROPER'S HAND

               As he flips the palmed envelope into his fingers with the 
               skill of a card shark, exchanging it for the one Korda 
               indicated. He tosses it across the room...

               From the shadows Korda's hand reaches out, picking it up. A 
               long beat.

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         I'm impressed. I didn't think you 
                         could do it. What did you have to 
                         do, steal them?

                                     ROPER
                         Yeah.

                                     KORDA (O.S.)
                              (wry)

                                     ROPER
                         I'll worry about that. Let's get on 
                         with it.

               Korda LAUGHS as he slowly emerges from the darkness.

                                     KORDA

               On the floor he SEES a shadow cast - Korda. He moves to the 
               windows... inside the vague, blurred OUTLINE of a man. His 
               scope goes back to the satchel and the .45 taped to the 
               bottom.

                                     MCCALL

               INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

               Korda moves closer to the light, tossing an ATHLETIC BAG to 
               Roper, in his hand an AUTOMATIC PISTOL.

                         homing device in the other one.

               Roper slides the jewels into the second bag, eyeing the .45 
               on the bottom of the satchel.

                                     KORDA

               Roper hesitates, but all he can do at this point is play for 
               time, he moves forward...

               Watching Roper as he moves away from the satchel and the

               He moves the SCOPE ahead of Roper, SEEING Korda's shadow 
               cast on the floor, still unable to see him.

               Roper growing closer to Korda's position.

                         That's far enough. Bag on the floor.

               Roper hangs onto the bag -- there's 'four million in jewels' 
               in there -- all he has to bargain with.

                                     ROPER
                         I've kept my end. Ronnie first.

               Korda reacts in mock surprise.

                         Oh, shit, in all the excitement I 
                         almost forgot. She right here...

               A LIGHT SWITCH is thrown, a bank of lights behind him coming 
               ON, illuminating a massive FLAT BED CIRCULAR LATHE. Roper's 
               eyes in horror go to...

               RONNIE

               Tied to the lathe bed spread eagle. Some distance from her 
               body a CUTTING DEVICE is positioned over the lathe bed.

               Roper looks into Ronnie's terrified eyes.

                                     ROPER
                         Be cool, Ronnie, I'm gonna get you 
                         out of this.

               He turns back, Korda grinning at him.

                         No shit, this I gotta see...

               Korda swings into position a CONTROL BOX, the buttons held 
               down with TAPE.

               Korda pulls free the tape, the huge lathe beginning to TURN, 
               very slowly, the cutting device activated... if the table 
               keeps turning, Ronnie's body will soon be under the blade.

               (PRODUCTION NOTE: Lathe will be cutting into a section of

               Korda presses the STOP BUTTON, the lathe stopping. He releases 
               his finger again, the lathe turning. He stops it.

               We can see that Korda is immensely proud of his 'creation', 
               his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at 
               this point.

                         your finger on the button or the

               He releases the button, the lathe turning towards the cutting 
               device. He stops it again, holding the button.

               He eases towards Roper, extending his arm on the control 
               box, holding the button down.

               Through the SCOPE, he can see Korda as he steps into view.

               The CROSSHAIRS settle on Korda's upper forehead.

               And then Roper's HEAD fills the scope, the red dot GLOWING 
               on the back of his head.

               Through the SCOPE, Roper's head blocking the shot to Korda.

                                     MCCALL
                         Roper, move...

               EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

               But Korda bends down, picking up the BAG, stepping back away 
               from Roper, clearly out of McCall's line of fire.

                                     KORDA
                         Well, hate to run but I've got a 
                         plane to catch. You take good care 
                         of the little lady, hear?

               As Korda walks down the corridor of the huge machine shop, 
               we now SEE a CAR parked near the end facing us. Korda suddenly 
               stops, turning, gesturing to the car.

                                     KORDA
                              (continuing)
                         How careless of me. You see, there's 
                         only one way out of here, and you're 
                         standing right in the way.
                              (grins)
                         You could move, but then...

               He shakes his head at Roper.

                                     KORDA
                              (continuing)
                         Sure hate to be in your shoes.

               He turns, walking quickly towards his car, TALKING, LAUGHING, 
               to himself.

               Roper looks to the car, then back at the SATCHEL where the 
               .45 is still taped to the bottom. But Roper can't move, unable 
               to change his position more than a foot or two. He looks 
               around him, no way to stop the lathe if he releases the 
               button.

               EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY

               He can see Roper holding the box, but nothing else.

                                     MCCALL
                         What the hell's going on?

               INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

               Now Korda reaches his car, hopping inside, STARTING it up. 
               In desperation Roper looks back at the satchel, then turns, 
               calling out...

                                     ROPER
                         McCall, stop him, stop the car!

               Korda REVVING the engine...

               EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY

               McCall reading Roper's lips...

                                     MCCALL
                         What car?

               He swings the SCOPE up but the back of the machine shop is 
               blocked by his vantage point.

               Then he HEARS the faint SQUEALING of tires. He lowers his 
               scope, holding, waiting...

               INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

               Korda at the end of the long building, beginning to 
               accelerate.

               ROPER

               Turns toward McCall's position...

                                     ROPER
                         McCall!

               The CAR now screaming down the long corridor...

               EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY

               McCall still can't see the car...

               INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

               The car now closing in on Roper, but Roper holds his ground...

                                     ROPER
                         McCall, shoot the son of a bitch!

               INT. KORDA'S CAR - DAY

               Korda bearing down on Roper.

                         Bye, bye, cop...

               ROPER

               Holding his position, eyes widening in fear...

               EXT. MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV - DAY

               The CAR comes into view, the CROSSHAIRS on the windshield... 
               but the glare off the window is obscuring any shot of Korda. 
               McCall takes aim and FIRES...

               INT. KORDA'S CAR - DAY

               The bullet punches through the window, catching Korda's left 
               shoulder, BLOOD flying. Korda whips the wheel in shock...

               INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY KORDA'S CAR

               Spinning out of control, hitting a table piled with MACHINE 
               PARTS, sending them flying...

               But the car is now swapping ends, still flying right towards 
               Roper, who can't move...; who won't move.

               The car flies past him, the SIDE MIRROR catching Roper's 
               shirt, tearing it, a flash of BLOOD from his arm...

               The car then collides with a series of PIPES crossing the 
               floor, STEAM erupting in every direction as the car then 
               slams into several PROPANE BOTTLES stacked near the benches, 
               a series of EXPLOSIONS ripping through the building. . .

               ROPER

               Thrown to the floor by the explosions, releasing the button, 
               as...

               THE CAR

               Hits the GLASSED-IN ROLLING DOORS.

               EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY

               The CAR explodes from the building, GLASS FLYING, the car 
               rolling, flipping over, coming to a rest on its wheels, 
               driver's side away from McCall's position.

               INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY ROPER

               On the floor, recovering. He catches a quick glimpse of the 
               bottom section of the lathe, a GEARBOX, the gears turning...

               THE LATHE

               Turning, the cutting blade inching towards Ronnie...

               ROPER

               Staggers to his feet, grabbing the control box, pressing the 
               button... nothing happens, the lathe still turning, SPARKS 
               coming out of the box, it's SHORTING... Only a few more 
               seconds...

               Desperately his eyes search the floor, SEEING a HUGE WRENCH. 
               He grabs the wrench, jamming it between the GEARS in the 
               gearbox, the gears shuddering violently, threatening to crush 
               the wrench...

               Roper runs to Ronnie's side, frantically pulling at her bonds, 
               the cutting blade now paused an inch away from her...

               THE GEARBOX

               Hammering and clanking, the wrench can't last a heartbeat 
               longer...

               ROPER

               Pulls the last of the restraints away...

               THE GEARBOX

               Just as the massive gears crush the wrench, the table 
               turning...

               THE LATHE

               The blade passing directly over Ronnie's position as Roper 
               hauls her away, holding her in his arms.

               EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV OF CAR

               Korda is slumped over the wheel. He looks dead. McCall slings 
               his rifle over his shoulder and moves towards a DRAIN PIPE 
               attached to the side of the building.

               INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

               Roper holding Ronnie, easing her away from the still turning 
               lathe.

                                     RONNIE

               McCall slides to the ground via the drain pipe, but...

               KORDA'S CAR

               Korda is not quite dead...

               The door eases open, Korda rolling to the ground, bag in one 
               hand, AUTOMATIC in the other. He looks up, SEEING McCall.

               He OPENS FIRE, McCall hitting the deck and taking cover as 
               BULLETS hit the wall around him.

               McCall whips out his REVOLVER, RETURNING FIRE, a GUN BATTLE 
               ensuing.

               INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY ROPER

               HEARING the shots outside, hauls Ronnie out of the way, 
               keeping her low to the ground.

                         Stay here, don't move.

                         Do it!

               He pushes her towards the cover of some machines, then 
               crouching low to the floor, recovers the .45 from the bottom 
               of the satchel. He heads out towards the other side of the 
               cavernous, machine-choked building.

               EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL

               FIRES a round at Korda, then trying to close in on the car, 
               runs from his cover into the opening...

               KORDA

               Leaps up and FIRES, McCall taking a slug in his leg, knocking 
               him to the ground. The SLIDE to Korda's AUTOMATIC has kicked 
               open, out of bullets. He drops the gun, picks up the BAG and 
               runs alongside the machine shop.

               ROPER

               Exits the machine shop, SEEING McCall on the ground, Korda 
               nowhere in sight. Combat-style Roper runs to McCall, dropping 
               to his side.

                                     ROPER
                         McCall, you all right?

                         I'm okay. Korda... went down the 
                         side of the building...

                         Stay put.

               Roper sprints towards the building, racing alongside it, 
               catching a glimpse of Korda just as he disappears around the 
               other end. Roper charges on...

               EXT. MACHINE SHOP - REAR - DAY

               Korda runs past the building, still clutching the BAG. He 
               runs past another building, heading towards the dry dock 
               area and Roper's pickup. A moment later Roper emerges from 
               the machine shop just in time to see Korda round the corner 
               of the next building.

               KORDA

               Clearing the building sees Roper's PICKUP. He runs to it, 
               jumping inside, finding the KEYS in the ignition. He starts 
               the truck, pulling out, just as Roper runs into view.

               ROPER

               With the truck accelerating towards him he raises and FIRES, 
               two bullet holes in the front WINDSHIELD, missing Korda, the 
               truck still speeding towards him. Roper's gun jams. Roper 
               leaps, sliding forward on the hood, almost falling as he 
               grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper 
               blades for support, his WEAPON flying from his hand.

               KORDA

               Speeds around the buildings and down the alleyways, whipping 
               from side to side, trying to shake Roper off, Roper hanging 
               on for dear life.

                                     ROPER
                              (shouting)
                         Give it up, Korda, you got away with 
                         nothing! Nothing but a bag of shit! 
                         It's all fake!

               Korda can't help but look at the OPEN BAG beside him.

                                     ROPER
                              (continuing)
                         Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it! 
                         It's all shit! A hundred dollars 
                         worth of glass!

               Korda reaches in, grabbing a handful of the COSTUME JEWELRY. 
               He can't believe it, it's all fake!

                                     KORDA
                         You fuck!!!

               Korda goes crazy, slamming the truck into the side of a 
               building, trying to throw Roper, but Roper hangs on.

               Korda then caroms off the sides of buildings, left, right, 
               SPARKS flying, then smashes into BOXES, CRATES, anything he 
               can see stacked alongside the road way, but Roper stays put, 
               clinging on with all he's got, swinging from side to side to 
               avoid the obstacles.

               Then Korda SEES ahead a huge pile of BOXES, WOOD FRAMING, 
               PALLETS, TRASH, stacked at the side of a building. He hammers 
               the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the 
               pile... BOXES, WOOD, PAPER, DEBRIS flying everywhere, through 
               the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with 
               his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside the 
               cab...

               ROPER

               In the maelstrom lets go his grip, grabbing the upper frame 
               of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck, rolls 
               over the top of the cab, landing in the bed of the truck 
               along with BOXES, LUMBER, and TRASH.

               KORDA

               Clears his eyes, looking up, Roper is gone! He LAUGHS 
               hysterically... he knocked him off!

               ROPER IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK

               Leaning out the passenger's side SEES they are approaching 
               the dry dock area.

               In the bed of the truck, along with the BOXES, SUITCASES and 
               other objects, he sees several long 2x4's. Grabbing a BOARD 
               he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift 
               movement, stands, swinging to the driver's side, driving the 
               2x4 through the side window, through the steering wheel, 
               past the dash and catching the tip of the ACCELERATOR PEDAL, 
               pinning it to the floor.

               As Roper releases the board it WEDGES inside the door frame, 
               locking the wheel and the accelerator, the engine SCREAMING 
               wide open. Korda reacts in panic...

               Roper clings to the cab, looking over the top, the DRY DOCK 
               looming towards them. He prepares to jump...

               KORDA

               Suddenly SEES the approaching dry dock. He jams on the brakes, 
               but it's not enough, the truck racing towards the edge...

               IN SLOW MOTION THE TRUCK

               Vaults over the edge of the dry dock as Roper runs down the 
               bed, leaping off the tail gate, arms windmilling as he goes 
               airborne...

               The truck plummets towards the bottom...

               ROPER

               Lands in a huge pile of CARGO NETS and CARDBOARD BOXES, piled 
               near the edge of the dry dock...

               KORDA

               SCREAMS in wide-eyed terror as...

               THE TRUCK

               Hits the bottom of the dock, EXPLODING into flames.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Roper and Ronnie lay on a gorgeous white sand beach, drinking 
               from coconuts with umbrellas in them.

                         Paradise shit.

               Roper hails a waitress, serving the hotel guests.

                              (to waitress)
                         I'll have another Pena Colada. And 
                         this time could you shave the ice, 
                         please.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Oui, Monsieur. Right away.

               Roper stretches back into his chaise lounge, adjusting his 
               Ray Bans. A purring cat without a care in the world.

                         I've been thinking.

               TWO GORGEOUS FRENCH GIRLS unstring their bikinis, flopping 
               topless on the beach in front of them.

                                     ROPER

                         But we've got to keep our perspective

   FADE IN:

   EXT. OCEAN - CLOSE UP:  WATER - MORNING LIGHT

   We are at the delicate interface between ocean and
   air...liquid and gas...the event horizon where molecules
   evaporate.  This interchange is ethereal.  Then, low
   frequencies rumble through depths...louder...closer, now...
   And the ocean surface is torn by a 46-foot catamaran and the
   ROAR of 2,700 horsepower, rocketing at us at 140 knots...

   OFFSHORE RACER:  "BORN TO WIN"

   in PROFILE.

   AERIAL:  "BORN TO WIN"

   ...has a canopy, low like a B-1 bomber and extends a half
   mile.  It launches off two-foot swells, goes airborne, pushes
   to 150 knots with another 1,100 RPM left...

   INT. RACE BOAT - SONNY CROCKETT

   pilots the "Born to Win" in full helmet.  On the throttle and
   flaps is RICARDO TUBBS...

   EXT. OCEAN - "BORN TO WIN"

   leads the frontrunners towards a finish line demarcated by a
   couple of $10 million yachts loaded with media.  At the last
   moment occurs a small power loss, and "Born to Win" gets
   nosed into second place by the 46-foot Skater, "Goddess"...

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. MARINA - "BORN TO WIN" - LATER

   thunders to the dock, throttled down at low revs.  The canopy
   is up.  Crockett and Tubbs' helmets are off.  Dockhands tie
   it off.  It's the same crowd you catch at a Grand Prix:  nine-
   figure money, tall, Northern Italian women and minor German
   princesses with Swiss educations, no bimbos and no questions
   about asset origins.  The exception is "Born to Win's"
   sponsor, a blonde, dreadlocked, bearded 6'4" SWITEK.  He
   looks like a dot-com entrepreneur who got out in time.  Next
   to him is a blonde Ukranian lady with high cheekbones.  We'll
   see her again.

   WINNING CIRCLE - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   in second position to the Japanese driver and throttle man of
   "Goddess," neither of whom speak English.  The #3 boat,
   "Bicardi Silver," was driven by David Scott and throttled by
   John Tomlinson...

   CROCKETT + TUBBS

   leave the winning circle among Asian and Mexican
   billionaires.  As the small crowd breaks up...

   A DEEPLY-TANNED PLAYER

   named NICHOLAS in Vuarnet wraparounds and buzz-cut white hair
   glides by...

                        NICHOLAS
                  (low)
             Burnett, what's crackin'?

                        CROCKETT
             Nothing.

                        TUBBS
             Maxin' and relaxin'.

                        NICHOLAS
                  (doesn't believe them)
             Sure.  Change your mind; get
             inclined?  Let me know...

   Whatever Nicholas is soliciting, Crockett and Tubbs don't
   want.  (Nicholas brokers "go-fast" runs, moving loads from
   offshore into South Florida.  Among guys who pilot offshore
   race boats, there are one or two who've never run a load, but
   no one's found them yet.)  Meanwhile...

   INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - A KITCHEN - NIGHT

   A couple-hundred-thousand-dollars worth of granite and steel.
   Off-screen a restaurant-grade Sub-Zero opens with a hiss.
   Fan starts.  Beyond the kitchen we SEE through a dining room
   to a den.  A chair is overturned.  We HEAR muffled sounds.
   We SEE feet extend through a door jamb.  Someone's on the
   floor.  A television is playing, distantly.

   INT. DEN - SEE FAMILY PICTURES

   so close they almost come to life.  A Venezuelan family, two
   boys and a girl in a pool.  Maria, Alonzo, the two boys at
   their sister's baptism.  And we see holding the baby daughter
   is Riccardo Tubbs.

   A family dinner at a South American restaurant.  Tubbs sits
   with the youngest daughter on his lap.  Maria is on the other
   side of him.  This is the image that almost comes to life.
   We hear the vivacious latin ambience late on a Sunday
   afternoon when families take the grandparents and have
   dinner.

   INT. KITCHEN - SUB ZERO REFRIGERATOR

   MOVE from the bright glare of the interior ONTO

   the broad neck of a MAN.  A Viking is tattooed there.  The
   image morphs into a naked woman presenting her rear to a
   muscled biker next to a chopper above a swastika residing
   between shoulder blades.  SS lightning bolts are on his neck.
   PULL BACK from this MAN, who is bent into the frig because
   he's hungry.  His head is shaved and he's naked from the
   waist up.  A BLACK HEFTY GARBAGE BAG is tied around his
   waist.  Yellow industrial gloves are on his hands.  Something
   bad is happening in this house...

   INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

   It's a Sikorski skimming across the water of Biscayne Bay on
   a moonlit night at living-room level past stilt houses.

   RICARDO TUBBS

   pilots the chopper past the brightly lit windows of high-rise
   Collins Avenue condos for the fugitive rich...and heads
   towards the MacArthur Causeway.

                        CROCKETT
             What's our deal?

                        TUBBS
             Backup in case the Russians get
             physical.

                        CROCKETT
             How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?

                        TUBBS
             Skin has to touch skin.  That's the
             requirement for the warrant.  Then
             he makes a credible excuse and he                        
             stops....
                  (beat)
             Her crew blackmailed and asset-
             stripped the last mark down to his
             social security...                                       

   In the back - her long copper legs stretched out under a
   short skirt - is GINA CALABRESE.

                        GINA
             This I gotta see...
                  (beat)
             ...the "make up an excuse and stop"
             part.

                        CROCKETT
             Have faith.

                        GINA
             I have faith.  In horoscopes and
             fortune cookies...

                        TUBBS
             So?

                        GINA
             Switek pulling this off...?  That's
             not faith; that's delusional...

   Wearing enough of nothing to hide the micro .380, which Gina
   checks right now.  There's a round in the chamber.

   AERIAL:  THE SIKORSKI crosses past the stacks of $5 million
   condos to a landing pad on a roof.  The Miami of the '80's,
   that twilight-zone frontier built on coke-fueled cash flow,
   is over.  The frontier development stage is passed.  It has
   BECOME Casablanca.  Anything goes; everything has a price.

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. ROOFTOP LANDING PAD - WIDE

   The chopper rockets in, settles.

   INT. UTILITY STAIRCASE

   Crockett, Tubbs and Gina descend to the 25th-floor penthouse,
   the target.  As Crockett and Tubbs continue down to 24, she
   looks over her shoulder at Tubbs...

                        TUBBS
             Damn, girl...

   INT. SURVEILLANCE APARTMENT (ONE FLOOR BELOW THE TARGET)
   PENTHOUSE - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT

   enter.  Two surveillance technicians, RICK and FRANK, are
   glued to a monitor showing a bedroom in which nothing
   happens.  LT. CASTILLO is there, out of a past somewhere
   between CIA and the Jesuits...

   Referring to the monitor on which there are NO PEOPLE in an
   EMPTY BEDROOM.

   They are watching air move.

                        TUBBS
             This is exciting...

                        RICK
             That's 'cause nothing is happening.

                        CROCKETT
             No shit...?

                        FRANK
                  (it goes past him)
             Yeah.  This is their
             surveillance...how they video their
             marks?  See, we jacked their fiber
             optics, like we piggybacked their
             signal.  Get it?

                        TUBBS
             Cooool...

   They exit to...

   INT. PENTHOUSE CONDO - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   are met at the door by security, who recognizes them, and are
   welcomed by their host, UGO.  This is the Baccardi Cup After-
   Party.  The same players from the marina...

   OVER CROCKETT + TUBBS

   enter an 8,000-square-foot penthouse...offshore racer types,
   players, So Bee models...

                        UGO
             Runnin' the Biscayne 200?

   Crockett wanders off...

                        TUBBS
             If a coupla new exhaust manifolds
             show up...

   approaches a bar and female bartender...

                        CROCKETT
             Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or
             Boodles.

                  (Scandinavian accent)
             Lemon or lime?

                        CROCKETT
             Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics,
             darlin'.  Where ya' from?

                        BARTENDER
                  (leaning in)
             Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.

             complexion...?

   She's beautifully bronzed.

                        BARTENDER
                  (laughs)
             No.  I was in Namibia...

                        CROCKETT
             Doing...?

                        BARTENDER
             With the United Nations High
             Commission on Refugees.  Famine
             relief.

   Gina's listening on her personal comms.

                        CROCKETT
             Really?  I did refugee relocation
             in Somalia.  But they transferred
             me out after I was wounded...

   Gina rolls her eyes as she crosses by Tubbs.

                        GINA
             Only African he ever "relocated"
             was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model
             for Gucci, and he got wounded when
             she took an NBA draft choice to the
             Super Bowl instead of him...

                        TUBBS
             He did volunteer one time...

                        TRUDY
                  (entering)
             For a massage parlor bust?
                  (beat)
             Why am I here...?

   TRUDY JOPLIN is a tall African-American.  She whispers into a
   small mic.  If you looked closely, she's ripped...as if steel
   cables moved under her smooth skin.  She slides past Tubbs
   and Gina...

                        TUBBS
                  (low)
             ...to backup Switek.  But only if
             it gets lethal.

                        TRUDY
             That's impossible.

                        TUBBS
             Why?

                        TRUDY
             Because you cannot kill him.

   SWITEK

   all white bling, is arguing with his blade-thin, glassy-eyed,
   adrenaline junkie partner, ZITO.  Approaching is "Miss
   Ukraine."  High cheekbones suggest one of Genghis Khan's
   horsemen found her maternal ancestor as attractive as Switek
   finds her...

   Tubbs clocks three beefy Russians in a corner, one is
   unusually fit.

                        TUBBS
             And there's Dmitri...

                        CROCKETT
             The honey trap.  And there's the
             honey.

                        TUBBS
             Hello, Miss Ukraine...

   MISS UKRAINE brings Switek his glass of champagne...  She
   whispers something in his ear...and is led towards a back
   bedroom.  Gina ambles over.

                        TRUDY
                  (to Crockett)
             Eleven to seven he blows it.

                        CROCKETT
                  (whispers)
             Twenty on my man...

                        TRUDY
             You're giving away your money,
             fool...

   Tubbs opens his Moto as if he's about to make a call...Trudy
   looks over his shoulder.  What we see is the feed from the
   monitor in the surveillance room downstairs.

   CLOSER: TUBBS'S MOTO

   Two blonde people starting to get naked.  Switek and Miss
   Ukraine.  A second call comes in.  Tubbs ignores it.

                        TUBBS
                  (to Zito)
             You bet your partner?

                        ZITO
             Sure.  Switek versus primal impulse
             from the amygdala.  Higher thinking
             versus the lizard brain.  Tectonic
             plates of libido confront the
             cognitive.

                        GINA
             Oh, bullshit.  She cops his joint.
             He pushes the button.

                        TRUDY
             What's so fucking difficult?

   THEIR FACES.  They watch.  And...Crockett's cell phone rings.
   He separates from the group...

                        CROCKETT
             Yeah...?

                        STEVENS (O.S.)
             Sonny...?

                        CROCKETT
             Yeah.

                        STEVENS (O.S.)
             Where's Riccardo?

                        CROCKETT
             On the phone.

                        STEVENS (O.S.)
             I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...

   EXT. BALCONY - CROCKETT - NIGHT

   enters.  He's come outside to hear better.

   In the background Gina shakes her head about Switek.  He blew
   it.  Trudy looks at Crockett and sees Crockett's focused,
   hearing...

                        CROCKETT
             Who is this?

                                                  INTERCUT
                                                  WITH:

   INT. BENTLEY - ALONZO STEVENS - NIGHT

   He's cruising at 85.  He's floating in a magnolia leather
   interior.  But it's bloodstained from his nose and mouth.
   He's been beaten.  His white shirt is torn.  He doesn't
   care...

                        STEVENS
                  (voice cracks)
             It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...

                        CROCKETT
                  (recognizing him)
             Alonzo?
                  (beat)
             What are you talking about?  Where
             are you...?

                        STEVENS
             They had me from the gate.

                        CROCKETT
             I don't understand...

   Crockett's alarmed.  He catches Tubbs' eye and waves him
   outside...

                        STEVENS
             I gave up nothing on you guys.
             Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico
             out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're
             on their own...it's all their deal,
             anyway, so fuck 'em.

                        CROCKETT (O.S.)
             Alonzo, what's goin' on?!

                        STEVENS
             After I check on Francine and the
             boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell
             Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to
             know...

   Tubbs joins Crockett on the balcony.

                        CROCKETT
             Where are you?

                        STEVENS (O.S.)
             ...look after her.  Ask Rico to.
             Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do
             it.  They had me from the gate.
             Do that.  Whatever you can do for
             them.  Okay?
                  (breaks)
             Look what I did to them, Sonny...!

                        CROCKETT
             Alonzo...!

                        STEVENS (O.S.)
             Goodbye.

   Crockett's phone goes dead.

                        TUBBS
             What is it?

                        CROCKETT
             Alonzo...

                        TUBBS
             Stevens?

                        CROCKETT
                  (nods)
             Something's wrong.

   Crockett's entering a number while...

                        TUBBS
                  (dialing)
             I'll try Francine...

   Meanwhile Crockett HEARS...

                        MACHINE VOICE
                  (recording)
             Federal Bureau of Investigation.
             Our office hours are...
                  (Crockett punches three-
                   digit code)

                        FBI AGENT VOICE
             F.B.I....

                        CROCKETT
                  (cuts him off)
             This is Detective Crockett.  Miami-
             Dade P.D.  Patch me through to your
             Special Agent in Charge, James
             Fujima?  It's an emergency...

                        FBI AGENT
             He'll be in on Monday...

                        CROCKETT
             I said, "emergency."  If he's not
             reachable, who's running the
             weekend?  The ASAC?

                        FBI AGENT
             We don't give that out...

                        CROCKETT
             Listen carefully.

   Crockett compels himself to be patient.  Meanwhile, Tubbs has
   struck out with Alonzo's home phone.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
                  (into Nextel)
             An informant who is working one of
             YOUR cases right now called me.
             YOU may have a problem.  So get me
             somebody on the other end of this
             telephone who knows what the hell
             I'm talking about...!

   Meanwhile...

                        TUBBS
                  (into phone)
             C'mon...

                        VOICE (O.S.)
             Miami-Dade PD Tech...

                        TUBBS

             Bobby G.  The firefly we used to
             have on Alonzo Stevens' Bentley,
             check if it still runs; if so,
             launch Air Support.  Locate the
             Bentley...
                  (pause, listens)
             I don't know...we haven't worked
             with him for six months...

                        CROCKETT
                  (waits, then hears a click
                   on his Nextel)
             Hello?

                        FUJIMA (O.S.)
             This is Agent James Fujima.

                        CROCKETT
             Detective Crockett.

                        FUJIMA (O.S.)
             What's your Miami PD badge number?

                        CROCKETT
             4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.

                        FUJIMA (O.S.)
                  (pause)
             Okay.  What's up?

                        CROCKETT
             A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint
             Interagency Task Force.  Name of
             Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR
             informant.  Stevens, called us.  I
             haven't spoken to him for six
             months.
             I do not know what case you have
             him on.  I do not know what he is
             talking about.  But whatever he is
             doing for you, it sounds like it is
             going bad.  Right now...

                        FUJIMA
             How do I discuss operations over an
             open line?

                        CROCKETT
             How do I know?
                  (beat)
             I got the call from Alonzo on an
             open line.  That is the hand we
             have been dealt at this moment, at
             eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday
             night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert
             you, here.
                  (beat)
             You know whether or not...you have
             a thing goin' down.  I do not.
                  (beat)
             But we know this guy.  I think you
             know this guy.  Normally, he is
             cool.  Tonight he is distraught.
             That is atypical.  That engenders
             foreboding.  Do you understand the
             meaning of the word "foreboding"?
             As in badness is happening to your
             deal right fucking now?

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. ABANDONED METAL SHED, INDIAN RIVER - WIDE - NIGHT

   Nothing.  Rusting marine parts and corrugated metal fall into
   weeds next on a channel of the Indian River.  It cuts through
   inner-city Miami.  Distant noise.  But...

   INT. METAL SHED - ARYAN BROTHERS

   in low light are strapping up.  Kevlar vests go over tattooed
   arms and chests.  Glimpses of swastikas.  Handguns in
   waistbands.  SMGs (Small Machine Guns) slung from shoulders
   over white shirts, business-suit jackets.  Everybody wears
   surgical gloves.  Shoes are industrial.

   REAR SHOT:  TWO OF THE BROTHERS

   are leaving.  One carries a very long rifle with a flash
   suppressor.  It is a bolt action .50 caliber Burrows.

   NEARBY ON THE RIVER

   is a second Aryan Brother sniper team with an identical
   weapon aimed at an empty lot a thousand yards away across the
   Indian River...

   INT. METAL SHED

   EXT. INDIAN RIVER - EMPTY LOT

   Caribbean freighters seized by US Customs rust at the bank.
   MOVE IN.  Two Cadillacs are parked.  Waiting.  A door opens.
   An interior light comes on.  MOVE CLOSER.  Two Russian
   slickster types.  Patient.  One looks at a watch.  The other
   triggers his cell phone.  A meeting is imminent.

                                                  MEANWHILE:

   INT. FBI OFFICE - RAC JAMES FUJIMA - NIGHT

   Empty except for the FBI Agent in a sweatsuit carrying files,
   as if he stopped by when Crockett's call came in.  He's on a
   computer.  He picks up the phone...

                        FUJIMA
             Guy's involved in a "meet"...

                        CROCKETT
             "Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"?
             "Reverse undercover"?  What?

                        FUJIMA
             Meet and greet.  "I flash you some
             of mine, you flash me some of
             yours?"

                        CROCKETT
             And the deal goes down at another
             place at another time.

                        FUJIMA
             That's right.

                        CROCKETT
             ...so there's no industrial-
             strength HRT weapons team out there
             tonight?

   Crockett puts his Nextel on "speaker" so Tubbs can hear, too.

                        FUJIMA
             Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash
             cash.

                        TUBBS
                  (into phone)
             Haitian, Dominican, Russian,
             Israeli?

                        FUJIMA
             White supremacist types.

   Crockett's impatient.

                        CROCKETT
             OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders,
             prison gangs?

                        FUJIMA
             NLR, we think.  I wanna know...

                        TUBBS
                  (sarcastic)
             Oh, good...

                        FUJIMA
             ...what else, what else did he
             indicate to you?  I need to know
             everything he said.

                        CROCKETT
             He is saying they had him from the
             gate.  He is saying to my partner
             and I and to his family "goodbye."
             What does that tell you?

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. INDIAN RIVER - WIDE:  THE DEAL - NIGHT

   Three Aryan Brothers in business suits get out of the rear of
   the Escalade and Suburban with a driver in each.  Our two
   "Russians" approach from their Cadillac with a backup
   Cadillac and one driver on the other side.

   CLOSER:  ARYAN BROTHERS.  Friendly.  Hip-hop culture has
   invaded White Supremacist gangs.  Buzz cuts.  Goatees.  A
   couple of diamond earrings.

                        RUSSIAN #1
             ...sample now is okay.  And we want
             sample load when we do deal...

                        ARYAN BROTHER
             Sure, man.

                        RUSSIAN #1
             What inventory you can supply...?

                        ARYAN BROTHER #1
             Meth.  Glass, ice, K's, E's,
             Mitsu's, Ames, Ex...whatever you
             need.  Coke?  Tonnage.  And
             Colombian H.  But give us a heads
             up...

   The Aryan Brother pops him a couple of vials.

                        ARYAN BROTHER #1 (cont'd)
             Ice.  Spectra-analyze that shit.
             And party-on with the coke.  You
             are looking at ninety-two percent
             pure...none of that jumped-on
             powder they sell up in New
             Yorioo...

                        ARYAN BROTHER #2
             Yeah...
                  (beat)
             Now, let's see the green...

   One of the Russians puts his hand on a weapon as the other
   opens up a Nike sports bag.

                        RUSSIAN
             Never seen money before?  This is
             called "money."

   Aryan Brother #1 reaches into the bag at the wrapped stacks
   of hundreds.  Flips through a couple, takes one or two at
   random.  Russian nods for him to go ahead.

                        ARYAN BROTHER #1
             Okay.  You got lotsa green.  We got
             all the goodies.  We party.
             Larry'll call you in the AM and
             talk money, quantity, time and
             place...

   WIDEN.  Everybody goes back to their cars.  As the two
   "Russians" get into theirs, Aryan Brother #1 turns from the
   running board of the Escalade with his driver's door open.

                        ARYAN BROTHER
             Hey, Ivan!  I forgot to ask you
             something, my brother...

   He looks at his partner and nods, who says something into a
   Nextel.

                        ARYAN BROTHER (cont'd)
             ...they have a decent death-benefit
             program in the FBI?

   For the Russians in the car, time freezes.  As they start
   to react, they're blown up by .50 caliber rounds from the two
   sniper positions.  The .50 caliber rounds go right through
   car bodies, sheet metal, upholstery, glass, human flesh,
   bone, more upholstery and metal and out the other end.
   Another round goes through the passenger door, through the
   passenger, through the driver, out the driver door and into
   the night...

   WIDE

   The three Aryan Brothers approach the steaming cars with the
   chopped-up occupants and take the gym bag full of cash.  The
   Escalade driver dons night-vision goggles.  They load up and
   drive off as we hear the "thump, thump" of Air Support and
   some distant sirens.  Meanwhile...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MIAMI-DADE CHOPPER - SWITEK + ZITO - NIGHT

   at 170 knots watching a thermographic image of Alonzo
   Stevens' car on a monitor weave through traffic northbound on
   the 95...  SEE Tubbs' Sikorsky beyond Switek + Zito as it
   swoops from a higher altitude right past the Miami-Dade
   chopper, banks and dives for the freeway.

   EXT. FREEWAY

   Tracking with Stevens' Bentley from the front.

   The black Sikorsky is almost on the Bentley's hood.  Tubbs
   racks the chopper sideways so that Alonzo can see Crockett in
   the copilot seat...

   CLOSER:  CROCKETT

   has his handgun out and is waving Alonzo over to the
   shoulder.  Tubbs keeps the chopper almost blocking Alonzo's
   Bentley.  Alonzo pulls over.  Tubbs wheels around and lands
   on the shoulder.  They approach...

   ALONZO STEVENS

   exits the Bentley and walks toward Crockett and Tubbs.  He
   holds his hand out to keep them at a distance.

   Freeway traffic roars past.  Crockett and Tubbs don't get too
   close, heeding Alonzo's warning...

                        TUBBS
                  (incensed, over traffic
                   noise)
             What the hell did you do?

                        STEVENS
             The Feeb gig was I front a coupla
             undercover, Russian-speakers to
             them.  One's ATF.  And broker the
             deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR
             types...

   Stevens takes a low-resolution E-mailed image from his pocket
   and hands it to Tubbs.  Tubbs looks up, shocked, hands it to
   Crockett.  Stevens' head rotates loosely on his
   shoulders...his mind's elsewhere...



   CROCKETT'S POV:  IMAGE

   Alonzo's wife, Francine, is bound - clothes torn - to a chair
   in a TV room.  On the floor are two young boys bound with
   plastic ties.  Paper bags are over their heads.  Francine's
   eyes are as large as saucers.  Around her neck is a necklace
   of C-4 explosive connected to a detonator.

                        STEVENS (cont'd)
                  (shouts)
             So I gave them up, man!  Gave up
             the Feds!  Gave up everything
             I knew.  Now I got to go home...

                        CROCKETT
             How'd they get onto you?

                        STEVENS
             How do I know?  But it was from the
             get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me
             into them.
                  (beat)
             Sonny, I gotta go...!

                                                  MEANWHILE:

   INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - TRUDY - NIGHT

   and a Miami PD SWAT team crash through the front door.
   Another team through the back.  Trudy in a tactical vest is
   second in with a 12-gauge.  The house is empty.  Gina and
   other detectives hang in the rear.  First SWAT team "clears"
   the living room, dining room.  Second clears the kitchen,
   maid's quarters...

   INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - DOOR TO DEN - NIGHT

   ...last room to clear...center of the house.  SWAT teams
   appear around corners.  Weapons up.  The looks on their faces
   tell us nobody is here...nobody alive...and what they see
   gives even these veterans pause as blood pools around the
   legs of a family and overturned chairs.  Alonzo didn't save
   anyone.

                        TRUDY
                  (after changing channel)
             Hello, Sonny...?

   EXT. FREEWAY - TUBBS

   on police radio listens to a message from Trudy while...

                        STEVENS
                  (to Tubbs)
             I gotta, I gotta go...!

                        TUBBS
             Alonzo...

                        STEVENS
             What...?

                        TUBBS
                  (voice cracks)
             Alonzo, you don't need to go home.

   Now Alonzo knows.

                        STEVENS
             They said they wouldn't hurt them,
             wouldn't hurt them if...

                        TUBBS
             They lied.

                        CROCKETT
             They been known to do that...

   Alonzo Stevens has a strange look in his eyes.  He looks at
   Crockett and Tubbs, as if to say something.  He doesn't.
   Crockett and Tubbs walk towards him, to reach him...to
   console him...

   BUT ALONZO STEVENS

   backs away.  Looks at them sadly.  And before they can stop
   him, he steps out onto the freeway, opens his arms, and
   embraces the front bumper of a 70 m.p.h. 18-wheeler.

   INT. MERCEDES CL-500 - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT

   Grim, silent, race through Miami traffic to the crime scene
   we know is ahead because...

   OVER TUBBS' SHOULDER we see all the lights from two dozen
   emergency vehicles a quarter mile ahead.  Death is not
   procedural or casual, not when it's somebody you know, like
   an informant you worked cases with.  Cell phone rings.

                        TUBBS
             Yeah.

                        CASTILLO (V.O.)
             What's your twenty?

                        TUBBS
             Quarter mile away.  We see the
             lights...

                        CASTILLO (V.O.)
             Turn around.

                        TUBBS
                  (taking cell)
             We know these people...!

                        CASTILLO
             Grieve elsewhere.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. PARKING STRUCTURE, TOP FLOOR - ANGRY MEN - 3 A.M.

   in a concrete space.  We've entered mid-scene.

                        FUJIMA
             We're not certain...

                        CASTILLO
             You said Nazi Low-riders...?

                        FUJIMA
             We're not certain!

                        TUBBS
             C'mon, man!

                        FUJIMA
             We think NLR.  We don't know!
             Alonzo only fronted as a broker for
             our guys to make the meet.  He
             wasn't deep into the crew.

                        CROCKETT
             White gangs...?  It doesn't track.

                        TUBBS
             White gangs is tweakers and a
             crystal meth lab in a trailer park.
             Bounce around the old lady Saturday
             night and get your recidivist ass
             busted back...

                        FUJIMA
             Not anymore.  This is a distribution
             network out of South Florida,
             moving poly-drug loads, crystal
             meth through coke, to Nashville,
             Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And
             computer fraud, identity theft.
             It's like that.

                        CASTILLO
                  (to the point)
             Tell them what you want.

                        FUJIMA
             They knew about Alonzo, before he
             made a move on them.  They had our
             operation.  They've cut into us.

                        CROCKETT
             How?

                        FUJIMA
             We don't know.

                        TUBBS
             Break your encryption?  Hack your e-
             mail?  Employee databases?
             Somebody on the inside?

                        FUJIMA
             We don't know.  And that's the
             point.  Maybe there's a mole.
             Whatever, it's a disaster.  And	
             it's a Joint Interagency Task
             Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S.
             Customs components in on it.  So
             the penetration could be from any
             one agency.  What we do know is I
             have to suspend operations right
             now from undercover work through
             interdictions 'cause I have to
             assume our Operational Security is
             blown.

                        TUBBS
             As in, your ass is dead in the
             water.

                        FUJIMA
             But Miami PD wasn't part of the
             J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said,
             he didn't give you up.

                        CROCKETT
             So what do you want?

                        FUJIMA
             To recruit you.

   Pause.

                        CASTILLO
             ...I didn't want you around the
             crime scene because it's crawling
             with federal law enforcement.  We
             don't know who's straight up, who's
             not...

                        CROCKETT
             Recruit us to do what?

                        FUJIMA
             Get into business with this crew,
             identify them.  Illuminate their
             network.  If you're lucky, discover
             their source, how they penetrated
             us.  We'll indict and take it from
             there...

                        CROCKETT
             How do we do that?  Make a buy?
                  (wry)
             That went well...

                        TUBBS
             Reverse undercover?  WE supply to
             them?

                        FUJIMA
             They got a steady stream of supply.
             So, no...

                        CROCKETT
             From whom...?

                        FUJIMA
             A Colombian producer.  Named
             Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.

                        CROCKETT
             Never heard of him.

                        FUJIMA
             From the North Valle area.  New.
             Low-level, we think.

                        TUBBS
             Aryan brothers are not going to
             change-up suppliers.  So...

                        CROCKETT
             Transpo?  How they bringing the
             loads in...?

                        FUJIMA
             They're not.  They collect in
             Miami.  Montoya, the producer,
             handles deliveries.  That's his
             end, and he varies the routes.  We
             got some FLIR off an AWAC of a
             coupla go-fast boats, on one run,
             that's all.

   Fujima boots up his military-spec laptop to view the FLIR
   video.  Meanwhile...

                        TUBBS
             Track with me, here...
                  (beat)
             They knew the "Russians" were
             undercover Feeb?  They should have
             no-showed.  But, no, these guys
             show anyway, and commit murder upon
             federal officers.  And steal all
             your money...
                  (beat; to Fujima)
             What does that say to you?

                        CROCKETT
                  (speculating)
             It says, "We do not fear you."
                  (to Fujima)
             It says, "Fuck off and die."  It
             says, "We get down for
             recreation..."

   Fujima's Dell laptop glows to life.  Two almost
   indistinguishable boats and their wakes are SEEN.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
             Blow that up...

   Crockett's attention goes to something atypical he spots
   about the wake emerging behind each boat.  He exchanges a
   look with Tubbs.  But they say nothing.

                        TUBBS
                  (to Crockett)
             So?

                        CROCKETT
             We could try to run loads into
             these guys.
                  (to Fujima)
             Run a few loads for Montoya into
             South Florida.  Into this group.

                        FUJIMA
             You need to consider a few issues.

                        CASTILLO
                  (to Crockett + Tubbs)
             ...you'd be operating outside
             territorial United States.  Your	
             badges do not count.  You have no	
             authorization to carry weapons.  If
             you're busted, it could take a long
             time to get you re-patriated.  And	
             there's no backup...	
                  (to Fujima)
             And you will share with them all	
             your intel on Montoya...	

                        FUJIMA
             Sure.

                        CASTILLO
             I mean full disclosure.	

                        FUJIMA
             Of course.  From my side, I don't	
             WANT to know anything about what
             you're doing or how you do it...
                  (to Castillo)
             So let me know if we're on...

   Fujima splits.  Castillo waits until Fujima's car pulls away.

                        CASTILLO
                  (to Tubbs)
             About the Stevens family, I'm
             sorry.  I know you were close to
             them.

                        TUBBS
             I was the kids' godfather.

                        CASTILLO
                  (intuits)
             And...?

                        TUBBS
             "And" what?

                        CASTILLO
             I got to know.  There is never any
             room for "personal"...	

                        CROCKETT
                  (for Tubbs)
             He is fine.  And we know the jokes.
             When it gets vengeful, things get	
             messy.  When they get messy the
             wrong people die...
                  (beat)
             Everybody gets it.

                        CASTILLO
             Good.

                        TUBBS
             And the answer is "yes."
                  (beat)
             Before she met Alonzo, once upon a
             time, a long time ago.
                  (beat)
             You bet it was personal.

   ...and is now compartmentalized in the past.

                        CASTILLO
             Okay.
                  (to Crockett)
             What'd you spot...?

                        CROCKETT
             Three wakes off the back of those
             boats.  Who runs three Sterling
             engines off a deep-V hull?

                        TUBBS
             Sal Maguda.

                        CASTILLO
             He any good?

                        TUBBS
             Oh, yeah...

                        CASTILLO
             So what's gonna persuade Montoya to	
             change off Sal Maguda running his	
             deliveries...?

   It's a rhetorical question.

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. INDIAN RIVER - THERMAL IMAGE OF TWO DEEP V-HULL GO-FAST
   BOATS - NIGHT

   They're two feet out of the water on their dry dock, next to
   a Marine Shed.

   It's an unlikely location because derelict factories, cheap
   apartments, weeds and marine scrap metal are the
   neighborhood.

   EXT. SURVEILLANCE LOCATION - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   and a SWAT team in the weeds across the river.  They include
   SGT. JEAN-LOUIS BASTIDE, a Haitian in dark sweats.  They all
   are in plain clothes.

                        BASTIDE
             Odile, she say they're pregnant...

   We don't know what that means, yet.

                        TUBBS
             Yeah?  Okay.  Only Jean-Louis and I
             do the talking...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MARINE SHED - DOOR - NIGHT

   Both steel doors EXPLODE as if their molecular structure,
   itself, disintegrated from one BLAST of Tubbs M-40 grenade-
   launcher firing a canister of ball bearings like a king-size
   shotgun on steroids as...

   GUARDS

   react, but Crockett draws down on one with an AK-47.  Bastide
   wounds the second GUARD who had drawn down his H & K.  A
   Third Guard begs to live in French Patois.  They own the
   place.  And Crockett sees...

   800 individually-wrapped bricks of North Valle Colombian
   cocaine are on a table.

                        TUBBS
             Comme on dit...
             (Like they said...)

                        JEAN-LOUIS
             Charger et les recoit d'ici...
             (Load 'em up and get out of
             here...)

                        BAD GUY
             You crazy?  Que fais-tu?

                        TUBBS
             Que faisons-nous?  De qu'a-t-il
             l'air, fou!  Nous voulons tous
             votre drugs.
             (What are we doing?  What's it look
             like we're doing, fool?  We are
             stealing all your dope.)

   Suburban crashes through the wreckage of the door and backs
   to the table.  Jean-Louis and SWAT #1 start throwing bricks
   into the back.  Tubbs with Crockett exit.

   EXT. MARINE SHED - DRY DOCK - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   approach the two deep V-hull go-fast boats with three engines
   off the back.  Tubbs cracks the breech of the grenade
   launcher and loads a 40-millimeter shell, while he strolls
   down the dock...

   CROCKETT

   tosses two Willie Peters (white phosphorus grenades) into the
   boats.  Tubbs fires the M-40 at a third boat, which explodes
   flame, followed by...

   TWO CARNATIONS OF WHITE PHOSPHORESCENCE

   destroy the smuggler's Strykers, which we saw in Fujima's
   video.  Crockett + Tubbs have just put Sal Maguda out of
   business.  They walk away and around the side of the shed,
   disregarding the curious citizens of Little Haiti, come to
   watch the fireworks...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MERCEDES CL 600 ON A MIAMI STREET - CROCKETT + TUBBS -
   BRILLIANT DAYLIGHT

   drive.  Crockett reaches into a paper bag full of cell phones
   and grabs one.  He dials up a number, grabs another and hands
   it to Tubbs.

                        CROCKETT
                  (in the phone)
             Hey, Sailor...
                  (pause)
             Yeah, I'm good.
                  (beat)
             Got a hole in the
             calendar...looking to charge up the
             cash flow.
                  (waits)
             Yeah, later.

   Crockett struck out.  While...

                        TUBBS
                  (into phone)
             Hey, Nicholas, my ace.  Wha's up?

                        NICHOLAS (V.O.)
             You know.  Same old...

                        TUBBS
                  (into phone)
             We got idle all of an instant.  You
             got something from somewhere that's
             got to go someplace, somewhen,
             which is not too distantly in the
             future...?

   INT. COLLINS AVENUE CONDO - NICHOLAS - DAY

   ...the guy with the white hair.

                        NICHOLAS
             It is fortuitous that you called...

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. LA PERLA DISTRICT OF SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO - TWILIGHT

   Corrosion and decay.  People look coldly at us.  Malevolence
   and malefaction on every corner.  No one's picked up the
   garbage for a month.  Poverty in the Caribbean half-light...

   CROCKETT & TUBBS

   cross the street to CAMERA from their rental car.  The La
   Perla section was a 16th Century haven for pirates.  It's had
   little civic improvements in 400 years.

   They enter a nightclub - shabby neon.

   INT. NIGHTCLUB - CROCKETT + TUBBS - TWILIGHT

   There are no customers.  They're cautious.  Men stop them
   and frisk them.  They expected that.

                        CROCKETT
             We're from Nicholas to meet José...

   They're waved to the rear.  They start towards a back table.
   A small group of people wait...

   OVER CROCKETT + TUBBS APPROACHING:  JOSÉ "COCHI LOCO" YERO

   He's a former right-wing Colombian paramilitary from the
   North Valle near the Pacific coast.  He runs operations,
   communications and security.  He has cold eyes and a corpulent
   face.  He's notorious for using torture to ferret-out
   informants.  Right now he watches these two Americans
   approach.  Security people are on either side of him.

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (extends hand)
             José...

                        CROCKETT
             Sonny Burnett...this is my partner,
             Rico.

                        JOSÉ YERO
             Sit.

   As Crockett sits, he notices that at a table a few to the
   side is a woman.  This is ISABELLA.  Behind glasses, she
   seems immobile, filled with intelligence, well-dressed in
   subdued Tom Ford and staring at him.  Reading him.  Crockett
   holds the look that extra beat and turns back to business...

                        CROCKETT
                  (to Security)
             Dos café.

   He's security, not a fucking waiter.  But Yero nods.
   Security fetches coffee, anyway.

                        TUBBS
             So lay it out, my brother...

                        JOSÉ YERO
             Nicholas said you okay.  That's
             nice.  But how I know if you any	
             good?

                        CROCKETT
             What...?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             Who you run loads for?  Cause other	
             than Nicholas, you knows you?

   Tubbs looks at Crockett.  They thought it was a done deal.	

                        CROCKETT
                  (dark)	
             My mommy and daddy know me.

   Isabella tilts her head imperceptibly.

                        TUBBS
             And we didn't come down here to	
             audition.  Business auditions for	
             us...
                  (beat)
             ...and know who we are and know	
             they want their load run by us	
             before Nicholas calls.

                        CROCKETT
             That way we do not waste AvGas or
             our motherfucking time.

   Yero's security reacts to the tone and raises weapons.  A few
   start up out of their chair as...

   ZITO + SWITEK

   appear at the door, SMGs from shoulder straps.  Zito flips a
   D14 hand grenade which Crockett snatches out of the air,
   pulls the pin and slams on the table.  Everyone FREEZES.

   Only Crockett's hand pressure restrains the clip.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
                  (goes right up in Yero's
                   face)
             You want to "know" shit?  Who the	
             fuck are you?  You got a side deal	
             with U.S. Customs to open up the	
             coast in a few spots...in exchange
             you flip them some gringo runners?
             Like us...?

                        TUBBS
             You wearing a wire?	

   Tubbs rips open Yero's shirt.

                        CROCKETT
             Or DEA?  The Feeb?	

   Yero's shirt...open to the waist.  No wire.  Yero's furious.

   Yero's people have weapons pointed their way.  They outnumber
   Switek and Zito.  Slack's taken up on triggers.  It's on the
   edge.  And the edge is overloaded.  Tubbs reads that, warns
   Yero...

                        TUBBS
             People gonna walk into this place
             and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some	
             crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild!	
             Is that a Jackson Pollack?"

                        CROCKETT
             "No, viejo.  That was José Yero,
             splattered all over his
             motherfucking wall."

                        TUBBS
             So we can close each other's eyes
             right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.
                  (pause)
             But, then, nobody makes any
             money...	

   Yero gestures his security to calm down....one notch.
   Crockett and Tubbs still hold the grenades.

   Then Crockett opens his shirt.  No wires.  So does Tubbs.	

   Pause.

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (flat)
             Equipment?

                        TUBBS
             Slow and low, Adam A-500s...
                  (Yero looks quizzical)
             ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400
             nautical-mile range, thousand ki
             payload...all the way to Caravels
             and 727's from a source country to
             a transshipment point.  Small
             freighters.  We've done
             containers...

                        CROCKETT
             And specialize in very fast go-fast
             boats for coastal runs.

                        TUBBS
             What kind of weight?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             We don't talk weight.  We talk
             logistics.

   Isabella sits, watching this.  She drinks her coffee.

                        JOSÉ YERO (cont'd)
             You get longs and lats for the
             pickup.  Open ocean.  You run it
             in.  On shore, our people receive
             the loads.

                        CROCKETT
                  (interrupts)
             The people on shore who handle a
             load we run are our people, not your	
             people.  No tweakers, dopers, first-	
             timers we don't know.  They didn't
             do time with us, they ain't doing
             crime with us.	

                        TUBBS	
             What you get from us is a date.  A
             place.  "In the parking lot of a
             Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At
             such-and-such time, an eighteen-	
             wheeler will be there.  Keys in the
             ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick	
             it up.  And you drive it...
                  (waves his left hand)
             ...away.

                        CROCKETT	
             Money thing is done in advance in	
             places where there are no guns.	                        
             Because when money and guns get	
             together, there is violence...

                        JOSÉ YERO
             You afraid of violence?

                        CROCKETT	
             I am not John Wayne.  There is no	
             "S" on his chest.  We get down if	
             the play calls for it.  But we are
             into business and making money.	

                        TUBBS	
             And violence is extra.  And
             expensive.  So how much weight you
             looking to move?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             Nothing.  'Cause how you do	
             delivery on the beach, I don't
             like.  Maybe this does not work.

                        CROCKETT
             Then it don't work.

                        TUBBS
             What happened to the last
             transporter you had?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             What do you care?

                        TUBBS
                  (to Crockett)
             Do we need this...?

                        CROCKETT
                  (rises)
             Red light, green light, José?

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (doesn't answer, leans
                   back)
             I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That
             means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I
             enforce security and get people to	
             tell me what I need to know.  That	
             part of what I do, you never want	
             to find out about.
                  (pause)
             Other people will negotiate the	
             money and go or not go.  Not me...

                        TUBBS
             Then what were we talking to you
             for?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             I had to lay eyes on you.

                        CROCKETT
             And...?

   Isabella watches Crockett...

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (to Tubbs)
             You seem okay.
                  (to Tubbs re: Crockett)
             But him?  I don't like... how he	
             looks...

   Everything goes from tense to lethal.  Has Yero made them?

                        TUBBS
             What do I care what you think about
             how he looks?  You wanna fuck my	
             partner or do business?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             Wait by the phone.
                  (pause)
             You get a call.  Or maybe you
             don't.  Until then, piss off back
             to where you come from...

   Crockett flips the hand grenade and catches it with his left
   hand...and he drops it in front of José Yero.  It spins on
   the table.  He had reinserted the pin.  And they back out.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MIAMI SAFE HOUSE - TUBBS IN THE SHOWER - NIGHT

   Contemplative.  Offscreen a door opens.  Entering is Gina
   Calabrese.  She's naked.  She washes his back.  She dumps too
   much shampoo on his head.  He tries to clear it from his
   eyes.  Laughs.  They start to make love under the water, in
   the steam, through the misted glass, offscreen we hear an
   engine rumble...

   CLOSER:  GINA

   Somebody's coming.

                        TUBBS
             ...Sonny can wait.

   Tubbs and Gina are not random lovers, they're in love.  The
   look in her eyes, the openness is pure femininity behind the
   Bronx presentation.  She smiles, touches the side of his
   face.

   EXT. SAFE HOUSE, ON THE INDIAN RIVER - CROCKETT - NIGHT

   ties up a 75' Sun Seeker.  It looks like a 38' deep-V
   offshore racer on growth hormones.  Crockett's alone, as dusk
   fades over the '60's ranch house on the river.  It's under
   tropical trees, with one strip of white neon utility lighting
   outlining the flat eave.

   INT. SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - CROCKETT

   let himself in.  He's at a kitchen stool at the counter when
   Tubbs enters in sweats.

                        TUBBS
             Anything?

                        CROCKETT
             Nothing.

   Gina enters in a robe...

                        GINA
                  (beat)
             "Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."

                        CROCKETT
             Hi, Gina.
                  (putting shopping bag on
                   table)
             This is from Frick and Frack.
             Trudy?

                        TUBBS
                  (re:  bag)
             What do we got?

   Crockett pulls out three overly-large cell phones...

                        CROCKETT
             Satellite.  New encryption.
             Supposedly sharper than the G...
                  (to Gina)
             How good's our background?

   Tubbs and Crockett look at the Mac screen as Gina boots it
   up.  Gina's fingers tap dance on the keyboard.

                        GINA
             You're so not the PD, if you got
             busted on a DUI, you're in serious
             trouble...you're bad men back to
             grammar school.
                  (to Tubbs)
             San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.
                  (to Crockett)
             Marine Corps.  Statesville.
             Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked
             up.  Now you're too smart and too
             fast to get jacked again...

                        CROCKETT
             How will it stand up?

                        GINA
             If they ran the rental car or lease
             on this place...even if it's EPIC
             database in El Paso...they'd have
             to work through the layers of
             bullshit three weeks deep.  Then
             they'd find your deeper, hidden
             criminal selves...

   INT. LIVING ROOM - BAD 3 AM TELEVISION - LATER

   No one's watching it.

   INT. BEDROOM - GINA

   asleep.  Tubbs' eyes are wide open, staring...

   INT. SECOND BEDROOM - ECU:  PAGER

   lights up.  Beeps.  Crockett's hand grabs it.  It's the
   summons from José Yero.

   INT. KITCHEN - GINA - PRE-DAWN

                        GINA
                  (Lazily)
             What am I supposed to do after I
             get my nails and hair done...?

                        TUBBS
             Reality TV and stay by the phone.	
             That's what all wives-in-crime
             do...

   He leans over and kisses her.  She holds firmly the back of
   his neck and looks into his eyes.

                        GINA
             Be...careful...  You hear me?

   He winks at her in assurance and he's gone.  Her lazy smile
   drops off.  "Careful"...she's not so sure he will be...

   INT. LEAR 55 JET - TUBBS PILOTS

   Crockett in the copilot seat.  Switek and Zito are in the
   back, barely awake.  Zito hands out coffee.  Switek's
   stashing weapons behind the fuselage upholstery.  Tubbs is
   clearing US air space as we...

   EXT. SKY - AERIAL:  LEAR JET

   rockets through cumulonimbus against a black sky up to 35,000
   feet.

   EXT. PORT-AU-PRINCE AIRPORT, RUNWAY - LEAR JET - DAWN

   aviation facility...

   CLOSER:  HATCH

   opens.  Switek and Zito emerge to rental cars with two car-
   rental clerks waiting...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. PORT-AU-PRINCE HOTEL ROOM - DOOR - DAY

   Crockett and Tubbs make a careful entry.  Hands on weapons,
   carrying bags...

                        CROCKETT
             What do we got?

                        TUBBS
             Five minutes...

   We see TRADECRAFT.  They clear the room.  They check for bugs
   and external surveillance.  They pull curtains.  Tubbs from a
   bag pulls a scanner.  Under the two beds.  Behind the
   picture.  The lamp.  The telephone.  Meanwhile...

   CROCKETT

   "traps" the room to reveal if it had been searched while they
   were gone.  He aligns the suitcase perfectly parallel on the
   bench.  A matchstick goes against the closed closet door.  A
   ballpoint pen is leaned against the telephone.

                        TUBBS (cont'd)
             ...show time.

   From his bag Tubbs pulls a Smith & Wesson J-frame hammerless
   in .357 Magnum.  He holsters this on his ankle.  A Remington
   780 shotgun with pistol grip, sawed-off to a 12-inch barrel
   gets slung on a bungee-cord shoulder strap under his right
   arm.  .9mm under his shirt in his waistband and two spare
   magazines clipped to his belt.

   CROCKETT

   loads a .45 "race" gun with rounded sights and a magna-ported
   barrel, cross-drawn, and a blunt .45 Para-Ordnance in the
   small of his back.  They're ready.

   INT. CORRIDOR - THEIR DOOR

   opens.  Crockett "traps" that door, too, with a small piece
   of tape.

   CROCKETT + TUBBS

   All of it tells us that where they are and where they're
   going is a high wire act without a net.  No backup.  Their
   badges don't work.  There is no law; there is no order.  They
   are in a state of nature where people get killed for their
   shoes.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

   EXT. PORT-AU-PRINCE CEMETERY (HAITI) - CROCKETT + TUBBS -
   LATE AFTERNOON

   wait.  Shadows on white limestone monuments.  Bird songs.

   They wait.  And wait.  And nothing happens.

                        TUBBS
             They watching us watching them
             watching us waiting for them?  Or
             what?

                        CROCKETT
             Who knows...

   Still apprehensive, concluding they're victims of a "no-
   show"...

                        TUBBS
             That's it.

   They split.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - CROCKETT + TUBBS -
   TWILIGHT

   approach their door.  Crockett stops.  The tape "trap" is
   torn.  Weapons appear in their hands.  Someone's been here.

   INT. HOTEL ROOM - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   enter stealthily.  Then, they relax.  They need not have
   bothered being so careful about detecting a clandestine
   surveillance.

   OVER CROCKETT + TUBBS

   The room is overtly destroyed.  Not one piece of furniture is
   unbroken.  Walls have been opened.  Pictures ripped.
   Curtains.  Their stuff's strewn all over.  And, then...

   DOORS CRASH

   in.  HAITIAN PARAMILITARY in soccer jerseys and shorts with
   assault rifles...

   BEDROOM DOORWAY - FOUR MORE PARAMILITARY

   AK's are aimed at Crockett and Tubbs' heads.  Crockett's .45
   and his Para-Ordnance are in each hand.  Tubbs' shotgun is
   aimed at the front door, his .9mm at the men streaming in the
   windows.  Frozen moment.  A woman's voice...

                        ISABELLA (O.S.)
                  (to Crockett)
             Put your guns on the table...
                  (enters, sits)
             If we wanted you dead, you would no
             longer be drawing breath in Miami.
             We wouldn't have brought you all
             the way here.

                        CROCKETT
             Really?  So, what is this, a party?

   Crockett + Tubbs put down their weapons.

                        TUBBS
             We'll have room service wipe up the
             furniture...and bring drinks.

   Isabella says something in French.  The Cops ease-up.
   Isabella's personal security frisks Crockett + Tubbs and
   remain.  Paramilitary leave.

                        CROCKETT
             Glad we came.  This place is a lot
             of fun if you're Doctors Without
             Borders.  So...?

   Isabella takes off her glasses.  She's Afro-Cuban.

                        ISABELLA
             I run down the numbers.  Nothing is
             very negotiable.  Small loads?  We
             pay three thousand a ki.
             We pay your fuel costs up front
             plus ten percent.  The next ten
             percent on U.S. landfall.

                        TUBBS
             Define small.

                        ISABELLA
             Two, three thousand a ki.
             Two thousand ki's, your end is
             $6,000,000.
                  (beat)
             Complex transshipments or dealing
             with containers, these have front-
             loaded costs we pickup.
                  (beat)
             For this kind of weight, the
             balance of 80% is when our buyer
             picks up the load.
                  (beat)
             Transactions are offshore.  Dollars
             or euros.  Secure internet
             transfers.  We have lists of Cayman
             and Isle of Man banks infiltrated
             by IRS, to be avoided...
                  (beat)
             No transactions of cash or other
             banking instruments take place on
             U.S. soil...

             That's the deal.

                        CROCKETT
             I thought we had to meet the Man.

                        ISABELLA
             You do.

                        CROCKETT
             When?

                        ISABELLA
             Right now.

   As she leaves...

   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT

   in the back seat on a rural road.  Isabella is not with them.
   One of her Russians is.  In the front seat, his SMG is ready;
   his eyes never leave Crockett and Tubbs.

   EXT. ROAD - CARAVAN

   A military Hummer in the front carries Isabella with her
   security.  Behind is a crew cab with bench seats loaded with
   Haitian paramilitary.

   INT. MERCEDES - TUBBS

   They approach a town.  He nudges Crockett.  A police
   roadblock's ahead.

   CROCKETT

   has seen something else.  He indicates the pager on his
   waist.

   TUBBS' POV:  PAGER - NO SIGNAL

   That's what's surprising.  Tubbs pulls his cell phone.
   Meanwhile, they're slowing down for the police roadblock.
   Crockett gets tense...

   TUBBS

   watches.  His cell's SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR steps down to
   zero.

   EXT. POLICE ROADBLOCK - COPS

   stop the caravan.  Is this turning bad?

   INT. CAR - CROCKETT

   alarmed.

   EXT. ROADBLOCK - HAITIAN COPS

   check under the vehicles with mirrors.  See all the weapons.
   Salute.  Usher the convoy past.

   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   exchange a look.  Then they get it.  The cops work as
   security for the narcotrafficker.  The caravan advances
   towards a major intersection.  This one is blocked-off by
   Haitian military.

   EXT. SECOND CHECKPOINT - CAR DOOR

   is snatched open.  Haitian soldiers search Crockett and
   Tubbs.  They defer to the Russian-speaking security.
   Mercedes pulls forward...

   CROCKETT

   eyes his pager; Tubbs his cell phone: no signal in an urban
   area?  Blocking signal traffic is something the CIA does over
   Baghdad.  It's not supposed to be happening in Haiti on a
   dope deal.

   CROCKETT + TUBBS

   SEE a third circle of security approach.

   PRIVATE-SECTOR TYPES IN BUSINESS SUITS

   carrying automatic weapons, some more casually dressed, some
   with night-vision goggles.  The vehicles stop.

   EXT. TOWN SQUARE

   Crockett and Tubbs are directed to get out.  They're pushed
   around and searched.  A working class Glaswegion Scot, a
   couple of 5'10" Brits are off to the side with short hair and
   shoulders that are too deep and faces like Rugby players (ex-
   SAS).  Russians are ex-KGB.  Languages overheard:  smatterings
   of Russian, Hebrew and English.  Crockett and Tubbs look at
   each other:  they get it.  This is the cream of private
   sector security.  And it says top dollar infrastructure.

   THEY + WE SEE:  EXT. TOWN SQUARE

   Four avenues lead in.  Each avenue is blocked.  The square is
   closed down to vehicles and pedestrians.  Locals have
   disappeared.  In the center of the square are FOUR MATCHING
   BLACK SUBURBANS.

   CROCKETT

   gestures to Tubbs to look up.  They see...

   ROOFTOPS:  TWO-MAN TEAMS - SNIPER + SPOTTER

   with night-vision goggles...

   CROCKETT + TUBBS

   are clean.

   CROCKETT, TUBBS + ISABELLA

   cross through a no-man's land.  It feels like being in the
   open in Kosovo.

   TUBBS

   checks out the first Suburban's uplink satellite dish on a
   hydraulic mast.  The rear's converted into computer equipment
   sitting in ruggedized racks...

   INT. SECOND SUBURBAN - WIDE

   Doors open.  The interior has been converted into a
   luxurious, limo-like office with swivel seats.  Isabella
   followed by Crockett and Tubbs enter.  It's occupied by
   ARCHANGEL DE JESUS MONTOYA-LONDONO.  He's not flashy.  He has
   smooth skin, slightly opalescent, black eyes.  His right arm
   is normal length, but shriveled.

                        MONTOYA
             Please take that seat on the
             side...

                        TUBBS
             Thank you.

                        MONTOYA
                  (polite, friendly)
             Excuse me because I am very busy
             and have many things to do, so this
             will be brief.  Yes?
                  (beat; not waiting)
             We will try you on a "run."  One.
             To build trust.  We do a thousand
             kis.  In all matters, when you work
             for us, you must do exactly what
             you say you will do.
                  (beat)
             In this business with me, if you
             say you will do a thing, you must
             do exactly that thing.
                  (beat)
             Then?  You will prosper beyond your
             dreams and you can live in Miami in
             millionaire style.
                  (beat)
             If you are arrested, there will be
             lawyers made available to you in
             the United States.  You will use
             them.  Anything you need, you will
             be provided by me.  It cost you
             nothing.  You will contact and work
             through José Yero on logistics and
             communications.  To do with money,
             you will work through my wife,
             Isabella...

   Crockett notices that Montoya lightly holds her hand.  It's
   confident.  And he sees the slight smile on Isabella's face
   as she watches he and Tubbs...

                        MONTOYA (cont'd)
             More than I, in finance and
             business, she is very dangerous.  I
             look forward to our doing work
             together.  Whether we do or not, it
             is unlikely we will meet again.  So
             I extend my best wishes to your
             families...
                  (to Tubbs)
             Particularly to your beautiful
             wife.
                  (beat)
             Thank you for making this long trip
             to see me...

   Dismissed, they exit.

   EXT. TOWN SQUARE - EXTREMELY CLOSE:  TUBBS

   Subterranean alarms are going off.  Tubbs finds himself in
   this small city, occupied by narcotraffickers and their
   security in the middle of nowhere.  Urgency agitates Tubbs.
   He controls it...

   CROCKETT

   in the town square, now, too.  But Isabella stayed inside
   Montoya's Suburban.  Now, she lowers her window.

   ROADBLOCKS

   break up.  Montoya's Suburbans pull out.  The security cordon
   deforms.  It all disappears around them.  It leaves only the
   Mercedes, a driver, and Crockett and Tubbs...

   CLOSER:  CROCKETT

   looks after the caravan.

   CROCKETT'S POV:  ISABELLA'S EYES

   in the side-view mirror on the passenger side.  She is
   looking at him.

   CROCKETT

   holds that look.

   ISABELLA'S EYES IN THE MIRROR

   holds his.

   CROCKETT

   Sound deadens.  His attention is on the woman in the
   mirror...until it's broken by Tubbs' attention to his cell
   phone.

   TUBBS' CELL PHONE

   Signal strength returns.  Tubbs punches in numbers.

                        TUBBS
                  (low)
             ...who did we just meet?

   He waits.  A phone rings.  It's picked up by Gina.

                        GINA (O.S.)
             Hello...?

   Tubbs is relieved...

                        TUBBS
             You okay?

                        GINA
             Yeah.

             You sure?

                        GINA
             Yes.  What's up?

                        TUBBS
             Nothing.  Calling to say hi...
             What's up with you?

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

   INT. SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - GINA

                        GINA
             Bored.

   To Tubbs, that's good news.

                        TUBBS
             Okay...see you soon.

                        GINA
             ...and thanks for the flowers.

   EXT. HAITIAN TOWN SQUARE - TUBBS

                        TUBBS
             What flowers?

                        GINA
             The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred
             dollars worth of roses...yellow.

   Pause.

                        TUBBS
             There a note?

   Pause.

                        GINA
             You mean with the flowers...?

                        TUBBS
             What's it say?

                        GINA
             "Salutations from the south..."

   A deep chill.

                        GINA (cont'd)
             I...I thought it was from you.
   
   And, now, she gets it.  Gina is in the kitchen.  Alone, in
   their secret safe-house location.  She and Tubbs have nothing
   to say.  He looks to Crockett.  The message from Montoya-
   Londono is clear:  I know you.  I can reach out and locate
   you our yours.  Anytime.  YOU ARE NOT SAFE.

                        TUBBS
             We're on our way...

             So why don't you...meet the
             plane...

   We sense this is code.  It means get the fuck out of there
   right now!

                        GINA
                  (cool)
             Okay.

                        TUBBS
             Good idea.
                  (beat)
             We'll grab a bite.

   Gina ends the call, drops to the floor to the wall, kills the
   lights, holds her Sig .9mm at her side as she moves deeper
   into the interior...

   INT. CUBAN CAFE ON CALLE OCHO, MIAMI - TUBBS + GINA - 4 AM

   Close on their two faces.  He's holding her hand under the
   table.  The noise of the surrounding crowd is a ROAR.  That's
   the idea.  They want their words buried under noise...

   PAST GINA:  CROCKETT

   discreetly at the door, watching the street.  Trudy, Switek
   and Zito are at adjacent tables.

                        GINA
             ...the lease, the phones, the
             cars...layers of false ident.
             Would take the FBI weeks.  How long
             did it take them?  Three hours?
             Four?
                  (re:  the note)
             This means, "We can reach out and
             touch somebody."  Like Bad
             Teleflora.

             they'll find is more cover...
             Trust what you built.  It's
             quality, girl.  We're cool...

                  (leans in; holds his hand
                   tighter)
             ...you are trying to reassure me
             because you know when people get
             anxious, they make mistakes.
             You're worried about me.  Do not
             be.
                  (into his eyes)
             I am careful.  I am cool.  I got
             Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry
             about you.  Because you are the
             ones who are in denied territory,
             not me.  If your focus is on me,
             you'll miss something coming at
             you.  That's how people slip up.
             Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything
             happened.  You worry about you.
             You and Sonny...are in the
             dangerous place.  I'm fine...

   Gina leans back in her chair.  Their eyes still connect
   across the distance between them.  Their hands still touch.

                        GINA (cont'd)
                  (loud)
             Fuck 'em.  They sent us some
             flowers.  Big deal.  Thanks for the
             flowers...

   Gina Calabrese shrugs.  Tubbs laughs, and we are...

   INT. SAFE HOUSE - BEDROOM - 4 AM

   Low music.  Dark shadows.  Half-light washes the walls from
   passing headlights.  Tubbs are Gina are naked.  It's the
   lovemaking of a man and a woman when they hold precious the
   moments they have because they know that in these moments
   they are safe.  And that the present is fleeting.  And they
   know their time together is about luck.  Because life is
   short.  Departure is imminent.  Nothing lives forever.  It's
   in their faces and their eyes...

   INT. SHACK (GUAJIRA PENINSULA, COLOMBIA) - CROCKETT - DAWN

   A lantern lights his face.  The night is soft.  Crockett's
   with a couple of campesinos, playing poker and drinking beer.

   Whoever's shack this is, is a Tupac Shakur freak.  His image
   is on all the walls.  A diesel truck starts and pulls away
   outside.

   EXT. LANDING STRIP - TUBBS - NIGHT

   checking the cargo tie-downs inside an A-500 Adam aircraft.
   He's sweating.  His shirt's off.  The cargo is ten black
   plastic-wrapped and taped bundles.  Like any good pilot,
   Tubbs trusts nobody but himself to tie-down the load.  The
   rear seats are removed.  There's a plastic bladder holding a
   reserve of 50 gallons of AvGas.

   INT. SHACK - CROCKETT

   wins.  The girls shriek.  Crockett pushes the money towards
   the Campesinos.  They refuse.  Crockett insists.  One will	
   only accept the money if Crockett accepts his Randall hunting
   knife.  He does.  Tubbs is in the doorway.

                        CROCKETT
             We set.

   Crockett kisses the girls, gracious about the gift.  Tubbs
   looks out into the night.

                        TUBBS
             To the limit.

                        CROCKETT
             You worried about the tree line, US
             Customs AWACS, or something else on
             your mind?

                        TUBBS
             Like...?

                        CROCKETT
             Gina in the Miami pad.
                  (no answer)
             You gonna give me phony denials?

                        TUBBS
             No.
                  (beat)
             You gonna give me phony
             reassurances?

                        CROCKETT
             No.

                        TUBBS
             Good.  So let's go...

   They head toward the strange-looking plane.  It's a single
   fuselage with two propellers...one at the nose, one at the
   tail.  Off the wings are two booms that connect to a rear
   wing.  It's a Burt Rutan aircraft design.

   There is neither metal nor exposed exhausts for radar or IF
   to spot.  It does 200 knots at 22,000 feet.  It'll fly,
   forever, 1,000 kilos of flake worth $23 million, and the
   total air weight is less than two Bentleys.  It's the
   smuggler's dream airplane.

   EXT. LANDING STRIP - END OF RUNWAY - A-500 ADAMS

   heads for the tree-line.  It will not make it.  At the last
   moment, Tubbs pulls back the stick and the plane lofts over
   the trees, clipping the tops...

   INT. A-500 - CROCKETT

   throws a look sideways at Tubbs.

   EXT. SKY - A-500

   airborne over the Caribbean, heading north...

                        CROCKETT (O.S.)
                  (into radio)
             Transglobal Airlines flight zero-
             zero-zero...is in the air...

                        ZITO (V.O.)
             Roger that.

   INT. A-500 - CROCKETT - MUCH LATER

   is dozing.  A signal.

   Tubbs points up and to the right.  Crockett wakes, looks.  An
   Aero Commander Turbo Twin is paralleling the A-500's course.
   Now, it slides over them...almost into a collision.  It sits
   right over the A-500, separated by only 75 feet.

   INT. OPA-LOCKA AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL - TRAFFIC CONTROLLER - DAY

   handling a myriad of flights, reacts.  On his radar he sees
   next to the image of the Aero Commander, a ghost image....

                        AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
             Eleven-ten, Sierra, do you have a
             visual on another aircraft...?

                        AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
             I've got an Aero Commander coming
             in on a two-seventy-nine heading,
             but I had a double image...like
             there's another plane there, now
             I'm only picking up on one.  What
             do you read?

   INT. US CUSTOMS AWAC - RADAR OFFICER

                        RADAR OFFICER
             Let me see...

   His FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) picks up Switek and
   Zito's Air Commander.  He flips through all the different
   modalities of detection, including thermography, for anything
   else suspicious in the airspace...

                  (into mic)
             Too many Mai Tais at lunch...
             You're seeing double.  One blip.
             One plane.

   EXT. SKY - SIDE SHOT:  THE AERO COMMANDER LIKE A PANCAKE ON
   TOP OF THE A-500 RIGHT BELOW IT

   We get the joke.  The A-500 with its stealthiness under the
   Aero Commander together like a single footprint.

   AERIAL ANGLE:  TWO PLANES

   piggybacked, enter US airspace and cross the coastline into
   Florida.

   From underneath, the Aero Commander sweeps to the right on
   approach as Tubbs radically dives for the trees, hugging the
   contour at 220 knots at 150 feet...having snuck this plane
   and its load into the United States of America.

             Heads up...

   ESCALADE

   Lights off.  Cruises through the parking lot past the U-Haul-
   It to the other side and disappears.

                        TUBBS (cont'd)
             That's slick:  Neptune's Escalade's
             worth more than the real estate.
             But no one's supposed to notice his
             drive-by?

                        CROCKETT
             Here's another incognito genius...

   ANOTHER ANGLE:  MALIBU SS

   cruises the other end of the parking lot.  The Escalade
   returns.  All's clear.  Both converge around the U-Haul-It
   truck.  Out of the Escalade steps NEPTUNE - 6'4", narrow-
   shouldered and bald.  From the Malibu and back of the
   Escalade, Four more Haitian ZO POUNDERS with handguns,
   shotguns and shades...

   NEPTUNE

   pops the lock on the U-Haul-It with a crowbar.  He rolls up
   the door expecting millions worth of cocaine.  Instead he
   comes face to face with the barrel of a 12-gauge...

                        TRUDY
             April Fool, motherfucker.

   Trudy whips the butt end of the shotgun around, caving in
   Neptune's cheekbone and nose...

   WIDER - NEPTUNE

   goes down for the count.  Switek - under the truck - rolls
   out.  Crockett, Tubbs with shotguns, Jean-Louis and Zito with
   CAR-15s emerge from the perimeter with bright lights on
   shouting for the Haitians to freeze...

                  (to one)
             Et vous, mo-fo!

   A 250-lb. ZO POUNDER brings up his weapon.  Crockett BLOWS
   the guy's legs out from under him.  Zito disarms him.  The
   other two are disarmed.

   NEPTUNE

   is rolled over by Crockett.  He plastic-ties his wrists and
   feet.  Others are manhandled...

             Get the fuck in the truck...!

   Zo Pounders, plastic-tied, are thrown into the truck with the
   thousand kilos of cocaine.  But not Neptune.  The gate is

   DOPE

   Carefully stacked in the living room are the PLASTIC-WRAPPED
   BRICKS OF COCAINE THAT CROCKETT AND TUBBS STOLE FROM SAL
   MAGUDA'S WAREHOUSE WHEN THEY BLEW UP HIS BOATS.

   Hog-tied and bleeding all over his clothes, in the corner is
   Neptune.  His mouth is taped.  He's shaking his

             sec's got a leak?  Yours?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             What'd Neptune tell you?

                        CROCKETT
             He didn't.  Interrogation's not in
             our skill set.
                  (beat)
             So c'mon, what suspicions have you
             master-minded off these
             associations?

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (whispers in Spanish to
                   Isabella)
             Here's what this is...ask how much
             they want to turn back to us our
             load...

   Yero's certain about their motive.

                        ISABELLA
             We want it back.

                        CROCKETT
             Okay.

                        ISABELLA
             What's the recovery?  How much are
             you looking for?

                        TUBBS
                  (to Crockett)
             How much we looking for?

                        CROCKETT
             Nothing.

                        ISABELLA
             What's "nothing"?

                        CROCKETT
             Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."

                        TUBBS
             And as an investment in the
             future...

                        ISABELLA
                  (takes off her glasses and
                   looks at Crockett)
             "Future" of...?

                        CROCKETT
             A fine...business...relationship...

   She holds Crockett's look...as she did before.

                        TUBBS
             It's yours cause what's yours, is
             yours.  And what's ours is ours...
                  (to Yero)
             ...like the second ten-percent,
             which is now due, Yero, my ace.

   Isabella gestures.  Yero kicks across the floor a cardboard
   box full of money.  Tubbs glances inside.  Doesn't count it.

                        TUBBS (cont'd)
             What's up next?  Or is this a one-
             time deal?

   Isabella decides.

                        ISABELLA
                  (to Yero)
             Give them the shipment on the
             seventeenth...

   Yero doesn't like it.  She gestures "do it."

                        TUBBS
             Conveyance?

                        ISABELLA
             Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.

   And she starts to leave...and sensing Crockett's gotten up
   and follows her.  Meanwhile

                        TUBBS
                  (to Yero)
             Lay it out...

   And Crockett, close behind Isabella, now...

                        CROCKETT
                  (low)
             There is one thing you can do for
             me in recognition of the death-
             defying risks we took to recover
             your product...

                        ISABELLA
                  (low)
             And what is that?

   This is the wife of narcotrafficker Archangel de Jesus
   Montoya-Londono.

                        CROCKETT
             Let me buy you a drink.

   Isabella pauses.  Crockett may get killed right now.  They're
   near the open doors to the patio.

                        ISABELLA
                  (low)
             What do you like to drink?

                        CROCKETT
                  (low)
             I'm a fiend for mojitas.

   Isabella looks over at Crockett's boat.  Back to Crockett...

                        ISABELLA
                  (low)
             How fast does that go?

                        CROCKETT
             It goes very fast.

                        ISABELLA
             Show me...?

   Isabella and Crockett head outside towards the dock, Tubbs
   overtakes...

                        TUBBS
             Can I talk to you for a second,
             partner...?

   They step aside.

                        TUBBS (cont'd)
                  (low, re:  Isabella)
             Wha's up...?

                        CROCKETT
                  (low)
             I know what I'm doing.

   And he leaves to help Isabella board.  Switek unties and
   pushes off the boat.  Looking out the window at them is José
   Yero, as perplexed as Tubbs, who covers...

                        TUBBS
             ...secure satellite comms.
             encrypted e-mail, the longs and
             lats for the transshipment
             point...all that?  It's all cool.
             But I need a vector, not a
             location.  'Cause ships move.
             That's why they call them ships.
             Ship stops?  It's trying to be an
             apartment building.  At sea that
             attracts attention.  That's bad...

   Meanwhile...

   INT. STRYKER, CABIN - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   pulling away from the docks at 12 knots, repressing the
   thunder of the 2,700-horsepower engines.  Crockett leaves the
   canopy slid back.  They're open to the air.  He gives
   Isabella headsets so they can talk over the roar.  The wind
   starts to move her hair.  She's not sure how to put on the
   headset.

   Crockett lets the boat rock over the swells while he arranges
   her headset around her ears.  His fingers brush her hair,
   touch her skin...

   It was not intentional.  But the look in Crockett's eyes is
   as if a small voltage passed through him.

   He plugs her headset into the dash, regains the wheel, shoves
   the throttles forward and...

   EXT. OPEN OCEAN - "BORN TO WIN"

   cuts and then leaps over swells.  In seven seconds they're
   doing over 70 knots.  And Crockett holds it there as...

   ISABELLA

   The wind whips her hair behind her, now.  The two are small
   against the smooth 50' long hull.  Crockett hands her
   wraparound shades for her eyes.  She doesn't want them...

                        CROCKETT
                  (through headset)
             So where's the best place for
             mojitas?

                        ISABELLA
             Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the only
             place for mojitas...

                        CROCKETT
             Where's that?

                        ISABELLA
             Off a little alley with
             cobblestones.  Hemingway went
             there...

                        CROCKETT
             The Keys?

                        ISABELLA
             Havana.

                        CROCKETT
             Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my
             business...

                        ISABELLA
             Are you afraid?
                  (smiles; Crockett shakes
                   his head "no")
             Good.  And you don't need a visa.
             Cause you're with me.

   EXT. OPEN OCEAN - OVERHEAD "BORN TO WIN" - DAY

   rockets from one swell to the next, getting airborne.  Wind
   and salt electrify Isabella.  She turns to Crockett and
   smiles, putting on the glasses, now.  Crockett gestures to
   her knees.  She should keep them bent.  Crockett pushes it to
   75 knots...

   FRONTAL:  CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   in strong light, ripped by wind.  Behind them are ocean and
   sky and twenty-foot plumes which jet from the props and make
   a wake that vectors in diagonals to what each is leaving
   behind them...where they've been...and converge to push them
   to the new places where they're headed.  Behind, the skies
   are leaden.  They're racing a storm.  Sunlight shafts through
   a gap in thunderclouds, turning the clouds yellow.  Now, they
   turn peach against the darkening open water and the grey sky
   behind.  The boat vibrates, the engines scream and...

   CROCKETT

   waves her over to join him behind the wheel.  He holds out
   his left hand to steady her.  He brings her to him.  Both
   lean against his high upholstered chair.  He holds her to his
   side.  Indicates the wheel...

                        CROCKETT
             Light touch.  Everything comes to
             you through the wheel.

   CROCKETT

   stays on the throttle, throttling back when the props are out
   of the water so you don't redline the engine and forward
   when reentering.  The swells are now four feet.  They launch
   off each, get airborne, cut into the next...

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
             How do we get into Cuba?!

                        ISABELLA
             My cousin is the harbor master.
             You must not bring in drugs.  You
             cannot be armed.  If you're
             carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it
             inside.  No one will go near your
             boat...

                        CROCKETT
             You do business in Cuba with your
             husband?

                        ISABELLA
             I never do business in Cuba.
                  (beat)
             And nobody goes to Cuba but me.
                  (smiles)
             And he is not my husband...

   Crockett's surprised.  And he doesn't push it.

                        CROCKETT
             Were you born in Havana?

                        ISABELLA
             Angola.  My mother was being a
             surgeon there.  She volunteered.
             Mozambique and Mali, too...
                  (over the wind)
             ...those days, in those days...she
             was part of Cuba's gift to the
             third world.  She came from a
             bourgeois family with a house in
             Verdado...we still have the house.
             We will go there...

                        CROCKETT
             Where's she now?

                        ISABELLA
             She's dead...

   Crockett looks at her.  Her perspective is that of the '60's
   and '70's, the politics of national liberation, the
   perspective of Marcuse and Franz Fanon.

                        CROCKETT
             Your father?

                        ISABELLA
             Angolan Military.  Went back to the
             fighting.  Disappeared.  Who
             knows...?

   Isabella looks at the look on Crockett's face.

                        ISABELLA (cont'd)
             Go ahead and ask...

                        CROCKETT
             How's he not your husband?

                        ISABELLA
             I am no one's wife.  I live in my
             own house.  I do not live in a
             man's house.  He has a wife.  We
             are together.  I am free.  Because
             of banking and finance and travel...
                  (looks at him, shouts over
                   wind)
             And I can do anything I want...

   She laughs.  She has that combination of intellect, beauty
   and youth.  Everything is possible...life will never
   end...she can ride this crest eternally.

   And Crockett knows that her confidence makes her oblivious to
   peril, makes "right now" too real because she believes she
   will live forever.

   CROCKETT

   can't help it.  He looks right at her.  She lifts her face to
   the spray.  Some clouds part and light strikes her...

   And Crockett wants to possess her; to protect her.  He wants
   no one else to have her.  He wants no harm to come to her.
   And this is an impulse that takes him over to the core of who
   he is.  And, as we MOVE IN CLOSER, Crockett has to turn
   away...

   ISABELLA

   sees this.  She's quizzical.  Crockett looks back at her.
   Their eyes connect.

   "BORN TO WIN"

   leaps...

   CROCKETT

   his left arm around her shoulder, his right on the wheel.
   She rocks back against his body.  They rip across the seas...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. "JAZZ" - A HAVANA NIGHTCLUB JAMMED WITH PEOPLE - NIGHT

   14-piece Afro-Cuban band.  IN THE PRESS OF dancers at a small
   table, Crockett and Isabella...

                        CROCKETT
                  (shouts over noise)
             Mojitas...?

                        ISABELLA
                  (shouting back)
             Later!  Do you dance?

                        CROCKETT
             I dance...

   They move into the crowd under two-story high windows
   overlooking Meyer Lansky's Hotel Riviera - freeze-dried 1959
   Las Vegas.

   CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   Whatever we knew about Sonny Crockett, we did not know he
   could dance.  Their feet, their knees and thighs, perfectly
   matched, they samba, like lightning.

   He swings her around and turns her to a close embrace as
   their hips and legs parallel each other's, as he turns her
   under his arm, stops her, pulls her backwards into his body,
   her hips into his, the fast beat, the footwork, and he spins
   her back facing him, pressing her closer as it gets faster
   and...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. BEDROOM - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   fall onto a bed, shedding the last of their clothes, making
   love in a house somewhere.  Beyond them is an open window to
   the ocean.  The sky turns red and grey but the water stays
   molten.

   Their eyes are open...because they're locked together the
   whole time and their faces are steady and urgently surprised
   because this is not language; not a symbol, not a
   representation of a thing.  Jesus Montoya is not here.  Miami
   is not here.  This is discovery.  This is fact.  They have
   discovered each other and have never felt like this about
   anyone before in their lives.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. HOUSE, BEDROOM - CROCKETT - MORNING

   His eyes open.  He wakes up.  Light and situation flood in.
   He does not know where he is.  He pulls on his pants.
   Barefoot, he walks to the window.  The interior is high-
   ceilinged with immaculately polished floors.  And Crockett
   looks around, a stranger in a stranger place.

   EXT. THE BALCONY - CROCKETT

   enters.  The paint on the outside of this house is peeling
   and patinaed with stain.  The yard is overgrown.  The stucco
   fence around the streamline deco facade is crumbling from
   weather and time...

   CROCKETT WATCHES THE OCEAN

   from the balcony of the futuristic villa in Verdado...  A
   futurism from 1939, peeling aqua, aging science fiction.
   Wherever we are in the world, this place is out of the
   stream, outside history.  And Isabella, this woman from a
   different world, enters, brings him an oversized cup of
   coffee.  In his trousers, Crockett drapes an arm across her
   shoulders and they stand in the air.

   CROCKETT

   hears voices from the interior.

                        ISABELLA
             My aunt.  She's ancient.  She looks
             after the place...
                  (beat)
             This was my mother's family's
             home...

   INT. BODEGUITA DEL MEDIO - CROCKETT + ISABELLA - AFTERNOON

   in the funky yellow restaurant drinking mojitas.  They've had
   lunch served to them at the bar.  Frosted glasses have sugar
   on the bottom and are loaded with crushed Cuban herbs.  The
   bartender has been there for 40 years.  Crockett and Isabella
   look like regulars.  They've served chicken and plantains.
   Like any restaurant, the people eating at the bar are the
   regulars.  They sit where Hemingway sat in the slow part of
   the afternoon.

                        ISABELLA
             Tell me everything.

                        CROCKETT
             No.

                        ISABELLA
             I insist.

                        CROCKETT
                  (flip)
             Okay.
                  (beat)
             Macon, Georgia is where I was born.
             Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I
             was 14.  Then the military.  Then
             prison.  Because I was dumb and
             angry.  Then I read.  Then I got
             smart.  Then I discovered what I
             know, now...it's all business...

   Isabella smiles.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
                  (to Bartender)
             My friend, two more.
                  (beat)
             What was your mother's name...?

                        ISABELLA
             Blanca...a rubio like you.
                  (pause)
             I see her in a dress...an old
             photograph from Lucinda somebody's
             wedding...everybody is with
             couples.  Husbands and wives.  They
             all pose.  My mother is alone
             because my father had to go back to
             the fighting.
                  (she points)
             ...she looks right into the camera.
             She is the most beautiful woman in
             the room.  By herself.  In a party

             knew she would die alone...
                  (beat...remembers)
             She spoke many languages.  We were
             in Luanda when she died.  I went to
             her friends in Mali.  They sent me
             to the Ecole Polytechnique in
             Geneva to study mathematics, where
             I met Montoya in the discos.  He
             had banking there...I was seventeen
             and very much into the clubs.  And
             he sent me to University for an MBA
             in Finance.
                  (pause)
             Your mother?

                        CROCKETT
             Died in childbirth, having me...

                        ISABELLA
             To mothers.  And all that we owe
             them...

   Isabella looks at Crockett and smiles and puts on her
   sunglasses.

                        CROCKETT
             You know how improbable this is...?

                        ISABELLA
             "Probable"...applies to an event
             that may be real.  Doesn't apply
             here.

                        CROCKETT
             ...'cause we have no future...are
             of today and not tomorrow.

                        ISABELLA
                  (laughs)
             That's right.

                        CROCKETT
             ...and therafore there is no
             consequence?

                        ISABELLA
             Exactly.

   Crockett's hand is around her waist and slips down her hip as
   he pulls her closer and takes off her glasses and she puts
   down her drink and kisses him at the bar and Crockett's eyes
   dwell on her and she looks back at him and, now, knowing what
   he's thinking...

   INT. THE STREAMLINE HOUSE IN VEDADO - LEADEN SKIES - LATE
   AFTERNOON

   The water is like sheet metal as clouds allow only a sliver
   of light to illuminate the sea while rain greys-out most of
   it.  Minute crimson is a freighter heading to the stone
   harbor.  Fabric billows in the wind.  PULL BACK into the room
   to Crockett and Isabella...

   TWO NAKED BODIES

   ...one light skinned, the other brown, intertwine in the
   opiated moments after sensuality.  The afternoon half-light
   drapes parts of their bodies, making a relief against which
   their eyes hold each other's...

   compels himself to a different place, now.  Then, the shower
   curtain parts.  It startles him...

   ISABELLA

   enters.  She touches his back.  He turns to her with a smile.

                        CROCKETT
                  (soft)
             Let's talk deliveries.

   Isabella is not let down by the switch to commerce.  She
   merely goes there, too.  After all, this is their subject.
   Soft smiles.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
             ...and a different kind of deal.

                        ISABELLA
             Like...?

                        CROCKETT
             Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's
             nice.
             And I can supply the transportation
             into South Florida and the Gulf,
             more reliable and on-time than
             FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK
             for openers.

                        ISABELLA
             And why should continuing
             excellence cost more?

                        CROCKETT
             Cost less.  That's the point.

                        ISABELLA
             Is it December?

                        CROCKETT
             What do you mean?

                        ISABELLA
             Did Christmas come early this
             year...?

                        CROCKETT
             Better than that.
                  (beat)
             We become partners.  Only in this
             territory and only on loads we run.
             And you don't pay us three thousand
             a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we
             get is thirty percent of the load.
             Product or cash.  "And why," you're
             thinking, "would I be crazy enough
             to out in these gringos like that?
             Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love?
             Too many mojitas?"  And the answer
             is, "of course" but also "no.  It
             is because Sonny can deliver what
             no one else can."

             'Cause you don't lose loads?

                        CROCKETT
             'Cause we guarantee every load.
                  (beat)
             Anywhere, for any reason, it comes
             up short, we make good.  Your
             operations will, from now on, run
             risk-free.

                        ISABELLA
             And you're our thirty-percent
             partner?

   Her knowing smile speaks of experience beyond her years.

                  (deadly seriously)
             What if I tell you that your ideas
             are too big for your skin?
                  (beat)
             That merely to propose this is a
             dangerous thing?

                        CROCKETT
             Then I would say to you, this has
             been fun...

   There's a long pause.  This is business.  This is what is.

                        ISABELLA
             The range should be between fifteen
             and seventeen-point-five percent of
             the P.O.E....to even consider it.

                        CROCKETT
             I need thirty.  Calculate in, also,
             the cash you don't have to front...

                        ISABELLA
             Available cash is not an issue for
             us...

                        CROCKETT
             Twenty-eight-point-five.

                        ISABELLA
             What if I pushed to twenty-one...?

                        CROCKETT
             I would say you're...
                  (hesitates; holds up four
                   fingers)

                        ISABELLA
             Maybe I'm only one.

   And she slides into his arms.  And smiles...

                        CROCKETT
             We'll do it at twenty-two...

   Isabella laughs.  She kisses him under the shower water.  And
   it's tough to know who is pushing it further out onto the
   edge.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
             ...and now what?

                        ISABELLA

   Crockett disconnects.  He pushes it.  It launches from one
   swell, airborne, and knifes into the next.  It's violent.
   Crockett's thoughts and expression are about Isabella.  They
   are criminal conspirators, a woman cheating on her
   narcotrafficker "husband," an outlaw smuggler who's really an

             first-class.  His security is ex-

             Change the mission statement.
             Crockett stays in.  He keeps

   Fujima nods acquiescence.

   EXT. FREIGHTER ON THE INDIAN RIVER - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT

   step across to a second ship among the dozens tied-up along
   the river.  Its crimson paint is peeling and it's been
   stripped of everything salvageable.  They're alone.

                  (low)
             What is going on...?!

             As in...?

                        TUBBS
             There is "undercover."  And there
             is "Which way is up?"

                        CROCKETT
             You think I am in so deep I forgot?

                        TUBBS
             I am asking.  You to me.

                        CROCKETT
             Do you believe...I have forgotten I
             am a cop?

                        TUBBS
             I would never doubt you.

   This is the answer Crockett needed to hear.

                        TUBBS (cont'd)
             And do you doubt I will slot anyone
             complicit in the death of Maria,
             Alonzo and those children?
             Anyone...whoever they are...

                        CROCKETT
             No, I do not.

   And we know that might mean Isabella.

   EXT. MONTOYA COMPOUND, GUAJIRA PENINSULA, COLOMBIA - ISABELLA

   We are on a peninsula with palm trees.  A bluff dotted with a
   small forest of satellite dishes.  A ribbon of white-sand and

   futuristic at the same time.

   from memory.  Nothing is written down, in the tradition of
   the elite section of Swiss private banking in which clerks
   commit portfolios to memory.  There are no documents.

                        ISABELLA
             ...and we're looking at Nigerian

             They've been targeted.  And
             Pakistani registry is too
             vulnerable to search and seizure
             right now.

                        MONTOYA
             José doesn't like the deal in South
             Florida...

   Montoya's referring to Crockett.  Alarm bells go off.

                        ISABELLA
                  (cuts in)
             Burnett?
                  (shrugs)
             They want 22% of the value on loads
             they run into South Florida.  It's
             the Juarez cartel model.
             They guarantee the loads.  The
             upside is our risk goes to zero.
             That frees-up capital.

                        MONTOYA
             But what does your intuition tell
             you...?

   Is he suspicious?  Does he suspect Isabella and Crockett are
   lovers?

                        ISABELLA
             My "intuition"...?  My intuition
             made him breakfast the other
             morning in Havana.

   Her lieson with Crockett is the last thing we expected to
   hear from Isabella.

                        MONTOYA
             And...?

                        ISABELLA
             They're serious.  They're cautious.
             They'll forgo a deal over a
             technicality of how a delivery's
             handled...they'd walk away, rather
             than compromise operational
             security...that's good.

   Montoya's thoughtful.

                        ISABELLA (cont'd)
             But they have to be watched
             closely...

                        MONTOYA
             Why?

                        ISABELLA
             A good deal, like this with us, for
             Burnett will be good only
             temporarily.  He'll get restless
             because he believes nothing is
             forever.  Life is dust, make it
             while you can.  He's ambitious.

   Montoya appreciates her thoughtfulness.

                        ISABELLA (cont'd)
             So I predict a few good runs.  Then
             there'll be a renegotiation.

                        MONTOYA
             That's my girl...

   Montoya uses Isabella and her sexual allure to gather insight
   into the people he does business with.  That's part of their
   deal.

                        MONTOYA (cont'd)
             On the next load, José wants to

             He thinks they are wrong.  What do
             you think?

                        ISABELLA
                  (revealing nothing)
             I think José suspects anybody he
             doesn't intimidate.  And people,
             who are good at what they do?  They
             have egos, too...

                        MONTOYA
                  (careful)
             What would you do...?

                        ISABELLA
                  (equally careful)
             I like the diminished risk.  It
             frees up capital reserves.  I like
             working with self-interested
             businessmen who are competent.  You
             can predict their behavior....

   Montoya looks at her very carefully.  She stares right back
   at him.

                        ISABELLA (cont'd)
             On the other hand...if what you
             wish, mi corazon, is la
             plumba...the lead?  Then let's do
             that.  Accept their deal.  After
             the load is received...we will
             close their eyes forever...

   She looks at Montoya squarely.  It hangs in the air.  In his
   strange process of decision-making, Montoya reaches a
   conclusion...

                        MONTOYA
              Let's try a few runs with these
              partners, I think.  I will tell
              José...

   If Isabella is pleased, she doesn't show it.  Montoya
   continues to stare at her unwavering expression, frozen in
   stone.  He smiles, then, and starts to take off her clothes.

   He reaches for her hand and brings her to him.  She kisses
   him and he puts aside his cigar, pulls her face into his
   neck, and she runs her hands down him...

   Then...

   CROCKETT

   emerges from behind an SUV.  He came to meet her plane.

   ISABELLA'S

   expression changes, but she masks it.

   Businesslike, she walks across the tarmac.  There are two
   Suburbans.  One for her; one full of security.  Crockett and
   her meet.  No show of affection.  Her Secretary, carrying her
   briefcase, accompanies her towards the second Suburban.

   INT. SECOND SUBURBAN - DOOR - NIGHT

   opens.  Crockett and Isabella climb in.  The rear is
   customized cream leather, luxurious with three telephones and
   a divider.  As Isabella climbs in, followed by Crockett, she
   takes the briefcase from the Secretary and indicates he ride
   in the front vehicle.  Doors close.  Windows go up.  Air
   conditioning comes on.  She raises the divider, blocking the
   driver and locks the doors.  They are sealed in the back.
   Alone.  And she assaults Crockett with a passion that's
   desperate...as if making love to him puts her world back in
   balance.  Their clothes come off, Crockett pauses...

                        CROCKETT
             Hola, chica.

                        ISABELLA

   Yero shakes Gina's hand.  He indicates to the bartender that

   He watches them, too.  His yellow eyes are lit by strobes.

             Make a lot of money for Pablo?
             Thank you very much."  And then
             Pablo would kill his ass.  After
             six loads.
                  (pause)
             And who was Pablo Escobar?  A
             provincial who got busted-out by
             the white collars from Cali.  When
             the gringos got him, he was nobody.
             We're three times better than Pablo
             Escobar.
                  (beat)
             The means we kill these
             sonsabitches three times sooner.
                  (beat)
             And do you know why Pablo Escobar
             did that?

                        EL TIBURON
             Why?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             He didn't like pilots.

   YERO POV:  GINA

   Tubbs.

                        JOSÉ YERO (CONT'D)
             And put eyes on her.  Put eyes on
             her twenty-four hours a day...

   EXT. BARRANQUILLA BEACH - CROCKETT + ISABELLA, TUBBS + GINA -
   NIGHT

   Isabella hands out banana leaves wrapped and tied around
   cooked rice and barbecued pork.  Gina and Tubbs walk away
   down the beach towards phosphorescent waves.

                        ISABELLA
             I forgot the napkins.

                        CROCKETT
             And the chopsticks and fortune
             cookies?

                        ISABELLA
             What's the best fortune you ever
             got?

                        CROCKETT
             They're all the same.  "Financial
             security is around the corner."
             "Your friends love you."

                        ISABELLA
             In Kowloon, once, I got one that
             said, "Live now because life is
             dust."

   Crockett and Isabella wander down the beach, hard from the
   ebb tide.

                        CROCKETT
             Do you have assets somewhere else?
             Bank accounts?

                        ISABELLA
             Why?

                        CROCKETT
             ...to fall back on.  You know, a
             fail-safe.  Insurance.

                        ISABELLA
             Do I need it?

                        CROCKETT
                  (shrugs)
             Everybody needs it.  Ask
             Prudential.  Or Allstate.

                        ISABELLA
                  (laughs)
             'Cause whatever can go wrong,
             will...?

   The Perseids make the night sky over the water look like the
   Fourth of July.

                        CROCKETT
             Something like that.  The odds
             catch up with you.  The odds are
             like gravity.  You can't negotiate
             with them.
                  (then)
             So...at some point, you should cash
             out, take your money and run...

                        ISABELLA
                  (smiles)
             Really?

                        CROCKETT
             Sure.  As far away and as fast as
             you can.

                        ISABELLA
             When?

                        CROCKETT
             Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe
             sooner.

   What is Sonny Crockett trying to say to her?

                        ISABELLA
             Would you find me...?

                        CROCKETT
             Of course.

                        ISABELLA
             Where would I go?

                        CROCKETT
             Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands.
             Somewhere in the Indian Ocean.
             There's twelve-hundred islands
             there...

                        ISABELLA
                  (smiles)
             Is this the protective male talk?

                        CROCKETT
                  (deadly serious)
             This is the talk of a man...if he
             were your husband...he would never
             put you at risk.  He would never
             put you within a thousand miles of
             anything that could hurt you.

                        ISABELLA
             And if I were in the Comoros, in
             the Indian Ocean, where would you
             be...?

                        CROCKETT
             A few more moments, still in this
             business.  Then I'd find you.

                        ISABELLA
             Would you?  Because if you
             couldn't, I would be very lonely...
             I would have left the only world I
             know and have known since I was
             seventeen.
                  (smiles, touches Crockett)
             But none of this will happen.  So
             it doesn't matter.  Because we are
             on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all
             you see around you...look around...
             is Archangel de Jesus Montoya-
             Londono.  He is my man.  And you are
             a smuggler moving a load...

   Her eyes say that she listened to his warnings and will
   disregard them.  Life is dust.  Meaning is in the moment, and
   that's right now.

   The intensity is because it's impossible.  Because it's
   impossible, they've been free to imagine.  And that's made
   the heat of it stronger...

                        CROCKETT
             ...in the morning.

                        ISABELLA
             I'll be on board by noon.

   Crockett didn't expect that.

                        ISABELLA (cont'd)
             What did you think?  This deal with
             you is my deal.  I am responsible.

   She vouched for him.  She has to stand behind it.  He puts
   his arm around her waist.

   The Freighter is anchored a half mile offshore.

   Magenta breaks the horizon.  Trudy looks at Crockett, looks

                        CROCKETT
             Go ahead.

                        TRUDY
             Too fast.  Too many moving parts.

                        CROCKETT
             Switek?

   Zito joins them.

                        SWITEK
             Same.  But it's your call, boss.

   Tubbs joins them.

                        CROCKETT
             What's your take?

                        TUBBS
             What's the point?  It's going down.

             And Switek resumes romancing Miss
             Ukraine...

   Crockett looks at Trudy.  There's a connection between
   Crockett and Trudy.  It's filial.  Crockett has a special
   regard for her judgment.

                        TRUDY
             If we were for real, and knew our

   drives up.  Parks.  She approaches along the sidewalk, down
   the walkway under the banana trees and birds of paradise.

   Motion sensors trigger exterior lights.  Gina cocks her ear,
   waiting to hear...  Then, offscreen, Tommy the dog barks.
   Reassured, her left hand on her .380, she reaches for her
   keys, opens the door...

   FROM BEHIND HER - WE MOVE CLOSER AS...

   a leather sap arcs through the air and descends onto her left
   shoulder, paralyzing her arm.  Other arms grab her, push her
   head down.  The same sap backhands with massive force across
   the back of her neck...

   INT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - ECU:  GINA - NIGHT

   slowly comes to consciousness.  She looks around,
   disoriented.  Her eyes roll back in her head and she slips
   into dreamland for a moment.  She rouses and opens her eyes
   again, blinks, disoriented...

   WIDE PAST GINA TO WHICH SHE SEES:  AN EMACIATED WOMAN IN A
   PLAID HOUSEDRESS

   stares at her from the back corner of the double-wide
   trailer.  With her is an overweight autistic Boy of about 11.
   He plays in the corner and watches a small TV with a coat
   hanger for an antenna.  The Old Woman pays Gina no attention
   On her face is zero affect.  There are other sounds in the
   room.

   WIDER:  GINA

   and we see she is tied to a chair that is bolted to the floor.
   Her clothes are disheveled and ripped.  She tries to focus.
   Then somebody's thick arms are fitting something around her
   neck.  A blindfold goes over her eyes.  Around her neck is a
   C-4 "necklace" like the one we saw on Stevens' wife in the
   beginning of the film.  The arms and back belong to the deep-
   chested Aryan Brother we saw from the Stevens' house and
   Coleman's double-wide.  MOVE IN ON GINA.  He reaches below
   the frame and does something.  Gina writhes away from him in
   the chair.  He laughs.  He backs away from her to
   camera...and holds something in his hand.

   A CAMERA

   He takes a digital picture.

   satellite dish.  On the driveway are two Escalades and a
   Bentley.  Out the back, off the dock is a two-million dollar
   sports/fishing boat.  Someone's entering numbers on a cell

   Brother we saw in the Stevens kitchen in the opening.
   Coleman's shirt open in the Barcalounger watching ESPN.  His
   watch is loaded with ice, and a four-carat diamond in his
   ear.  He is all white bling.  Coleman's tattooed up.  Not
   with "cool" Celtic symbols...his tats are neo-Nazi, white
   supremacist, hard-core prison stuff.

   CELL PHONE

             I confess I have succumbed to my

             another's point of view.

             So I want you to deliver my

   Isabella walks in.  Crockett gestures for her to be quiet.

                        CROCKETT
             What friend?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She
             is safe.  To insure that, I am
             keeping her close to me.  It's
             always good to keep people your
             friends care about close to you.

   Tubbs reaches for the phone.  Trudy intercepts him.

   Crockett turns it away and goes off the speaker...

                        JOSÉ YERO (cont'd)
             So, I will tell you when you're 10
             minutes out where to drop the load
             into the hands of my people.  You
             have 35 minutes to enter Government
             Channel.  Head up the River...  We
             will watch you.  Then I will call
             you.

             I don't give a shit...

   José Yero does NOT know Isabella's on board.

                        CROCKETT
             Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs.

             Of course!  That is why I placed
             myself here, with you, knowing Yero
             would pull this crap.

                        CROCKETT
             Yero doesn't know she's here!

   Crockett looks at Isabella, who's distracted in calculating
   what's really happening.

                        SWITEK
                  (entering)
             Cigarette and the two Starkeys are

             What...?

                        TRUDY
             They grabbed Gina...

   Isabella punches numbers into a satellite phone.  No results.

                        ISABELLA
             It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of
             communication in Fals de Iguazu.
             José knows that...  Whatever he's
             going to do, he has to do it fast
             because he's acting on his own.
             And he will need a story.

                        TUBBS
             Meaning...?

                        ISABELLA
             They will kill you.  And then they
             will kill your wife, too.

                        CROCKETT
             Yero, by himself?

                        ISABELLA
             Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy
             whites.

   Zito enters, makes the situation...

                        ZITO
             We're half loaded...

                        TRUDY
             Gina.  Like Alonzo's wife...  Cochi
             Loco's got her.

                        CROCKETT
             Dump the rest.  Let's get the boats
             up that river.

   Crockett picks up the phone and dials.  His eyes contact with
   Tubbs has Tubbs take Isabella out of the Captain's Bridge.
   She pulls her arm away.  As they head down from the
   bridge...we see...

   EXT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER - DOPE-ON-A-ROPE

   lines run from the freighter to two go-fast boats.  The fuel
   bladders with crampons slide down the rope into the smaller
   "cigarette" boats..."dope-on-a-rope."

   WIDER:  ONE STARKEY

   loaded, takes off into the night, no lights.  A second one
   pulls away as the third boat's being loaded; Switek and Zito
   climb into a cigarette.  Meanwhile...

             José Yero changed-up the drop plan
             on us.  He's grabbed Gina.

                        CASTILLO
             Where's the new drop point...?

                        CROCKETT
             They'll have surveillance on us.
             We'll know only at the last
             moment...

                        CASTILLO
             What do you think?

                        CROCKETT
             It's a rip and a hit.

                        CASTILLO
                  (to someone else)
             Get me Air Support...
                  (to Crockett)
             We'll be airborne and assault the
             ambush...

                        CROCKETT
             You can't.

                        TUBBS
             They'll kill Gina.

                        CASTILLO
             They may have already, so we
             protect the living.  Proof she's
             alive?

                        CROCKETT
             Supposedly it's coming.

   INT. SCARAB - SWITEK, ZITO + TRUDY

   rip from one swell to another, airborne, in between their
   load.  Trudy's on the comms.  Switek drives with night-vision
   gear.

   INT. STRYKER - CROCKETT, TUBBS + ISABELLA

   Crockett drives.  Tubbs is on the throttles.  Isabella's
   between them.  Then, Tubbs is sent a page.  Reads the number.
   Picks up the satellite phone.  Crockett takes control of the
   throttles, too.

                        TUBBS
                  (into phone)
             Hello...?

   And Tubbs hears..."And weather on the southeast throughout
   today and looking into the weekend is broken clouds, humidity
   78%, small chance of rain.  And coming up in four minutes at
   5:45 is Lou Dobbs with Friday's market previews..."

                        LOU DOBBS (O.S.)
             Welcome, folks.  Today's Friday,
             the three-hundredth-and-fourteenth

                        TUBBS
             They're proving it's right now.
             And that she's alive right now...

             ...nice friends you got.  Trailer

   The phone is ripped away from her.  It's disconnected.

             She's allergic to diethylene...she
             in a meth lab?

   Crockett takes the phone, dials Castillo.

                        CROCKETT
             Just came in.  She's still alive.

                        CASTILLO
             Safe house is empty...
                  (beat)
             Air Support's set to jump when we
             know your drop point.  Gina?

                        TUBBS
                  (takes phone)
             She's sending a message.  Meth Lab.
             Trailer park.  Anything with
             interesting antenna arrays...?

                        CASTILLO
             There's three between Miami
             International and the glades.  I'm
             gonna try for her, but this is
             triage.  Protect the maximum number
             of lives.  You need to know that...

   Crockett knows the Sophie's choice Castillo may have to make.
   And it may cost Gina.  Crockett glances at Tubbs.  Crockett
   pushes the throttles forward...

   EXT. GOVERNMENT CHANNEL - TWO BOATS:  THE SCARAB + THE

   jam over the swells into Government Channel, NOT SLOWING this
   time, even though the limit is 15 knots.  Barely missing

   INT. SCARAB - SWITEK

   slams the Scarab sideways, spewing a huge wake, driving it
   through a circle to slough off speed as he pulls into a dock.
   Crockett's Stryker does the same.  Tubbs transfers into this
   boat with Trudy and Zito.  Switek gets into the Stryker with
   Crockett and Isabella.  As they speed up Government Channel.

   RAGES INTO THE MIDDLE GROUND, CALLING DOWN JOSÉ YERO.
   BLOCKED BY AN ARYAN BROTHER, SHE PUSHES, HE SLAPS HER, SHE

   the wall.

   EXT. TRAILER PARK, DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - OVER TRUDY

   And Trudy and we SEE in fish-eye a long-haired Nazi Low-Rider
   and the bulked-out Brother with the Hefty garbage-bag apron.
   Deeper in the trailer, her clothes torn, blindfolded, is Gina
   with the C-4 necklace.  Beyond her, the woman in the house
   dress and her large, retarded son.

   Too late.  Door's opened.

   holding the bag of Chinese for the Long-Haired NLR.  He

   TUBBS

   rips Long-Hair through the door, down the stairs, where two
   SWAT slam him into the ground.  He struggles.  A baton slams
   twice across the back of his neck.  He's out.  Handcuffed,
   and Tubbs and Trudy are in the interior...

   INT. METH LAB, DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER

                        TUBBS
             HOLD IT!!

   Bulked-out Aryan has a handgun in one hand, detonator in the
   other.  Eyes wide.  Standoff.  The Old Woman in house dress
   is SCREAMING...  Her retarded Son sees Tubbs/Gina as a threat
   to his mother...grabs butcher knife...rushes forward
   during...

                        TRUDY
             PUT DOWN THE DETONATOR!

   FROZEN.  Aryan doesn't move.  The FARQ-like necklace of C-4
   around Gina's neck.

   GINA

   struggles against plastic ties, to hear, to see, as...

   OBESE SON

   shouts, surges past bulky Aryan, heading for Tubbs...

   TUBBS

   prepares for the autistic son, not seeing behind him...

   ARYAN BROTHER #3

   rising from a bare mattress with an aluminum baseball bat,
   coming up behind Tubbs.

   WIDE - TUBBS

   slips the Autistic Son, rotating his right arm around the
   kid's right arm, getting slashed on the back of his forearm,
   but grabbing the Son's wrist as the momentum propels him past
   Tubbs, who torques the wrist back.  Screaming, Son's ruined
   wrist, Tubbs took the knife, and as the Aryan Brother swings
   the bat...

   LOW ANGLE:  TUBBS

   ducks the bat.  It dents the faux-wood paneling.  Tubbs slams
   the knife twice into the man's slide, doubling him up, leaving
   the AB Brother to crawl, bleeding, with a 10-inch butcher
   knife through his kidney into his right lung...  AND Tubbs'
   gun in his left hand has never moved off-target of the Aryan
   brother with the detonator in his hand the whole time until
   right now:  he snaps a ROUND into the wounded Aryan Brother's
   head.  And, that fast, Tubbs' gun is back on target.

   AND THE FIERCE EYES OF BULKED-OUT BROTHER

   A nihilistic smile dawns there.

                        ARYAN BROTHER
             Shoot me, she dies.  Hey, fuck it,
             man.  We can all go.

             between your upper lip and the

             Fuck...

   BLAM.  That's all he gets out.  Trudy does exactly that.
   Aryan Brother falls like a felled tree.  Tubbs retrieves the
   detonator.  Trudy unties Gina.  Carefully, Tubbs pulls the
   sensitive remote detonator from his hands.

   TUBBS

   puts his coat over Gina.  As she half leaves, turns to the
   fallen AB...

                        GINA

   She kicks him in the head.  Tubbs grabs her to pull her off.

   run for cover, fire three-shot bursts, run and cover.  But...

   ISABELLA

   runs from cover into the clear with her handgun firing at the
   crazy whites, furious at the betrayal by Yero.  She's shouting
   in Spanish.  It's insane.

   CROCKETT

   sees Isabella, moves.

   COLEMAN

   sees Isabella, swings his assault rifle onto her as...

                        CROCKETT
             Isabella!!

   CROCKETT RUNS

   and sees Coleman because he's turned he's exposed his legs
   and Crockett slows and blows Coleman's legs out from under
   him.  Coleman's on the ground, scrambling for his rifle to
   kill Isabella.  Dark-Haired NLR is pulling the trigger on
   Crockett when BOOM...

   TUBBS

   fires the M40 grenade launcher loaded with shot.  Dark-Haired
   NLR is nearly cut in half.

   CROCKETT + ZITO

   FIRE at the prone Coleman.  Coleman's dead.

   WIDER:  THE FREIGHTERS - THE FIREFIGHT

   continues as other NLR battle Miami SWAT.  Meanwhile...

   CROCKETT

   goes to Isabella, pulls her into the shadows away from
   dockside, keeping her low, seemingly away from the police.
   OK, how will they get out of here?

   OVER CROCKETT + ISABELLA:  TUBBS

   approaches from the left.  Tubbs and Crockett's eyes connect.

   CLOSER:  TUBBS

   sees his partner with this woman.  The frozen moment.
   Isabella doesn't understand the changed expression on Tubbs'
   face.  We do.

   CROCKETT EYE TO EYE WITH HIS PARTNER

   50 yards away.  All meaning is transmitted.  And Tubbs
   nods...and the nod means:  "get her out of here..."

   As Tubbs speaks into his radio, his right arm belted where it
   was slashed, heading towards the diminished firefight, now
   under MPD control, as...

   CROCKETT RACES ISABELLA AWAY

   through the weeds and scrap, away from the firefight, away
   from the freighters, AWAY FROM THE POLICE.  Beyond them, we
   hear the gunfight diminishing.

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. STREET - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   enter from the rubble-filled industrial lot.  Cars have
   stopped, their occupants seeking cover behind them.  Crockett
   hesitates not at all.  He grabs a late '80's Mercedes left
   with its door open.  Its owner, a middle-aged man at the
   curb, starts to object.  Crockett raises his gun.  Owner
   demurs.  Crockett steals away in it down the street into the
   night, its lights off.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   breathing.  She's hyperventilating.  He steadies her.  Then,
   Crockett sees something and she does, too.

   CROCKETT'S POV:  A ROADBLOCK

   appears around the corner.  Rearview mirror:  flashing lights
   on his tail.  Nowhere to go.  Crockett stops.

   ISABELLA

   thinks this is it.  She's dead.  SWAT, shotguns and assault
   rifles, approach.

   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT

                        CROCKETT
             Touch the windshield with your
             hands.  Let 'em see your hands are
             empty.  Steady.

                        SWAT SERGEANT
                  (approaching)
             Don't move!  Don't move!  Keep your
             hands where I can see them...

   They do.  Then the SWAT Sergeant stops...

                        SWAT SERGEANT (cont'd)
             ...Sonny?

                        CROCKETT
             Yeah.  Hey, Robert.

   The police relax, turn away.

                        SWAT SERGEANT
             Are you okay?!

                        CROCKETT
             Yeah.  Going to Miami General.
             Check out Gina.  Everybody's okay.
             Everybody's fine...

   Crockett nods and drives through the roadblock.  He drives
   away into the night.

   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT

   does not look at Isabella.  He shoots up the on-ramp onto
   I-95.  His eyes at the moment are world-weary and street-
   wise.  It's all out.  All is in the open.  Finally, he looks
   over his right shoulder at her.

   ISABELLA

   stares at him.  Incredulous.  For the first time she realizes
   he's the police and has been undercover.  And now she hits
   him...

   EXT. HIGHWAY - MERCEDES

   swerves across three lanes, up on two wheels, almost rolls,
   cuts off a semi, which barely recovers, and spins out onto
   the shoulder, off the shoulder, down into the gravel.  It
   comes to a stop and...

   INT. MERCEDES - ISABELLA

   tries to bring her .380 around.  Crockett overpowers her.
   Takes the gun.  She slams him in the face with a closed fist.
   He grabs her wrists, spins her around, pushes her at the
   door, handcuffs her behind her back.

   EXT. HIGHWAY

   He floors the Mercedes.  It spins through 270 degrees,
   scattering gravel and dust, and pulls back onto the freeway,
   driving out of the city, away from Miami, out, into the
   night.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MERCEDES - LATER

   She won't look at him.  She won't reply.  She's frozen,
   immobile, withdrawn deep, darkly into herself.

                        CROCKETT
             Isabella...?

   No reply.  Isabella wonders where he's taking her, what will
   happen to her, but she won't ask.

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. TWO-LANE BLACKTOP THROUGH CYPRESS - NIGHT

   Nothing.  The cypress are silhouettes against a lighter mauve
   sky.  Engine sound.  Then, the Mercedes enters and speeds
   down the empty two-lane blacktop.  And at the end, the trees
   open up and there's the open ocean and, beyond that, the
   Florida Keys.  We see a house.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. HOUSE IN THE CYPRESS - WIDE:  NIGHT

   Door opens.  Crockett leads Isabella in.  He uncuffs her.
   She rips away from his hand holding her arm.  She walks to
   the other end of the large room with the picture windows
   overlooking the water and the jetty and a boat tied up there.
   Low furniture.  Sparse, it was built in the '60's.  She walks
   to a restroom, slams the door.  Offscreen, a faucet runs.

   Suddenly, the door opens.  She comes out, glaring, shouting.

                        ISABELLA
             What are you going to do with me?
             Are you taking me to jail?  You
             think I will turn into your
             informant, is that it?

                        CROCKETT
             No.

   It is a police action, an assault.

   REVERSE:  EMPTINESS

   It's as if no one had ever lived there.  A few papers flutter
   in the breeze from the light wind entering through the open
   doorways.  White papers against white marble against white
   walls.  A profound statement of nobody is home.  Wherever
   Montoya is, he is not here.

   INT. HOUSE IN THE CYPRESS - CROCKETT - LATE AFTERNOON

   staring out the window at the narrow jetty.  Isabella sits,
   distantly, alone at the end.

   CLOSER:  ISABELLA

   Crockett joins her.  She's withdrawn into herself.

                        CROCKETT
             No part of it wasn't real.

                        ISABELLA
             I know.
                  (quietly)
             And now?

                        CROCKETT
             It still is.  I'm so in this, I
             don't know which way is up... All I
             know is I won't let anything bad
             happen to you.
                  (beat)
             Just like I said.
                  (beat)
             And I know we can't ever see each
             other again.  And we never will.

   Isabella sits there for a moment.  She glances at him, looks
   away.  Then...

                        ISABELLA
             You said time is luck...

   Meaning, who can tell?  There may be a time for them
   somewhere else.

                        CROCKETT
             Luck ran out.
                  (beat)
             This was too good to last.

   He touches her hand.  And she leans all her weight against
   his arm.

   asleep.  The moonlight is silver tinged with green.  Someone
   else had been in the bed with him, but he is there alone,
   now.  Crockett wakes up.  He looks around.  She was there and
   now she's gone.

   He gets out of the bed and looks out to the ocean and the
   jetty.  The boat's gone.  She's gone.  Sonny Crockett looks
   out the window.

 "MINORITY REPORT" 
               -- Aug 15th 1997 rewrite by Jon Cohen


 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               The oval face is female, a woman of indeterminate age, her
               features as fragile as porcelain.  Her eyes are closed in
               sleep, or in death ... or in something in between.

               Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness.  They are
               male, and they float into position on either side of the
               female.  They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,
               and like the female their eyes are closed.

               The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch.  Her features,
               which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,
               into the face of a woman in fear.  Her eyes open.

               The male face on her right contorts too.  His features warp
               into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged.  His eyes
               open.

               The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young
               boy, a boy who is terribly frightened.  His eyes open wide.

               As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a
               sudden and unnerving exchange begins ...

 FEMALE                               (frightened woman)
 JOHNNY, PLEASE MALE RIGHT                               (mocking man)
                         "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 FEMALE                          You're scaring me.

 MALE LEFT                               (child's voice)
 DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
 MALE RIGHT                               (considering)
                         I don't like you any more, Carol.

 FEMALE                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me.  Please.

 MALE RIGHT                          Oh, Carol.

 FEMALE                          Johnny!  Stop!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. 

 MALE RIGHT                          Don't grab at me!  Let

 MALE LEFT                          Daddy!  No!

               All we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but
               we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us: a
               man with scissors lunging at his wife, her anguished scream,
               the whimpering cries of their son.

               And then there is silence, and it is over, and the three
               faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state.
               Their eyes slowly close.  They do not move.

               So that when they do move again, it is startling.  In abrupt
               unison, the EYES flash open.  Three pairs of eyes stare
               straight at us, accusing.

               Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and
               the dark reaches forth, and takes them.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 EXT. SUBURBIA DAY 
               Morning in America.  Just look at it.  America in the
               midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into
               the sun drenched distance.  White house upon white house.
               Emerald lawns, glistening with dew.

               In each driveway, a big Chevy, or a Ford, muscled with chrome,
               long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships.

               Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on
               trikes.  Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways,
               watching.  The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go
               back into their houses.

               Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height,
               boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes.  It
               is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are
               safe.

 INT. A HOUSE 
               A family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone
               fireplace, a console TV, a man's leatherette Barca-Lounger,
               a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of
               children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. 

               A young mother, CAROL, her hair -in a pony-tail, stands at a
               picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly
               at the scene outside.

 CAROL'S POV - A LITTLE GIRL 
               A little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk.  The ball
               gets away from her, and rolls into the street.

               At the same moment, a two-toned CHEVY, lush and huge, rounds
               the corner.

               The girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball.

 THE FAMILY ROOM 
               Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesn't cry
               out, or bang on the window, or run for the front door.  She
               watches.  And smiles a little.

 OUTSIDE 
               The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white
               shirt, thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of
               the car.

               Disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel.
               Not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in
               front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him.

               Through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road
               in front of him, going for her ball.

               CAROL Watches, her smile in place.

 OUTSIDE 
	       The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears 
	       down on her.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               An alarm suddenly CHIRPS.  The car automatically brakes to a
               halt.  The man looks around the edge of his paper to see
               what is happening.

 THE STREET 
               The car has stopped, inches from the girl.

               The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink.
               She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. 

               The man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on
               its own, starts up again.  The car rounds a corner, and
               disappears.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               Carol turns away from the window.  She startles when she
               sees her husband, JOHNNY, is there behind her.  He is in his
               pajamas.  How long has he been there, watching her?

 JOHNNY                               (gruff)
                         Why'd you let me sleep so long?

 CAROL                          It's Saturday, Johnny, you always --
                              (beat)
                         Why are you staring at me like that?

               He takes a step toward her.  He stands there, his thick black
               hair tousled with sleep, scratching his stubbled jaw,
               considering her.

 JOHNNY                          I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so
                         long.

               He takes another step toward her.  She doesn't move a muscle.
               A little BOY suddenly enters the room.  Johnny turns, looks
               at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife.  Then,
               without a word, he begins to walk out of the room.  On his
               way out, Johnny's eyes flick to Carol's sewing basket, which
               sits beside a sewing machine.  It is not the sewing that has
               caught his attention, but a large pair of garment SCISSORS
               which lie across a fold of colored cloth.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Johnny stands on the front porch, scratching.  He walks down
               his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper.
               Carol stands in the doorway, watching him.

               A SHADOW slides over Johnny, cast from above.  The air fills
               with the piercing WHINE of an engine.  Johnny looks up,
               alarmed.

               In the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban
               trees, is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT.

               The children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone
               freezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable
               drama.

               Racing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him, are SLEEK
               TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS, lethal and efficient looking -- they
               seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat
               Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to
               process them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. 

               Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.
               More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses.  Their
               uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light.  Their
               left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some
               sort of complicated glove.

 CLOSE 
 ON - A GLOVE 
               The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger
               ending in an open barrel.

               Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not
               America in the 1950's.  It is the neo-past, the retro world
               of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is
               intermeshed with hypertechnology.

               And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he
               makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering
               behind him.  He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out
               of the way.

               Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a
               backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a
               handle grip and an ovoid screen.  It is a holographic scanner.

               He activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an
               IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form.

               The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver
               a dozen times.

               In less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three
               dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning
               like living beings -- has been created.  An overwhelming
               police deterrent presence has been established.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house,
               too.  It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and
               which are scanned holographs.  The juxtaposition of the
               futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.

 INSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET 
               Johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his
               wife's dresses.

 UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 
               Two OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands
               out in front of them, palm out.  When the first officer points
               his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove
               BEEPS softly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. 

               The officer looks at his PALM.  A red thermal IMAGE appears
               on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching
               man.  The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second
               officer.

 THE BEDROOM 
               The room is packed with police -- how many are real?

 THE CLOSET 
               Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat.  He calls
               out through the door.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do anything!

 OUTSIDE THE CLOSET 
               Every OFFICER in the room lifts his gloved hand and points
               his index barrel at the closet door.  The effect is deeply
               accusatory.

               An OFFICER speaks, his VOICE electronically manipulated to
               be as menacing as possible.

 OFFICER 1                          Come out of the closet on your hands
                         and knees.

               Nothing happens.  Two officers aim their barrels at the
               perimeter of the door.  In repeated, small SONIC BLASTS, the
               closet door is blown off of its frame, revealing Johnny among
               the dresses.

               Johnny starts to rise, and BAM, a section of floorboards is
               blasted away beneath his feet.

 OFFICER 1                          Hands and knees!

               Johnny trips among the splintered floorboards, and drops.
               He stays on his hands and knees, and approaches.  He lifts
               his head and looks up at the officer.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't... 

		Another OFFICER 2 bends down with a DEVICE -- the words
		"IdentiScan" on its side -- and blips a red laser light 
		into each of Johnny's, eyes, reading his irises.  The 
                officer nods affirmatively to the other officer.

 OFFICER 2 POSITIVE FOR JOHN PALMER. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 7. 

 OFFICER 1                               (to Johnny)
                         John Palmer, if you were being
                         arrested for any other crime, I would
                         now read you your rights.
                              (beat)
                         But you are under arrest for the
                         future murderer of your wife, Carol
                         Palmer.  You have no rights.

               Johnny, on his hands and knees, goes limp.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- LATER 
               In the background, Johnny is guided into a Precrime police
               vehicle as the neighbors look on.  Carol and her son stand
               in the doorway, stunned.

               TWO OFFICERS remove their helmets.  The first man is tall,
               sandy-haired, good eyes, deeply blue; This is PAUL ANDERSON,
               late thirties, Director of the Precrime Division, Washington
 D.C. 
               The second man is ED WITWER, Anderson's second in command,
               late thirties, big like Anderson, good face, strong in the
               shoulders, short brown hair.

               The two men are deeply comfortable together.  They can speak,
               or not.  It doesn't matter -- they still communicate.  Two
               good cops, good together.

               They walk side-by-side around the house, dematerializing the
               holographic decoy cops.

 WITWER                          Thought we might a had a runner.

               Anderson seems tired, takes a moment to answer.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah, a runner.

 WITWER                          A little chase -- that'd been good.

 ANDERSON                          Fifty cops on the scene takes the
                         chase out of them.

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         But only eight of us were real.

               Witwer dematerializes the last decoy.

 ANDERSON                          We ever get a runner, I'd be too old
                         to give chase.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. 

 WITWER                          You'd chase.  You'd love it,.  Man.

               They get to the front of the house and watch the Precrime
               vehicle holding Johnny zoom SOUNDLESSLY away.

 ANDERSON                          I love it more Johnny boy doesn't
                         get to murder his wife.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         It's a beautiful world.

 EXT. SAME SCENE -- LATER 
               The children play on their trikes.  The wives talk among
               themselves.  The birds sing, the dogs bark.

               The little girl bounces her red ball again.  She stops a.
               minute, when two pieces of newspaper blow past her,
               unexpectantly littering the orderly suburban landscape.

 INT. A BEDROOM - SUBURBAN VIRGINIA (OUTSIDE WASHINGTON) DAY 
               Decorated in a 1950's style.  Anderson lies in bed beside
               his wife, LISA, a pretty, green-eyed brunette.  It is early
               morning, they are both awake.  Her hand caresses his chest.
               Maybe they will make love.

               Lisa's hand stops suddenly on the center of Anderson's chest.

 LISA                          Jesus, Paul.  Your heart's hammering.
                              (playfully)
                         I excite you that much?

               He turns to her, and the grim set of his jaw makes her smile
               vanish.

 ANDERSON                          I used to love being a cop.  

 LISA                          You're still a cop.  I'm a factory
                         worker.  We don't catch murderers.
                         We process them.

               Lisa takes a long breath.  She's been down this road before.
               She speaks reassuringly.

 LISA                          You're the best homicide cop in the
                         country.

	       ANDERSON snorts disdainfully.

 ANDERSON                          Great -- except there's no such thing
                         as homicide.  What I do best doesn't
                         exist anymore.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9. 

 LISA PAUL.                               (beat)
                         You're the Director of a perfect
                         system.  A Cop with a perfect record

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs have a perfect record.
                         They identify the accused -- I just
                         put on my monkey suit and go round
                         them up.

               Lisa hugs him, kisses the back of his neck.

 LISA                          And then I prosecute them.  And they
                         go to jail.  And lives are saved.
                         Thousands of lives.
                              (beat)
                         And that's a cop's dream.

               Anderson is silent for a time.  He sighs, then smiles, and
               turns to his wife, takes her in his arms.

 ANDERSON                          No.  You're a cop's dream.

 INT. THE BATHROOM -- LATER 
               Anderson steps out of the shower, and begins to towel himself
               dry- He glances out a casement window.  He tilts his head,
               curious, then wipes at the steam on the window.

 ANDERSON'S POV LISA 
               Lisa stands in the backyard in her nightgown, talking on a
               cell phone.  She hangs up, moves quickly back into the house.

 ANDERSON 
               Cocks his head, then goes back to toweling off.

 INT. KITCHEN -- LATER 
               Checkered linoleum floor.  Appliances out of the 1950's.

               Except there are little differences.  When Lisa puts a skillet
               of eggs on the stove, the heating element is not an electric
               coil, or gas but a shimmering field of light.

               Lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket.
               Anderson wears a gray suit, thin blue tie, white shirt,
               wingtipped shoes.  He doesn't look up from the newspaper as
               he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          Who called?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. 

               Lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs.  She touches
               her long brown hair.

 LISA                          No one.  I called about my hair.
                         Getting it done this afternoon.

               Anderson looks like he's about to say something else, when
               suddenly someone RAPS on the back screen door.  Anderson and
               Lisa both turn and smile.

 ANDERSON                          Come on in, neighbor.  Want some
                         coffee?

 OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
               FRANK D'IGNAZIO, 65, white-haired, robust, hesitates before
               coming in.  A thin METALLIC ARM with a red laser light arches
               quickly down from above the doorway, shines into each of his
               EYES, scanning the irises.  The arm lifts out of view, the
               screen door UNLATCHES.

               Frank enters the kitchen, carrying a basket of tomatoes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Brought these for your supper.

 LISA                          Oh, Frank.  That's so sweet.  Thank
                         you.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Sweet, nothing.  I gotta get rid of
                         these things.  One plant, and I'm
                         invaded by tomatoes.  When I was a
                         kid ...

               Anderson laughs, claps his friend and neighbor on the back,
               teases him.

 ANDERSON                          Before all this genetically engineered
                         crap ...

               Frank gives him an ornery look, then a smile.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Yeah well, it's true.  It used to be
                         a challenge to grow things.  An art.
                         Now you put one plant in the ground
                         -- then jump the hell out of the
                         way.

               Anderson gestures for Frank to sit down.

 ANDERSON                          Coffee?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. 

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Nah, thanks.  Can't stay.  You guys
                         are rushing off to work anyway.

               Lisa sets the eggs down in front of Anderson.

 LISA                          You and Ellie come for supper then.

 ANDERSON                          We'll barbecue.

               Frank nods and pushes on the screen door.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          You betcha.  We'll bring some more
                         tomatoes -- a new batch will have
                         grown by then.

               They all laugh, Frank exits, Anderson goes back to his paper.

 EXT. DRIVEWAY -- LATER 
               Anderson waves to Lisa.  Her big Studebaker drives off down
               the tree-lined street and away.

               Anderson approaches his Chevy.  He doesn't take out a key to
               unlock it.  There is no lock.  He slides in behind the wheel.
               Doesn't take out a key for the ignition -- there is no
               ignition.

               A thin METALLIC ARM arches down from the sun visor, scans
               Anderson's EYES, identifying him.  A seat harness wraps around
               him, and the car STARTS.

               Anderson picks up a folder marked "Precrime" and begins to
               read through the papers.  The Chevy backs out of the driveway
               and takes him to work.

 EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - ALEXANDRIA, VA -- LATER 
               A vast spread of corporate and government buildings -- the
               spillover from Washington D.C. across the Potomac River into
               Virginia.

               Beyond the white of Washington is "The Sprawl" -- the massive
               unzoned city that has spread uncontrolled on the outskirts
               of the Capitol.  It is impenetrable and uninviting, especially
               to those comfortable in the utopian suburbs.

               Anderson's Chevy moves in a sea of fifties-type cars.
               Occasionally, an ultramodern vehicle zips past them.  In the
               sky above is another sea -- of advertising dirigibles,
               holographic billboards, hovercrafts, skim-jet transports.
               On one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to
               flash: "I LIKE MIKE!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. 

               Then a picture of the smiling President appears.  Then the
               words: "RE-ELECT PRESIDENT MIKE BILLINGS FOR ANOTHER FOUR
 YEARS! KEEP THE PAST IN OUR FUTURE!" 
 INSIDE ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Through his windshield, Anderson glances at a holographic
               road sign.

               THE ROAD SIGN reads: "FBI Headquarters 1 mile.  CIA
               Headquarters 1.5 miles.  PRECRIME Headquarters 2 miles."

               Anderson goes back to his papers.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair.
               He abruptly rises and begins to pace.  The room is large,
               but he paces like a lion confined in a cage.

               He punches an intercom.  A female VOICE responds.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          Yes, Director Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Where's Ennis Page?  Why hasn't he
                         delivered this morning's Precog discs?

               Ed Witwer opens the door to the office., and casually walks
               in.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          I'll find him, sir.

               Ed shakes his head, smiles.

 WITWER                          Bullying the staff again, Director
                         Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Screw you.

               Anderson turns away and stares out a large window.  Witwer
               joins him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Was that fun for you, yesterday?

 WITWER                          The Johnny Palmer bust?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It was okay.  We got our man.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. 

               Anderson takes a long breath.

 ANDERSON                          When do we not get our man?

               They turn as Ennis PAGE, 44, a thin, tight little man with
               burr cut hair, knocks and enters the room.  He carries a
               black BRIEFCASE marked:

               "Zone 218 - Washington/Alexandria, VA." The case is cuffed
               to his wrist.

 PAGE                          Sorry I'm late, sir.  Precogs put
                         out a heavy national volume this
                         morning -- four for our zone.

 ANDERSON (DISTRACTED)                          Put the case on my desk, Ennis.

               Page hesitates, doesn't do it.  Anderson moves quickly to
               Page.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          What was I thinking.

               Anderson leans over the BRIEFCASE.  A small panel recedes, a
               red laser scanner clicks on, scans Anderson's eyes, BEEPS
               affirmatively, then clicks off.  The cuff on Page's wrist
               falls open.

               Now Page puts the case on Anderson's desk.  Page hesitates.
               Anderson and Witwer know just what he's going to do.  Page
               reaches down, unable to resist straightening a pile of papers
               strewn on Anderson's desk.

               Anderson and Witwer exchange knowing smiles.  When Page looks
               up they try to cover, but are not quick enough.  He frowns
               tightly, and heads for the door.

               Anderson calls after him.

 ANDERSON                          Thanks, Ennis.  

               Witwer turns to leave, too.

 WITWER                          Now that's a guy who really cares.

               Witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office.

               Anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk, and opens
               the briefcase.  Four small bright DISCS sit in rows.  He
               removes one, places it in a VIDEO MONITOR that lifts into
               view from the center of his desk.  He sits back, weary, and
               watches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. 

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A young black woman stands in a hallway.  She stares at a
               door, gun in hand.  She opens the door, enters a bedroom.

               She glides toward a bed, where a man lies sleeping.  She
               lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form.

               ANDERSON pops the disc, jots down some notes, pops in a new
               disc.

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A white woman stands at a stove, cooking.  A man comes up
               behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands.
               He raises the necktie toward her neck

 ANDERSON 
               He's not watching the screen.  He is out of his chair now, 
               looking out the window.

 INT. PRECRIME MAIN LOBBY 
               A tour of Precrime is in progress, like the public relations
               tours run by present-day FBI.  The TOUR GUIDE, a pretty,
               smartly uniformed woman in her twenties, leads a group of
               adults and children, all with glowing nametags, through the
               building.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               The group follows the guide slowly through the lobby.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Precrime was established in 2030,
                         with the harnessing of the remarkable
                         talents of the Precognitive mutants.

               She points cheerfully to a stubby little man, MR. HARRIS.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Mr. Harris, can you tell me how many
                         Precogs there are?

 MR. HARRIS                          Three.  Uh, right?

 TOUR GUIDE                          That's exactly right!  A lot of people
                         assume there are Precogs in every
                         branch office.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. 

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          But there are only three Precogs,
                         right here in this building.  And
                         the information they give us, we
                         send out to all the other branches.
                              (beat)
                         And what is that information -what
                         do the Precogs do?

               An eager boy, TIMMY has the answer to that one.

 TIMMY                          They protect us.

               The guide tousles his hair.

 TOUR GUIDE                               (chipper voice)
                         That's right, Timmy.  Because of the
                         Precogs, you're going to grow up
                         murderfree.  Isn't that something?

 MR. HARRIS                          They ever wrong?  The Precogs ever
                         screw up when they predict a murder?

               The guide laughs tolerantly.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Never, sir.  It's an infallible
                         system.  The Precogs predict a
                         homicide, and our Precrime police
                         then apprehend that future murderer
                         before the event occurs.  And right
                         next door is the Judicial Center,
                         where we prosecute the
                         future murderers.

 TIMMY                          Can we see the Precogs?

 TOUR GUIDE                          No, I'm sorry.  That part of the
                         building is not open to the public.
                              (beat)
                         Now, if you'll just step this way
 ... 
               She waves the group on toward an elevator.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The chamber is an elaborate, hypertech hospital, constructed
               for the maintenance of three beings -- the Precogs.  They
               are triplets -- two of the Precogs are male, one is female.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. 

               Technicians swarm all over them like worker bees.  The bodies
               of the Precogs are being tended to: exercised, cleansed,
               groomed.

               The head of each Precog is encased in a complex, ornate HELMET
               that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright
               metallics.  The helmets pulse slightly, and the surfaces
               seem to flow and shift, like oil on water.

               A network of micro-thin cables that are actually strands of
               light, rise Medusa-like from each helmet, then centralize
               into a single strand, and connect to a massive mainframe
               computer.

               The Precogs appear to be in suspended animation, or in comas.
               They are absolutely still and limp -- except for their faces.
               Their faces are in constant motion, the lips mouthing scenes
               from murders only they can see.  Life for a Precog is an
               endless cycle of death.

 CLOSE ON - THE FEMALE PRECOG 
               we recognize her fragile and perfect FACE from the opening
               scene of the movie.  She floats in a glowing nutritive bath.
               Like her brothers, she seems to be eternally young, or
               eternally old.

               The technicians lift her from her bath.  She is dried, dressed
               in a robe, then guided into an over-sized, throne like chair.
               Her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side
               of her.

               Not once are their helmets removed.  What they feed into the
               mainframe is too valuable.  It must be gathered twenty-four
               unrelenting hours a day.

 INT. A ROOM 
               Ennis Page sits in a room just off the Precog Chamber.  He
               can see them through a large window.  He works a large
               computer console, the gathering point for the information
               the Precogs constantly feed the computer.

               Perhaps every ten seconds, a small DISC is released by the
               computer, and mechanically gathered, sorted, and placed -under
               Page's watchful eye -- into a black case.

               ANDERSON is in the room standing quietly behind Page.  As
               Director, Anderson is authorized to come and go, but from
               his fussy movements, it's obvious Page sees anyone else in
               the room as an intruder in his special domain.

               Anderson turns and looks through the window at the Precogs.

 ANDERSON                          What would they think about if we
                         unhooked them?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. 

               Page looks up from his work.

 PAGE                          They don't think, sir.  They just
                         see.

               Anderson is silent.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          They're not even alive, really.

               Anderson contemplates the scene, nods to Page's words, then
               turns and walks out of the room, as Page looks on.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 


               The female Precog sits in her chair.  Her eyes are open.
               She faces the window that looks into Page's main frame room.
               In the window we see Anderson leaving the room.

               The female Precog's eyes drift closed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT.COURTROOM - JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               A trial is in progress.  The defendant is Johnny Palmer.  He
               sits, ashen, at a table, his DEFENSE ATTORNEY beside him.

               There are no jurors in the Juror BOX.  There is a JUDGE, 55,
               and stern.  There are a few people in the public seats.

               The Precrime prosecuting attorney is Lisa Anderson.  She
               wears a black robe, and addresses the Director of Precrime,
               Anderson, who sits in the witness stand.

 LISA                          Director Anderson, do you swear that
                         the disc you now present to the court
                         is the only and authentic disc of
                         the future murder of Carol Palmer by
                         her husband, John Palmer?

               It is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of
               times.  Anderson gives the rote answer as he holds up the
 DISC. 
 ANDERSON                          Yes.  This is the only and authentic
                         disc of the event seen by the
                         Precognitive mutants and recorded by
                         the Precrime Division.  This is the
                         immutable evidence of the infallible
                         system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. 

 LISA                          The murder of Carol Palmer will occur
 ... ? 
 ANDERSON                          In one week -- June 16th, 2040 at
                         10:33 in the morning.

               Lisa steps back.  The judge reaches out and Anderson hands
               him the disc.  The judge inserts it into a special video
               machine on his desk.  Anderson steps down, his ritual part
               in this trial completed.

               A huge MONITOR comes to life behind the judge.  He does not
               turn around to watch -- he has his own monitor.

               Johnny Palmer watches, eyes wide.  We now see, in detail,
               what we previously heard the Precogs act out in the beginning
               of the movie.

 THE MONITOR 
               The Palmer's family room.  Johnny reaches into Carol's sewing
               basket for the scissors.  Carol stands defenseless in front
               of him.  Their son cowers in a corner of the room.

 CAROL                          Johnny, please --

 JOHNNY                          "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 CAROL                          You're scaring me.

 JOHNNY'S SON DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
               Johnny approaches his wife with deadly menace.

 JOHNNY                               (considering)
                         I don't like you any more, Carol.

 CAROL                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me. Please.  

               We cut away from the monitor and stay on JOHNNY PALMER'S FACE 
               as he sits at the defense table.  He winces at each terrible exchange.

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Oh, Carol.

 CAROL (O.S.)                          Johnny!  Stop!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. 

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Don't grab at me!  Let go...

 JOHNNY'S SON (O.S.)                          Daddy!  No!

               Johnny Palmer cries out as the MONITOR goes blank.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do it.  I'm innocent!  It
                         didn't happen!

               The JUDGE hits his gavel.

 JUDGE                          How does the defense plead?

               The defense attorney glances at his watch, then quickly
               rattles off the words to his part of this judicial ritual.

 DEFENSE ATTORNEY                          The defense acknowledges the
                         infallibility of the system.  We are
                         Guilty.  We throw ourselves at the
                         mercy of the court.

 JOHNNY                          No! No! The Precogs are wrong!  No!

               The court guards are on him in an instant.  They lead him
               out of the courtroom.

 INT.A BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson pushes down a tight hallway thick with police and
               enters a disheveled room.  The fifties interior is drab: a
               Formica table, bad curtains, a frayed Lazy Boy positioned in
               front of a TV.

               Ed Witwer is already on the scene.  He stands a few feet
               from the BODY of a man, gunshot wound to the head, a handgun
               on the floor nearby.

 WITWER                               (to Anderson)
                         Looks like the old days.

               Anderson nods to his former partner.  Anderson leans over
               the body.

 ANDERSON                          That would be bad news for an
                         infallible system.

               Witwer is suddenly bored.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 20. 

 WITWER                          We know it can't be a murder -- the
                         Precogs would've seen it.  Why do
                         you insist on coming to these things?

 ANDERSON                          Keeps the system honest.  And besides,
                         I like to pretend I'm a cop.

               Anderson turns to an officer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Who's got the Coroner?

               Another OFFICER steps forward with a large blue case.

 OFFICER                          Right here, sir.

               The officer places the case beside the corpse, and opens the
               latches.  Inside the case is a large metallic APPARATUS: the
               "Coroner."

               It comes to auto-life, and begins to unfold itself - It rises
               crab-like, and steps out of its case.

               Except for his mouth, the doctor doesn't move.  His projected
               image stands beside the body, his arms folded behind his
               back.  He is the interface, the way the humans communicate
               with the crab apparatus.

 ANDERSON                          Hi DOC.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Hello, Director Anderson.

               The coroner crab begins to walk the body, which is face down
               on the floor.  It moves slowly, hesitating as it crawls the
               body's back to insert various razor thin probes and core
               samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord.

 WITWER                          This a homicide, Doc?

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I'm presently analyzing neurohormones,
                         Assistant Director Witwer.  I have
                         not concluded my examination.

               The crab engulfs the back of the head, probes the wound.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          I'm detecting carbonization of skull
                         fragments around the entry wound.

               Witwer whispers to Anderson.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. 

 WITWER                          Bingo.  The guy put the gun to his
                         own head.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I have not determined that yet,
                         Assistant Director.

               Witwer grins.

 WITWER                          You have good ears for a ghost, Doc.

               The coroner crab steps away from the body.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Please rotate the corpse to the
                         lateral supine position.

               Two officers turn the body face-up.  The crab inches close
               to probe the face.  Disconcertingly, it lifts the eyelids,
               and examines the interior of the mouth, so that for a moment
               the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive.

               Then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs At last, it
               comes to a standstill.  The holographic Doctor closes his
               eyes as if in thought.

 WITWER                          Can you imagine if this was a
                         homicide?  Who even knows how to
                         hunt down a killer any more?

               Anderson gives him a hard look.

 ANDERSON                          I know how, dammit.  You know how.

 WITWER                          Easy, partner.
                              (beat)
                         But you know what I'm saying.  The
                         state legislatures are pushing to
                         stop funding for training homicide
                         detectives ...

 ANDERSON                          God bless the Precogs.

               The Doctor opens his eyes.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          This event is a negative homicide.
                         A mortal wound was generated by a
                         .22 calibre bullet self-delivered to
                         the parietal 'portion of the skull

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          Eastern Standard Time.  This event
                         is a positive suicide.

               The holographic doctor begins to shimmer, then disappears
               back into the coroner crab.  The crab crawls back into its
               case, folds its probes and legs tight to its metal body, and
               shuts down.

               Witwer turns to Anderson.

 WITWER                          It's time to stop coming to these,
                         partner.

               Anderson watches as the med techs lift the body onto a
               stretcher.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  You're right.

 INT. A BANQUET - WASHINGTON, D.C. -- NIGHT 
               Anderson, in black-tie, with Lisa in a shimmering blue gown
               at his side, moves through a huge room filled high level
               government officials and politicians.

 ANDERSON                          A little bit of me dies every time I
                         come to one of these things.

 LISA                          It's only a party, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I'd never have let them appoint me
                         to Precrime if I'd have known this
                         was going to be part of it.

 LISA                          You're exactly what Precrime needed.
                         An amazing homicide cop and a real
                         person in an unreal job.

 ANDERSON                          Exactly.  

 LISA 			 The public loves the
                         Precogs.  But they give people the
                         creeps, too.  You're something they
                         understandp a regular cop running
                         things.

               Anderson sighs as he looks around the elegantly appointed
               banquet hall.

 ANDERSON                          Let's invite all these irregular
                         assholes over for a barbecue.  Burgers
                         and beer - think they'd come?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. 

               A barrel-chested man with a great shock of pepper gray hair,
               SENATOR MALCOLM, 58, takes hold of Anderson's elbow from
               behind.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I'd come, Mr. Director.  And I'd
                         make all the other assholes come
                         with me.

               Lisa reddens, Anderson gives an embarrassed cough.  The
               Senator laughs and claps him on the back.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Nice job this morning.  Another
                         negative homicide.  The Precogs never
                         let us down.

               Mrs. Malcolm smoothly occupies Lisa, while the Senator eases
               Anderson in the opposite direction 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                         I have a dream, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I know you do, Senator.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Hundreds of Precogs.  Not just
                         predicting murders, but predicting
                         all crimes.  Burglary, arson, assaults
 ... 
 ANDERSON                          How about jaywalking?  Littering?
                         Now there's a crime.

               The Senator smiles through his teeth.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I don't want a police state, you
                         know that.  But we have an opportunity
                         here, and

 ANDERSON                          No sir, we don't have that
                         opportunity.  There are only three
                         Precogs.  They're a lucky accident
                         of nature.  There are no more.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (beat)
                         We can make more.  Just give me your
                         support.  Help me increase funding
                         for the Precog Engineering Project.

 ANDERSON                          Precogs aren't sheep or pigs.  Seeing
                         into the future is a gift, a
                         nonreproducible event.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          There was only one Mozart, and there
                         are only three Precogs.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Fuck Mozart.  The people want to be
                         safe.  They want that more than they
                         want food or love.

               He gestures at the room full of glittering partygoers.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Look at us -it's 2040 and we've
                         wrapped ourselves up in the 1950's
                         like a big security blanket.  Why?
                         Because we want to feel like they
                         felt.  Safe.

 ANDERSON                          Senator, a world filled with hundreds
                         of Precogs is not my idea of a safe
                         place.

               The Senator gives it one last shot.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Sure could use your help, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I decline, Senator.  I'm sorry.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (icily)
                         Don't think I'll come to your barbecue
                         after all.

               The senator moves off.  Anderson stands stiffly among the
               sea of black-ties and exquisite fifties dresses.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD DAY 
               Anderson walks through the lab with a tall, pale man, DR,
               RESFIELD, 60, the head scientist.  It is not a place that
               warms Anderson's heart.

               Biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting
               and examining protoplasmic tissue masses.  Other technicians
               peer through massive microscopes.  Still others use robotic
               arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded-glass
               barriers.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You don't get out here much.

 ANDERSON                          Not my sort of place.

               Dr. Resfield emits a dry little laugh.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          The head of Precrime squeamish?

 ANDERSON                          When it comes to needles and scalpels,
                         yeah.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I promise we won't use any on you.

 ANDERSON                          What do you use them on?

 DR. RESFIELD                               (beat)
                         On bits of this and that.

               Anderson looks at him.  The doctor pauses outside a thick
               door.  An IdentiScan device quickly reads their eyes, and
               the door opens with an electronic hiss.

               Anderson looks around the lab.  Technicians lower mesh
               cylinders into some sort of chemical VAT.  Another technician
               turns a dial, and an electric charge courses through the
               roiling liquid.

 ANDERSON                          What's happening here?

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're in an interesting phase.

 ANDERSON                          What's in the cylinders?

 DR. RESFIELD                          Neurotissue.

 ANDERSON                          From ...?

 DR. RESFIELD                          A fusion of sources.  From the
                         Precogs' deceased mother.  From the
                         Precogs themselves.

 ANDERSON                          A fusion of ... ?

 DR. RESFIELD                          In lay terms, we mated sperm from
                         the brothers with ova from the mother
                         and sister to create new growth.

               The CYLINDERS shudder as the voltage is increased.

 DR. RESFIELD (CONT'D)                          And then we add mutating variables.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. 

               Anderson stares into the roiling vat.  Dr. Resfield waits
               for more questions.  But it is clear from Anderson's
               expression he has already learned enough.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in his office reviewing Precog discs for
               premurders in the local Washington area. We stay on him as he
               watches the monitor.  He pops the disc, jots down some notes,
               slides in the next disc.

               Anderson's mouth slowly opens.  He leans close to the monitor,
               his face ashen.

 EXT. FRANK D'IGNAZIO'S BACKYARD -- LATER 
               Frank is on his hands and knees, working his vegetable garden.
               He whistles softly under his breath as he trowels the rich
               soil.

               He sits up as he hears someone open the garden gate.  He
               lifts his straw hat in greeting, gives a smile.  It's
 ANDERSON. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          What are you doing, playing hooky?

               Anderson tries to smile.  But it won't come.  He looks around
               the abundant garden.

 ANDERSON                          It's great out here, Frank.. You got
                         the touch.

               Frank straightens with a grimace.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          I got the arthritis, is what I got.

               Anderson reflexively looks up at a high WHINING sound from
               over head.  Frank follows his gaze.  A Precrime HOVERCRAFT
               glides into position overhead.

               Frank stares, then lowers his eyes to the ground.  He takes
               a long sad breath.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          Ah shit, neighbor.
                              (beat)
                         Goddamn Precogs don't miss a beat,
                         do they?
                              (beat)
                         Can we do this inside?  Ellie's not
                         home.

               Anderson's voice is full of pain.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. 

 ANDERSON                          Sure, Frank.  Yeah.

 INT. FRANK'S KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 


               Frank wanders the kitchen, trying to focus on his situation.
               Anderson has trouble meeting his friend's eyes.

               Through a window we can see black suited police officers
               with mirrored helmets swarming outside Frank's house.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (distracted)
                         I thought I'd buried it all.
                         Thirty-five years -- all those minutes
                         and days to bury it.
                              (beat)
                         But suddenly you see the man who
                         murdered your daughter walking the
                         streets -- my God it throws you.

               Frank stops pacing.  He stares at a kitchen drawer.

 ANDERSON                          He'd served his time, Frank.  I know
                         it's not fair.  It's way beyond not
                         fair ...

               Frank looks.  At Anderson bitterly.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (yells)
                         God damn the Precogs.  You know?
                         Why couldn't they have been around
                         to save my girl?
                              (softly)
                         Now they're catching me.

               Frank reaches into the drawer and pulls out a small handgun.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          I really shoot the bastard, huh?
                         When?

 ANDERSON                          Next Wednesday, at noon.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Good.

               Anderson's cop eyes are all over the gun.

 ANDERSON                          It's not in you, Frank, to kill
                         anybody.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28. 

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Tell it to the Precogs.  It's set in
                         stone now, right?

               Frank puts the gun on the kitchen counter.  Anderson relaxes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (almost inaudible)
                         I don't want to be a part of this
                         world anymore.

 ANDERSON                          I know, Frank.

               Frank gives Anderson a look -- no, friend, you don't know.
               Then Frank looks hard at the gun on the counter.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (beat)
                         So.  Tell me, Paul.  Do the Precogs
                         see everything?

 ANDERSON                          No.

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Then they won't have seen this.

               Frank suddenly snatches up the gun and presses it to his own
               head.  On Anderson's anguished FACE, at the SOUND of the gun
               going off.

 EXT. FRONT YARD -- LATER 
               Anderson stands with his old partner, Witwer, on Frank's
               front porch.  Behind them, through an open door, we see Lisa
               comforting Ellie D'Ignazio in the living room.

               Anderson is deeply shaken.  Witwer tries to talk him through
               it.

 WITWER (GENTLY)                          We had to bring him in.

               Anderson doesn't respond.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He was a future murderer.

 ANDERSON                               (angrily)
                         You blame him?  The guy killed his
                         daughter!

               Witwer lets the implication of his words sink in.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Yeah.  I know.  I know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29. 

               Anderson turns and watches as they wheel Frank's draped body
               into the back of an ambulance.  Anderson's bitterness erupts.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I hate the Precogs, Ed. I believe in
                         them absolutely and I hate them
                         absolutely.  Jesus.

               Witwer listens to him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          And that goddamn lab trying to grow
                         more of them.  Put a Precog in every
                         home, you know?  So we can have more
                         Franks - people shooting themselves --
                         over who knows what?

               Witwer kneads Anderson's shoulder, talks to him in soothing
               tones like you'd calm an agitated horse.

 WITWER                          Precrime did the job it was supposed
                         to do.

               The two men can hear Ellie sobbing inside the house.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You know it.  And you believe in it.

 ANDERSON (BEAT)                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It's not easy.  It beats us down.
                         Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates
                         you right now.

               Anderson turns to Witwer.

 ANDERSON                          That's why I got into this business
                         -- to be hated.

               Anderson almost manages a small smile.  Witwer puts his arm
               around him.  Walks him away from the scene.

 WITWER                          They hated us when we were regular
                         cops.  Now we're Precrime, and they
                         still hate US.  It's one of the little
                         perks of law enforcement nobody knows
                         about.

               Their quiet laughter is tinged with sadness.  Anderson looks
               into his partner's good, open face.  Then they both look
               away, their understanding of each other complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30. 

 INT. ANDERSON'S BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT 
               Anderson stares out the window at Frank's house, illuminated
               by the moon.  It's a mournful sight.

               Lisa rises on an elbow and watches him from the bed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS-ALEXANDRIA-DAY - ONE WEEK LATER 
               Ennis Page, in the mainframe room just off the Precog Chamber,
               picks up a black BRIEFCASE marked: "Zone 218 Washington /
               Alexandria, VA." He approaches the door, and his eyes are
               scanned.  The door opens with a HISS.

               We follow Page as he walks through doors and corridors until
               he reaches a long hallway leading to the Director's office.
               Anderson's secretary, Angela, looks up on Page's approach.
               She nods.  He nods.

               He walks around her desk.  His eyes are scanned, and the
               door to Anderson's office opens.

               ANDERSON looks up, wearily.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- LATER 
               Anderson inserts a disc into the video monitor, almost
               absently.  As we have seen him do before, he swivels his
               chair away from the monitor, and stares at Washington D.C.
               across the Potomac.  Hovercrafts and transports skim through
               the sky above the Washington Monument.

               The camera stays on Anderson's back as the sound from the
               Precog disc begins.  He hears his own voice speaking in
               strained, agitated tones.

 ANDERSON (O.S.)                          Let's not do this, Ed.

               Anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and
               horror at the monitor.

 THE MONITOR 
               shows Anderson and Witwer in a room, a few feet apart pointing
               guns directly at each other.  Their eyes intense and panicked.
               Who murders whom?

               Ed's eyes cut to a huge digital clock on the wall as the red
               seconds tumble away.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31. 

               Witwer lowers his gun.  He stands unresisting before

               Anderson.

               Witwer sees his own death in Anderson's wild eyes, has always
               seen it.

               Anderson FIRES his weapon, puts a bullet straight into
               Witwer's heart, throwing him back against a wall.  Witwer
               slumps, dying, beneath the huge digital clock, which reads:

 5:20 AM. 
 BACK TO SCENE 
               Anderson stares as the monitor fades to a blank.  His hand
               goes to his mouth.  His body begins to shake.  He hugs
               himself, but he can't stop the shaking.

               The DISC pops out of the side of the monitor.  It is a small
               SOUND, but it has Anderson up and out of his chair as if it
               were a gunshot, He reaches for the disc but cannot touch it.
               His legs suddenly weaken, and he drops to one knee beside
               his desk, like a man in need of prayer.

               There is a single thought that screams through his brain.
               It is an almost visible thing, filling the room, blackly.
               Anderson whispers the sickening words that shape his fate.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I kill you.
                              (beat)
                         Oh god, I kill you.

               As Anderson pulls himself up, and tries to reach again for
               the disc ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In an image just like the scene in the beginning of the movie,
               the three FACES of the Precogs hover in the misty darkness.
               Their closed eyes open in SUDDEN UNISON.  They speak as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               After a long moment, the eyes close again, and the Precogs
               fade into the mists ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE 
               Anderson looks up sharply at the SOUND of a knock on his
               door.  Every normal sound seems grotesquely AMPLIFIED, the
               traffic outside, his own breathing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32. 

               His senses are on overload.

               The door begins to open.  A stockinged leg is the first thing
               Anderson sees.  His secretary, ANGELA.

 ANGELA                          Sir?

               She hesitates before fully entering the room, Anderson grabs
               at the incriminating disc.  He sees his EYES reflected in
               its alloy surface.  He pushes the disc deep into his pants
               pocket.

               Somehow he finds his voice.

 ANDERSON                          Come in.  Angela.

               She looks at him, uncertain.  Then she places a small stack
               of papers on his desk.

 ANGELA                          Need you to sign these.  And your
                         eleven o'clock starts in five minutes.

 ANDERSON                          My ... eleven.

 ANGELA                               (beat)
                         Budget coordination with the FBI.
                              (beat)
                         You okay, sir?

               Anderson runs his hand through his hair, can't think fast
               enough.  He sees her glance at the black Precog disc case.
               He shuts it, awkwardly, and it auto-locks.

 ANDERSON                          Have Page take this.

               Angela steps back, disturbed.

 ANGELA                          But sir, the procedure

 ANDERSON (SNAPS)                          I make procedure.  Call him.
                              (long beat)
                         I'm not okay, Angela ... you're right.

               My head and stomach.  I'm going down to the clinic.  Or maybe
               just home.

               Angela looks relieved at the explanation.

 ANGELA                          Yes sir.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 33. 

               He moves past her.  His FINGERS fidget against the hidden
               disc in his pocket.

 ANDERSON                          I'll speak to Witwer, put him in
                         charge for the rest of the day.

               He hesitates at the door, turns to look at his office, and
               at his view of Washington.  Then he is gone.

 INT. OUTSIDE WITWER'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Anderson looks in the door Of Witwer's empty office.  He
               takes a step inside.

               Witwer's booming voice sounds from behind him, startling
               him.

 WITWER                          Breaking and entering.  That'll get
                         you five to ten, hard.

               Witwer immediately scans his old partner's ashen face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          What's wrong?

               Anderson can hardly bear to meet his friend's eyes.  He
               REACHES into his pocket, as if to lift the disc into the
               light.  If he could just do that, show it to Witwer.

 WITWER                          Paul?

               Anderson's hand comes out of his pocket, EMPTY.

 ANDERSON                          Take over for me today?

 WITWER                          You sick?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

               Witwer makes a show of backing away.

 WITWER                          Don't give it to me.  You probably
                         have that Trans-10 virus going around.
                         A stomach thing.  I hate stomach
                         things.

               Anderson Almost smiles.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34. 

 WITWER                          Yeah?

               Witwer looks at him.  Anderson almost reaches out for him.

 ANDERSON                          Run the place, okay?

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         Sure.  Right into the ground.
                              (beat)
                         Go on home before I call Infectious
                         Control and have them spray you down
                         with something.

               Anderson moves unsteadily down the hallway.  Witwer calls
               out.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You want me to do the discs, or hold
                         them for you to review when you get
                         back?

 ANDERSON                          Can't let them back up.  Do 'em.

 WITWER                          Call you later.  Take it easy, all
                         right?

               Witwer lifts his hand in farewell, Anderson fixes on that
               last image -- Witwer waving goodbye.

 INT. PRECRIME UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- LATER 
               Anderson, sweating now, leans against a thick cement pillar
               and pulls out a cell phone.  He hits a button.

 INTERCUT BETWEEN ANDERSON / LISA AT THE JUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa sits in a meeting.  Her phone CHIRPS softly.  She glances
               at the display, then rises to take it.  She goes to a corner
               of the room.

 LISA                          Paul?

 ANDERSON                          Listen to me.

               Lisa presses her phone close to her ear.

 LISA                          I can hardly hear you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 35. 

 ANDERSON                          I'm underground.  Weakens the signal
                         so it can't be picked up.

               Alarm moves across her face.

 LISA                          But we're on Secure

 ANDERSON                          Listen, dammit!  I'm going to murder
                         Ed.

               The Precogs picked it up.

               On Lisa -- can she have heard right?

 LISA                          Paul.  Paul His crackling voice
                         faintly comes through the phone.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          ... home.

               Lisa's phone goes dead.

 BACK TO ANDERSON 
               Anderson looks down a long row of parked Precrime ground
               transports.  They are sleek and menacing, the black shells
               lumpy with dangerous gadgetry.  In the distance, a POLICE
               OFFICER, holding an armful of equipment, opens the back of
               one of them.

               He looks up at Anderson's approach.  He puts his equipment
               down, and salutes.

 POLICE OFFICER                          Hello, sir.

               Anderson nods, moves close.

 ANDERSON                          What's your name, officer?

 POLICE OFFICER                          Bob, uh, Robert Smythe.

 ANDERSON                          These the new Python transports?

               The young officer turns and looks at the transport with pride,
               is about to speak, when Anderson touches a palm-sized Nova
               stun gun to the base of his neck.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (sincerely)
                         Sorry, Officer Smythe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 36. 

               The officer buckles.  Anderson catches him, rolls him gently
               into the back of the transport.

               Then Anderson quickly reaches into the transport, and begins
               stuffing equipment into a duffel bag: a helmet and black
               uniform, the weapon-glove, a folded rifle, a holographic
               scanner, and other equipment whose function we can only guess
               at.

               Anderson looks up at a sound, echoey FOOTSTEPS.  They
               approach, then fade away.

               Anderson places the officer's hands and legs together, then
               aims a nozzled cylinder at them.  He shoots a spray of blue
               BindFoam chemical restraint, sticking the man to the floor
               of the transport in an adhesive glob.

               Then he leaves the scene, running.

 INT. ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Anderson grips the wheel of his Chevy, driving down 1-95.
               The fact that he can't control his car -- that the steering
               wheel has no function, his speed is predetermined, and his
               direction is guided by satellite -- is maddening now.

               From inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn
               and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his
               steering wheel.

               Anderson slams it with his fist.  Through his windshield
               Anderson sees a four year old boy in the driver's seat of a
               passing red and black Ford.  His mother sits in the
               passenger's seat, blithely reading.  The boy mimics Anderson,
               gleefully slams his steering wheel too, then laughs.

               Anderson turns and looks the other way, into the distance,
               at the "Sprawl,' the vast unzoned city attached to Washington
               D.C. You can see it in his face: a man could lose himself in
               there.

 EXT. POTOMAC PARK 
               Anderson stands on an embankment.  He holds the Precog disc
               in his hand, ready to throw it into the river.

               He stands like that ... and then slowly lets his hand drop.
               He doesn't do it.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOME - SUBURBS -- LATER 
               Lisa enters the house, in a rush.  Every shade is drawn.
               Paul Anderson sits in an overstuffed chair, absolutely
               motionless, like a man who has died suddenly.

 ANDERSON                          Don't move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 37. 

               Lisa doesn't get it.  She continues toward him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Stop!  Moving heats you up, makes it
                         easier for them to pick you up on
                         their thermals.

               She looks at him, scared, stops in her tracks.  She is
               suddenly suffocating.

 LISA                          It's a hundred degrees in here.

 ANDERSON                          I turned the furnace all the way up.
                         Your hair dryer.  The oven.  If they
                         come, it'll buy me twenty seconds.
                         Maybe thirty.

 LISA                          Nobody's coming for you.

               Anderson stares at her.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          On the phone -- what you said.  It's
                         impossible.

               She shakes her head in disbelief.  Anderson speaks, choking
               on the words.

 ANDERSON                          I'm going to kill Ed Witwer.

 LISA                          It's not true.

               Anderson's right hand hangs over the side of his armchair.
               We see the bright DISC cupped in the palm.  He seems about
               to reveal it to her, but doesn't, yet.  He keeps staring at
               her intently.  Something is holding him back.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You're upset.  You've been unhappy.
                         There's a lot of pressure on you.
                         And then Frank ...

 ANDERSON                          One week from today.  Tuesday, June
                         25, at five-twenty in the morning.
                         I shoot him, Lisa.

 LISA                               (beat)
                         You need to take time off.

               Anderson laughs harshly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38. 

 ANDERSON                          You don't have to worry about that.

               She steps toward him.

 LISA                               (gently)
                         I want to hold you.

 ANDERSON                          If you love me, stand there.  And
                         don't move.

               Tears well in her eyes.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the disc, Lisa.  I shoot him.
                         In the chest.  And he dies.  I've
                         watched a thousand murders.  This
                         time I star in one.

 LISA                          Something's wrong.  You wouldn't do
                         it.

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs are never wrong.  They
                         emit a single disc.  "The immutable
                         evidence of the infallible system."

               The room is terribly hot, his words -- she begins to sway
               unsteadily.

               Anderson focuses on her.  Her face.  Her hair ...

 LISA                          We'll figure this out.  We'll review
                         the system.

 ANDERSON                          There is no review.  There's only
                         the disc.  It Shows My guilt.  There's
                         no defense.

               Her long hair.  He stares.

 LISA                          You can't run.  Please, let's --

               A SOUND outside.  They both turn.  A deep silence.  The
               furnace churns out heat.  And Anderson looks at Lisa's hair
               ... and finally understands.

               Slowly, and very carefully, Anderson slides the DISC back
               into his pocket.  He rises from his chair.  For the first
               time he goes to her, reaches out, and touches her hair.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39. 

 ANDERSON                          Last week.  It was strange.  I watched
                         from the bathroom window.  You went
                         out in the backyard to make a call.

               She looks at him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          An appointment, you said.  For a
                         haircut that afternoon.

               Lisa's hand jumps to her hair.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          You didn't get your hair cut.  You
                         went to the trouble of calling first
                         thing in the morning.  It was that
                         important ...

               She reaches for him.  He pulls away.

 LISA                          Stop it!  Paul, please.  You're
                         panicking.  Everything's going to
                         look wrong.  You're going to distrust
                         everybody and everything now.

               Lisa implores him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You can't distrust me.
                              (beat)
                         It was Ed I called.

               Anderson cocks his head.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.  why outside?  Why lie about it?

 LISA                          Stop being a cop and listen to me!

               A booming, electronically altered VOICE suddenly penetrates
               the walls of the house from outside.

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Director Anderson!  There is no
                         escape!

               Anderson, betrayed, glares at his wife.  She's frantic.

 LISA                          Your birthday's tomorrow!  We wanted
                         to...

               But be's already on the move, running for the upstairs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 40. 

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Drop to your hands and knees and
                         stay there.  Precrime is entering
                         your house!

               Lisa screams, as her front door is sonically BLASTED off its
               hinges, and a swarm of Precrime officers in mirrored helmets
               hurtle in.

 LISA                          Paul!

	       They move past her and spread through the rooms and up the 
               stairs like a disease in fast motion.

 UPSTAIRS 
               Helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out,
               scanning rooms for thermal presence.

               An OFFICER 1 steps out of a small room.  He speaks, his voice
               electronically altered.

 OFFICER 1                          He's got a hair dryer going.  Screwed
                         up my reading.

               The others nod.

 OFFICER 2                          We're not picking up shit.

               They rush into rooms, with increased urgency.  We follow
               OFFICER 1 as he moves counter to the group and down the
               stairs.

               He hesitates as he moves through the living room, which is
               awash in personnel.  Lisa stands against the wall, pale and
               shaken.  He looks at her for a long beat, then steps over
               the shattered door and out into the sunlight.

 OUTSIDE 
               Everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm.
               But Anderson's house looks like a wasps's nest someone has
               kicked.  Four Precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it,
               engines WHINING.  Black Python transports are all over the
               street out in front, and more keep coming.

               And everywhere on foot, there are Precrime police.  OFFICER
               I approaches a Python ground transport.  Another officer
               guards it, weapon out, his head turning right to left.  He
               settles on OFFICER 1's approach and raises his weapon.

               OFFICER 1 doesn't even break stride.  He walks right up to
               the guard -- and then right through him.  A holograph decoy.
               OFFICER 1 enters the Python.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 41. 

 INSIDE THE PYTHON 
               OFFICER 1 removes his helmet -- it's Anderson.  And then
               comes the moment of truth -- have they cancelled his
               IdentiScan access to Precrime vehicles yet?

               A little scanner arm arches down from the visor, and flashes
               a red beam into his eyes.  Anderson presses his lips together.
               The Python turns on, and a generated voice greets him.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson 0256 clear.

               Anderson grips the steering wheel.  But his time, since it
               is a law enforcement.  Vehicle, the steering actually works.
               Anderson pulls out.

               FROM ABOVE, as the Python transport slips away from the chaos.

               THEN HIGHER, and we see that the direction the Python is
               headed will take it from the green of the suburbs, through
               the white of Washington, and into the dark of The Sprawl.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 


               Ed Witwer sits alone in an antechamber.  He stares at an
               oversized oak door, then looks down at the floor.

               He runs both hands through his hair.  He is tired, his eyes
               weary, lost.

               A voice comes over the intercom.

 VOICE                          Enter now please, Assistant Director
                         Witwer.

               Witwer pulls himself together, and opens the door.

 INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM 
               Witwer takes a seat at the end of a long table.

               Powerful men sit at the other end of the table.  SWANSON,
               sharp-boned, the FBI Director.  CRONIN, awl-like eyes, the
               CIA Director.  Senator Malcolm.  Chief Justice POLLARD, whose
               face reveals nothing.  Vice-President ALMER, whose tongue
               darts across his dry lips unsettlingly.  Unpleasant looking
               men in an unpleasant mood.

               Cronin looks up from a printout he's been reading and stares
               at Witwer.

 CIA CRONIN                          The central question is: Why does
                         Anderson want to kill Witwer?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42. 

               Cronin holds up the printout.

 CIA CRONIN (CONT'D)                          We checked your finances.  His
                         finances.  Nothing irregular, you
                         don't steal from him, he doesn't
                         steal from you.  You haven't done
                         anything that he might have
                         discovered, and vice versa.

               Swanson holds up another sheath of papers.

 FBI SWANSON                          Personnel checks reveal no ambitious
                         coups planned by you to topple him.
                              (beat)
                         He's done nothing to you, or you to
                         him.

               Witwer presses his lips together.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          You fucking his wife?

 WITWER                          No.

 FBI SWANSON HIS MOTHER? HIS BROTHER? 
               Witwer gives him a bad look.

 FBI SWANSON (CONT'D)                          Okay.  There we are.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          So, you are friends, partners, and
                         soul mates.  Anderson has no motive.

 WITWER                          I can't think of one.
                              (beat)
                         Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs
                         are mistaken?

               Witwer looks away.  Jesus, he wants out of this room.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You don't believe that, do you?

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         No.  The Precogs are infallible.

               Senator Malcolm is impatient with all this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43. 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          You're goddam right.  So, gentlemen
                         -screw the motive.  We got a
                         pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty
                         little PR problem.

               The very powerful men level their unpleasant gazes on Witwer.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And here is our solution.  You are
                         now Director Witwer.

               Witwer shakes his head, starts to protest.  Almer silences
               him with a raised finger.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER (CONT'D)                          Precrime must demonstrate its
                         willingness to go after one of its
                         own.  Total impartiality.

 WITWER                          Now look--

               Cronin talks right over him.

 CIA CRONIN                          The public must believe that every
                         future murderer is pursued with equal
                         vigor.

 FBI SWANSON                          Therefore, Precrime will put in charge
                         the man best suited to the job.  And
                         who would pursue a murderer harder
                         ... than his intended victim?

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You went after Anderson yesterday
                         -because it was right, and because
                         you believe.

               Almer speaks with a tight irony.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And your belief will certainly grow
                         stronger with each tick of the clock.

               Witwer looks at the men with thinly-veiled hatred.  But he
               does not deny their words.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          Haw long will it take, Director?

               Wiltwer takes a long breath, concentrates his mind on the
               task he can't avoid.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 44. 

 WITWER                          He knows Precrime, of course.  And
                         the streets -- he's rusty, but he'll
                         remember how to work them.  It'll
                         come back to him fast.  He's ... the
                         best.

               Witwer almost smiles.  Justice Pollard's not smiling.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          We're not here to praise Caesar --
                         we're here to bury him.

               Witwer looks at Pollard, then lifts a finger and touches his
               right eye.

 WITWER                          He can't avoid iris identification.
                         Every door he opens, every ATM he
                         uses, or taxi or transport he boards
                         -- he'll get scanned.
                              (quietly)
                         It won't take long to find him.  

	       The eyes that look back at Witwer are unblinking.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL NIGHT 
               The unzoned city is full of 1950's iconography, but it all
               feels different than it did in the suburbs.  Where the burbs
               were Ike, the city is Joseph McCarthy.

               The fat Ramblers and Studebakers have a little grime on them.
               The women's dresses are tighter and more urgent, the men's
               suits have some shine at the elbows.  You look over your
               shoulder here, move faster, and smile a lot less.

               And some streets you don't go on at all.  Anderson's Python
               moves down one of them.  He stops under a blackened suspension
               bridge, gets out.  He's still in uniform.  He holds a duffel
               bag.

               He starts to walk away from the Python, then hesitates.
               He's left the door open.  He shakes his head at his
               sloppiness.  Goes back and shuts the door.  Walks away again.

 INSIDE THE CAR 
               He's left a small DEVICE on the passenger's seat.  Digital
               numbers shoot by in reverse.  Something CLICKS.

 OUTSIDE THE CAR 
               Anderson continues walking away.  He doesn't look back as
               the Python is engulfed in a miniature sun of heat and flame.
               It's not a gasoline powered vehicle -- so it doesn't explode.
               It just ceases to exist.

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS - -- NIGHT LATER 
               Through a smeared window Anderson sees racks of suits and
               dresses hanging in clear plastic bags.  He gets to work on
               the door.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
               Lisa lies in her bed, alone in the dark.  She listens to an
               almost inaudible sound, a high WHINE.

               A Precrime HOVERCRAFT floats high above her house, a dark
               moon in the low clouds.

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS -- EARLY MORNING 
               A worker stands in the back of the store puzzling over the
               clean clothes piled on the floor.  It almost looks like a
               nest, like someone slept there

 EXT. SUBWAY LATER 
               Anderson, in a blue suit and fedora, carrying his duffel
               bag, stands on a subway platform.  He takes out a cell phone,
               dials a number.  He looks up at the SOUND of a train.

               The approaching MagLev train has a lit sign on its front
               car: "33rd Street Express."

               displays.

               A Precrime TECHNICIAN 1 suddenly sits upright.  Witwer picks
               him out of the crowd and zeroes in.

 TECHNICIAN                          It's Anderson.

               Witwer grabs a phone, punches a button

 WITWER                          Paul!

 ANDERSON                          My wife calling you before breakfast?

 WITWER                          We were planning a surprise party.
                         It was going to be today.
                              (beat, ironic)
                         Happy birthday, partner.

 ANDERSON                          This party's no fun, Ed. It's a hell
                         of a surprise, though.

                         I'm having trouble trusting people,
                         Ed, I gotta tell you.

               At Precrime, they upload a MAP DISPLAY of the Express train's
               route.  We see a blue light moving -- the train.  And two
               separate red dots along its route.

               An OFFICER points at the dots, and speaks to Witwer in a low
               voice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 47. 

 OFFICER                          The train makes two stops, here and
                         here: 20th, then 33rd Street.

 OFFICER                          We'll never make 20th

 ANDERSON                          You there, Ed?

 WITWER                          I'm here.  You gotta come in, Paul .

 ANDERSON                          I'm a Cop, Ed. I need a motive.

 WITWER                          Come in.  We'll figure this thing

 WITWER                          It'll get ugly if you keep running.
                         And your eyes, Paul -- every move
                         you make a Scanner will pinpoint you
                         for us.

 ANDERSON                          I saw a news flash.  You're the new
                         Director.  Is that the point of this?

 WITWER                          Fuck you.

               Anderson smiles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 48. 

 ANDERSON                          Didn't think so.  But it has to be
                         something, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the DISPLAY MAP.  We see the blue train
               nearing its first stop, 20th street.  We see two waves of
               lighted green dots -- Precrime units heading for 20th and
               33rd.

 WITWER                          Paul.  Come in.

               Anderson sees an overhead light come on in the train: "Next
               Stop 20th Street.

 ANDERSON                          If I come in, it puts me close to
                         you.  If I get close ... I may kill
                         you.  I can't risk that.

                         Anyway, they'd force you to lock me

                         get my chance to solve this thing.

               Witwer needs to keep him talking

 WITWER                          You're kinds liking this, in a way,
                         aren't you?  The action ...

 ANDERSON                          And you get to be a real cop again.

               -- he's going on to 33rd Street, the last stop.

               Technician 2 presses his earphone close, listens, then calls
               over to Witwer.  Witwer covers his mouthpiece.

 TECHNICIAN 2                          We have visual verification -- he's
                         still on the train.

               Witwer gives him a thumb's up.  We STAY ON Witwer as he
               listens to Anderson, and watches his train move toward 33rd
               on the MAP.

               Witwer nods.  Now the MAP shows all the Precrime units

 EXT. STREET - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 


               Every city has its underbelly.  If you lifted the fat dark
               underbelly of The Sprawl this is where you'd end up.

               The streets here feel like alleys, clotted and tight.  There
               are streetlights, bright ones -- but the light dies at its
               source, never makes it through the sour air down to the
               ground.

               The retro fifties look comes apart here.  The people that
               you see -- and you only catch quick glimpses of them, they
               move like rats -- wear black mostly, tight fitting
               tech-fibers.

               ANDERSON'S caught one of the rats, a thin bald guy in black.
               Anderson has him pinned up against a wall.  They're having
               some kind of exchange -- which consists of the guy answering
               none of Anderson's questions, and Anderson pressing him harder
               against the wall.

               Finally, the guy does something odd.  He lifts a finger and
               pulls down Anderson's right lower eyelid.  Anderson lets
               him.  Then the guy does the same on the left.  Has a long
               look.  And then nods.  Anderson releases him, and they go
               off together.

 EXT. AN APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER 
               An oppressive brick thing on a side street.  The facade is
               crumbling.  Nothing good happens in a building like this..

               The guy leads Anderson to the building, then scurries off
               into the night.

 INT. ROOM -- LATER 
               A stained overstuffed chair in the corner, a dreary little
               kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink.

               But jarringly, in the center of all this, is a make-shift
               hypertech medical setup: a gleaming operating table, an array
               of lasers, scalpels and surgical equipment, an anesthesia
               console.

               Anderson sits in a chair facing DOC.  DOC is a big man with
               delicate fingers.  He sneezes, then blows his nose hard into
               a handkerchief.

 DOC                          Got a cold.

               Anderson looks at him uneasily.  It's not just DOC -- it's
               the whole setup, the needles and scalpels, the medical thing,
               which Anderson truly does not care for.  Doc sneezes again,
               then looks up at his patient.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 52. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          Don't worry.  I could cut open your
                         chest, sew a dead cat in there, and
                         you'd never get an infection.  Not
                         with the spectrum antibios I'll be
                         shooting into you.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not here for cat surgery, Doc.

               Doc chuckles.  Then he waits, expectantly.

               Anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card.  A preset cash
               card.  DOC slides it into small console, watches the numbers
               flash up.  He frowns, sighs.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          It's all I could safely move

               He waits.  Doc's not thrilled, but finally, he nods.

 DOC                          Yeah.  All right.

               Time to got down to business.  Doc walks over to a large
               medical cabinet and opens the door.  It's full of EYES, and
               parts of eyes -- 611 !  A cryo-jars.

               Anderson tightens.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          You understand what I told you then.
                         I can't just give you new irises.
                         The Scanners will read the scar
                         tissue.  Alarms will go off.

 ANDERSOIN                          I'm a cop, I know

 DOC                          I gotta take your eyes out.

               Anderson knows this, too, wishes Doc would shut up ANDERSON
               Yeah.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          And put in new ones.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  I get it, DOC.

               Anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the
               operating table.  He lies down.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Do me quick before I run out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53. 

               Anderson lies there, blinking up at the ceiling.  He listens
               to Doc preparing instrument trays.  It's a bad sound.

               Witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the
               Potomac.  It's a pose a track dog might hold, nose up, testing
               the air for a scent.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               We can't see anything at first, because Anderson can't see
               anything either.  He's in a deep post-surgical haze.  DOC'S
               voice comes to him.  It's warped and ugly.

 DOC'S VOICE                          Don't take the bandages off for twenty
                         four hours.  You'll go blind if you
                         do.

               Anderson makes an affirmative grunt. Now we see his
               surroundings, even though Anderson still can't.  He lies in
               a grungy bed, his head and eyes swathed in white dressings.
               Doc stands over him.

 DOC                          You're in a room.  I had you moved
                         here, a couple miles from my place.
                         If they find you, they don't find
                         me.

               Anderson grunts weakly.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          A guy will come in, feed you once.
                              (beat)
                         I juiced up the nano-reconstruction
                         around your new eyes, 'cause I know
                         you're in a hurry.

 ANDERSON                               (Fuzzily))
                         Nano-re ...construction.

 DOC                          Organic microrobots that reconstruct
                         nerves and blood vessels.  It'll
                         feel like fleas chewing on your
                         eyeballs.  Don't scratch.

               Anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages.
               Doc forces them away.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 54. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm giving you a bonus, might come
                         in handy.  Feel this.

               Doc takes an air-syringe out of his pocket and touches it to
               Anderson's hand.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          It's a temporary paralytic enzyme.
                         Someone spots you, you duck into an
                         alley, shoot this under your chin.

               Doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of Anderson's
               chin.  Anderson jumps.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          The enzyme turns your facial muscles
                         to mush.  You won't look like the
                         same man.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus.

 DOC                          You tighten up again in about thirty
                         minutes.  Hurts like nothing you
                         ever felt.  It's vicious, but
                         effective.  I'll put it in your bag.

               Finally, Doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places
               it on a dresser beside Anderson's bed.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm setting up a timer.  When it
                         buzzes tomorrow, take off your
                         bandages, and get the hell out of
                         here.

               Anderson, groggy, starts to say something else, but then he
               hears a door open and close, and Doc is gone.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               The Precrime presence mounts on the streets.  A couple of
               units move past the boarding house, but they don't stop.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in a chair, his dressings like a blindfold.
               He looks like a hostage.  He is sweating.  Keeps reaching
               for his dressings to scratch, then forces himself not to.

               He speaks to someone we don't yet see.  The guy DOC said
               would come.

 ANDERSON                          I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 55. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Guess I should eat.  
				(Beat) 
			 You gonna help feed me?

               Now the camera moves and we see who it is that has been sent
               to help Anderson.  It's the rat guy, the thin bald man
               Anderson had roughed up the day before.  The guy has a bowl
               of hot soup in his hands.  He stares contemptuously at
               Anderson.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          So how do we do this, pal?

               The rat guy doesn't say a word.  He simply tips the hot soup
               and it splatters down into Anderson's lap.  Anderson cries
               out in pain and surprise.  The guy walks out of the room.

 CLOSE ON- THE TIMER 
               Twenty hours gone by.  Four more to go.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Precrime cops are shaking down any of the rats they can catch,
               looking for leads, looking for anything.

 INT. THE BOARDING ROOM 
               The TIMER shows one hour to go.  Anderson sits in a chair,
               squirming miserably.  His dressings are wet with sweat, and
               frayed and dirty at the edges where he has tugged and plucked
               at them.

 ANDERSON                               (to himself)
                         Fuck.

               He is this close to ripping the dressings off

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- DAY 
               A Precrime transport stops.  Two officers get out.  One of
               them sets up a large thermal scanner on the sidewalk, and
               does a read on the boarding house.  The other does a read on
               a pawn shop and bar next door..

               The OFFICER 1 doing Anderson's boarding house, calls to the
               other officer.

 OFFICER 1                          Got 27 warm bodies in this place.
                         What should it take, three or four
                         Spiders?

 OFFICER 2                          Do four.  Speed things up, so we can
                         go eat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56. 

               The Officer 1 opens the back of the transport, and takes out
               a box.  He removes four round BALLS.  They are silver, as
               big as billiard balls.

               He goes up to the boarding house, gets IdentiScanned, and
               the front door opens.  He rolls the balls down a dark hallway.

               Then he goes back out to the transport, and leans against
               it, bored.  He holds up an electronic clipboard and waits
               for the data to come in.

 INT. THE BUILDING 
               The BALLS roll about eight feet, then suddenly come to
               autolife as they spin.  They open like flowers -- flowers
               with legs.

 CLOSE ON : A BALL 
               A fist-sized Spider takes shape.  On its head is an IdentiScan
               lens mounted on a thin metallic antenna.

 INT. A ROOM 
               An OLD WOMAN sits at a card table eating a bowl of something
               unidentifiable.  She looks up with annoyance as she sees a
               spider scuttling across the floor toward her.  It makes a
               CLICKING sound on the floor as it comes.  She's poor, living
               in The Sprawl -- she knows the drill.  She continues to eat
               as the SPIDER crawls up the leg of the card table.  She barely
               watches as it moves past her bowl and toward her hand.

 OLD WOMAN                          It's nice to have a little company

               She smiles toothlessly at her joke The Spider hops onto her
               am and inches up, then moves across her shoulder.  It grips
               her cheek lightly, as the IdentiScan antenna reads her eyes.

               Then it leaps off her and onto the floor and CLICKS away
               across the linoleum.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Precrime officer lifts his clipboard and checks a column
               with his laser pen, and waits for the next one.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson sits in his chair.  He cocks his head, listening.
               His body tenses.  Something feels wrong.

               The TIMER shows ten minutes to go.  Blindfolded for a day
               and a night, Anderson has no idea how much time he has left.
               Three seconds, four hours?

               A flattened SPIDER squeezes under his door.  Anderson tenses
               as it CLICKS across the floor toward him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57. 

               He knows that sound.

               Anderson stumbles up and out of his chair.  He starts to
               grab at his dressings, remembers Doc's warning, and stops
               himself.  The SPIDER waits for him to settle, then CLICKS
               toward him again.

               Anderson moves around the room, avoiding the Spider.  He is
               dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard.  The Spider
               comes faster.  Anderson crashes into a table, brings it down.
               Falls across the bed.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Officer 1 squints at his clipboard.  One of the Spiders
               is taking too long.  He adjusts his thermal scanner, and
               sees the heat outline of a man bouncing around a room.

               The other Officer 2 finishes reading the pawn shop and the
               barroom, then wanders over to Officer 1. They both watch the
               screen.

 OFFICER 1                          Stinking drunk.

 OFFICER 2                               (beat)
                         Or a guy who doesn't want to get
                         read.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson forces himself to sit still, because he knows the
               consequences.  The Spider advances, starts up his leg.

               The TIMER has not buzzed.  Anderson can't touch his dressings.
               The Spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face.  It
               WHIRS and HUMS trying to adjust its antenna against the
               dressings.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers eye the thermal scanner, as they reach for their
               mirrored helmets, getting ready to go in.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               The Spider crawls all over Anderson's head, trying to get
               past the dressings for a read.

               Anderson has no choice.  None.  He starts to lift at his
               dressing.  The Spider senses his cooperation, freezes in
               place.

               Anderson wants to scream.  He unwraps his head, tugs the eye
               pads away from his eyes.  He rips them off.  The Spider sits
               on his shoulder, waiting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58. 

               Anderson's eyes are tightly closed.  He opens them

 ANDERSON'S POV - BLINDING LIGHT 
               Light brighter than a magnesium burn, brighter than a nuclear
               flashpoint.  Light to buckle the knees and push the brain
               beyond endurance.

               And though all this the faraway sound of a BUZZER going off.
               The TIMER has finally sounded.  Anderson's open eyes are
               streaming with tears, but he has survived the moment.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE ROOM 
               It comes into slow focus The Spider, all business, reads his
               eyes.  Then, as if nothing unusual has occurred, it jumps
               off his shoulder, and crosses the floor.  It flattens, scoots
               under the door, and is gone.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers see that the Spider has gotten its read.  They
               pull off their helmets.

 OFFICER 1                          Let's eat.

               They start putting their equipment back into the transport.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson stares at himself in a dusty mirror.  His new eyes
               are tender and bloodshot.  And they are not blue, like the
               ones he was born with, but a deep brown.  Anderson is exactly
               the same, and utterly different.

               He grabs his duffel bag, and gets the hell out of there.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTER'S -- DAY 
               Lisa, looking drawn and scared, sits in Witwer's office.
               Witwer isn't looking too well, either.

 WITWER                          They told me to move into Paul's
                         office.  I said fuck you very much.

               Lisa nods.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (softly)
                         I don't want to do any of this, Lisa.

 LISA                          I know.  I know that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         Everybody's got their reasons for
                         wanting you in charge.  So do I --
                         you won't bring him in dead.

 WITWER                          Yeah.  But if he shoots a cop ...
                              (beat)
                         Which is what he does four days from
                         now, isn't it?

               Witwer's eyes imp involuntarily to a CLOCK on his desk.

 LISA                          He'd never hurt you.

 WITWER                          I know that.  But the other thing I
                         know is -- the Precogs are never
                         wrong.

               The words are leading them no place good.  They stop talking,
               and just sit there.

 INT. THE SPRAWL 
               Anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with
               several people waiting for the N0.6 Turbo Tram.

               The double decker Tram comes.  People get off, then the line
               starts to move forward as people get on.

               Anderson fidgets.  He's last in line.  Each person gets
               IdentiScanned as he boards.  Anderson's putting his new eyes
               to the test.  If the scan goes wrong, he's positioned himself
               to run.

               The woman ahead of him, gets scanned, pays her fare.
               Anderson's turn.  Anderson goes up the steps, and a red beam
               reads his eyes.

               The Tram DRIVER glances at a monitor beside his steering
               wheel, then nods at him.

 DRIVER                          Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington.  Plenty
                         of seats in the back.

               Anderson nods, moves casually to the back.  But his jaw
               muscles are flexing hard, working off the tension.

 INT. A WEALTHY HOME - SUBBURIAN WASHINGTON -- NIGHT 
               Senator Malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he
               finishes off a late night whiskey in his panelled den.  He
               wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos
               adorning the cherry wood walls.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 60. 

               He's feeling cozy and safe, the way rich people can afford
               to.  No IdentiScan Spiders would ever be sent under his doors.
               No intrusions of any sort, nothing that a coiffed secretary
               or a loyal wife wouldn't announce before hand.

               Which is why he doesn't immediately understand the small
               SOUND at ear level, coming from just behind him.  It's a
               metallic CLICK-CLICK.  He turns amiably.  His eyes instantly
               widen, and his knees buckle when he sees he's looking into
               the barrel of ANDERSON'S cocked gun.

 ANDERSON                          Time to upgrade your alarm system,
                         Senator.

               Senator Malcolm tries to regain his composure.  His fear
               embarrasses him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Your work-up of Witwer.  The Security
                         Panel would've done one.
                              (beat)
                         Why do I kill Witwer?

               The Senator finds his voice.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          There's no motive.

 ANDERSON                          There's, always a motive.

               Anderson presses the gun to the Senator's forehead.  He slides
               the barrel tip back and forth across the Senator's sweaty
               skin.  It makes a greasy red mark.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I could've come to anyone on the
                         panel.  But I picked you.
                              (beat)
                         Of all the shits on that panel, I
                         like you least of all.  So if this
                         gun goes off, I'll feel bad, but
                         not, you know, devastated.

               You can almost see a thought dawning on Senator Malcolm.

               And then, shockingly he spits in Anderson's face, and turns
               and walks to the other side of the den.  His tone is mocking.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          What the fuck was I worried about?
                         You can't kill me.  The Precogs
                         would've seen it.

               Anderson realizes this, too, lowers his gun.  The Senator is
               even laughing now.  For a moment Anderson does nothing, then
               he moves toward the Senator again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 61. 

               The Senator stands his ground smugly.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Witwer's clean.  You're clean.
                         There's nothing.  No motive.  Kind
                         of like something Kafka would've
                         cooked up.
                              (beat)
                         You like that, cockroach?  You're
                         fucked and you'll never know why.

               The Senator is laughing hard now.  Anderson lets him.

 ANDERSON                          Tell you something about the Precogs,
                         Senator.  They're great on murder.
                         But it's the little things they fail
                         to see.

               Anderson hits the Senator so hard it bounces him across the
               floor and into the cherry wood panelling.  Several of his
               beloved photos crash down onto him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Little things like that, for instance.

               Anderson steps over him, and walks out of the room

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 
               Search and Command room.  Witwer stands there amidst all of
               the technology speaking to a group of Precrime officers.

 WITWER                          He hasn't shown up on one goddamn
                         IdentiScan in three days.

               No one says anything, and then LIEUTENANT GLASER, 30, speaks
               up.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          He's found a room -- he's going to
                         sit it out.

 WITWER                          Yeah, except for holding a gun to
                         senator Malcolm's goddman head in
                         his own goddman house last night,
                         Anderson's sitting it out!
                              (beat)
                         Why hasn't he been scanned?

               The officers look at their shoes.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Why is he invisible?  He's moving
                         around but he isn't being seen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 62. 

               Lieutenant Glaser tries again.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Hes beating the scanners

 WITWER                          No one beats the scanners.

               Witwer reaches up, wearily, rubbing his face and eyes with
               his hands.  The fingers dragging across his eyes stop.  Then
               his hands drop away, and he looks at his men.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's done his eyes

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          But the scarring always

 WITWER                          He went the whole way.  The crazy
                         bastard had his eyes removed.  New
                         ones sewn in.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          That takes weeks to heal.

 WITWER                          If you're prepared to go blind, a
                         street surgeon'll juice up the repair
                         cycle.  They don't give a fuck about
                         risk.

               Witwer's eyes flick to a digital CLOCK on the wall.  It's
               something he can't help doing now.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's going to do what it takes to
                         stay free -- if it blinds him, maims
                         him, or kills him.

               Witwers admiring smile makes his men very uncomfortable .

 INT. KITCHEN - THE SUBURBS -- DAY 
               A mother places a carton of milk on a table in front of her
               teenage son.  He pours it into his cereal bowl, then puts
               the carton down in front of him.

               There's a flexible Vid-Screen on the side of the carton,
               about the size of a playing card.  AS the sleepy kid watches,
               the disposable Vid-Screen sparkles to life.

               Nothing unusual, they always do that.  For advertisements,
               lost kids, or in this case crime bulletins.

               A good one.  The kid straightens up.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 63. 

 THE VID-SCREEN 
               A fully rotating mug shot of PAUL ANDERSON fills the screen,
               followed by vital statistics and details of the precrime
               he's been charged with.

               The kid watches for a while, then gets bored, and pulls the
               Dexi-Pops cereal box over and starts reading the back of
               that.

 INT. A LIVING ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A big man in a tee shirt lies on a couch, a bowl of popcorn
               perched on his belly.  He stares at a TV monitor that's the
               size of a twin bed.

 TV 
               Anderson's face fills the monitor.  The TV image is so big
               that Anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence.
               It's like God coming to pay a visit -- even if you want to
               avoid Him you can't.

               The big man with the popcorn tries to do just that.  He surfs
               through a zillion channels, but Anderson's visage is
               omnipresent.

 EXT. THE SKY - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson's face fills the skies, too.  Witwer and Precrime
               have pulled out all the stops.

               Advertising dirigibles float by with Anderson's image on it.
               Holographic billboards with Anderson hover in the air.  There
               are so many Andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the
               weather, a special type of cloud.

               People on the streets look up, briefly interested, then go
               about their business.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL 
               One person who is paying deep attention to all this is
               Anderson himself.  He stands on a street corner, wearing
               dark glasses and a fedora, staring at a public video kiosk.

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               The mug shot of Anderson disappears and is replaced by a
               Precrime SPOKESWOMAN.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          The United States Supreme Court has
                         issued a special injunction allowing
                         the unprecedented public viewing of
                         former Precrime Director Paul
                         Anderson's future murder of Edward
                         Witwer, the current Director.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64. 

 ANDERSON                          His mouth slowly opens.  He steps
                         back against a wall and slides his
                         hand into his pants pocket.  He looks
                         at the Precog DISC in his cupped
                         hand, then quickly puts it away.

               He stares at the kiosk as people on the street begin to gather
               around excitedly.

               CROWDS OF PEOPLE look into the sky, in store windows, at
               other video kiosks.  They have the enthralled anticipation
               of a mob at a public guillotining.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          She continues her declamation

 SPOKESWOMAN (CONT'D)                          The video you are about to see,
                         generated by the Precognitive mutants,
                         is the immutable evidence of the
                         infallible system.
                              (reassuring smile)
                         Citizens are urged to call
                         1-800-PRECRIME with any information
                         that may lead us to the whereabouts
                         of Paul Anderson, future murderer.

 ANDERSON                          Shakes his head in confusion and
                         disbelief.  But he has the Precog
                         disc ...

               The OLD GUY him nudges him

 OLD GUY                          This oughtta be good, huh?

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               And there it is, Anderson and Witwer standing there pointing
               guns at each other.  The whole thing just as we saw it before.
               All the way through to the fatal moment.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

               Anderson shoots him.  Witwer slumps, dying.  The video stops.
               And then begins to play all over again, right from the start,
               the 1-800-PRECRIME number scrolling along the bottom of it.
               "Call now!  Call now!  Call now!

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Moves quickly through the crowds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 65. 

 INT. BAR - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so
               full of cigarette smoke it doesn't seem capable of supporting
               life.  But it supports the kind of life Page is interested
               in.

               An emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool
               beside Page.  He gives one shake of his head, and she slides
               away again.  His eyes cut to a group of females.  He waits
               for the next approach.

 CLOSE ON: PAGE 
               as a HAND reaches over his shoulder and places a Precog disc
               on the bar in front of him.  Page makes a sound and tries to
               jump away, as if the disc is something lethal.  Which it is,
               in a way.

               Anderson presses him back down on his stool.  Sits next to
               him.  Page stares at him, scared.  Anderson looks straight
               ahead as he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          "Ennis Page engages the services of
                         prostitutes because his relationships
                         with them compound his feelings of
                         selfloathing."
                              (beat)
                         Direct quote from your psychological
                         profile -- the kind of shit I had to
                         know as your former boss.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          "Page is an obsessive-compulsive
                         Type Nine." Another quote.  Niners
                         are great for the kind of work you
                         do -- keeping all those Precog discs
                         in order.

               You can almost see Page's heart slamming in his chest.  He
               tries to hide it with tough talk.

 PAGE                          I fuck whores and I'm orderly, so
                         what?

 ANDERSON                          Something's out of order, Ennis.
                         Deeply out of order.

               Page looks unhappily at the disc on the bar PAGE You got a
               disc Anderson picks it up, holds it tight in his fist

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Not A disc.  The disc.  When I went
                         home sick, I stole it.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 66. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I took it with me, Ennis.  I wasn't
                         sick, I was running with the evidence.
                              (lets that sink in)
                         So how is it that Precrime has one,
                         too?

 PAGE                               (utterly baffled)
                         You can't make copies 

	       Anderson waits.  Lets Page work through it.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          It's the basis of the system.  The
                         immutable evidence.  Copies are
                         impossible.
                              (beat)
                         You went home.  A little later, I
                         came in with a disc for Mr. Witwer
                         to review.  I wasn't halfway out the
                         door when he cried out.

               Anderson is barely breathing, he's listening so hard.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          He was in shock.  He showed me.  It
                         was you shooting him.  Then all hell
                         broke loose.  He had to send the
                         Precrime units to your house.

 ANDERSON                          Ennis -- you gave out the same disc
                         twice.  Less than an hour apart.
                         The one I stole.  And then another
                         one.  Of the same event.

 PAGE                          It's impossible.  The Precogs can
                         only move forward to new events.
                         Into the future.  They never repeat.

               Anderson looks around.  Patrons are beginning to look over
               in his direction, eyes lingering.  He rises.

               Page seems in a daze.  As an obsessive-compulsive niner, the
               concept of an untidy system is disorienting.

               Anderson starts to say something to the man, then doesn't.

               On the way out Anderson gets IdentiScanned.  An automatic
               DIGITAL VOICE calls out after him.

 DIGITAL VOICE                          Have a nice night, Mr. Symington

	       Anderson leaves the dark of the bar for the deeper dark of The Sprawl.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 67. 

 INT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A YOUNG GUY with a sparse moustache walks up to a payphone.
               He picks up, the receiver and immediately gets IdentiScanned.
               A light goes on, he's about to dial.

               Anderson appears out of nowhere, shoulders him out of the
               way.  The young guy drops the receiver and stumbles back
               onto the sidewalk.  Anderson grabs the hanging receiver.

 YOUNG GUY                          Hey!  Hey, you can't... 

	       He reaches for Anderson, then thinks better of it.  Anderson 
	       is twice his size and very menacing in dark glasses.

 YOUNG GUY (CONT'D)                          I'm gettin' a cop.

               The guy scurries off.  Anderson dials quickly.

 INTERCUT ANDERSON/LISAS OFFICE 
               Lisa, walking down a hallway in the Judicial Center, stops
               to answer her BEEPING cell phone.  She leans against a wall,
               as lawyers and judges pass by.

 ANDERSON                          It's me.

 LISA                          Paul.

               Lisa grips the phone and turns to the wall

 ANDERSON                          Your phone will be bugged.  So we
                         can't meet, we can't do anything.
                         Just listen.  Nowing you're listening
                         is enough.

               Lisa nods, as if he's right there.  He is right there, for
               her.  This is all she's got.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When Precrime stormed the house, I
                         thought you'd called them.  Betrayed
                         me.

 LISA                          No.

 ANDERSON                          I know.  Witwer sent them.  He saw
                         the disc and had to do his job.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me you forgive me.  Please.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 68. 

 LISA                          Of course, I forgive you.

               There's no time left.  He has to get off the line and start
               moving again.  A vast weariness enters his voice.

 ANDERSON                          All these people I need to forgive
                         me.
                              (beat)
                         Do you think Frank forgave me?  All
                         I could do for him was send him
                         gardenias.
                              (long beat)
                         I love you.

               Lisa almost cries out when he hangs up.  She flattens herself
               against a wall.  She stays like that for a long moment,
               pulling the sound of her husband's voice, his words, deep
               inside of herself.

               And then she gets a look, as one of those words registers
               profoundly.

 LISA                               (whispers to herself)
                         Frank hated gardenias.

 EXT. EAST END CEMETERY - ARLINGTON -- LATER 
               A public cemetery along the Potomac.  There's not much land
               left for new graves.  A funeral is taking place.  A lot of
               mourners in dark 1950's suits and dresses.  The service is
               nearing its end.

               Frank D'Ignazio's newly dug grave is nearby.  Lisa stands
               there, looking at the temporary marker, and the flowers and
               wreaths piled up against it.

               Two rows over, they are lowering the casket into the ground.

               High in the sky, a PRECRIME HOVERCRAFT, everpresent in Lisa's
               life, floats in the low clouds with a barely audible WHINE.

               Lisa rests a floral arrangement against the pile of flowers.
               Her hand drifts near a white GARDENIA WREATH.  There is a
               small envelope tucked beneath a blossom.  She takes it.

               Then she rises and begins to walk back to her car.

               The funeral is over, and the mass of mourners, many wearing
               dark glasses, fan out toward a long line of cars.

               One of the MOURNERS brushes past Lisa.  She looks up and he
               tips his dark glasses down onto his nose and stares over
               them at her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 69. 

               It's Anderson.  Isn't it?  She looks into his eyes.  And
               it's jarring, the blue eyes gone, that they're brown now.
               But it's him, he's there, and she wants to reach out for
               him.  Knows she can't.

               He's already moving on.  He's risked everything for a look.
               He slips into the black sea of mourners, she goes to her car
               -neither of them ever breaking stride.

               The Precrime craft hovers, unaware

 INT. LISA'S CAR 
               Lisa opens the envelope as her car drives her down the
               Alexandria-Washington ConnectWay.

               A Precog DISC falls into her hand.  Her mouth opens -- she's
               never held one before.

               And there is a NOTE with it It READS:

               "The Precogs generated duplicate discs.  This is the first.
               Precrime has the second.  Duplicates.  Why?"

 EXT. A CONVENIENCE STORE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson has to eat bad food quickly, and on the run.  He
               gathers up a wrapped sandwich, a bag of donuts, something to
               drink.

               He waits in line.  He doesn't like to be in a line, waiting.
               The woman ahead of him argues about change.  He presses his
               lips together.

               And then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera
               DOME attached to the ceiling.  It gives him a fish eye
               reflected VIEW of what's happening behind him.

               Precrime police are happening behind him.  He doesn't stop
               to ponder, as two Python transports zoom up outside the store.

               Anderson vaults the counter, knocking the customer and the
               clerk to the floor.

 INT. BACK ROOM 
               Anderson plows over a guy filling a trash can.  He hears the
               mechanically altered COMMANDS of a Precrime officer calling
               from the store.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson crashes out into an alley, and clambers up a fence.
               SONIC BLASTS shatter the air around him.  Chunks of brick
               fly off the walls on both sides.  But he is full of
               adrenaline, and there is no stopping him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 70. 

 INT. A TURBOTRAM - THE SPRAWL -- LATER 
               A different part of the city.  Anderson hunkers low in the
               back seat of a tram.

               He looks up, as the DRIVER swears

 DRIVER                          What the hell --

               Anderson stands up, looks down the aisle, through the
               windshield.  Precrime transports are heading straight at the
               tram, going the wrong way on a one way avenue.

               They've even taken radio control of the P.A. system on the
               tram.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson can't believe it -- how are they suddenly pinpointing
               him?  The passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare
               at him, terrified.

               Anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit
               doors, smashing them open, and tumbles out onto the street.

               He rolls, and is up on his feet in a second, reaching into
               his bag for a glove.  He pulls the weapon onto his right
               hand, as he whirls around sizing up his predicament.

               Precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the
               street.  He looks up.  He is surrounded by skyscrapers and
               buildings -- he is walled in, at the bottom of an urban
               canyon.

               People freeze against the sides of buildings, run into
               doorways where they can.  Passengers in trans and taxis or
               cars stay there, pressed against their windows watching.

               Nothing moves, except the Python transports, closing in.
               The lead officer speaks, with that menacing electronically
               altered VOICE.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Lower your weapon, or we will
                         neutralize your threat potential.

               The Precrime police are out of the transports now, advancing
               at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men.

               Anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building
               closest to him.

 ANDERSON'S POV - A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT 
               The large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 71. 

               Anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward
               it, his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Do not move!

               Anderson is up on the sidewalk now, two feet out from the
               building, right beside the high pressure hydrant.

               He stops, looks up, looks down, looks at the police advancing.
               It is a moment for prayer.  Anderson doesn't have a moment.

               He spreads his feet and fires a massive SONIC BLAST down at
               the sidewalk.  The effect on the underground water main is
               immediate.

               A GEYSER of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up
               from the sidewalk, lifting the tumbling Anderson fifteen
               feet into the air right alongside the building.

               The stunned police officers try to take aim, but Anderson's
               bouncing at the top of the geyser.  And they can't fire,
               anyway, because officers workers stare at the excitement
               from every window in the building.

               All this in a time span of seconds.  The world spins crazily
               for ANDERSON, but he manages to grip hold of a metal support
               beam holding the building's sign, one story up.

               The police try to see what he's doing, but the torrent of
               water from the water main break obscures his moves.

               He pulls himself onto a ledge, steadies himself, slides along
               it toward a second story window.  The office building gawkers
               lurch backward from the window as Anderson blasts it to
               sparkling dust and leaps inside.

 INT. OFFICE BUILDING 
               The building covers almost an entire city block.  Anderson,
               dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting
               through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way.

               He is like a wide receiver running the length of the field,
               jumping obstacles, slamming through, over, and around whatever
               he must to get to his goal.

               And then he reaches his goal -- the windows overlooking the
               avenue next block over and parallel to the one where Precrime
               ambushed him.

               He spots a double-decker TurboTram moving slowly in the stream
               of traffic.  It pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers.

               Anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of
               the bus.  It is a bone-jarring landing.  He loses
               consciousness for a second, rolls the length of the roof,
               and slides off it onto the pavement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 72. 

               He lies there, trying to rouse himself.  Traffic brakes to a
               stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in
               the road.  No one wants to touch him.  A single car horn
               SOUNDS, and then a chorus of them.

               Anderson rouses, struggles to his feet, and takes off in a
               limping run.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION LATER 
               Anderson, out of breath and in pain, leans against a post at
               the far end of the passenger platform.  There are tracks on
               either side of him, one marked "Uptown" and the other
               "Downtown. "

               He feels a blast of air and looks to his right and sees that
               the Downtown train is coming in.  And on his left, too, the
               Uptown train rounds the bend and comes into view.

               Which MagLev train will lead him to safety?  Which one won't
               they pinpoint?  He runs up to a teenage KID who has his arm
               around his girlfriend.  They step back, startled.  He's got
               a flat top hair cut, she wears a pleated skirt and saddle
               shoes.

               The trains pull in.

 ANDERSON                          Pick one for me!

 KID                          What?

 THEY TRY TO WALK AWAY 
 ANDERSON                          Point to the train I should take.
                         Please.

 KID                          I don't know.

               The girl lifts a nervous finger and points.  The Uptown.  He
               runs to board it, as they run in the opposite direction to
               the Downtown.

 INT. SUBWAY CAR 
               He sits at the back of the half empty train watching the
               dark rush by.  A train chosen arbitrarily -- it's impossible
               they could find him.

               A station Stop.  He starts to get off, is actually on the
               platform, then steps back onto the train.

               The rushing dark again.  When the MagLev eases to a halt at
               the next station he gets off this time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 73. 

 INT. STATION 
               He walks toward the exit stairs with a handful of people.
               He eases back and lets them go up first.

 THE STAIRS 
               Precrime officers crouch around the bend, silently snatching
               people out of the way as they come into view.  They wait
               -but Anderson does not come.  And he does not come.

               On signal, the Precrime officers rush down the stairs.

 DOORWAY ABOVE THE STAIRS 
               ANDERSON hangs high above the doorway near the ceiling,
               adhered by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive BindFoam.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE OFFICERS 
               as they run below him down the stairs.  They go out of sight,
               he can hear them rushing along the platform searching for
               him.

               The strain of hanging by one arm is killing him.  He reaches
               up.  With a laser knife, and cuts away at his coat sleeve,
               releasing himself from the glob.  He drops to the stairs,
               and instantly slips up them.

               He surprises a helmeted OFFICER, just around the bend.  He
               slams HIM against the wall, yanks off his helmet, and holds
               the laser knife against his throat.

               The OFFICER 1s clearly terrified.  He speaks hoarsely through
               Anderson's choking grip.

 OFFICER                          Don't kill me!  Jesus.  Please.

               Anderson looks at the panicked officer.  Anderson closes his
               eyes trying to put it together.  He opens them.

 ANDERSON                          But the Precogs would've predicted
                         me killing you.  You'd know whether
                         I do or not.

               The officer looks at him with eyes begging for mercy.
               Anderson suddenly gets it.  He tightens his grip on the man.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          They shut down the system.  Haven't
                         they?  They've shut down the Precogs.

               The officer nods.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 74. 

 OFFICER                          They're off homicides.  They're
                         redirecting them to help us locate
                         you.

               Which is how they knew where he'd be every time.

               Anderson chops quickly at the base of the man's skull,
               knocking him out.  And then he runs, because what else can
               he do?

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               Lisa stands in a long hallway outside a door, labeled:
               COURTROOM 17.  She holds a briefcase in one hand.  Down the
               hall, other courtrooms are in use, but not this one.  She
               enters the dark and vacant Courtroom 17.

 INT. COURTROOM 17 
               Lisa sits at the judge's bench in the empty courtroom.  The
               lights are dim.

               She takes a small, battery-powered tv out of her briefcase.
               She turns it on.

 TV 
               The murder of Witwer by Anderson is being shown over and
               over in a continuous loop.  Flashing at the bottom is the
               hotline number: "1-800-PRECRIME." Then- "Call Now!  Call
               Now!

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Now Lisa takes out the Precog disc Anderson gave to her -the
               first disc.

               She places it in the specialized monitor on the judge's bench.

               The tv and the judge's monitor sit side by side.  The tv
               plays the version of the murder from the second disc; the
               judge's monitor plays the version from the first disc.

               She stares intently, her eyes flicking back and forth from
               one version to the other.  They seem absolutely identical.
               When the judge's monitor goes blank, she starts it over again.

               Lisa stares, watching her husband murder his best friend,
               endlessly.

 EXT. A GAS STATION - ALEXANDRIA -- DAY 
               A gas station right out of the fifties.  An attendant in a
               uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield
               of a sky blue Rambler.

               In the background, Anderson walks toward a men's room.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 75. 

 INT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               Anderson looks at himself in the mirror.  He reaches out and
               touches one reflected eye, which is a deep brown.  It is
               still startling to him, the color of his eyes.

               Then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air
               syringe Doc gave to him.  He looks at it nervously.  It is
               filled with 5 cc's of an opaque green liquid.

               He touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin.
               He closes his eyes.  Then he screws up his courage, and hits
               the plunger.  The liquid is pneumatically delivered with a
               searing HISS.

               Anderson screams out in agony, slams back against the wall
               of the bathroom.  His hands reach up for his face -- which
               looks like it's boiling from within.

 ANDERSON'S FACE 
               The skin on both cheeks begins to pucker.  The muscle tone
               around his chin goes soft, and begins to sag like an old
               man's.  That is the effect -- like he is aging fifty years.
               His forehead wrinkles, the skin under his eyes droop.  Healthy
               pink is replaced by bloodless gray.

 AND MOTHER OF GOD DOES IT HURT 
 EXT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               The ATTENDANT knocks nervously on the door

 ATTENDANT                          You all right in there?

               When the door opens, an unhealthy looking old guy with a
               fedora hat pulled low comes slowly out of the bathroom.
               Anderson nods, and walks past the attendant, who watches
               after him uncertainly as he wanders off.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               The perky tour guide we met earlier takes another group around
               the headquarters.  There may be a massive campaign to find
               Anderson, but the Precrime public relations machine continues
               to run without interruption.

               There are ten people in the group, and the physically
               transformed Anderson is among them.  They all wear glowing
               nametags.  Anderson's reads, "Mr. Symington." He keeps his
               hands in his pockets, and his head low.

               We have heard the tour guide's spiel before

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 76. 

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               She is about to go on when she looks over at Anderson.  He
               is fidgeting uncomfortably.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Are you ... all right, Mr. Symington?

               Anderson moves up close to her, a little too close.  He
               whispers to her, embarrassed.  She gives him a professional
               smile, and points in the distance past the elevators.

               Anderson nods, and heads off.  She calls after him.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          We'll wait right here for you, sir!

 INT. A STAIRWELL 
	       Anderson runs down a back stairwell to a lower floor.

 INT. A BASEMENT CORRIDOR 
               Anderson stands outside a door marked: "Housekeeping." Above
               the doorway is an IdentiScan device.

               Anderson reaches into his coat and carefully removes a small
               cryo-jar.

 CLOSE ON: THE CRYO-JAR 
               Imbedded in the clear gelatinous coolant are two eyeballs
               -the irises a luminous blue.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND -- MOMENTS LATER 
               The operations room in Precrime.  The technicians sit at
               their computers and holographic tracking displays.

               Witwer paces among them.  His eyes keep flicking to the
               digital clock on the wall.  Then they cut back to the men
               and machines that are telling him nothing.  Witwer does not
               look well at all, When a TECHNICIAN leans close to his
               computer monitor,Witwer almost leaps across the room to get
               to him.  He looks over the man's shoulder.

 WITWER                          What is it?

 TECHNICIAN                          Must be a glitch ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 77. 

 WITWER                          What?

 TECHNICIAN                          Anderson just got IdentiScanned.

               Witwer grips the back of the technician's chair.  The
               technician types the data through again.

 TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)                          It's him -- he's been scanned.

 WITWER                          Where is he?

               The technician looks up at Witwer.

 TECHNICIAN                          But he's had his eyes done.  Right?
                         Sir?  Tries to think it through.

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         He had to have.

               The technician's computer flashes the next piece of
               information.  When he speaks, it's the last thing Witwer
               wants to hear.

 TECHNICIAN                          Jesus Christ, sir.  He's in the
                         basement of this building.

               All eyes turn to Witwer.  The unspoken question hangs in the
               air.  Anderson's come to murder Witwer?

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Throughout the building, every available Precrime Officer
               begins to receive orders to mobilize toward the basement.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Four officers stand guard in the chamber.  They listen to
               the orders coming in on their earpieces.  Three of the guards
               rush out of the room, one stays behind.

               The three Precogs sit in their oversized chairs, the female
               in the middle, the males on either side of her.  Their eyes
               are open ... and they are deeply alert.

               Two technicians tend to the Precogs.  At the back of the
               chamber, through a large window, we see Ennis Page sitting
               at the huge mainframe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 78. 

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               A ring of Precrime officers three men deep stand guard around
               Witwer.  Witwer looks like he wants to kill them all.

 WITWER                          This is ridiculous.

               Lieutenant Glaser replies forcefully

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Standing orders from the Security
                         Panel, sir.

 WITWER                          If he wants to get to me, he'll get
                         to me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          No, he won't, sir.

               Witwer looks at the confident young officer almost pityingly.
               Then his eyes flick to the wall clock.

 INT. THE BASEMENT 
               Armed Precrime officers clog the corridors, conducting
               defensive searches of one room after another.  All they are
               coming up with so far are some very startled housekeepers.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In the chamber are one guard, two technicians, and three
               Precogs.  And all of them are left in sudden darkness, as
               the power is cut.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               The officers around Witwer reach for their maglite
               flashlights.  The Search and Command room suddenly looks
               exceedingly vulnerable.

               A technician calls out from the darkness

 TECHNICIAN                          Don't worry, air -emergency generators
                         will kick on in five seconds.

               The green glow from a roomful of wristwatches makes the room
               seem alive with fireflies.  Five seconds go by.  Then ten
               more.

 WITWER                          Explanation, please!

 TECHNICIAN                          Uh, sir.  It seems ... he got the
                         generators, too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79. 

               There is a long moment of silence.  And then Witwer begins
               to laugh.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The room is utterly dark and silent.  The silence is broken
               by the SOUND of something rolling across the floor.  Somebody
               speaks, probably the guard.

 VOICE                          Shit.

               An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blasts.
               And leaping through the light is ANDERSON.  The temporarily
               blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees.
               Anderson stun guns them quickly.

               The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor.
               We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial features
               are returning to normal.

               He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs.  It is the
               equipment he is after.

               Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching in
               horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the
               Precog helmets to the mainframe.

               Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing
               it out and knocking Page unconscious.  Then he reaches into
               the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of
               blasts.

               Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a
               PRESENCE behind him.  Perhaps it is because the movement is
               so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection.

               A HAND, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes
               hold of his hand.

               Anderson whirls around, weapon out.  And there before him,
               is the FEMALE Precog.  He looks at her, then beyond her to
               the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in
               their chairs.

               Her helmet is off.  She is young, but her close-cropped hair
               is silver white.  And when she speaks, her voice is like the
               wind whispering through time.

 FEMALE                          Save us, Anderson.

               Anderson can feel the seconds ticking away, his carefully
               planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way.

 ANDERSON                          I have to get out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 80. 

               She grips his hand.

 FEMALE                          Save us.

               It is beyond pitiful, this frail little woman, pleading.
               And her eyes, she won't let him go.  She is beginning to
               weaken, to sway on her feet.

               A sudden realization floods over Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          You let me get here, didn't you?
                         You stopped giving them information,
                         so they couldn't track me.

               The Precog female is fading fast.  She tries to reach out
               for him and her legs give way.

 FEMALE                          Save -- 
  	       And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls?  
	       What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the 
	       fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom.

 INT. TUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa has been staring at the judge's monitor and the tv screen
               for over an hour.  The two versions of Anderson murdering
               Witwer play over and over.

 LISA                               (wearily, to herself)
                         Help me, Paul.

               She hits freeze-frame on the judge's monitor, at a moment
               during his confrontation with Witwer when Anderson's FACE
               fills the screen.

               Lisa looks with deep urgency into her husband's eyes.

               And it is his EYES, finally, that tell her everything.  Lisa's
               hand rises to her open mouth.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          They're blue.

               She keeps the image on freeze-frame, and turns and looks at
               the tv, which shows Precrime's disc over and over, the 1-800
               number scrolling along the bottom.

               When the same close-up of Anderson flashes onto the tv screen,
               she leans close to it and squints.

               Anderson stares right back at her.  And for the first time,
               Lisa sees that the tapes are not exactly identical.  His
               eyes...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 81. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          And now they're brown.

               For the first time in days she allows herself a small smile.

 INT. PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Power has been restored to Precrime Headquarters.  Witwer
               walks slowly through the ruins of the Chamber.  EMT teams
               work on Ennis Page and the other dazed personnel Anderson
               has left in his wake.

               Technicians cluster around the two remaining Precogs, the
               brothers.  Their eyes are closed and they are limp.  Their
               lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other.

               Lieutenant Glaser is with him, but when Witwer speaks it is
               almost to himself.

 WITWER                          Why didn't the Precogs know he was
                         coming to do this?

               The Lieutenant has no reply.  Witwer runs both hands through
               his hair.  It has begun to wear him down, the ticking of the
               clock ...

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The next time he shows up it'll be
                         to kill me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We won't let that happen, sir.

               Witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him, then gives the
               Lieutenant a withering look.

 WITWER                          You won't, huh?

               When the Lieutenant tries to speak to him, Witwer walks away
               and goes over to the technicians working on the Precogs.  He
               stares at the Precogs.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (to a technician)
                         When can we get these things
                         operational?

 TECHNICIAN                          They're a hive mind, sir.  It takes
                         three for their predictive abilities
                         to be fully operational.

               Which Witwer does not want to hear.  Witwer leans very close
               to the technician.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82. 

 WITWER                          These two are all I have to find the
                         man who is about to murder me.  Hook
                         them up, and flood them with whatever
                         kind of fucking chemicals you have
                         to.  They are a machine, and I need
                         that machine at my disposal.

               The Precogs's lips stop for a microsecond, and then begin
               their silent movements again.

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE - ALEXANDRIA -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page is a man unglued.  He sits on a tidy little sofa,
               in a tidy 1950's style living room.  But his movements have
               become untidy.  He puts a very tiny pill on his tongue.

               When he drinks from a glass of water, it dribbles down his
               chin onto his shirt.  Not like Ennis, at all.

               When his doorbell RINGS, he slowly looks up, then looks down
               at the floor again.  He doesn't answer it.  It RINGS some
               more.

               And then Lisa is standing there before him

 LISA                          Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis.  I
                         could just walk in here.

 PAGE                          I forgot.  To turn it on.

               She sits down beside him.

 LISA                          You don't look surprised to see me.

               She glances at the bubble pack of pills on the table beside
               him, three gone.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          I need your help.

               Unexpectedly, tears well up in Ennis's eyes.

 PAGE                          He took one of my babies.

 LISA                          He's desperate, Ennis.  He had to.
                              (beat)
                         We have to help him.

               Lisa holds the Precog disc in front of his eyes.  He closes
               them against the sight, as if it were an evil talisman.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 83. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          It's a fake Ennis.

               Ennis's eyes open again.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This is the first disc.  You delivered
                         it to Director Anderson.  He reviewed
                         it.  And then he stole it, and went
                         on the run.

               Ennis tries to think through his fear and haze.  His words
               slur.

 PAGE                          I delivered ... a fake .. to him?

 LISA                          But he thought it was real, and ran
                         with it.

               The pills, his tidy world coming apart -- Ennis is losing
               it.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          An hour later, you delivered a second
                         disc of the same event.  Witwer
                         reviewed it.  It was real.  (Beat)
                         How do I know this?

               Ennis just wants her to go away.  He wants it all to go away.
               Tears stream down his face.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Director Anderson had his eyes
                         changed.  They were blue.  Now he
                         has brown ones.

               Ennis is sliding away.  Lisa takes hold of him.  Makes him
               listen, dammit.  She points to the disc in her hand.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This disc, the fake one, shows a
                         blueeyed Anderson murdering Witwer
                         two days from now.  He doesn't have
                         blue eyes anymore.  The person who
                         faked this disc had no idea he would
                         change his eyes.

               Lisa shakes him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Listen!  But the second disc has to
                         be real, because he has brown eyes

                         Somebody tried to frame him with a
                         fake.  And somehow it all became real.
                         Why, Ennis?  How could this happen?

               Ennis gives her a look that's on the other side of
               comprehension.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You handle the discs.  How did a
                         fake one get delivered?

               Ennis's eyes roll back into his head.

               PAGE Coffee ...

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You want-- ?

 PAGE                          He spilled coffee everywhere ...
                         Everywhere ...

 LISA                          What coffee?  What are you -- ?

               But Ennis sags unconscious.  She shakes him hard, even slaps
               him, but Ennis is out.  She lets him drop down on the sofa.

               From outside the house, somewhere high in the clouds, comes
               the WHINE of a hovercraft.

               Lisa looks once more at Ennis, then gets out of there

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               A small, dreary room, invisible with insignificance.  Which
               is just the kind of room you want if you've stolen a Precog.

               The female Precog lies on a cot.  Anderson sits on a metal
               folding chair watching her.

               Her eyes slowly open and look at him

 FEMALE                          My brothers aren't here.

 ANDERSON                          You didn't even look around.  You
                         knew.

 FEMALE                               (beat)
                         We can sense each other.  You must
                         save

	       Anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 85. 

 ANDERSON                          Stop.  I saved You.  It was the best
                         I could do.

               She turns away and looks at the yellowing paper on the wall.
               There is a fading pink cabbage rose.  She traces the outline
               of it with her thin finger.

               She turns back to him.

 FEMALE                          Thank you, Anderson.

               It is deeply eerie for him, chatting with a Precog.

 ANDERSON                          What am I going to do with you?

               Her eyes grow very serious.

 FEMALE                          Name me, Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          What?

 FEMALE                          Give me a name.  I've never had one.

               Anderson rises, moves around the small room.  He is shamed,
               embarrassed.

 ANDERSON                          Listen.

               She turns to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Listen to me.

                         Listen to me ... Rose.

               It is heartrendingly touching, the smile she gives him when
               she faces him again.

 FEMALE                          Rose.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  They shifted your precognition
                         so you would locate me.

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         Yes.  And it hurt us, physically.
                         Did you know that?  The helmets, the
                         controls.  It hurts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 86. 

 ANDERSON                               (guiltily)
                         I didn't know.

               For a long moment he can't say anything.  But there are things
               he needs to understand ...

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When they shifted you to find me,
                         you didn't reveal everything.  That
                         I was going to break into Precrime.

 ROSE                          We saw our chance.  You would need
                         to shut us down, you would have to
                         come.  We wanted you to come.

 ANDERSON                          You used me -- to save you.

 ROSE                          I have been used all my life,
                         Anderson.

               Anderson can't meet her eyes.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          No one cared that we were human.
                         From a human mother.  Taken at birth.
                         Hooked to machines.
                              (beat)
                         We have been alive, Anderson.
                         Enslaved, for the greater good.

               Her words are unbearable, for both of them.  She traces the
               outline of the wallpaper rose again.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          But now I have a name.  And I know
                         the man who has named - me will not
                         allow me to be enslaved again.

               Anderson looks at her, then goes to the window, carefully
               watches the street below.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What's going to happen to us?
                         Can you see that?

 ROSE                          I'm weak.  And away from my brothers.
                         I see glimpses and hints of things
                         nearby.  But it's all ... scattered.
                              (beat)
                         I'm tired of the future, Anderson.

               She lies on the bed, watching as Anderson comes back to her.
               He sits carefully on the side of her bed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 87. 

               Then be reaches out, and gently touches her cheek

 ANDERSON                          You didn't know I was going to do
                         that, did you?

               She is almost too overwhelmed to speak

 ROSE                          No.  Oh, Anderson.  It was lovely.

               And now it is Anderson who is overwhelmed

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE DAWN 
               If he were not already dead, it would've killed Ennis Page
               to see the state of his living room.  Precrime officers
               everywhere.  Blood on the rug.  A gun beside the sofa.

               Witwer stands in the corner of the room witching the Coroner
               crab walk Page's body.  It WHIRS and CLICKS as it probes and
               takes samples from various sites.

               The holographic doctor waits patiently as the Coroner crab
               makes its determinations.

               Lieutenant Glaser talks quietly to Witwer

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Who else could it've been?

               The crab probes the ragged hole in Page's head

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          He grabbed a Precog so he could commit
                         an undetected murder.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         Page worshipped the system.  He fell
                         apart.  Shot himself.

               The Lieutenant rolls his eyes.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Anderson.

               Witwer doesn't say anything.  He just stares at the body The
               crab finishes.  The holographic doctor unfolds his arms and
               turns his head to Witwer.  He is only a computer interface,
               but even so, it seems as if there is surprise in his
               digitalized voice.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Director Witwer.  This event is a

                         Two Investigation is in order.

               No one says anything as the holographic doctor dematerializes
               and the Coroner crab walks across the floor and puts itself
               back in its box.

               At last, someone moves.  It is Witwer.  He lifts his arm,
               pulls back his shirtsleeve, and stares long and hard at his
               watch.

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- DAY LATER 
               Lisa sits biting her lip as Witwer watches two monitors play
               the two versions of Anderson's murder of Witwer.  Lisa points.

 LISA                          There.

               She reaches down and freezes on a close-up of Anderson on
               the two monitors.

 CLOSE ON - THE MONITORS 
               On the left monitor Anderson has blue eyes, on the right he
               has brown.

 LISA                          The one on the left, the first disc
                         -it's a fake.  He doesn't have blue
                         eyes anymore.

               Witwer stares for a long time.

 WITWER                          A fake.

 (BEAT)                          But the Precogs predict the infallible
                         truth.  They don't emit fake discs.

               And now Lisa smiles.  She has set her lawyerly mind to the
               solution.  It is her moment

 LISA                          Exactly.  You can't tamper with the

                         have made a fake disc on their own
                         and inserted it into the delivery
                         system.

               The simplicity of it is inconceivable.  Witwer speaks
               carefully, trying to process it

 WITWER                          Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake
                         disc in with that day's real ones...

 LISA                               (excited)
                         We're all programmed to believe
                         anything we see on a Precog disc.
                         The system has never been wrong ...

               Witwer stares at the proof before him.  -- the different
               colored eyes of Anderson.  He ejects both discs and holds
               them in his hands.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You have to call off the hunt.  He
                         was set up.

               Witwer looks at the two discs he is holding

 LISA                          He was set up!  You both were.  If
                         Paul kills you, you're both out of
                         the picture.

 LISA                          Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing!  And
                         then we can investigate Witwer's

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90. 

 LISA                          He's not a murderer.

 WITWER                          I think he is.  A murderer ... and a
                         future murderer.

                         one's real?

               Witwer's hands close tight on the discs.  Lisa stands there,
               motionless.  Then she turns, and leaves his office, abruptly.
               He watches her go.

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Rose sits in a chair near the window.  She is chewing lightly
               on a cracker.  Her face shows wonder -- at the cracker's
               texture and taste.  She holds it up and admires its shape.

               Anderson's mood is less wondrous

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Listen to me.  I'm going to
                         leave you here.  I have to keep
                         moving.

 ROSE'S SMILE ABRUPTLY VANISHES 
 ROSE                          No.  You must save my brothers.

 ANDERSON                          It's impossible.  There's no time.
                         I've done what I can do!

               Rose waits for him to finish.  She looks out the window at
               the street scene.

 ROSE                          Come here, Anderson.

	       He does, reluctantly.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          Do you see that boy in the blue hat
                         walking with his mother?
                              (beat)
                         In sixty seconds he will walk beneath
                         those workers installing a window on
                         the tenth floor of that building.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE BOY AND THE WORKERS 
               Two men struggle to lift a large window in place.  Way below
               the little boy in the blue hat walks on along the sidewalk
               holding his mother's hand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91. 

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          They'll drop the window, killing
                         him.  It is impossible to save him.

               Anderson turns to her, shocked And then he runs for the door,
               hurls it open, and disappears down the hall.

               Rose listens to his FOOTSTEPS crashing down the stairs

 EXT. THE STREET. 
               Even as Anderson rushes out of the boarding house, the WORKERS
               have lost their grip on the window.

               The little BOY in the blue hat and his MOTHER walk unwittingly
               toward disaster.  They do not appear to hear the MEN'S cries.

               The WINDOW falls end over end above the boy's head.  The
               sunlight sparks off of the glass, so that from a distance it
               looks like a star falling from the sky.

               A WOMAN across the street sees what is happening, and cries
               out.

               But what Anderson does is run.  He runs faster and harder
               than humanly possible.  He does not care if he is recognized
               or hit by a passing taxi.  He is going to get to that boy.
               He has to get to that boy ...

               ANDERSON rams the BOY from behind just as the corner of the
               window frame kisses the boy's blue hat.  He knocks the boy
               to safety as glass and metal SMASH into the sidewalk.

               The mother does not even have time to scream.  She is on the
               ground, stunned, But Anderson has saved the boy.

               He rolls away, and gets to his feet.  Before anyone can put
               together what has happened, Anderson has ducked into an alley,
               and is gone.

 INT. THE ROOM - LATER 
               Anderson enters the room again, out of breath, some small
               cuts on his face and hands.  He stands across the room staring
               at Rose.

               Rose considers him.  When she speaks her voice is near and
               distant at the same time.  For Anderson, it is as if the
               words are coming from a place inside his own head.

 ROSE                          It was impossible to save that boy
                         -- but you did, Anderson.  It's in
                         you.  It's what you are.

               Anderson sits on the floor and leans back wearily against a
               wall.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92. 

 ANDERSON                          You knew it wasn't impossible.  That
                         I'd get there.

               Rose reveals nothing.

 ROSE                          You are a man who saves others.
                              (beat)
                         Save my brothers.

               Anderson almost laughs.  Her persistence is unbelievable

 ANDERSON                          I'm in a lot of trouble right now.

 ROSE                          My brothers are in more trouble.
                         They've moved them to ... an awful
                         place.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Ed Witwer -he's in the most
                         trouble of all.  Who saves him?

               Rose suddenly grimaces in pain, and grips the side of her
               head.  She curls into a fetal position.

               Anderson goes to her, touches her thin shoulder.  Her eyes
               roll into the back of her head.

               Whose pain is she feeling?  Her own?  Someone else's?
               Anderson doesn't want to think about it.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB -CHEVY CHASE, MD -- NIGHT 
               Because Anderson has destroyed the Precog Chamber, the two
               Precog brothers have been brought here.

               The room is makeshift, uncomfortable ... a place for
               experiments.  The brothers are strapped into chairs.  They
               are helmeted.

               But unlike before, large bore needles have been placed in
               their jugular veins.  Connected to the needles are long twists
               of IV tubing.  There are several IVs running at high drip
               rates.

               Witwer has his back to all this.  He stands with Dr. Resfield,
               watching a technician working the keyboard on a huge
               mainframe.

               Dr. Resfield, a man not given to squeamishness looks back at
               the Precogs, uneasy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're not really set up for this
                         type of 

               He stops talking when he looks into Witwer's hollow eyes. Witwer 
               is somewhere beyond the influence and reach of words.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- MORNING 
               Anderson tries to get Rose to drink some water.  Her skin is
               translucent, unhealthy, glistening with sweat.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Try to drink.

               She pushes the cup away.  She closes her eyes, as if even
               the dim light of the room causes her pain.

 ROSE                          Your wife.  We have to get her here,
                         Anderson.

               She opens her eyes.  Anderson doesn't like the feel of this.

 ANDERSON                          Why?

 ROSE                          I don't know ...

 ANDERSON                          What are you seeing?

 ROSE                          Glimpses, Anderson.  Please.  We
                         have to get her here.

 ANDERSON                          You're scaring me, Rose

               She covers his mouth with her hand

 ROSE                          Stop talking.  It uses me up.

               For a long time, Rose says nothing, Her gaze is locked onto
               a distance beyond the room.  At last, she speaks.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          In three minutes your wife will take
                         a walk ..

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               Lisa sits in her office.  But she can't stand it, the sitting
               and waiting.  She has to move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 94. 

               She gets up and hurriedly leaves her office

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Witwer walks past Lisa's SECRETARY toward the open door of
               Lisa's office.

 SECRETARY                          Sir?  I'm sorry, she stepped out for
                         a few minutes.
                              (beat)
                         Sir?

               Witwer stares into the empty office.  There is a clock on
               Lisa's desk.  His eyes fix on it.

 EXT. JUDICIAL CENTER ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa moves quickly down the steps of the white marble
               building.  She takes a deep breath, then heads down Jefferson
               Boulevard toward the city.

               A sleek black TRANSPORT with two Precrime officers in it
               follows her from a discreet distance.

               In the sky above, the ubiquitous Precrime hovercraft

 INT. CITY STREET ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa walks down the street.  She hugs herself, barely aware
               of her surroundings.  She passes by stores, restaurants,
               payphones, video kiosks ... oblivious.  People push past
               her.

               On a street corner, as she waits at a red light, the payphone
               beside her begins to RING.  If she hears it, she gives no
               indication.  A KID reaches for it, listens, hangs up.

               She walks on.  Stores.  Restaurants.  An art gallery.  As
               she comes abreast of another PAYPHONE, it suddenly starts to
               ring.  This time Lisa glances at it.  But again, walks on.

               The TRANSPORT weaves through traffic, nearby She walks past
               the K.L. Lawrence Graphics Museum.  And another restaurant.
               And a PAYPHONE.  And this time, finally, when it, too, RINGS,
               she turns and looks hard at it.

               A man begins to walk over to it.  Lisa almost knocks him out
               of the way to get to it.  She grabs at the receiver.

 LISA                          Hello?  Hello?

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I need you.

               Lisa's forehead sags against the side of the payphone.  She
               basks in the sound of him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95. 

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          It's 1:03.  Set your watch, exactly.

               Lisa pushes the buttons on her digital watch as she listens
               LISA Okay.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          This is what you have to do ...

               We now hear ANDERSON continue in VOICE OVER as we follow
               Lisa through a SEQUENCE OF EVENTS ...

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa walks up the steps of the museum

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:07 hang up the phone and enter
                         the Lawrence Museum.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               Lisa walks quickly through a display of 19th century magazine
               advertising.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               The two Precrime officers walk into a room filled with Chinese
               graphics.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:13 the two Precrime officers
                         following you take a wrong turn into
                         a different room, losing sight of
                         you for ten seconds.

               The officers start toward the entrance way to another room,
               then hesitate uncertainly, and go for another entrance way.

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa hurries down the steps

 INT. A SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa boards the "A" MagLev train

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          An undercover transport officer will
                         have received emergency orders to
                         follow you.
 (MORE)                          He's wearing a red tie.  He has short
                         blond hair.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 96. 

 INT. THE SUBWAY CAR 
               The blond transport officer with the red tie sits at the far
               end of Lisa's car, watching her.

               At the next stop Lisa gets off.  He follows, not too far
               behind.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa starts up the stairs.  She looks at her watch, then
               makes herself pause a few moments, to keep within Anderson's
               time frame.  She starts up again.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          As you come around the bend, cry out
                         and turn around and slap the
                         officer...

               Lisa does this, and the officer reels back, surprised. At the
               same moment two big men rushing to catch a subway come into
               view, and see this happening.  Lisa starts to run.  When the
               undercover officer tries to stop her, the two men grab the
               officer, and they get into a fight.

               Lisa escapes.

 INT. A TAXI - THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa looks at her watch, then taps the window for the driver
               to stop.  She gets out.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          Stay on Ninth street.  Underneath
                         Ninth street is the main power feed
                         for The Sprawl.  It'll mess up the
                         navigational beacon on the hovercraft.
                              (beat)
                         Keep switching taxis.  But stay on
                         Ninth.

               She hails another taxi.  She holds her hand over the
               IdentiScan before it can read her.  The taxi driver looks at
               her, sees her smile, sees the prepaid cash card she holds
               out to him.

 LISA                          Two hundred dollars if you don't
                         scan me.

               It's The Sprawl -- stranger things have happened.  He grabs
               the card, and jerks his head for her to get in.  They take
               off.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 97. 

 EXT. NINTH STREET LATER 
               Lisa gets out of the taxi and looks briefly into the sky.
               It is dense with holographic billboards, skim-jets,
               dirigibles.  Somewhere in all that is a Precrime hovercraft.

               And the neighborhood around her is definitely downscale.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          The hovercraft will try to drop
                         altitude, but the air traffic will
                         slow it down.
                              (beat)
                         Precrime loses you.  You'll have to
                         walk two miles.  Don't get scanned.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa walks hurriedly down a side street.  She stands out in
               her white dress -- a spot of vulnerable color in world of
               black.

               Too vulnerable to pass up.  A MAN in a gray overcoat slides
               out from between two buildings in front of her.  He is not
               coy about his intent.  He comes straight at her, all business.

               Lisa freezes in place.  She looks at her watch.  The man
               grabs her by the shoulder.  When she starts to scream, he
               claps his hand over her mouth, hard.

 MAN                          You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your
                         teeth out.

               Her eyes look around frantically.  He starts to drag her
               backwards into the dark.

               ANDERSON leaps into view, and slams the man's head into a
               light post.  It takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens
               his grip on Lisa.  His legs at last collapse under him.

               Anderson scoops Lisa off the ground.  She hugs him hard.

               Then pulls back from him.  She gives him a look.

 LISA                          Cut it a little close there,
                         honeybunch.

 ANDERSON                          Rose got the street wrong.  She's
                         getting weak.

 LISA                          Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 98. 

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- LATER 
               Rose sits up in bed silently watching Lisa and Anderson
               together.

               Lisa needs to touch him.  She keeps a hand on his arm, brushes
               back a loose look of his hair.  Rose is mesmerized by her
               actions.  She drinks in everything, every bit of life.

               Anderson and Lisa are deep in conversation.  They speak to
               each other as if Rose were hardly present in the room.

               Anderson is trying to process everything Lisa has told him.

 ANDERSON                          Two discs.  One fake.  One real.

 LISA                          I don't think there were supposed to
                         be two.  Whoever planned it, wasn't
                         counting on two.

               They are silent for a long time.  Rose watches them work it
               through.

 ANDERSON                          An infallible system.  Every disc
                         ever generated has been true ...

 LISA                          Somebody wants you out of the way --
                         so they make a fake disc.  Who ever
                         doubts the discs?

 ANDERSON                          I never doubted it.  I saw it.  And
                         believed it, absolutely.  I was
                         certain I was going to murder Witwer.

               Anderson is shaking.  Lisa wraps her arms around him.  His
               voice is a stunned whisper.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the fake, and believed so much
                         in the system, that I saw myself as
                         a murderer.
                              (beats)
                         And the Precogs picked up those
                         thoughts ...

 LISA                          And generated the second disc.  The
                         real one.

 ANDERSON                          A self-fulfilling prophesy.  I
                         believed it was true.  And that made
                         it true.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99. 

               Anderson and Lisa turn and look at Rose.  She lies curled on
               the bed, her face to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Rose.  If all this is based on a lie
                         -the fake disc -- then do I really
                         kill Witwer?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We see what we see.  I'm sorry,
                         Anderson.  It's been predicted.

               Such a small voice, delivering a message of such finality

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- MIDNIGHT 
               Lieutenant Glaser tries to get through to Witwer.  Witwer's
               back is turned to him.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We can't take chances, sir

               Witwer doesn't move or answer.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          It happens in less than three hours.
                              (beat)
                         We put you in a hovercraft and keep
                         you airborne -- until after the event.

 WITWER                          The event.

               Lieutenant Glaser shifts uncomfortably

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I've been ordered to get you onto
                         the craft.  By force if necessary.

 WITWER                          The event is inevitable, Lieutenant.

	        Witwer doesn't turn around.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The Precogs are never wrong.  The
                         event will take place.  I'm a
                         believer.  Aren't you?

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I don't leave this room without you,
                         sir.  The Security Panel insists.

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE SIMULTANEOUS 
               Anderson and Lisa keep working it, peeling away the layers.
               Rose lies silent.

 ANDERSON                          Nobody could slip a fake disc past
                         Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head.

 LISA                          He was the weak link in the perfect
                         system.

 ANDERSON                          Obsessive compulsive niners can't
                         allow changes in the routine

 LISA                          Something threw him off.
                              (beat)
                         He tried to tell me.  It didn't make
                         any sense.  Something about "spilled
                         coffee."
                              (beat)
                         Someone was in his office with him.
                         And coffee spilled ...

               We stay CLOSE ON Anderson and Lisa as Rose's voice cuts in.

 ROSE (V.O.)                          We were always treated as if we
                         weren't alive.  As if we weren't
                         there.

               The camera pulls back and they are watching her as she
               continues to speak.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          Even now.  You forget that I'm here.
                         You talk between yourselves.  And
                         when you need me to see into the
                         future, then you turn to me.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What is it?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We weren't just lost in the future.
                         We were in the Chamber, too.  Our
                         eyes were open.  In the present.

               And then Anderson gets it.  He kneels beside her bed

 ANDERSON                          Your eyes were open.  What did you
                         see, Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 101. 

 ROSE                          Who would I have told?  Who ever
                         talked to us?  Who cared that we
                         could talk?

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Who spilled the coffee?
                         Straight ahead ...

               Rose stares stright ahead ...

 MEMORY HIT 
               Rose sits in her chair in the Precog Chamber.  Her brothers
               sit in their usual places on either side of her.  The
               technicians tend to them.

               Rose's eyes are open.  She sees everything in the room.  The
               technicians, the machines ... and across the room a large
               window where she can see Ennis Page working the mainframe
               computer.

               Rose watches through the window ...

               As the computer emits discs, Page gathers them

 ROSE (V.O.)                          Ed Witwer entered Page's office.

               Witwer carries a mug of coffee.

               Ennis Page goes red in the face, stares at the coffee.  Speaks
               to Witwer, angrily, pointing to the coffee.  We can't hear
               the words.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Page was so upset at the sight of
                         the coffee.

               Witwer goes to put the coffee down on a small table.  It
               tips, and spills.

               Page looks like his head will explode.  He pulls a neatly
               folded white handkerchief out of his back pocket and drops
               to his hands and knees and begins to obsessively blot at the
               coffee stain on his spotless rug.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket,
                         reached over Page and put it in one
                         of the open cases.

               Witwer closes the case.  He looks through the window into
               the Precog Chamber, but the only one watching him is Rose --
               and what does she matter?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 102. 

               Page rises angrily from cleaning the rug.  Witwer shrugs in
               apology and leaves the room.  Page stares after him.

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Rose is weeping.  She looks at Anderson and Lisa.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          I didn't understand what I'd seen.
                         And I had no one to tell ...

               Lisa puts her arms around Rose Anderson tries to comprehend
               what he has heard.

 ANDERSON                          Ed ...

               Lisa turns, and speaks softly to her husband.

 LISA                          The perfect system -brought down by
                         a cup of coffee.  My god.

 ANDERSON                               (long beat)
                         He set into motion his own death.
                         He didn't know it would go this far.
                              (to Rose)
                         What makes me leave this room?  If I
                         stay here I won't kill him.  Right?

               But Rose and her brothers have already answered that question
               for him.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE 
               Lieutenant Glaser looks at his watch.  Witwer is still in
               his chair, turned away from him.

 WITWER                          You see, if you think you can put me
                         on a hovercraft and save me, then
                         you don't believe in the infallibility
                         of the Precog system.

               Lieutenant Glaser has his orders.  He begins to approach.

               And as he does, Witwer swivels his chair around, and lifts
               the weapon he has been holding and silently shoots Lieutenant
               Glaser in the forehead.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And what I do not want around me,
                         are nonbelievers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 103. 

               Witwer steps over the body as if it doesn't exist, and walks
               out of the office, locking the door behind him.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD -- LATER 
               Witwer gets out his car and looks at the two story concrete
               building that houses the lab.  The lights are out in all the
               windows except the back section of the second floor.  There,
               the lights burn brightly.

               Witwer sees Precrime officers posted at intervals around it.
               He smiles as if he knows something they don't.  He looks at
               his watch.  It is a cool night, but his face is slick with
               sweat.

               He walks to the entrance of the building.  An OFFICER 1s
               startled to see him.

 WITWER                          Things quiet?

 OFFICER                          Sir.  Should you ... be here?

 WITWER                          There's been a development.  A body's
                         been found in the Sprawl.

 OFFICER                          Anderson's?

 WITWER                          They're checking it out.  I need to
                         see what the Precogs have seen.

               Witwer is IdentiScanned.  The door opens and he goes in.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Dr. Resfield looks up as Witwer strides into the lab, carrying
               a tv under his arm.  Witwer is the last person he wants to
               see.

 WITWER                          Borrowed this from the technicians'
                         lounge.  You don't think they'll
                         mind, do you?

 DR.RESFIELD                          You shouldn't be here, Director.

               Dr. Resfield's eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall,
               the red numbers ticking off time in seconds.

               Witwer looks for a plug, finds one.  Plugs in the tv.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 104. 

 WITWER                          No, no.  This is exactly where I
                         should be.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You're under a lot of strain,
                         Director.

               Witwer finds what he's looking for -- the continuous loop of
               his murder by Anderson.  "Call Now!  Call Now!"

 WITWER                          And tv's so good for that -- soothes
                         the mind.

               Witwer turns his sweaty face to Resfield and gives him a
               bright smile.  The scientist looks like he wants to run out
               of the room.

               Witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the
               Precogs.  Two technicians hover over the Precogs adjusting
               IV's and turning dials on the Precogs's organic helmets.

               The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial.
               But they are no longer violently seizing -- they are too
               weak for that.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Bring me up to speed, Doc.

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're getting nothing from them.

 WITWER                          And that's because ... ?

               Witwer still grips him by the elbow.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I don't know.

 WITWER                          Do you think they know where Anderson
                         is?

 DR. RESFIELD                          It's impossible to tell.
                              (beat)
                         We've done everything.  Maybe even
                         too much.

 WITWER STARES AT THE PRECOGS 
 WITWER                          They know how to find Anderson for
                         me.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 105. 

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         They're the perfect machine, Doctor.
                         You just have to know which button
                         to push.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL 
               Rose looks like she's on fire.  Anderson wets another towel,
               wrings it over the sink.  Lisa takes it, and wipes down Rose's
               face and arms .

               Rose's lips are moving soundlessly.  Her eyes are shut tight.
               She begins to writhe in bed.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus Christ.

 LISA                          Come on, Rose.

 ANDERSON LOOKS AT HIS WATCH 
 ANDERSON                          One hour.  We hold it together for
                         an hour, Witwer lives -- and I'm not
                         a murderer.

 LISA                          She won't last an hour.

               It suddenly looks much worse than that.  Rose's body contorts
               horribly and she arches up off the bed.  Lisa can't control
               her.

               Anderson reaches for her, wraps her in his arms, trying to
               hold and comfort her.

 ANDERSON                          Rose!

               She begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms.

 ROSE                          He's killed him, Anderson!

               Rose stiffens into a seizure posture, then her body goes
               slack.  Anderson eases her back on the bed.  He stares at
               her, stricken.

               Her voice barely leaves her now

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          You didn't save my brother.

               Anderson reels at her words.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 106. 

 ANDERSON                          Did he kill both of them, Rose?
                         Rose!

               Rose manages to speak, one last time.  Her whispered words
               damn him.

 ROSE                          Does it matter, Anderson?

               Anderson rises.  Looks down at Rose.

               It matters.  He starts to move, quickly.

               Lisa takes hold of his arm.

 LISA                          If you leave this room...

	       Anderson kisses her.

 ANDERSON                          Then I'm a cop, just trying to do
                         hisjob.

               He reaches for his duffel bag.

               When the door closes behind him, Rose turns her head slightly
               and looks.  And then her eyes drift closed, as she goes to a
               place deep within her own mind.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL - MOMENTS LATER 
               He passes by several cars on the street.  But they're all
               auto-drive, they won't do him any good.

               So he smashes a store window within forty-five seconds a
               city police transport zooms up, lights flashing.  Two city
               officers leap out of the transport.  They approach the
               smashed-in store window, weapons drawn.  Which is a mistake.
               Anderson rises into view behind them, and sonically blasts a
               small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on.

               As they trip and fall, he is already spraying them down with
               BindFoam.

               Their second mistake is they left the engine running to power
               the bank of Nits -Tracker lights on the car's hood and roof.
               Anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets
               of The Sprawl, a beacon of light in the darkness.

 INT. THE LAB 
               The DIGITAL CLOCK races through time.  Witwer reaches his
               hand up and touches the vanishing numbers.

               The camera pulls back, and we see Dr. Resfield and the two
               technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 107. 

               And when we see the lab in its entirety, there sprawled on
               the floor in front of his chair is one of the Precog brothers.
               A small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of
               his skull.

               The other Precog sits very still in his chair.  He is still
               connected to everything -- his helmet is in place, the TVs
               drip into him.  His eyes are open, and when Witwer moves,
               the Precog's eyes follow him.

               Witwer can feel them on him.  He turns around.

 WITWER                          Is he coming?  No?  Yes?  Maybe?
                              (beat)
                         I think yes.

               The Precog looks at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And you think yes.

               Witwer points to the tv screen, running Anderson's murder of
               Witwer.  Witwer smiles triumphantly.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Infallibly, immutably yes.

               The Precog looks at him.  Witwer's smile vanishes, and
               suddenly strides across the room, and claps his hand over
               the Precog's eyes.  Then he turns, and stares again at the
               clock.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB 
               Three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the
               building, facing outward toward the parking lot, weapons
               cradled in their arms.

               Behind them is a line of yew bushes.  AS we watch, the officer
               on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes.
               Several moments pass, and the same thing happens to the
               officer on the right.

               The officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right.
               Then he looks hard.  He grips his weapon tight, and swings
               left.  No one there, either.

               ANDERSON drops him hard, from behind.  The officer crumples
               onto the cement.

               But Anderson's not done with him.  Anderson lifts him up,
               struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance.

               Anderson holds him upright in place.  The man's head lolls
               backward.  Which is.  Perfect for what Anderson needs to do.
               Anderson reaches his fingers towards the man's closed eyes.
               He pulls up on the eyelids.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 108. 

               An IdentiScan over the entrance clicks on and reads the man's
               eyes.  Access granted, the doors HISS open.  Anderson enters
               the building, dragging the officer with him.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Anderson enters the lab.  The very building sickens him.
               What he sees sickens him even more.

               The remaining Precog sits strapped into his chair.  Witwer
               sits beside him in the other Precog chair, the dead brother
               at his feet.  Witwer wears the dead Precog's helmet.  His
               hand is in his lap, holding a gun.

               He grins when Anderson appears.  He takes off the helmet,
               drops it on the floor.

 WITWER                          I figured, since I can see the future,
                         too, maybe I could get a little disc
                         action going.
                              (beat)
                         Just kidding.

               Anderson stares at his old partner.  Then he looks up at the
               digital clock.  Five-seventeen AM.  Witwer looks too, then
               turns back to Anderson.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You find you been doing that a lot
                         this week?  Looking at clocks?
                              (beat)
                         Three minutes to go.

               Anderson turns to the tv.

 ANDERSON                          There's never anything good on, you
                         know?

               Now Witwer smiles.

 WITWER                          There.  That's the old Paul.

 ANDERSON                          You're not the old Ed. You've lost
                         it.

               Witwer rises from the chair, the gun in his hand.

 WITWER                          You lost it.  You went weak in the
                         knees, partner.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not your partner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 109. 

               Witwer looks at him sadly.

 WITWER                          The air went out of you when Frank
                         D'Ignazio killed himself.

 ANDERSON                          He was guilty.  I accepted that.

 WITWER                          No you didn't.  The doubts were
                         creeping in on you.  The lab trying
                         to engineer more Precogs ... Malcolm
                         pressuring you to expand ...

               Witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining Precog
               brother's cheek.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Belief is the basis of the system.
                         It was your job to be the ultimate
                         believer.

               Witwer is breathing hard.  He lifts a hand and wipes the
               sweat from his face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And when Frank died, you faltered.
                         I'm a cop, I see into the hearts of
                         men.
                              (beat)
                         And the thing about you is, you
                         wouldn't have just walked away.

 ANDERSON                          Never been my style.

	      Witwer gives him the flicker of a smile

 WITWER                          Precrime needs to grow.  You would
                         have stood in its way.  The Security
                         Panel wouldn't have understood that.
                         What you're capable of.  What a
                         bulldog you are.
                              (beat)
                         Look what you've been doing to us
                         all week.  Amazing.  You're the best.

 ANDERSON                          So you took matters into your own hands.

 WITWER                          I understood the threat.  I understood
 YOU 
               Anderson looks at the dead Precog

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 110. 

 ANDERSON                          You killed a Precog.  You ended the
                         system you wanted to protect.

 WITWER                          Wrong.  This lab will make more.
                         Believe it, Paul.

               They look at the CLOCK.  Five-nineteen.

 ANDERSON                          Knowing the exact moment of your
                         death -it's made you crazy, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the tv.  The TV REALITY is almost in synch
               with what is happening in the room.

               Witwer lifts his gun -- and then realizes something is
               terribly wrong.

               Anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the
               disc -- except there is a major difference.

 WITWER                          You sonofabitch!

               Anderson lifts up both hands

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You didn't bring your gun!

 ANDERSON                          That's right.  No gun.

 WITWER                          You see?!  That's exactly what I'm
                         talking about.  You don't Believe!

               Anderson just looks at Witwer, raging at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The system is infallible.

               ANDERSON Doesn't Seem to be Witwer reaches behind him and
               pulls a second gun from out of his belt.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          I guess that's why I've always carried
                         two.

               He tosses the gun to Anderson.  It clatters at Anderson's
               feet.

 ANDERSON                          You can't have it both ways.  You
                         don't want to die.  That's why you
                         lured me here -- to kill me first.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 111. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         But it you don't diet the system is
                         flawed, and you couldn't live with
                         that.

               Witwer SHOOTS him once, in the right thigh.  Anderson cries
               out, falls to the concrete floor.

 WITWER                          Pick it up

               Anderson speaks through his teeth ANDERSON It doesn't happen.

               Witwer looks frantically at the tv, at the clock.

               He reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back IV
               feeding into the Precog's main line.  A thick, yellow fluid
               begins to flow toward the Precog's jugular vein.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You're killing him, partner.

               And what choice, finally, does Anderson have?  He reaches
               for the gun.

 ANDERSON                          Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains
                         his gun on Anderson.  Anderson trains
                         his gun on Witwer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Oh, Ed ...

               Witwer lowers his gun.  And stands there between Anderson
               and the doomed Precog.

               The yellow liquid has almost reached the Precog's jugular.

               Anderson shoots Witwer, once in the heart.  Witwer is thrown
               back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock.

               Anderson drags himself to the Precog, and rips the yellow IV
               out of the main line.  The yellow drips onto the floor,
               mingling with Witwer's red.

               Anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him.  Witwer
               whispers something, and Anderson leans close to hear him.

 WITWER                          Now do you believe?

               Anderson pulls away from Witwer, and lets him take his last
               breaths alone.

 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               It is Rose's face.  The camera pulls back and we see that
               she is lying on a grassy hillside.  Her brother is lying
               beside her.

               They are looking up at the night sky, at a sky filled with
               stars.

               Rose stares up into the sky, and speaks in a soft voice to
               her brother.

 ROSE                          James.  Can you guess what I'm

 THE END
"MINORITY REPORT" 
               -- Aug 15th 1997 rewrite by Jon Cohen


 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               The oval face is female, a woman of indeterminate age, her
               features as fragile as porcelain.  Her eyes are closed in
               sleep, or in death ... or in something in between.

               Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness.  They are
               male, and they float into position on either side of the
               female.  They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,
               and like the female their eyes are closed.

               The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch.  Her features,
               which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,
               into the face of a woman in fear.  Her eyes open.

               The male face on her right contorts too.  His features warp
               into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged.  His eyes
               open.

               The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young
               boy, a boy who is terribly frightened.  His eyes open wide.

               As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a
               sudden and unnerving exchange begins ...

 FEMALE                               (frightened woman)
 JOHNNY, PLEASE MALE RIGHT                               (mocking man)
                         "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 FEMALE                          You're scaring me.

 MALE LEFT                               (child's voice)

 MALE RIGHT                               (considering)

 FEMALE                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me.  Please.

 MALE RIGHT                          Oh, Carol.

 FEMALE                          Johnny!  Stop!

 MALE RIGHT                          Don't grab at me!  Let

 MALE LEFT                          Daddy!  No!

               All we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but
               we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us: a
               man with scissors lunging at his wife, her anguished scream,
               the whimpering cries of their son.

               And then there is silence, and it is over, and the three
               faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state.
               Their eyes slowly close.  They do not move.

               So that when they do move again, it is startling.  In abrupt
               unison, the EYES flash open.  Three pairs of eyes stare
               straight at us, accusing.

               Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and
               the dark reaches forth, and takes them.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 EXT. SUBURBIA DAY 
               Morning in America.  Just look at it.  America in the
               midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into
               the sun drenched distance.  White house upon white house.
               Emerald lawns, glistening with dew.

               In each driveway, a big Chevy, or a Ford, muscled with chrome,
               long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships.

               Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on
               trikes.  Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways,
               watching.  The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go
               back into their houses.

               Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height,
               boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes.  It
               is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are
               safe.

 INT. A HOUSE 
               A family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone
               fireplace, a console TV, a man's leatherette Barca-Lounger,
               a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of
               children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. 

               A young mother, CAROL, her hair -in a pony-tail, stands at a
               picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly
               at the scene outside.

 CAROL'S POV - A LITTLE GIRL 
               A little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk.  The ball
               gets away from her, and rolls into the street.

               At the same moment, a two-toned CHEVY, lush and huge, rounds
               the corner.

               The girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball.

 THE FAMILY ROOM 
               Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesn't cry
               out, or bang on the window, or run for the front door.  She
               watches.  And smiles a little.

 OUTSIDE 
               The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white
               shirt, thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of
               the car.

               Disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel.
               Not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in
               front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him.

               Through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road
               in front of him, going for her ball.

               CAROL Watches, her smile in place.

 OUTSIDE 
	       The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears 
	       down on her.

 INSIDE THE CHEVY 
               An alarm suddenly CHIRPS.  The car automatically brakes to a
               halt.  The man looks around the edge of his paper to see
               what is happening.

 THE STREET 
               The car has stopped, inches from the girl.

               The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink.
               She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. 

               The man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on
               its own, starts up again.  The car rounds a corner, and
               disappears.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               Carol turns away from the window.  She startles when she
               sees her husband, JOHNNY, is there behind her.  He is in his
               pajamas.  How long has he been there, watching her?

 JOHNNY                               (gruff)
                         Why'd you let me sleep so long?

 CAROL                          It's Saturday, Johnny, you always --
                              (beat)
                         Why are you staring at me like that?

               He takes a step toward her.  He stands there, his thick black
               hair tousled with sleep, scratching his stubbled jaw,
               considering her.

 JOHNNY                          I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so
                         long.

               He takes another step toward her.  She doesn't move a muscle.
               A little BOY suddenly enters the room.  Johnny turns, looks
               at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife.  Then,
               without a word, he begins to walk out of the room.  On his
               way out, Johnny's eyes flick to Carol's sewing basket, which
               sits beside a sewing machine.  It is not the sewing that has
               caught his attention, but a large pair of garment SCISSORS
               which lie across a fold of colored cloth.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Johnny stands on the front porch, scratching.  He walks down
               his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper.
               Carol stands in the doorway, watching him.

               A SHADOW slides over Johnny, cast from above.  The air fills
               with the piercing WHINE of an engine.  Johnny looks up,
               alarmed.

               In the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban
               trees, is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT.

               The children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone
               freezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable
               drama.

               Racing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him, are SLEEK
               TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS, lethal and efficient looking -- they
               seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat
               Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to
               process them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. 

               Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.
               More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses.  Their
               uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light.  Their
               left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some
               sort of complicated glove.

 CLOSE 
 ON - A GLOVE 
               The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger
               ending in an open barrel.

               Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not
               America in the 1950's.  It is the neo-past, the retro world
               of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is
               intermeshed with hypertechnology.

               And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he
               makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering
               behind him.  He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out
               of the way.

               Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a
               backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a
               handle grip and an ovoid screen.  It is a holographic scanner.

               He activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an
               IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form.

               The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver
               a dozen times.

               In less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three
               dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning
               like living beings -- has been created.  An overwhelming
               police deterrent presence has been established.

 INSIDE THE HOUSE 
               The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house,
               too.  It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and
               which are scanned holographs.  The juxtaposition of the
               futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.

 INSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET 
               Johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his
               wife's dresses.

 UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 
               Two OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands
               out in front of them, palm out.  When the first officer points
               his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove
               BEEPS softly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. 

               The officer looks at his PALM.  A red thermal IMAGE appears
               on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching
               man.  The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second
               officer.

 THE BEDROOM 
               The room is packed with police -- how many are real?

 THE CLOSET 
               Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat.  He calls
               out through the door.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do anything!

 OUTSIDE THE CLOSET 
               Every OFFICER in the room lifts his gloved hand and points
               his index barrel at the closet door.  The effect is deeply
               accusatory.

               An OFFICER speaks, his VOICE electronically manipulated to
               be as menacing as possible.

 OFFICER 1                          Come out of the closet on your hands
                         and knees.

               Nothing happens.  Two officers aim their barrels at the
               perimeter of the door.  In repeated, small SONIC BLASTS, the
               closet door is blown off of its frame, revealing Johnny among
               the dresses.

               Johnny starts to rise, and BAM, a section of floorboards is
               blasted away beneath his feet.

 OFFICER 1                          Hands and knees!

               Johnny trips among the splintered floorboards, and drops.
               He stays on his hands and knees, and approaches.  He lifts
               his head and looks up at the officer.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't... 

		Another OFFICER 2 bends down with a DEVICE -- the words
		"IdentiScan" on its side -- and blips a red laser light 
		into each of Johnny's, eyes, reading his irises.  The 
                officer nods affirmatively to the other officer.

 OFFICER 2 POSITIVE FOR JOHN PALMER. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 7. 

 OFFICER 1                               (to Johnny)
                         John Palmer, if you were being
                         arrested for any other crime, I would
                         now read you your rights.
                              (beat)
                         But you are under arrest for the
                         future murderer of your wife, Carol
                         Palmer.  You have no rights.

               Johnny, on his hands and knees, goes limp.

 EXT. THE HOUSE -- LATER 
               In the background, Johnny is guided into a Precrime police
               vehicle as the neighbors look on.  Carol and her son stand
               in the doorway, stunned.

               TWO OFFICERS remove their helmets.  The first man is tall,
               sandy-haired, good eyes, deeply blue; This is PAUL ANDERSON,
               late thirties, Director of the Precrime Division, Washington
 D.C. 
               The second man is ED WITWER, Anderson's second in command,
               late thirties, big like Anderson, good face, strong in the
               shoulders, short brown hair.

               The two men are deeply comfortable together.  They can speak,
               or not.  It doesn't matter -- they still communicate.  Two
               good cops, good together.

               They walk side-by-side around the house, dematerializing the
               holographic decoy cops.

 WITWER                          Thought we might a had a runner.

               Anderson seems tired, takes a moment to answer.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah, a runner.

 WITWER                          A little chase -- that'd been good.

 ANDERSON                          Fifty cops on the scene takes the
                         chase out of them.

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         But only eight of us were real.

               Witwer dematerializes the last decoy.

 ANDERSON                          We ever get a runner, I'd be too old
                         to give chase.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. 

 WITWER                          You'd chase.  You'd love it,.  Man.

               They get to the front of the house and watch the Precrime
               vehicle holding Johnny zoom SOUNDLESSLY away.

 ANDERSON                          I love it more Johnny boy doesn't
                         get to murder his wife.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         It's a beautiful world.

 EXT. SAME SCENE -- LATER 
               The children play on their trikes.  The wives talk among
               themselves.  The birds sing, the dogs bark.

               The little girl bounces her red ball again.  She stops a.
               minute, when two pieces of newspaper blow past her,
               unexpectantly littering the orderly suburban landscape.

 INT. A BEDROOM - SUBURBAN VIRGINIA (OUTSIDE WASHINGTON) DAY 
               Decorated in a 1950's style.  Anderson lies in bed beside
               his wife, LISA, a pretty, green-eyed brunette.  It is early
               morning, they are both awake.  Her hand caresses his chest.
               Maybe they will make love.

               Lisa's hand stops suddenly on the center of Anderson's chest.

 LISA                          Jesus, Paul.  Your heart's hammering.
                              (playfully)
                         I excite you that much?

               He turns to her, and the grim set of his jaw makes her smile
               vanish.

 ANDERSON                          I used to love being a cop.  

 LISA                          You're still a cop.  I'm a factory
                         worker.  We don't catch murderers.
                         We process them.

               Lisa takes a long breath.  She's been down this road before.
               She speaks reassuringly.

 LISA                          You're the best homicide cop in the
                         country.

	       ANDERSON snorts disdainfully.

 ANDERSON                          Great -- except there's no such thing
                         as homicide.  What I do best doesn't
                         exist anymore.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9. 

 LISA PAUL.                               (beat)
                         You're the Director of a perfect
                         system.  A Cop with a perfect record

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs have a perfect record.
                         They identify the accused -- I just
                         put on my monkey suit and go round
                         them up.

               Lisa hugs him, kisses the back of his neck.

 LISA                          And then I prosecute them.  And they
                         go to jail.  And lives are saved.
                         Thousands of lives.
                              (beat)
                         And that's a cop's dream.

               Anderson is silent for a time.  He sighs, then smiles, and
               turns to his wife, takes her in his arms.

 ANDERSON                          No.  You're a cop's dream.

 INT. THE BATHROOM -- LATER 
               Anderson steps out of the shower, and begins to towel himself
               dry- He glances out a casement window.  He tilts his head,
               curious, then wipes at the steam on the window.

 ANDERSON'S POV LISA 
               Lisa stands in the backyard in her nightgown, talking on a
               cell phone.  She hangs up, moves quickly back into the house.

 ANDERSON 
               Cocks his head, then goes back to toweling off.

 INT. KITCHEN -- LATER 
               Checkered linoleum floor.  Appliances out of the 1950's.

               Except there are little differences.  When Lisa puts a skillet
               of eggs on the stove, the heating element is not an electric
               coil, or gas but a shimmering field of light.

               Lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket.
               Anderson wears a gray suit, thin blue tie, white shirt,
               wingtipped shoes.  He doesn't look up from the newspaper as
               he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          Who called?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. 

               Lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs.  She touches
               her long brown hair.

 LISA                          No one.  I called about my hair.
                         Getting it done this afternoon.

               Anderson looks like he's about to say something else, when
               suddenly someone RAPS on the back screen door.  Anderson and
               Lisa both turn and smile.

 ANDERSON                          Come on in, neighbor.  Want some
                         coffee?

 OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
               FRANK D'IGNAZIO, 65, white-haired, robust, hesitates before
               coming in.  A thin METALLIC ARM with a red laser light arches
               quickly down from above the doorway, shines into each of his
               EYES, scanning the irises.  The arm lifts out of view, the
               screen door UNLATCHES.

               Frank enters the kitchen, carrying a basket of tomatoes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Brought these for your supper.

 LISA                          Oh, Frank.  That's so sweet.  Thank
                         you.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Sweet, nothing.  I gotta get rid of
                         these things.  One plant, and I'm
                         invaded by tomatoes.  When I was a
                         kid ...

               Anderson laughs, claps his friend and neighbor on the back,
               teases him.

 ANDERSON                          Before all this genetically engineered
                         crap ...

               Frank gives him an ornery look, then a smile.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Yeah well, it's true.  It used to be
                         a challenge to grow things.  An art.
                         Now you put one plant in the ground
                         -- then jump the hell out of the
                         way.

               Anderson gestures for Frank to sit down.

 ANDERSON                          Coffee?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. 

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Nah, thanks.  Can't stay.  You guys
                         are rushing off to work anyway.

               Lisa sets the eggs down in front of Anderson.

 LISA                          You and Ellie come for supper then.

 ANDERSON                          We'll barbecue.

               Frank nods and pushes on the screen door.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          You betcha.  We'll bring some more
                         tomatoes -- a new batch will have
                         grown by then.

               They all laugh, Frank exits, Anderson goes back to his paper.

 EXT. DRIVEWAY -- LATER 
               Anderson waves to Lisa.  Her big Studebaker drives off down
               the tree-lined street and away.

               Anderson approaches his Chevy.  He doesn't take out a key to
               unlock it.  There is no lock.  He slides in behind the wheel.
               Doesn't take out a key for the ignition -- there is no
               ignition.

               A thin METALLIC ARM arches down from the sun visor, scans
               Anderson's EYES, identifying him.  A seat harness wraps around
               him, and the car STARTS.

               Anderson picks up a folder marked "Precrime" and begins to
               read through the papers.  The Chevy backs out of the driveway
               and takes him to work.

 EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - ALEXANDRIA, VA -- LATER 
               A vast spread of corporate and government buildings -- the
               spillover from Washington D.C. across the Potomac River into
               Virginia.

               Beyond the white of Washington is "The Sprawl" -- the massive
               unzoned city that has spread uncontrolled on the outskirts
               of the Capitol.  It is impenetrable and uninviting, especially
               to those comfortable in the utopian suburbs.

               Anderson's Chevy moves in a sea of fifties-type cars.
               Occasionally, an ultramodern vehicle zips past them.  In the
               sky above is another sea -- of advertising dirigibles,
               holographic billboards, hovercrafts, skim-jet transports.
               On one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to
               flash: "I LIKE MIKE!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. 

               Then a picture of the smiling President appears.  Then the
               words: "RE-ELECT PRESIDENT MIKE BILLINGS FOR ANOTHER FOUR
 YEARS! KEEP THE PAST IN OUR FUTURE!" 
 INSIDE ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Through his windshield, Anderson glances at a holographic
               road sign.

               THE ROAD SIGN reads: "FBI Headquarters 1 mile.  CIA
               Headquarters 1.5 miles.  PRECRIME Headquarters 2 miles."

               Anderson goes back to his papers.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair.
               He abruptly rises and begins to pace.  The room is large,
               but he paces like a lion confined in a cage.

               He punches an intercom.  A female VOICE responds.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          Yes, Director Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Where's Ennis Page?  Why hasn't he
                         delivered this morning's Precog discs?

               Ed Witwer opens the door to the office., and casually walks
               in.

 INTERCOM VOICE                          I'll find him, sir.

               Ed shakes his head, smiles.

 WITWER                          Bullying the staff again, Director
                         Anderson?

 ANDERSON                          Screw you.

               Anderson turns away and stares out a large window.  Witwer
               joins him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Was that fun for you, yesterday?

 WITWER                          The Johnny Palmer bust?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It was okay.  We got our man.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. 

               Anderson takes a long breath.

 ANDERSON                          When do we not get our man?

               They turn as Ennis PAGE, 44, a thin, tight little man with
               burr cut hair, knocks and enters the room.  He carries a
               black BRIEFCASE marked:

               "Zone 218 - Washington/Alexandria, VA." The case is cuffed
               to his wrist.

 PAGE                          Sorry I'm late, sir.  Precogs put
                         out a heavy national volume this
                         morning -- four for our zone.

 ANDERSON (DISTRACTED)                          Put the case on my desk, Ennis.

               Page hesitates, doesn't do it.  Anderson moves quickly to
               Page.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          What was I thinking.

               Anderson leans over the BRIEFCASE.  A small panel recedes, a
               red laser scanner clicks on, scans Anderson's eyes, BEEPS
               affirmatively, then clicks off.  The cuff on Page's wrist
               falls open.

               Now Page puts the case on Anderson's desk.  Page hesitates.
               Anderson and Witwer know just what he's going to do.  Page
               reaches down, unable to resist straightening a pile of papers
               strewn on Anderson's desk.

               Anderson and Witwer exchange knowing smiles.  When Page looks
               up they try to cover, but are not quick enough.  He frowns
               tightly, and heads for the door.

               Anderson calls after him.

 ANDERSON                          Thanks, Ennis.  

               Witwer turns to leave, too.

 WITWER                          Now that's a guy who really cares.

               Witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office.

               Anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk, and opens
               the briefcase.  Four small bright DISCS sit in rows.  He
               removes one, places it in a VIDEO MONITOR that lifts into
               view from the center of his desk.  He sits back, weary, and
               watches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. 

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A young black woman stands in a hallway.  She stares at a
               door, gun in hand.  She opens the door, enters a bedroom.

               She glides toward a bed, where a man lies sleeping.  She
               lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form.

               ANDERSON pops the disc, jots down some notes, pops in a new
               disc.

 VIDEO SCREEN 
               A white woman stands at a stove, cooking.  A man comes up
               behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands.
               He raises the necktie toward her neck

 ANDERSON 
               He's not watching the screen.  He is out of his chair now, 
               looking out the window.

 INT. PRECRIME MAIN LOBBY 
               A tour of Precrime is in progress, like the public relations
               tours run by present-day FBI.  The TOUR GUIDE, a pretty,
               smartly uniformed woman in her twenties, leads a group of
               adults and children, all with glowing nametags, through the
               building.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               The group follows the guide slowly through the lobby.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Precrime was established in 2030,
                         with the harnessing of the remarkable
                         talents of the Precognitive mutants.

               She points cheerfully to a stubby little man, MR. HARRIS.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Mr. Harris, can you tell me how many
                         Precogs there are?

 MR. HARRIS                          Three.  Uh, right?

 TOUR GUIDE                          That's exactly right!  A lot of people
                         assume there are Precogs in every
                         branch office.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. 

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          But there are only three Precogs,
                         right here in this building.  And
                         the information they give us, we
                         send out to all the other branches.
                              (beat)
                         And what is that information -what
                         do the Precogs do?

               An eager boy, TIMMY has the answer to that one.

 TIMMY                          They protect us.

               The guide tousles his hair.

 TOUR GUIDE                               (chipper voice)
                         That's right, Timmy.  Because of the
                         Precogs, you're going to grow up
                         murderfree.  Isn't that something?

 MR. HARRIS                          They ever wrong?  The Precogs ever
                         screw up when they predict a murder?

               The guide laughs tolerantly.

 TOUR GUIDE                          Never, sir.  It's an infallible
                         system.  The Precogs predict a
                         homicide, and our Precrime police
                         then apprehend that future murderer
                         before the event occurs.  And right
                         next door is the Judicial Center,
                         where we prosecute the
                         future murderers.

 TIMMY                          Can we see the Precogs?

 TOUR GUIDE                          No, I'm sorry.  That part of the
                         building is not open to the public.
                              (beat)
                         Now, if you'll just step this way
 ... 
               She waves the group on toward an elevator.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The chamber is an elaborate, hypertech hospital, constructed
               for the maintenance of three beings -- the Precogs.  They
               are triplets -- two of the Precogs are male, one is female.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. 

               Technicians swarm all over them like worker bees.  The bodies
               of the Precogs are being tended to: exercised, cleansed,
               groomed.

               The head of each Precog is encased in a complex, ornate HELMET
               that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright
               metallics.  The helmets pulse slightly, and the surfaces
               seem to flow and shift, like oil on water.

               A network of micro-thin cables that are actually strands of
               light, rise Medusa-like from each helmet, then centralize
               into a single strand, and connect to a massive mainframe
               computer.

               The Precogs appear to be in suspended animation, or in comas.
               They are absolutely still and limp -- except for their faces.
               Their faces are in constant motion, the lips mouthing scenes
               from murders only they can see.  Life for a Precog is an
               endless cycle of death.

 CLOSE ON - THE FEMALE PRECOG 
               we recognize her fragile and perfect FACE from the opening
               scene of the movie.  She floats in a glowing nutritive bath.
               Like her brothers, she seems to be eternally young, or
               eternally old.

               The technicians lift her from her bath.  She is dried, dressed
               in a robe, then guided into an over-sized, throne like chair.
               Her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side
               of her.

               Not once are their helmets removed.  What they feed into the
               mainframe is too valuable.  It must be gathered twenty-four
               unrelenting hours a day.

 INT. A ROOM 
               Ennis Page sits in a room just off the Precog Chamber.  He
               can see them through a large window.  He works a large
               computer console, the gathering point for the information
               the Precogs constantly feed the computer.

               Perhaps every ten seconds, a small DISC is released by the
               computer, and mechanically gathered, sorted, and placed -under
               Page's watchful eye -- into a black case.

               ANDERSON is in the room standing quietly behind Page.  As
               Director, Anderson is authorized to come and go, but from
               his fussy movements, it's obvious Page sees anyone else in
               the room as an intruder in his special domain.

               Anderson turns and looks through the window at the Precogs.

 ANDERSON                          What would they think about if we
                         unhooked them?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. 

               Page looks up from his work.

 PAGE                          They don't think, sir.  They just
                         see.

               Anderson is silent.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          They're not even alive, really.

               Anderson contemplates the scene, nods to Page's words, then
               turns and walks out of the room, as Page looks on.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 


               The female Precog sits in her chair.  Her eyes are open.
               She faces the window that looks into Page's main frame room.
               In the window we see Anderson leaving the room.

               The female Precog's eyes drift closed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT.COURTROOM - JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               A trial is in progress.  The defendant is Johnny Palmer.  He
               sits, ashen, at a table, his DEFENSE ATTORNEY beside him.

               There are no jurors in the Juror BOX.  There is a JUDGE, 55,
               and stern.  There are a few people in the public seats.

               The Precrime prosecuting attorney is Lisa Anderson.  She
               wears a black robe, and addresses the Director of Precrime,
               Anderson, who sits in the witness stand.

 LISA                          Director Anderson, do you swear that
                         the disc you now present to the court
                         is the only and authentic disc of
                         the future murder of Carol Palmer by
                         her husband, John Palmer?

               It is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of
               times.  Anderson gives the rote answer as he holds up the
 DISC. 
 ANDERSON                          Yes.  This is the only and authentic
                         disc of the event seen by the
                         Precognitive mutants and recorded by
                         the Precrime Division.  This is the
                         immutable evidence of the infallible
                         system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. 

 LISA                          The murder of Carol Palmer will occur
 ... ? 
 ANDERSON                          In one week -- June 16th, 2040 at
                         10:33 in the morning.

               Lisa steps back.  The judge reaches out and Anderson hands
               him the disc.  The judge inserts it into a special video
               machine on his desk.  Anderson steps down, his ritual part
               in this trial completed.

               A huge MONITOR comes to life behind the judge.  He does not
               turn around to watch -- he has his own monitor.

               Johnny Palmer watches, eyes wide.  We now see, in detail,
               what we previously heard the Precogs act out in the beginning
               of the movie.

 THE MONITOR 
               The Palmer's family room.  Johnny reaches into Carol's sewing
               basket for the scissors.  Carol stands defenseless in front
               of him.  Their son cowers in a corner of the room.

 CAROL                          Johnny, please --

 JOHNNY                          "Johnny, please.  Johnny please."

 CAROL                          You're scaring me.

 JOHNNY'S SON DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
               Johnny approaches his wife with deadly menace.

 JOHNNY                               (considering)
                         I don't like you any more, Carol.

 CAROL                               (imploring)
                         Put the scissors down.  You're scaring
                         me. Please.  

               We cut away from the monitor and stay on JOHNNY PALMER'S FACE 
               as he sits at the defense table.  He winces at each terrible exchange.

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Oh, Carol.

 CAROL (O.S.)                          Johnny!  Stop!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. 

 JOHNNY (O.S.)                          Don't grab at me!  Let go...

 JOHNNY'S SON (O.S.)                          Daddy!  No!

               Johnny Palmer cries out as the MONITOR goes blank.

 JOHNNY                          I didn't do it.  I'm innocent!  It
                         didn't happen!

               The JUDGE hits his gavel.

 JUDGE                          How does the defense plead?

               The defense attorney glances at his watch, then quickly
               rattles off the words to his part of this judicial ritual.

 DEFENSE ATTORNEY                          The defense acknowledges the
                         infallibility of the system.  We are
                         Guilty.  We throw ourselves at the
                         mercy of the court.

 JOHNNY                          No! No! The Precogs are wrong!  No!

               The court guards are on him in an instant.  They lead him
               out of the courtroom.

 INT.A BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson pushes down a tight hallway thick with police and
               enters a disheveled room.  The fifties interior is drab: a
               Formica table, bad curtains, a frayed Lazy Boy positioned in
               front of a TV.

               Ed Witwer is already on the scene.  He stands a few feet
               from the BODY of a man, gunshot wound to the head, a handgun
               on the floor nearby.

 WITWER                               (to Anderson)
                         Looks like the old days.

               Anderson nods to his former partner.  Anderson leans over
               the body.

 ANDERSON                          That would be bad news for an
                         infallible system.

               Witwer is suddenly bored.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 20. 

 WITWER                          We know it can't be a murder -- the
                         Precogs would've seen it.  Why do
                         you insist on coming to these things?

 ANDERSON                          Keeps the system honest.  And besides,
                         I like to pretend I'm a cop.

               Anderson turns to an officer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Who's got the Coroner?

               Another OFFICER steps forward with a large blue case.

 OFFICER                          Right here, sir.

               The officer places the case beside the corpse, and opens the
               latches.  Inside the case is a large metallic APPARATUS: the
               "Coroner."

               It comes to auto-life, and begins to unfold itself - It rises
               crab-like, and steps out of its case.

               Except for his mouth, the doctor doesn't move.  His projected
               image stands beside the body, his arms folded behind his
               back.  He is the interface, the way the humans communicate
               with the crab apparatus.

 ANDERSON                          Hi DOC.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Hello, Director Anderson.

               The coroner crab begins to walk the body, which is face down
               on the floor.  It moves slowly, hesitating as it crawls the
               body's back to insert various razor thin probes and core
               samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord.

 WITWER                          This a homicide, Doc?

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I'm presently analyzing neurohormones,
                         Assistant Director Witwer.  I have
                         not concluded my examination.

               The crab engulfs the back of the head, probes the wound.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          I'm detecting carbonization of skull
                         fragments around the entry wound.

               Witwer whispers to Anderson.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. 

 WITWER                          Bingo.  The guy put the gun to his
                         own head.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          I have not determined that yet,
                         Assistant Director.

               Witwer grins.

 WITWER                          You have good ears for a ghost, Doc.

               The coroner crab steps away from the body.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Please rotate the corpse to the
                         lateral supine position.

               Two officers turn the body face-up.  The crab inches close
               to probe the face.  Disconcertingly, it lifts the eyelids,
               and examines the interior of the mouth, so that for a moment
               the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive.

               Then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs At last, it
               comes to a standstill.  The holographic Doctor closes his
               eyes as if in thought.

 WITWER                          Can you imagine if this was a
                         homicide?  Who even knows how to
                         hunt down a killer any more?

               Anderson gives him a hard look.

 ANDERSON                          I know how, dammit.  You know how.

 WITWER                          Easy, partner.
                              (beat)
                         But you know what I'm saying.  The
                         state legislatures are pushing to
                         stop funding for training homicide
                         detectives ...

 ANDERSON                          God bless the Precogs.

               The Doctor opens his eyes.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          This event is a negative homicide.
                         A mortal wound was generated by a
                         .22 calibre bullet self-delivered to
                         the parietal 'portion of the skull

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. 

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)                          Eastern Standard Time.  This event
                         is a positive suicide.

               The holographic doctor begins to shimmer, then disappears
               back into the coroner crab.  The crab crawls back into its
               case, folds its probes and legs tight to its metal body, and
               shuts down.

               Witwer turns to Anderson.

 WITWER                          It's time to stop coming to these,
                         partner.

               Anderson watches as the med techs lift the body onto a
               stretcher.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  You're right.

 INT. A BANQUET - WASHINGTON, D.C. -- NIGHT 
               Anderson, in black-tie, with Lisa in a shimmering blue gown
               at his side, moves through a huge room filled high level
               government officials and politicians.

 ANDERSON                          A little bit of me dies every time I
                         come to one of these things.

 LISA                          It's only a party, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I'd never have let them appoint me
                         to Precrime if I'd have known this
                         was going to be part of it.

 LISA                          You're exactly what Precrime needed.
                         An amazing homicide cop and a real
                         person in an unreal job.

 ANDERSON                          Exactly.  

 LISA 			 The public loves the
                         Precogs.  But they give people the
                         creeps, too.  You're something they
                         understandp a regular cop running
                         things.

               Anderson sighs as he looks around the elegantly appointed
               banquet hall.

 ANDERSON                          Let's invite all these irregular
                         assholes over for a barbecue.  Burgers
                         and beer - think they'd come?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. 

               A barrel-chested man with a great shock of pepper gray hair,
               SENATOR MALCOLM, 58, takes hold of Anderson's elbow from
               behind.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I'd come, Mr. Director.  And I'd
                         make all the other assholes come
                         with me.

               Lisa reddens, Anderson gives an embarrassed cough.  The
               Senator laughs and claps him on the back.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Nice job this morning.  Another
                         negative homicide.  The Precogs never
                         let us down.

               Mrs. Malcolm smoothly occupies Lisa, while the Senator eases
               Anderson in the opposite direction 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                         I have a dream, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I know you do, Senator.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Hundreds of Precogs.  Not just
                         predicting murders, but predicting
                         all crimes.  Burglary, arson, assaults
 ... 
 ANDERSON                          How about jaywalking?  Littering?
                         Now there's a crime.

               The Senator smiles through his teeth.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          I don't want a police state, you
                         know that.  But we have an opportunity
                         here, and

 ANDERSON                          No sir, we don't have that
                         opportunity.  There are only three
                         Precogs.  They're a lucky accident
                         of nature.  There are no more.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (beat)
                         We can make more.  Just give me your
                         support.  Help me increase funding
                         for the Precog Engineering Project.

 ANDERSON                          Precogs aren't sheep or pigs.  Seeing
                         into the future is a gift, a
                         nonreproducible event.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          There was only one Mozart, and there
                         are only three Precogs.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Fuck Mozart.  The people want to be
                         safe.  They want that more than they
                         want food or love.

               He gestures at the room full of glittering partygoers.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Look at us -it's 2040 and we've
                         wrapped ourselves up in the 1950's
                         like a big security blanket.  Why?
                         Because we want to feel like they
                         felt.  Safe.

 ANDERSON                          Senator, a world filled with hundreds
                         of Precogs is not my idea of a safe
                         place.

               The Senator gives it one last shot.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          Sure could use your help, Paul.

 ANDERSON                          I decline, Senator.  I'm sorry.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                               (icily)
                         Don't think I'll come to your barbecue
                         after all.

               The senator moves off.  Anderson stands stiffly among the
               sea of black-ties and exquisite fifties dresses.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD DAY 
               Anderson walks through the lab with a tall, pale man, DR,
               RESFIELD, 60, the head scientist.  It is not a place that
               warms Anderson's heart.

               Biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting
               and examining protoplasmic tissue masses.  Other technicians
               peer through massive microscopes.  Still others use robotic
               arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded-glass
               barriers.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You don't get out here much.

 ANDERSON                          Not my sort of place.

               Dr. Resfield emits a dry little laugh.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          The head of Precrime squeamish?

 ANDERSON                          When it comes to needles and scalpels,
                         yeah.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I promise we won't use any on you.

 ANDERSON                          What do you use them on?

 DR. RESFIELD                               (beat)
                         On bits of this and that.

               Anderson looks at him.  The doctor pauses outside a thick
               door.  An IdentiScan device quickly reads their eyes, and
               the door opens with an electronic hiss.

               Anderson looks around the lab.  Technicians lower mesh
               cylinders into some sort of chemical VAT.  Another technician
               turns a dial, and an electric charge courses through the
               roiling liquid.

 ANDERSON                          What's happening here?

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're in an interesting phase.

 ANDERSON                          What's in the cylinders?

 DR. RESFIELD                          Neurotissue.

 ANDERSON                          From ...?

 DR. RESFIELD                          A fusion of sources.  From the
                         Precogs' deceased mother.  From the
                         Precogs themselves.

 ANDERSON                          A fusion of ... ?

 DR. RESFIELD                          In lay terms, we mated sperm from
                         the brothers with ova from the mother
                         and sister to create new growth.

               The CYLINDERS shudder as the voltage is increased.

 DR. RESFIELD (CONT'D)                          And then we add mutating variables.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. 

               Anderson stares into the roiling vat.  Dr. Resfield waits
               for more questions.  But it is clear from Anderson's
               expression he has already learned enough.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in his office reviewing Precog discs for
               premurders in the local Washington area. We stay on him as he
               watches the monitor.  He pops the disc, jots down some notes,
               slides in the next disc.

               Anderson's mouth slowly opens.  He leans close to the monitor,
               his face ashen.

 EXT. FRANK D'IGNAZIO'S BACKYARD -- LATER 
               Frank is on his hands and knees, working his vegetable garden.
               He whistles softly under his breath as he trowels the rich
               soil.

               He sits up as he hears someone open the garden gate.  He
               lifts his straw hat in greeting, gives a smile.  It's
 ANDERSON. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          What are you doing, playing hooky?

               Anderson tries to smile.  But it won't come.  He looks around
               the abundant garden.

 ANDERSON                          It's great out here, Frank.. You got
                         the touch.

               Frank straightens with a grimace.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          I got the arthritis, is what I got.

               Anderson reflexively looks up at a high WHINING sound from
               over head.  Frank follows his gaze.  A Precrime HOVERCRAFT
               glides into position overhead.

               Frank stares, then lowers his eyes to the ground.  He takes
               a long sad breath.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          Ah shit, neighbor.
                              (beat)
                         Goddamn Precogs don't miss a beat,
                         do they?
                              (beat)
                         Can we do this inside?  Ellie's not
                         home.

               Anderson's voice is full of pain.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. 

 ANDERSON                          Sure, Frank.  Yeah.

 INT. FRANK'S KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 


               Frank wanders the kitchen, trying to focus on his situation.
               Anderson has trouble meeting his friend's eyes.

               Through a window we can see black suited police officers
               with mirrored helmets swarming outside Frank's house.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (distracted)
                         I thought I'd buried it all.
                         Thirty-five years -- all those minutes
                         and days to bury it.
                              (beat)
                         But suddenly you see the man who
                         murdered your daughter walking the
                         streets -- my God it throws you.

               Frank stops pacing.  He stares at a kitchen drawer.

 ANDERSON                          He'd served his time, Frank.  I know
                         it's not fair.  It's way beyond not
                         fair ...

               Frank looks.  At Anderson bitterly.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (yells)
                         God damn the Precogs.  You know?
                         Why couldn't they have been around
                         to save my girl?
                              (softly)
                         Now they're catching me.

               Frank reaches into the drawer and pulls out a small handgun.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)                          I really shoot the bastard, huh?
                         When?

 ANDERSON                          Next Wednesday, at noon.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                          Good.

               Anderson's cop eyes are all over the gun.

 ANDERSON                          It's not in you, Frank, to kill
                         anybody.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28. 

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Tell it to the Precogs.  It's set in
                         stone now, right?

               Frank puts the gun on the kitchen counter.  Anderson relaxes.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (almost inaudible)
                         I don't want to be a part of this
                         world anymore.

 ANDERSON                          I know, Frank.

               Frank gives Anderson a look -- no, friend, you don't know.
               Then Frank looks hard at the gun on the counter.

 FRANK D'IGNAZIO                               (beat)
                         So.  Tell me, Paul.  Do the Precogs
                         see everything?

 ANDERSON                          No.

 FRANK D'IGRAZIO                          Then they won't have seen this.

               Frank suddenly snatches up the gun and presses it to his own
               head.  On Anderson's anguished FACE, at the SOUND of the gun
               going off.

 EXT. FRONT YARD -- LATER 
               Anderson stands with his old partner, Witwer, on Frank's
               front porch.  Behind them, through an open door, we see Lisa
               comforting Ellie D'Ignazio in the living room.

               Anderson is deeply shaken.  Witwer tries to talk him through
               it.

 WITWER (GENTLY)                          We had to bring him in.

               Anderson doesn't respond.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He was a future murderer.

 ANDERSON                               (angrily)
                         You blame him?  The guy killed his
                         daughter!

               Witwer lets the implication of his words sink in.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Yeah.  I know.  I know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29. 

               Anderson turns and watches as they wheel Frank's draped body
               into the back of an ambulance.  Anderson's bitterness erupts.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I hate the Precogs, Ed. I believe in
                         them absolutely and I hate them
                         absolutely.  Jesus.

               Witwer listens to him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          And that goddamn lab trying to grow
                         more of them.  Put a Precog in every
                         home, you know?  So we can have more
                         Franks - people shooting themselves --
                         over who knows what?

               Witwer kneads Anderson's shoulder, talks to him in soothing
               tones like you'd calm an agitated horse.

 WITWER                          Precrime did the job it was supposed
                         to do.

               The two men can hear Ellie sobbing inside the house.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You know it.  And you believe in it.

 ANDERSON (BEAT)                          Yeah.

 WITWER                          It's not easy.  It beats us down.
                         Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates
                         you right now.

               Anderson turns to Witwer.

 ANDERSON                          That's why I got into this business
                         -- to be hated.

               Anderson almost manages a small smile.  Witwer puts his arm
               around him.  Walks him away from the scene.

 WITWER                          They hated us when we were regular
                         cops.  Now we're Precrime, and they
                         still hate US.  It's one of the little
                         perks of law enforcement nobody knows
                         about.

               Their quiet laughter is tinged with sadness.  Anderson looks
               into his partner's good, open face.  Then they both look
               away, their understanding of each other complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30. 

 INT. ANDERSON'S BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT 
               Anderson stares out the window at Frank's house, illuminated
               by the moon.  It's a mournful sight.

               Lisa rises on an elbow and watches him from the bed.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS-ALEXANDRIA-DAY - ONE WEEK LATER 
               Ennis Page, in the mainframe room just off the Precog Chamber,
               picks up a black BRIEFCASE marked: "Zone 218 Washington /
               Alexandria, VA." He approaches the door, and his eyes are
               scanned.  The door opens with a HISS.

               We follow Page as he walks through doors and corridors until
               he reaches a long hallway leading to the Director's office.
               Anderson's secretary, Angela, looks up on Page's approach.
               She nods.  He nods.

               He walks around her desk.  His eyes are scanned, and the
               door to Anderson's office opens.

               ANDERSON looks up, wearily.

 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- LATER 
               Anderson inserts a disc into the video monitor, almost
               absently.  As we have seen him do before, he swivels his
               chair away from the monitor, and stares at Washington D.C.
               across the Potomac.  Hovercrafts and transports skim through
               the sky above the Washington Monument.

               The camera stays on Anderson's back as the sound from the
               Precog disc begins.  He hears his own voice speaking in
               strained, agitated tones.

 ANDERSON (O.S.)                          Let's not do this, Ed.

               Anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and
               horror at the monitor.

 THE MONITOR 
               shows Anderson and Witwer in a room, a few feet apart pointing
               guns directly at each other.  Their eyes intense and panicked.
               Who murders whom?

               Ed's eyes cut to a huge digital clock on the wall as the red
               seconds tumble away.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31. 

               Witwer lowers his gun.  He stands unresisting before

               Anderson.

               Witwer sees his own death in Anderson's wild eyes, has always
               seen it.

               Anderson FIRES his weapon, puts a bullet straight into
               Witwer's heart, throwing him back against a wall.  Witwer
               slumps, dying, beneath the huge digital clock, which reads:

 5:20 AM. 
 BACK TO SCENE 
               Anderson stares as the monitor fades to a blank.  His hand
               goes to his mouth.  His body begins to shake.  He hugs
               himself, but he can't stop the shaking.

               The DISC pops out of the side of the monitor.  It is a small
               SOUND, but it has Anderson up and out of his chair as if it
               were a gunshot, He reaches for the disc but cannot touch it.
               His legs suddenly weaken, and he drops to one knee beside
               his desk, like a man in need of prayer.

               There is a single thought that screams through his brain.
               It is an almost visible thing, filling the room, blackly.
               Anderson whispers the sickening words that shape his fate.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I kill you.
                              (beat)
                         Oh god, I kill you.

               As Anderson pulls himself up, and tries to reach again for
               the disc ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In an image just like the scene in the beginning of the movie,
               the three FACES of the Precogs hover in the misty darkness.
               Their closed eyes open in SUDDEN UNISON.  They speak as one.

 ALL THREE                          Murderer!

               After a long moment, the eyes close again, and the Precogs
               fade into the mists ...

 CUT TO: 
 INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE 
               Anderson looks up sharply at the SOUND of a knock on his
               door.  Every normal sound seems grotesquely AMPLIFIED, the
               traffic outside, his own breathing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32. 

               His senses are on overload.

               The door begins to open.  A stockinged leg is the first thing
               Anderson sees.  His secretary, ANGELA.

 ANGELA                          Sir?

               She hesitates before fully entering the room, Anderson grabs
               at the incriminating disc.  He sees his EYES reflected in
               its alloy surface.  He pushes the disc deep into his pants
               pocket.

               Somehow he finds his voice.

 ANDERSON                          Come in.  Angela.

               She looks at him, uncertain.  Then she places a small stack
               of papers on his desk.

 ANGELA                          Need you to sign these.  And your
                         eleven o'clock starts in five minutes.

 ANDERSON                          My ... eleven.

 ANGELA                               (beat)
                         Budget coordination with the FBI.
                              (beat)
                         You okay, sir?

               Anderson runs his hand through his hair, can't think fast
               enough.  He sees her glance at the black Precog disc case.
               He shuts it, awkwardly, and it auto-locks.

 ANDERSON                          Have Page take this.

               Angela steps back, disturbed.

 ANGELA                          But sir, the procedure

 ANDERSON (SNAPS)                          I make procedure.  Call him.
                              (long beat)
                         I'm not okay, Angela ... you're right.

               My head and stomach.  I'm going down to the clinic.  Or maybe
               just home.

               Angela looks relieved at the explanation.

 ANGELA                          Yes sir.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 33. 

               He moves past her.  His FINGERS fidget against the hidden
               disc in his pocket.

 ANDERSON                          I'll speak to Witwer, put him in
                         charge for the rest of the day.

               He hesitates at the door, turns to look at his office, and
               at his view of Washington.  Then he is gone.

 INT. OUTSIDE WITWER'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Anderson looks in the door Of Witwer's empty office.  He
               takes a step inside.

               Witwer's booming voice sounds from behind him, startling
               him.

 WITWER                          Breaking and entering.  That'll get
                         you five to ten, hard.

               Witwer immediately scans his old partner's ashen face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          What's wrong?

               Anderson can hardly bear to meet his friend's eyes.  He
               REACHES into his pocket, as if to lift the disc into the
               light.  If he could just do that, show it to Witwer.

 WITWER                          Paul?

               Anderson's hand comes out of his pocket, EMPTY.

 ANDERSON                          Take over for me today?

 WITWER                          You sick?

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.

               Witwer makes a show of backing away.

 WITWER                          Don't give it to me.  You probably
                         have that Trans-10 virus going around.
                         A stomach thing.  I hate stomach
                         things.

               Anderson Almost smiles.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34. 

 WITWER                          Yeah?

               Witwer looks at him.  Anderson almost reaches out for him.

 ANDERSON                          Run the place, okay?

 WITWER                               (smiles)
                         Sure.  Right into the ground.
                              (beat)
                         Go on home before I call Infectious
                         Control and have them spray you down
                         with something.

               Anderson moves unsteadily down the hallway.  Witwer calls
               out.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You want me to do the discs, or hold
                         them for you to review when you get
                         back?

 ANDERSON                          Can't let them back up.  Do 'em.

 WITWER                          Call you later.  Take it easy, all
                         right?

               Witwer lifts his hand in farewell, Anderson fixes on that
               last image -- Witwer waving goodbye.

 INT. PRECRIME UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- LATER 
               Anderson, sweating now, leans against a thick cement pillar
               and pulls out a cell phone.  He hits a button.

 INTERCUT BETWEEN ANDERSON / LISA AT THE JUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa sits in a meeting.  Her phone CHIRPS softly.  She glances
               at the display, then rises to take it.  She goes to a corner
               of the room.

 LISA                          Paul?

 ANDERSON                          Listen to me.

               Lisa presses her phone close to her ear.

 LISA                          I can hardly hear you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 35. 

 ANDERSON                          I'm underground.  Weakens the signal
                         so it can't be picked up.

               Alarm moves across her face.

 LISA                          But we're on Secure

 ANDERSON                          Listen, dammit!  I'm going to murder
                         Ed.

               The Precogs picked it up.

               On Lisa -- can she have heard right?

 LISA                          Paul.  Paul His crackling voice
                         faintly comes through the phone.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          ... home.

               Lisa's phone goes dead.

 BACK TO ANDERSON 
               Anderson looks down a long row of parked Precrime ground
               transports.  They are sleek and menacing, the black shells
               lumpy with dangerous gadgetry.  In the distance, a POLICE
               OFFICER, holding an armful of equipment, opens the back of
               one of them.

               He looks up at Anderson's approach.  He puts his equipment
               down, and salutes.

 POLICE OFFICER                          Hello, sir.

               Anderson nods, moves close.

 ANDERSON                          What's your name, officer?

 POLICE OFFICER                          Bob, uh, Robert Smythe.

 ANDERSON                          These the new Python transports?

               The young officer turns and looks at the transport with pride,
               is about to speak, when Anderson touches a palm-sized Nova
               stun gun to the base of his neck.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (sincerely)
                         Sorry, Officer Smythe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 36. 

               The officer buckles.  Anderson catches him, rolls him gently
               into the back of the transport.

               Then Anderson quickly reaches into the transport, and begins
               stuffing equipment into a duffel bag: a helmet and black
               uniform, the weapon-glove, a folded rifle, a holographic
               scanner, and other equipment whose function we can only guess
               at.

               Anderson looks up at a sound, echoey FOOTSTEPS.  They
               approach, then fade away.

               Anderson places the officer's hands and legs together, then
               aims a nozzled cylinder at them.  He shoots a spray of blue
               BindFoam chemical restraint, sticking the man to the floor
               of the transport in an adhesive glob.

               Then he leaves the scene, running.

 INT. ANDERSON'S CHEVY 
               Anderson grips the wheel of his Chevy, driving down 1-95.
               The fact that he can't control his car -- that the steering
               wheel has no function, his speed is predetermined, and his
               direction is guided by satellite -- is maddening now.

               From inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn
               and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his
               steering wheel.

               Anderson slams it with his fist.  Through his windshield
               Anderson sees a four year old boy in the driver's seat of a
               passing red and black Ford.  His mother sits in the
               passenger's seat, blithely reading.  The boy mimics Anderson,
               gleefully slams his steering wheel too, then laughs.

               Anderson turns and looks the other way, into the distance,
               at the "Sprawl,' the vast unzoned city attached to Washington
               D.C. You can see it in his face: a man could lose himself in
               there.

 EXT. POTOMAC PARK 
               Anderson stands on an embankment.  He holds the Precog disc
               in his hand, ready to throw it into the river.

               He stands like that ... and then slowly lets his hand drop.
               He doesn't do it.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOME - SUBURBS -- LATER 
               Lisa enters the house, in a rush.  Every shade is drawn.
               Paul Anderson sits in an overstuffed chair, absolutely
               motionless, like a man who has died suddenly.

 ANDERSON                          Don't move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 37. 

               Lisa doesn't get it.  She continues toward him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Stop!  Moving heats you up, makes it
                         easier for them to pick you up on
                         their thermals.

               She looks at him, scared, stops in her tracks.  She is
               suddenly suffocating.

 LISA                          It's a hundred degrees in here.

 ANDERSON                          I turned the furnace all the way up.
                         Your hair dryer.  The oven.  If they
                         come, it'll buy me twenty seconds.
                         Maybe thirty.

 LISA                          Nobody's coming for you.

               Anderson stares at her.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          On the phone -- what you said.  It's
                         impossible.

               She shakes her head in disbelief.  Anderson speaks, choking
               on the words.

 ANDERSON                          I'm going to kill Ed Witwer.

 LISA                          It's not true.

               Anderson's right hand hangs over the side of his armchair.
               We see the bright DISC cupped in the palm.  He seems about
               to reveal it to her, but doesn't, yet.  He keeps staring at
               her intently.  Something is holding him back.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You're upset.  You've been unhappy.
                         There's a lot of pressure on you.
                         And then Frank ...

 ANDERSON                          One week from today.  Tuesday, June
                         25, at five-twenty in the morning.
                         I shoot him, Lisa.

 LISA                               (beat)
                         You need to take time off.

               Anderson laughs harshly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38. 

 ANDERSON                          You don't have to worry about that.

               She steps toward him.

 LISA                               (gently)
                         I want to hold you.

 ANDERSON                          If you love me, stand there.  And
                         don't move.

               Tears well in her eyes.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the disc, Lisa.  I shoot him.
                         In the chest.  And he dies.  I've
                         watched a thousand murders.  This
                         time I star in one.

 LISA                          Something's wrong.  You wouldn't do
                         it.

 ANDERSON                          The Precogs are never wrong.  They
                         emit a single disc.  "The immutable
                         evidence of the infallible system."

               The room is terribly hot, his words -- she begins to sway
               unsteadily.

               Anderson focuses on her.  Her face.  Her hair ...

 LISA                          We'll figure this out.  We'll review
                         the system.

 ANDERSON                          There is no review.  There's only
                         the disc.  It Shows My guilt.  There's
                         no defense.

               Her long hair.  He stares.

 LISA                          You can't run.  Please, let's --

               A SOUND outside.  They both turn.  A deep silence.  The
               furnace churns out heat.  And Anderson looks at Lisa's hair
               ... and finally understands.

               Slowly, and very carefully, Anderson slides the DISC back
               into his pocket.  He rises from his chair.  For the first
               time he goes to her, reaches out, and touches her hair.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39. 

 ANDERSON                          Last week.  It was strange.  I watched
                         from the bathroom window.  You went
                         out in the backyard to make a call.

               She looks at him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          An appointment, you said.  For a
                         haircut that afternoon.

               Lisa's hand jumps to her hair.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          You didn't get your hair cut.  You
                         went to the trouble of calling first
                         thing in the morning.  It was that
                         important ...

               She reaches for him.  He pulls away.

 LISA                          Stop it!  Paul, please.  You're
                         panicking.  Everything's going to
                         look wrong.  You're going to distrust
                         everybody and everything now.

               Lisa implores him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You can't distrust me.
                              (beat)
                         It was Ed I called.

               Anderson cocks his head.

 ANDERSON                          Ed.  why outside?  Why lie about it?

 LISA                          Stop being a cop and listen to me!

               A booming, electronically altered VOICE suddenly penetrates
               the walls of the house from outside.

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Director Anderson!  There is no
                         escape!

               Anderson, betrayed, glares at his wife.  She's frantic.

 LISA                          Your birthday's tomorrow!  We wanted
                         to...

               But be's already on the move, running for the upstairs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 40. 

 VOICE (O.S.)                          Drop to your hands and knees and
                         stay there.  Precrime is entering
                         your house!

               Lisa screams, as her front door is sonically BLASTED off its
               hinges, and a swarm of Precrime officers in mirrored helmets
               hurtle in.

 LISA                          Paul!

	       They move past her and spread through the rooms and up the 
               stairs like a disease in fast motion.

 UPSTAIRS 
               Helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out,
               scanning rooms for thermal presence.

               An OFFICER 1 steps out of a small room.  He speaks, his voice
               electronically altered.

 OFFICER 1                          He's got a hair dryer going.  Screwed
                         up my reading.

               The others nod.

 OFFICER 2                          We're not picking up shit.

               They rush into rooms, with increased urgency.  We follow
               OFFICER 1 as he moves counter to the group and down the
               stairs.

               He hesitates as he moves through the living room, which is
               awash in personnel.  Lisa stands against the wall, pale and
               shaken.  He looks at her for a long beat, then steps over
               the shattered door and out into the sunlight.

 OUTSIDE 
               Everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm.
               But Anderson's house looks like a wasps's nest someone has
               kicked.  Four Precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it,
               engines WHINING.  Black Python transports are all over the
               street out in front, and more keep coming.

               And everywhere on foot, there are Precrime police.  OFFICER
               I approaches a Python ground transport.  Another officer
               guards it, weapon out, his head turning right to left.  He
               settles on OFFICER 1's approach and raises his weapon.

               OFFICER 1 doesn't even break stride.  He walks right up to
               the guard -- and then right through him.  A holograph decoy.
               OFFICER 1 enters the Python.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 41. 

 INSIDE THE PYTHON 
               OFFICER 1 removes his helmet -- it's Anderson.  And then
               comes the moment of truth -- have they cancelled his
               IdentiScan access to Precrime vehicles yet?

               A little scanner arm arches down from the visor, and flashes
               a red beam into his eyes.  Anderson presses his lips together.
               The Python turns on, and a generated voice greets him.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson 0256 clear.

               Anderson grips the steering wheel.  But his time, since it
               is a law enforcement.  Vehicle, the steering actually works.
               Anderson pulls out.

               FROM ABOVE, as the Python transport slips away from the chaos.

               THEN HIGHER, and we see that the direction the Python is
               headed will take it from the green of the suburbs, through
               the white of Washington, and into the dark of The Sprawl.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 


               Ed Witwer sits alone in an antechamber.  He stares at an
               oversized oak door, then looks down at the floor.

               He runs both hands through his hair.  He is tired, his eyes
               weary, lost.

               A voice comes over the intercom.

 VOICE                          Enter now please, Assistant Director
                         Witwer.

               Witwer pulls himself together, and opens the door.

 INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM 
               Witwer takes a seat at the end of a long table.

               Powerful men sit at the other end of the table.  SWANSON,
               sharp-boned, the FBI Director.  CRONIN, awl-like eyes, the
               CIA Director.  Senator Malcolm.  Chief Justice POLLARD, whose
               face reveals nothing.  Vice-President ALMER, whose tongue
               darts across his dry lips unsettlingly.  Unpleasant looking
               men in an unpleasant mood.

               Cronin looks up from a printout he's been reading and stares
               at Witwer.

 CIA CRONIN                          The central question is: Why does
                         Anderson want to kill Witwer?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42. 

               Cronin holds up the printout.

 CIA CRONIN (CONT'D)                          We checked your finances.  His
                         finances.  Nothing irregular, you
                         don't steal from him, he doesn't
                         steal from you.  You haven't done
                         anything that he might have
                         discovered, and vice versa.

               Swanson holds up another sheath of papers.

 FBI SWANSON                          Personnel checks reveal no ambitious
                         coups planned by you to topple him.
                              (beat)
                         He's done nothing to you, or you to
                         him.

               Witwer presses his lips together.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          You fucking his wife?

 WITWER                          No.

 FBI SWANSON HIS MOTHER? HIS BROTHER? 
               Witwer gives him a bad look.

 FBI SWANSON (CONT'D)                          Okay.  There we are.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          So, you are friends, partners, and
                         soul mates.  Anderson has no motive.

 WITWER                          I can't think of one.
                              (beat)
                         Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs
                         are mistaken?

               Witwer looks away.  Jesus, he wants out of this room.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You don't believe that, do you?

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         No.  The Precogs are infallible.

               Senator Malcolm is impatient with all this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43. 

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          You're goddam right.  So, gentlemen
                         -screw the motive.  We got a
                         pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty
                         little PR problem.

               The very powerful men level their unpleasant gazes on Witwer.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And here is our solution.  You are
                         now Director Witwer.

               Witwer shakes his head, starts to protest.  Almer silences
               him with a raised finger.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER (CONT'D)                          Precrime must demonstrate its
                         willingness to go after one of its
                         own.  Total impartiality.

 WITWER                          Now look--

               Cronin talks right over him.

 CIA CRONIN                          The public must believe that every
                         future murderer is pursued with equal
                         vigor.

 FBI SWANSON                          Therefore, Precrime will put in charge
                         the man best suited to the job.  And
                         who would pursue a murderer harder
                         ... than his intended victim?

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          You went after Anderson yesterday
                         -because it was right, and because
                         you believe.

               Almer speaks with a tight irony.

 VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER                          And your belief will certainly grow
                         stronger with each tick of the clock.

               Witwer looks at the men with thinly-veiled hatred.  But he
               does not deny their words.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          Haw long will it take, Director?

               Wiltwer takes a long breath, concentrates his mind on the
               task he can't avoid.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 44. 

 WITWER                          He knows Precrime, of course.  And
                         the streets -- he's rusty, but he'll
                         remember how to work them.  It'll
                         come back to him fast.  He's ... the
                         best.

               Witwer almost smiles.  Justice Pollard's not smiling.

 JUSTICE POLLARD                          We're not here to praise Caesar --
                         we're here to bury him.

               Witwer looks at Pollard, then lifts a finger and touches his
               right eye.

 WITWER                          He can't avoid iris identification.
                         Every door he opens, every ATM he
                         uses, or taxi or transport he boards
                         -- he'll get scanned.
                              (quietly)
                         It won't take long to find him.  

	       The eyes that look back at Witwer are unblinking.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL NIGHT 
               The unzoned city is full of 1950's iconography, but it all
               feels different than it did in the suburbs.  Where the burbs
               were Ike, the city is Joseph McCarthy.

               The fat Ramblers and Studebakers have a little grime on them.
               The women's dresses are tighter and more urgent, the men's
               suits have some shine at the elbows.  You look over your
               shoulder here, move faster, and smile a lot less.

               And some streets you don't go on at all.  Anderson's Python
               moves down one of them.  He stops under a blackened suspension
               bridge, gets out.  He's still in uniform.  He holds a duffel
               bag.

               He starts to walk away from the Python, then hesitates.
               He's left the door open.  He shakes his head at his
               sloppiness.  Goes back and shuts the door.  Walks away again.

 INSIDE THE CAR 
               He's left a small DEVICE on the passenger's seat.  Digital
               numbers shoot by in reverse.  Something CLICKS.

 OUTSIDE THE CAR 
               Anderson continues walking away.  He doesn't look back as
               the Python is engulfed in a miniature sun of heat and flame.
               It's not a gasoline powered vehicle -- so it doesn't explode.
               It just ceases to exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 45. 

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS - -- NIGHT LATER 
               Through a smeared window Anderson sees racks of suits and
               dresses hanging in clear plastic bags.  He gets to work on
               the door.

 INT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
               Lisa lies in her bed, alone in the dark.  She listens to an
               almost inaudible sound, a high WHINE.

 EXT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE 
               A Precrime HOVERCRAFT floats high above her house, a dark
               moon in the low clouds.

 EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS -- EARLY MORNING 
               A worker stands in the back of the store puzzling over the
               clean clothes piled on the floor.  It almost looks like a
               nest, like someone slept there

 EXT. SUBWAY LATER 
               Anderson, in a blue suit and fedora, carrying his duffel
               bag, stands on a subway platform.  He takes out a cell phone,
               dials a number.  He looks up at the SOUND of a train.

               The approaching MagLev train has a lit sign on its front
               car: "33rd Street Express."

               displays.

               A Precrime TECHNICIAN 1 suddenly sits upright.  Witwer picks
               him out of the crowd and zeroes in.

 TECHNICIAN                          It's Anderson.

               Witwer grabs a phone, punches a button

 WITWER                          Paul! 
                The technicians scramble to pinpoint Anderson on a
               Glowing holographic MAP.

 ANDERSON                          My wife calling you before breakfast?

 WITWER                          We were planning a surprise party.
                         It was going to be today.
                              (beat, ironic)
                         Happy birthday, partner.

 ANDERSON                          This party's no fun, Ed. It's a hell
                         of a surprise, though.

                         I'm having trouble trusting people,
                         Ed, I gotta tell you.

               At Precrime, they upload a MAP DISPLAY of the Express train's
               route.  We see a blue light moving -- the train.  And two
               separate red dots along its route.

               An OFFICER points at the dots, and speaks to Witwer in a low
               voice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 47. 

 OFFICER                          The train makes two stops, here and
                         here: 20th, then 33rd Street.

 ANDERSON                          You there, Ed?

 WITWER                          I'm here.  You gotta come in, Paul .

 ANDERSON                          I'm a Cop, Ed. I need a motive.

 WITWER                          Come in.  We'll figure this thing

 WITWER                          It'll get ugly if you keep running.
                         And your eyes, Paul -- every move
                         you make a Scanner will pinpoint you
                         for us.

 ANDERSON                          I saw a news flash.  You're the new
                         Director.  Is that the point of this?

 WITWER                          Fuck you.

               Anderson smiles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 48. 

 ANDERSON                          Didn't think so.  But it has to be
                         something, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the DISPLAY MAP.  We see the blue train
               nearing its first stop, 20th street.  We see two waves of
               lighted green dots -- Precrime units heading for 20th and
               33rd.

 WITWER                          Paul.  Come in.

               Anderson sees an overhead light come on in the train: "Next
               Stop 20th Street.

 ANDERSON                          If I come in, it puts me close to
                         you.  If I get close ... I may kill
                         you.  I can't risk that.

                         Anyway, they'd force you to lock me

                         get my chance to solve this thing.

               Witwer needs to keep him talking

 WITWER                          You're kinds liking this, in a way,
                         aren't you?  The action ...

 ANDERSON                          And you get to be a real cop again.

               -- he's going on to 33rd Street, the last stop.

               Technician 2 presses his earphone close, listens, then calls
               over to Witwer.  Witwer covers his mouthpiece.

 TECHNICIAN 2                          We have visual verification -- he's
                         still on the train.

               Witwer gives him a thumb's up.  We STAY ON Witwer as he
               listens to Anderson, and watches his train move toward 33rd
               on the MAP.

               Witwer nods.  Now the MAP shows all the Precrime units

 WITWER                          Yeah.

 EXT. STREET - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 


               Every city has its underbelly.  If you lifted the fat dark
               underbelly of The Sprawl this is where you'd end up.

               The streets here feel like alleys, clotted and tight.  There
               are streetlights, bright ones -- but the light dies at its
               source, never makes it through the sour air down to the
               ground.

               The retro fifties look comes apart here.  The people that
               you see -- and you only catch quick glimpses of them, they
               move like rats -- wear black mostly, tight fitting
               tech-fibers.

               ANDERSON'S caught one of the rats, a thin bald guy in black.
               Anderson has him pinned up against a wall.  They're having
               some kind of exchange -- which consists of the guy answering
               none of Anderson's questions, and Anderson pressing him harder
               against the wall.

               Finally, the guy does something odd.  He lifts a finger and
               pulls down Anderson's right lower eyelid.  Anderson lets
               him.  Then the guy does the same on the left.  Has a long
               look.  And then nods.  Anderson releases him, and they go
               off together.

 EXT. AN APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER 
               An oppressive brick thing on a side street.  The facade is
               crumbling.  Nothing good happens in a building like this..

               The guy leads Anderson to the building, then scurries off
               into the night.

 INT. ROOM -- LATER 
               A stained overstuffed chair in the corner, a dreary little
               kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink.

               But jarringly, in the center of all this, is a make-shift
               hypertech medical setup: a gleaming operating table, an array
               of lasers, scalpels and surgical equipment, an anesthesia
               console.

               Anderson sits in a chair facing DOC.  DOC is a big man with
               delicate fingers.  He sneezes, then blows his nose hard into
               a handkerchief.

 DOC                          Got a cold.

               Anderson looks at him uneasily.  It's not just DOC -- it's
               the whole setup, the needles and scalpels, the medical thing,
               which Anderson truly does not care for.  Doc sneezes again,
               then looks up at his patient.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 52. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          Don't worry.  I could cut open your
                         chest, sew a dead cat in there, and
                         you'd never get an infection.  Not
                         with the spectrum antibios I'll be
                         shooting into you.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not here for cat surgery, Doc.

               Doc chuckles.  Then he waits, expectantly.

               Anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card.  A preset cash
               card.  DOC slides it into small console, watches the numbers
               flash up.  He frowns, sighs.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          It's all I could safely move

               He waits.  Doc's not thrilled, but finally, he nods.

 DOC                          Yeah.  All right.

               Time to got down to business.  Doc walks over to a large
               medical cabinet and opens the door.  It's full of EYES, and
               parts of eyes -- 611 !  A cryo-jars.

               Anderson tightens.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          You understand what I told you then.
                         I can't just give you new irises.
                         The Scanners will read the scar
                         tissue.  Alarms will go off.

 ANDERSOIN                          I'm a cop, I know

 DOC                          I gotta take your eyes out.

               Anderson knows this, too, wishes Doc would shut up ANDERSON
               Yeah.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          And put in new ones.

 ANDERSON                          Yeah.  I get it, DOC.

               Anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the
               operating table.  He lies down.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Do me quick before I run out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53. 

               Anderson lies there, blinking up at the ceiling.  He listens
               to Doc preparing instrument trays.  It's a bad sound.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               The suspension bridge where we saw Anderson vaporize the
               Python transport.  Witwer stands watching as a Precrime
               techno-unit sifts through the white ashes.

               Witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the
               Potomac.  It's a pose a track dog might hold, nose up, testing
               the air for a scent.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               We can't see anything at first, because Anderson can't see
               anything either.  He's in a deep post-surgical haze.  DOC'S
               voice comes to him.  It's warped and ugly.

 DOC'S VOICE                          Don't take the bandages off for twenty
                         four hours.  You'll go blind if you
                         do.

               Anderson makes an affirmative grunt. Now we see his
               surroundings, even though Anderson still can't.  He lies in
               a grungy bed, his head and eyes swathed in white dressings.
               Doc stands over him.

 DOC                          You're in a room.  I had you moved
                         here, a couple miles from my place.
                         If they find you, they don't find
                         me.

               Anderson grunts weakly.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          A guy will come in, feed you once.
                              (beat)
                         I juiced up the nano-reconstruction
                         around your new eyes, 'cause I know
                         you're in a hurry.

 ANDERSON                               (Fuzzily))
                         Nano-re ...construction.

 DOC                          Organic microrobots that reconstruct
                         nerves and blood vessels.  It'll
                         feel like fleas chewing on your
                         eyeballs.  Don't scratch.

               Anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages.
               Doc forces them away.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 54. 

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm giving you a bonus, might come
                         in handy.  Feel this.

               Doc takes an air-syringe out of his pocket and touches it to
               Anderson's hand.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          It's a temporary paralytic enzyme.
                         Someone spots you, you duck into an
                         alley, shoot this under your chin.

               Doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of Anderson's
               chin.  Anderson jumps.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          The enzyme turns your facial muscles
                         to mush.  You won't look like the
                         same man.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus.

 DOC                          You tighten up again in about thirty
                         minutes.  Hurts like nothing you
                         ever felt.  It's vicious, but
                         effective.  I'll put it in your bag.

               Finally, Doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places
               it on a dresser beside Anderson's bed.

 DOC (CONT'D)                          I'm setting up a timer.  When it
                         buzzes tomorrow, take off your
                         bandages, and get the hell out of
                         here.

               Anderson, groggy, starts to say something else, but then he
               hears a door open and close, and Doc is gone.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               The Precrime presence mounts on the streets.  A couple of
               units move past the boarding house, but they don't stop.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- DAY 
               Anderson sits in a chair, his dressings like a blindfold.
               He looks like a hostage.  He is sweating.  Keeps reaching
               for his dressings to scratch, then forces himself not to.

               He speaks to someone we don't yet see.  The guy DOC said
               would come.

 ANDERSON                          I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 55. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Guess I should eat.  
				(Beat) 
			 You gonna help feed me?

               Now the camera moves and we see who it is that has been sent
               to help Anderson.  It's the rat guy, the thin bald man
               Anderson had roughed up the day before.  The guy has a bowl
               of hot soup in his hands.  He stares contemptuously at
               Anderson.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          So how do we do this, pal?

               The rat guy doesn't say a word.  He simply tips the hot soup
               and it splatters down into Anderson's lap.  Anderson cries
               out in pain and surprise.  The guy walks out of the room.

 CLOSE ON- THE TIMER 
               Twenty hours gone by.  Four more to go.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Precrime cops are shaking down any of the rats they can catch,
               looking for leads, looking for anything.

 INT. THE BOARDING ROOM 
               The TIMER shows one hour to go.  Anderson sits in a chair,
               squirming miserably.  His dressings are wet with sweat, and
               frayed and dirty at the edges where he has tugged and plucked
               at them.

 ANDERSON                               (to himself)
                         Fuck.

               He is this close to ripping the dressings off

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- DAY 
               A Precrime transport stops.  Two officers get out.  One of
               them sets up a large thermal scanner on the sidewalk, and
               does a read on the boarding house.  The other does a read on
               a pawn shop and bar next door..

               The OFFICER 1 doing Anderson's boarding house, calls to the
               other officer.

 OFFICER 1                          Got 27 warm bodies in this place.
                         What should it take, three or four
                         Spiders?

 OFFICER 2                          Do four.  Speed things up, so we can
                         go eat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56. 

               The Officer 1 opens the back of the transport, and takes out
               a box.  He removes four round BALLS.  They are silver, as
               big as billiard balls.

               He goes up to the boarding house, gets IdentiScanned, and
               the front door opens.  He rolls the balls down a dark hallway.

               Then he goes back out to the transport, and leans against
               it, bored.  He holds up an electronic clipboard and waits
               for the data to come in.

 INT. THE BUILDING 
               The BALLS roll about eight feet, then suddenly come to
               autolife as they spin.  They open like flowers -- flowers
               with legs.

 CLOSE ON : A BALL 
               A fist-sized Spider takes shape.  On its head is an IdentiScan
               lens mounted on a thin metallic antenna.

 INT. A ROOM 
               An OLD WOMAN sits at a card table eating a bowl of something
               unidentifiable.  She looks up with annoyance as she sees a
               spider scuttling across the floor toward her.  It makes a
               CLICKING sound on the floor as it comes.  She's poor, living
               in The Sprawl -- she knows the drill.  She continues to eat
               as the SPIDER crawls up the leg of the card table.  She barely
               watches as it moves past her bowl and toward her hand.

 OLD WOMAN                          It's nice to have a little company

               She smiles toothlessly at her joke The Spider hops onto her
               am and inches up, then moves across her shoulder.  It grips
               her cheek lightly, as the IdentiScan antenna reads her eyes.

               Then it leaps off her and onto the floor and CLICKS away
               across the linoleum.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Precrime officer lifts his clipboard and checks a column
               with his laser pen, and waits for the next one.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson sits in his chair.  He cocks his head, listening.
               His body tenses.  Something feels wrong.

               The TIMER shows ten minutes to go.  Blindfolded for a day
               and a night, Anderson has no idea how much time he has left.
               Three seconds, four hours?

               A flattened SPIDER squeezes under his door.  Anderson tenses
               as it CLICKS across the floor toward him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57. 

               He knows that sound.

               Anderson stumbles up and out of his chair.  He starts to
               grab at his dressings, remembers Doc's warning, and stops
               himself.  The SPIDER waits for him to settle, then CLICKS
               toward him again.

               Anderson moves around the room, avoiding the Spider.  He is
               dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard.  The Spider
               comes faster.  Anderson crashes into a table, brings it down.
               Falls across the bed.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The Officer 1 squints at his clipboard.  One of the Spiders
               is taking too long.  He adjusts his thermal scanner, and
               sees the heat outline of a man bouncing around a room.

               The other Officer 2 finishes reading the pawn shop and the
               barroom, then wanders over to Officer 1. They both watch the
               screen.

 OFFICER 1                          Stinking drunk.

 OFFICER 2                               (beat)
                         Or a guy who doesn't want to get
                         read.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson forces himself to sit still, because he knows the
               consequences.  The Spider advances, starts up his leg.

               The TIMER has not buzzed.  Anderson can't touch his dressings.
               The Spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face.  It
               WHIRS and HUMS trying to adjust its antenna against the
               dressings.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers eye the thermal scanner, as they reach for their
               mirrored helmets, getting ready to go in.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               The Spider crawls all over Anderson's head, trying to get
               past the dressings for a read.

               Anderson has no choice.  None.  He starts to lift at his
               dressing.  The Spider senses his cooperation, freezes in
               place.

               Anderson wants to scream.  He unwraps his head, tugs the eye
               pads away from his eyes.  He rips them off.  The Spider sits
               on his shoulder, waiting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58. 

               Anderson's eyes are tightly closed.  He opens them

 ANDERSON'S POV - BLINDING LIGHT 
               Light brighter than a magnesium burn, brighter than a nuclear
               flashpoint.  Light to buckle the knees and push the brain
               beyond endurance.

               And though all this the faraway sound of a BUZZER going off.
               The TIMER has finally sounded.  Anderson's open eyes are
               streaming with tears, but he has survived the moment.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE ROOM 
               It comes into slow focus The Spider, all business, reads his
               eyes.  Then, as if nothing unusual has occurred, it jumps
               off his shoulder, and crosses the floor.  It flattens, scoots
               under the door, and is gone.

 EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE 
               The officers see that the Spider has gotten its read.  They
               pull off their helmets.

 OFFICER 1                          Let's eat.

               They start putting their equipment back into the transport.

 INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM 
               Anderson stares at himself in a dusty mirror.  His new eyes
               are tender and bloodshot.  And they are not blue, like the
               ones he was born with, but a deep brown.  Anderson is exactly
               the same, and utterly different.

               He grabs his duffel bag, and gets the hell out of there.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTER'S -- DAY 
               Lisa, looking drawn and scared, sits in Witwer's office.
               Witwer isn't looking too well, either.

 WITWER                          They told me to move into Paul's
                         office.  I said fuck you very much.

               Lisa nods.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (softly)
                         I don't want to do any of this, Lisa.

 LISA                          I know.  I know that.

                         Everybody's got their reasons for

                         you won't bring him in dead.

 WITWER                          Yeah.  But if he shoots a cop ...
                              (beat)
                         Which is what he does four days from
                         now, isn't it?

               Witwer's eyes imp involuntarily to a CLOCK on his desk.

 LISA                          He'd never hurt you.

 WITWER                          I know that.  But the other thing I
                         know is -- the Precogs are never
                         wrong.

               The words are leading them no place good.  They stop talking,
               and just sit there.

 INT. THE SPRAWL 
               Anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with
               several people waiting for the N0.6 Turbo Tram.

               The double decker Tram comes.  People get off, then the line
               starts to move forward as people get on.

               Anderson fidgets.  He's last in line.  Each person gets
               IdentiScanned as he boards.  Anderson's putting his new eyes
               to the test.  If the scan goes wrong, he's positioned himself
               to run.

               The woman ahead of him, gets scanned, pays her fare.
               Anderson's turn.  Anderson goes up the steps, and a red beam
               reads his eyes.

               The Tram DRIVER glances at a monitor beside his steering
               wheel, then nods at him.

 DRIVER                          Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington.  Plenty
                         of seats in the back.

               Anderson nods, moves casually to the back.  But his jaw
               muscles are flexing hard, working off the tension.

 INT. A WEALTHY HOME - SUBBURIAN WASHINGTON -- NIGHT 
               Senator Malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he
               finishes off a late night whiskey in his panelled den.  He
               wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos
               adorning the cherry wood walls.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 60. 

               He's feeling cozy and safe, the way rich people can afford
               to.  No IdentiScan Spiders would ever be sent under his doors.
               No intrusions of any sort, nothing that a coiffed secretary
               or a loyal wife wouldn't announce before hand.

               Which is why he doesn't immediately understand the small
               SOUND at ear level, coming from just behind him.  It's a
               metallic CLICK-CLICK.  He turns amiably.  His eyes instantly
               widen, and his knees buckle when he sees he's looking into
               the barrel of ANDERSON'S cocked gun.

 ANDERSON                          Time to upgrade your alarm system,
                         Senator.

               Senator Malcolm tries to regain his composure.  His fear
               embarrasses him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Your work-up of Witwer.  The Security
                         Panel would've done one.
                              (beat)
                         Why do I kill Witwer?

               The Senator finds his voice.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          There's no motive.

 ANDERSON                          There's, always a motive.

               Anderson presses the gun to the Senator's forehead.  He slides
               the barrel tip back and forth across the Senator's sweaty
               skin.  It makes a greasy red mark.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I could've come to anyone on the
                         panel.  But I picked you.
                              (beat)
                         Of all the shits on that panel, I
                         like you least of all.  So if this
                         gun goes off, I'll feel bad, but
                         not, you know, devastated.

               You can almost see a thought dawning on Senator Malcolm.

               And then, shockingly he spits in Anderson's face, and turns
               and walks to the other side of the den.  His tone is mocking.

 SENATOR MALCOLM                          What the fuck was I worried about?
                         You can't kill me.  The Precogs
                         would've seen it.

               Anderson realizes this, too, lowers his gun.  The Senator is
               even laughing now.  For a moment Anderson does nothing, then
               he moves toward the Senator again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 61. 

               The Senator stands his ground smugly.

 SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)                          Witwer's clean.  You're clean.
                         There's nothing.  No motive.  Kind
                         of like something Kafka would've
                         cooked up.
                              (beat)
                         You like that, cockroach?  You're
                         fucked and you'll never know why.

               The Senator is laughing hard now.  Anderson lets him.

 ANDERSON                          Tell you something about the Precogs,
                         Senator.  They're great on murder.
                         But it's the little things they fail
                         to see.

               Anderson hits the Senator so hard it bounces him across the
               floor and into the cherry wood panelling.  Several of his
               beloved photos crash down onto him.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Little things like that, for instance.

               Anderson steps over him, and walks out of the room

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY 
               Search and Command room.  Witwer stands there amidst all of
               the technology speaking to a group of Precrime officers.

 WITWER                          He hasn't shown up on one goddamn
                         IdentiScan in three days.

               No one says anything, and then LIEUTENANT GLASER, 30, speaks
               up.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          He's found a room -- he's going to
                         sit it out.

 WITWER                          Yeah, except for holding a gun to
                         senator Malcolm's goddman head in
                         his own goddman house last night,
                         Anderson's sitting it out!
                              (beat)
                         Why hasn't he been scanned?

               The officers look at their shoes.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Why is he invisible?  He's moving
                         around but he isn't being seen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 62. 

               Lieutenant Glaser tries again.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Hes beating the scanners

 WITWER                          No one beats the scanners.

               Witwer reaches up, wearily, rubbing his face and eyes with
               his hands.  The fingers dragging across his eyes stop.  Then
               his hands drop away, and he looks at his men.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's done his eyes

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          But the scarring always

 WITWER                          He went the whole way.  The crazy
                         bastard had his eyes removed.  New
                         ones sewn in.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          That takes weeks to heal.

 WITWER                          If you're prepared to go blind, a
                         street surgeon'll juice up the repair
                         cycle.  They don't give a fuck about
                         risk.

               Witwer's eyes flick to a digital CLOCK on the wall.  It's
               something he can't help doing now.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          He's going to do what it takes to
                         stay free -- if it blinds him, maims
                         him, or kills him.

               Witwers admiring smile makes his men very uncomfortable .

 INT. KITCHEN - THE SUBURBS -- DAY 
               A mother places a carton of milk on a table in front of her
               teenage son.  He pours it into his cereal bowl, then puts
               the carton down in front of him.

               There's a flexible Vid-Screen on the side of the carton,
               about the size of a playing card.  AS the sleepy kid watches,
               the disposable Vid-Screen sparkles to life.

               Nothing unusual, they always do that.  For advertisements,
               lost kids, or in this case crime bulletins.

               A good one.  The kid straightens up.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 63. 

 THE VID-SCREEN 
               A fully rotating mug shot of PAUL ANDERSON fills the screen,
               followed by vital statistics and details of the precrime
               he's been charged with.

               The kid watches for a while, then gets bored, and pulls the
               Dexi-Pops cereal box over and starts reading the back of
               that.

 INT. A LIVING ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A big man in a tee shirt lies on a couch, a bowl of popcorn
               perched on his belly.  He stares at a TV monitor that's the
               size of a twin bed.

 TV 
               Anderson's face fills the monitor.  The TV image is so big
               that Anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence.
               It's like God coming to pay a visit -- even if you want to
               avoid Him you can't.

               The big man with the popcorn tries to do just that.  He surfs
               through a zillion channels, but Anderson's visage is
               omnipresent.

 EXT. THE SKY - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson's face fills the skies, too.  Witwer and Precrime
               have pulled out all the stops.

               Advertising dirigibles float by with Anderson's image on it.
               Holographic billboards with Anderson hover in the air.  There
               are so many Andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the
               weather, a special type of cloud.

               People on the streets look up, briefly interested, then go
               about their business.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL 
               One person who is paying deep attention to all this is
               Anderson himself.  He stands on a street corner, wearing
               dark glasses and a fedora, staring at a public video kiosk.

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               The mug shot of Anderson disappears and is replaced by a
               Precrime SPOKESWOMAN.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          The United States Supreme Court has
                         issued a special injunction allowing
                         the unprecedented public viewing of
                         former Precrime Director Paul
                         Anderson's future murder of Edward
                         Witwer, the current Director.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64. 

 ANDERSON                          His mouth slowly opens.  He steps
                         back against a wall and slides his
                         hand into his pants pocket.  He looks
                         at the Precog DISC in his cupped
                         hand, then quickly puts it away.

               He stares at the kiosk as people on the street begin to gather
               around excitedly.

               CROWDS OF PEOPLE look into the sky, in store windows, at
               other video kiosks.  They have the enthralled anticipation
               of a mob at a public guillotining.

 SPOKESWOMAN                          She continues her declamation

 SPOKESWOMAN (CONT'D)                          The video you are about to see,
                         generated by the Precognitive mutants,
                         is the immutable evidence of the
                         infallible system.
                              (reassuring smile)
                         Citizens are urged to call
                         1-800-PRECRIME with any information
                         that may lead us to the whereabouts
                         of Paul Anderson, future murderer.

 ANDERSON                          Shakes his head in confusion and
                         disbelief.  But he has the Precog
                         disc ...

               The OLD GUY him nudges him

 OLD GUY                          This oughtta be good, huh?

 VIDEO KIOSK 
               And there it is, Anderson and Witwer standing there pointing
               guns at each other.  The whole thing just as we saw it before.
               All the way through to the fatal moment.

 ANDERSON                          Oh, Ed ...

               Anderson shoots him.  Witwer slumps, dying.  The video stops.
               And then begins to play all over again, right from the start,
               the 1-800-PRECRIME number scrolling along the bottom of it.
               "Call now!  Call now!  Call now!

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Moves quickly through the crowds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 65. 

 INT. BAR - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so
               full of cigarette smoke it doesn't seem capable of supporting
               life.  But it supports the kind of life Page is interested
               in.

               An emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool
               beside Page.  He gives one shake of his head, and she slides
               away again.  His eyes cut to a group of females.  He waits
               for the next approach.

 CLOSE ON: PAGE 
               as a HAND reaches over his shoulder and places a Precog disc
               on the bar in front of him.  Page makes a sound and tries to
               jump away, as if the disc is something lethal.  Which it is,
               in a way.

               Anderson presses him back down on his stool.  Sits next to
               him.  Page stares at him, scared.  Anderson looks straight
               ahead as he speaks.

 ANDERSON                          "Ennis Page engages the services of
                         prostitutes because his relationships
                         with them compound his feelings of
                         selfloathing."
                              (beat)
                         Direct quote from your psychological
                         profile -- the kind of shit I had to
                         know as your former boss.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          "Page is an obsessive-compulsive
                         Type Nine." Another quote.  Niners
                         are great for the kind of work you
                         do -- keeping all those Precog discs
                         in order.

               You can almost see Page's heart slamming in his chest.  He
               tries to hide it with tough talk.

 PAGE                          I fuck whores and I'm orderly, so
                         what?

 ANDERSON                          Something's out of order, Ennis.
                         Deeply out of order.

               Page looks unhappily at the disc on the bar PAGE You got a
               disc Anderson picks it up, holds it tight in his fist

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Not A disc.  The disc.  When I went
                         home sick, I stole it.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 66. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I took it with me, Ennis.  I wasn't
                         sick, I was running with the evidence.
                              (lets that sink in)
                         So how is it that Precrime has one,
                         too?

 PAGE                               (utterly baffled)
                         You can't make copies 

	       Anderson waits.  Lets Page work through it.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          It's the basis of the system.  The
                         immutable evidence.  Copies are
                         impossible.
                              (beat)
                         You went home.  A little later, I
                         came in with a disc for Mr. Witwer
                         to review.  I wasn't halfway out the
                         door when he cried out.

               Anderson is barely breathing, he's listening so hard.

 PAGE (CONT'D)                          He was in shock.  He showed me.  It
                         was you shooting him.  Then all hell
                         broke loose.  He had to send the
                         Precrime units to your house.

 ANDERSON                          Ennis -- you gave out the same disc
                         twice.  Less than an hour apart.
                         The one I stole.  And then another
                         one.  Of the same event.

 PAGE                          It's impossible.  The Precogs can
                         only move forward to new events.
                         Into the future.  They never repeat.

               Anderson looks around.  Patrons are beginning to look over
               in his direction, eyes lingering.  He rises.

               Page seems in a daze.  As an obsessive-compulsive niner, the
               concept of an untidy system is disorienting.

               Anderson starts to say something to the man, then doesn't.

               On the way out Anderson gets IdentiScanned.  An automatic
               DIGITAL VOICE calls out after him.

 DIGITAL VOICE                          Have a nice night, Mr. Symington

	       Anderson leaves the dark of the bar for the deeper dark of The Sprawl.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 67. 

 INT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               A YOUNG GUY with a sparse moustache walks up to a payphone.
               He picks up, the receiver and immediately gets IdentiScanned.
               A light goes on, he's about to dial.

               Anderson appears out of nowhere, shoulders him out of the
               way.  The young guy drops the receiver and stumbles back
               onto the sidewalk.  Anderson grabs the hanging receiver.

 YOUNG GUY                          Hey!  Hey, you can't... 

	       He reaches for Anderson, then thinks better of it.  Anderson 
	       is twice his size and very menacing in dark glasses.

 YOUNG GUY (CONT'D)                          I'm gettin' a cop.

               The guy scurries off.  Anderson dials quickly.

 INTERCUT ANDERSON/LISAS OFFICE 
               Lisa, walking down a hallway in the Judicial Center, stops
               to answer her BEEPING cell phone.  She leans against a wall,
               as lawyers and judges pass by.

 ANDERSON                          It's me.

 LISA                          Paul.

               Lisa grips the phone and turns to the wall

 ANDERSON                          Your phone will be bugged.  So we
                         can't meet, we can't do anything.
                         Just listen.  Nowing you're listening
                         is enough.

               Lisa nods, as if he's right there.  He is right there, for
               her.  This is all she's got.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When Precrime stormed the house, I
                         thought you'd called them.  Betrayed
                         me.

 LISA                          No.

 ANDERSON                          I know.  Witwer sent them.  He saw
                         the disc and had to do his job.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me you forgive me.  Please.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 68. 

 LISA                          Of course, I forgive you.

               There's no time left.  He has to get off the line and start
               moving again.  A vast weariness enters his voice.

 ANDERSON                          All these people I need to forgive
                         me.
                              (beat)
                         Do you think Frank forgave me?  All
                         I could do for him was send him
                         gardenias.
                              (long beat)
                         I love you.

               Lisa almost cries out when he hangs up.  She flattens herself
               against a wall.  She stays like that for a long moment,
               pulling the sound of her husband's voice, his words, deep
               inside of herself.

               And then she gets a look, as one of those words registers
               profoundly.

 LISA                               (whispers to herself)
                         Frank hated gardenias.

 EXT. EAST END CEMETERY - ARLINGTON -- LATER 
               A public cemetery along the Potomac.  There's not much land
               left for new graves.  A funeral is taking place.  A lot of
               mourners in dark 1950's suits and dresses.  The service is
               nearing its end.

               Frank D'Ignazio's newly dug grave is nearby.  Lisa stands
               there, looking at the temporary marker, and the flowers and
               wreaths piled up against it.

               Two rows over, they are lowering the casket into the ground.

               High in the sky, a PRECRIME HOVERCRAFT, everpresent in Lisa's
               life, floats in the low clouds with a barely audible WHINE.

               Lisa rests a floral arrangement against the pile of flowers.
               Her hand drifts near a white GARDENIA WREATH.  There is a
               small envelope tucked beneath a blossom.  She takes it.

               Then she rises and begins to walk back to her car.

               The funeral is over, and the mass of mourners, many wearing
               dark glasses, fan out toward a long line of cars.

               One of the MOURNERS brushes past Lisa.  She looks up and he
               tips his dark glasses down onto his nose and stares over
               them at her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 69. 

               It's Anderson.  Isn't it?  She looks into his eyes.  And
               it's jarring, the blue eyes gone, that they're brown now.
               But it's him, he's there, and she wants to reach out for
               him.  Knows she can't.

               He's already moving on.  He's risked everything for a look.
               He slips into the black sea of mourners, she goes to her car
               -neither of them ever breaking stride.

               The Precrime craft hovers, unaware

 INT. LISA'S CAR 
               Lisa opens the envelope as her car drives her down the
               Alexandria-Washington ConnectWay.

               A Precog DISC falls into her hand.  Her mouth opens -- she's
               never held one before.

               And there is a NOTE with it It READS:

               "The Precogs generated duplicate discs.  This is the first.
               Precrime has the second.  Duplicates.  Why?"

 EXT. A CONVENIENCE STORE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Anderson has to eat bad food quickly, and on the run.  He
               gathers up a wrapped sandwich, a bag of donuts, something to
               drink.

               He waits in line.  He doesn't like to be in a line, waiting.
               The woman ahead of him argues about change.  He presses his
               lips together.

               And then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera
               DOME attached to the ceiling.  It gives him a fish eye
               reflected VIEW of what's happening behind him.

               Precrime police are happening behind him.  He doesn't stop
               to ponder, as two Python transports zoom up outside the store.

               Anderson vaults the counter, knocking the customer and the
               clerk to the floor.

 INT. BACK ROOM 
               Anderson plows over a guy filling a trash can.  He hears the
               mechanically altered COMMANDS of a Precrime officer calling
               from the store.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson crashes out into an alley, and clambers up a fence.
               SONIC BLASTS shatter the air around him.  Chunks of brick
               fly off the walls on both sides.  But he is full of
               adrenaline, and there is no stopping him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 70. 

 INT. A TURBOTRAM - THE SPRAWL -- LATER 
               A different part of the city.  Anderson hunkers low in the
               back seat of a tram.

               He looks up, as the DRIVER swears

 DRIVER                          What the hell --

               Anderson stands up, looks down the aisle, through the
               windshield.  Precrime transports are heading straight at the
               tram, going the wrong way on a one way avenue.

               They've even taken radio control of the P.A. system on the
               tram.

 VOICE                          Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands
                         and knees!

               Anderson can't believe it -- how are they suddenly pinpointing
               him?  The passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare
               at him, terrified.

               Anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit
               doors, smashing them open, and tumbles out onto the street.

               He rolls, and is up on his feet in a second, reaching into
               his bag for a glove.  He pulls the weapon onto his right
               hand, as he whirls around sizing up his predicament.

               Precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the
               street.  He looks up.  He is surrounded by skyscrapers and
               buildings -- he is walled in, at the bottom of an urban
               canyon.

               People freeze against the sides of buildings, run into
               doorways where they can.  Passengers in trans and taxis or
               cars stay there, pressed against their windows watching.

               Nothing moves, except the Python transports, closing in.
               The lead officer speaks, with that menacing electronically
               altered VOICE.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Lower your weapon, or we will
                         neutralize your threat potential.

               The Precrime police are out of the transports now, advancing
               at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men.

               Anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building
               closest to him.

 ANDERSON'S POV - A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT 
               The large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 71. 

               Anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward
               it, his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement.

 VOICE (CONT'D)                          Do not move!

               Anderson is up on the sidewalk now, two feet out from the
               building, right beside the high pressure hydrant.

               He stops, looks up, looks down, looks at the police advancing.
               It is a moment for prayer.  Anderson doesn't have a moment.

               He spreads his feet and fires a massive SONIC BLAST down at
               the sidewalk.  The effect on the underground water main is
               immediate.

               A GEYSER of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up
               from the sidewalk, lifting the tumbling Anderson fifteen
               feet into the air right alongside the building.

               The stunned police officers try to take aim, but Anderson's
               bouncing at the top of the geyser.  And they can't fire,
               anyway, because officers workers stare at the excitement
               from every window in the building.

               All this in a time span of seconds.  The world spins crazily
               for ANDERSON, but he manages to grip hold of a metal support
               beam holding the building's sign, one story up.

               The police try to see what he's doing, but the torrent of
               water from the water main break obscures his moves.

               He pulls himself onto a ledge, steadies himself, slides along
               it toward a second story window.  The office building gawkers
               lurch backward from the window as Anderson blasts it to
               sparkling dust and leaps inside.

 INT. OFFICE BUILDING 
               The building covers almost an entire city block.  Anderson,
               dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting
               through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way.

               He is like a wide receiver running the length of the field,
               jumping obstacles, slamming through, over, and around whatever
               he must to get to his goal.

               And then he reaches his goal -- the windows overlooking the
               avenue next block over and parallel to the one where Precrime
               ambushed him.

               He spots a double-decker TurboTram moving slowly in the stream
               of traffic.  It pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers.

               Anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of
               the bus.  It is a bone-jarring landing.  He loses
               consciousness for a second, rolls the length of the roof,
               and slides off it onto the pavement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 72. 

               He lies there, trying to rouse himself.  Traffic brakes to a
               stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in
               the road.  No one wants to touch him.  A single car horn
               SOUNDS, and then a chorus of them.

               Anderson rouses, struggles to his feet, and takes off in a
               limping run.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION LATER 
               Anderson, out of breath and in pain, leans against a post at
               the far end of the passenger platform.  There are tracks on
               either side of him, one marked "Uptown" and the other
               "Downtown. "

               He feels a blast of air and looks to his right and sees that
               the Downtown train is coming in.  And on his left, too, the
               Uptown train rounds the bend and comes into view.

               Which MagLev train will lead him to safety?  Which one won't
               they pinpoint?  He runs up to a teenage KID who has his arm
               around his girlfriend.  They step back, startled.  He's got
               a flat top hair cut, she wears a pleated skirt and saddle
               shoes.

               The trains pull in.

 ANDERSON                          Pick one for me!

 KID                          What?

 THEY TRY TO WALK AWAY 
 ANDERSON                          Point to the train I should take.
                         Please.

 KID                          I don't know.

               The girl lifts a nervous finger and points.  The Uptown.  He
               runs to board it, as they run in the opposite direction to
               the Downtown.

 INT. SUBWAY CAR 
               He sits at the back of the half empty train watching the
               dark rush by.  A train chosen arbitrarily -- it's impossible
               they could find him.

               A station Stop.  He starts to get off, is actually on the
               platform, then steps back onto the train.

               The rushing dark again.  When the MagLev eases to a halt at
               the next station he gets off this time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 73. 

 INT. STATION 
               He walks toward the exit stairs with a handful of people.
               He eases back and lets them go up first.

 THE STAIRS 
               Precrime officers crouch around the bend, silently snatching
               people out of the way as they come into view.  They wait
               -but Anderson does not come.  And he does not come.

               On signal, the Precrime officers rush down the stairs.

 DOORWAY ABOVE THE STAIRS 
               ANDERSON hangs high above the doorway near the ceiling,
               adhered by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive BindFoam.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE OFFICERS 
               as they run below him down the stairs.  They go out of sight,
               he can hear them rushing along the platform searching for
               him.

               The strain of hanging by one arm is killing him.  He reaches
               up.  With a laser knife, and cuts away at his coat sleeve,
               releasing himself from the glob.  He drops to the stairs,
               and instantly slips up them.

               He surprises a helmeted OFFICER, just around the bend.  He
               slams HIM against the wall, yanks off his helmet, and holds
               the laser knife against his throat.

               The OFFICER 1s clearly terrified.  He speaks hoarsely through
               Anderson's choking grip.

 OFFICER                          Don't kill me!  Jesus.  Please.

               Anderson looks at the panicked officer.  Anderson closes his
               eyes trying to put it together.  He opens them.

 ANDERSON                          But the Precogs would've predicted
                         me killing you.  You'd know whether
                         I do or not.

               The officer looks at him with eyes begging for mercy.
               Anderson suddenly gets it.  He tightens his grip on the man.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          They shut down the system.  Haven't
                         they?  They've shut down the Precogs.

               The officer nods.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 74. 

 OFFICER                          They're off homicides.  They're
                         redirecting them to help us locate
                         you.

               Which is how they knew where he'd be every time.

               Anderson chops quickly at the base of the man's skull,
               knocking him out.  And then he runs, because what else can
               he do?

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY 
               Lisa stands in a long hallway outside a door, labeled:
               COURTROOM 17.  She holds a briefcase in one hand.  Down the
               hall, other courtrooms are in use, but not this one.  She
               enters the dark and vacant Courtroom 17.

 INT. COURTROOM 17 
               Lisa sits at the judge's bench in the empty courtroom.  The
               lights are dim.

               She takes a small, battery-powered tv out of her briefcase.
               She turns it on.

 TV 
               The murder of Witwer by Anderson is being shown over and
               over in a continuous loop.  Flashing at the bottom is the
               hotline number: "1-800-PRECRIME." Then- "Call Now!  Call
               Now!

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Now Lisa takes out the Precog disc Anderson gave to her -the
               first disc.

               She places it in the specialized monitor on the judge's bench.

               The tv and the judge's monitor sit side by side.  The tv
               plays the version of the murder from the second disc; the
               judge's monitor plays the version from the first disc.

               She stares intently, her eyes flicking back and forth from
               one version to the other.  They seem absolutely identical.
               When the judge's monitor goes blank, she starts it over again.

               Lisa stares, watching her husband murder his best friend,
               endlessly.

 EXT. A GAS STATION - ALEXANDRIA -- DAY 
               A gas station right out of the fifties.  An attendant in a
               uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield
               of a sky blue Rambler.

               In the background, Anderson walks toward a men's room.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 75. 

 INT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               Anderson looks at himself in the mirror.  He reaches out and
               touches one reflected eye, which is a deep brown.  It is
               still startling to him, the color of his eyes.

               Then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air
               syringe Doc gave to him.  He looks at it nervously.  It is
               filled with 5 cc's of an opaque green liquid.

               He touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin.
               He closes his eyes.  Then he screws up his courage, and hits
               the plunger.  The liquid is pneumatically delivered with a
               searing HISS.

               Anderson screams out in agony, slams back against the wall
               of the bathroom.  His hands reach up for his face -- which
               looks like it's boiling from within.

 ANDERSON'S FACE 
               The skin on both cheeks begins to pucker.  The muscle tone
               around his chin goes soft, and begins to sag like an old
               man's.  That is the effect -- like he is aging fifty years.
               His forehead wrinkles, the skin under his eyes droop.  Healthy
               pink is replaced by bloodless gray.

 AND MOTHER OF GOD DOES IT HURT 
 EXT. THE MEN'S ROOM 
               The ATTENDANT knocks nervously on the door

 ATTENDANT                          You all right in there?

               When the door opens, an unhealthy looking old guy with a
               fedora hat pulled low comes slowly out of the bathroom.
               Anderson nods, and walks past the attendant, who watches
               after him uncertainly as he wanders off.

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               The perky tour guide we met earlier takes another group around
               the headquarters.  There may be a massive campaign to find
               Anderson, but the Precrime public relations machine continues
               to run without interruption.

               There are ten people in the group, and the physically
               transformed Anderson is among them.  They all wear glowing
               nametags.  Anderson's reads, "Mr. Symington." He keeps his
               hands in his pockets, and his head low.

               We have heard the tour guide's spiel before

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 76. 

 TOUR GUIDE                          Welcome to the main headquarters of
                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches
                         are scattered throughout the United
                         States.

               She is about to go on when she looks over at Anderson.  He
               is fidgeting uncomfortably.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          Are you ... all right, Mr. Symington?

               Anderson moves up close to her, a little too close.  He
               whispers to her, embarrassed.  She gives him a professional
               smile, and points in the distance past the elevators.

               Anderson nods, and heads off.  She calls after him.

 TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)                          We'll wait right here for you, sir!

 INT. A STAIRWELL 
	       Anderson runs down a back stairwell to a lower floor.

 INT. A BASEMENT CORRIDOR 
               Anderson stands outside a door marked: "Housekeeping." Above
               the doorway is an IdentiScan device.

               Anderson reaches into his coat and carefully removes a small
               cryo-jar.

 CLOSE ON: THE CRYO-JAR 
               Imbedded in the clear gelatinous coolant are two eyeballs
               -the irises a luminous blue.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND -- MOMENTS LATER 
               The operations room in Precrime.  The technicians sit at
               their computers and holographic tracking displays.

               Witwer paces among them.  His eyes keep flicking to the
               digital clock on the wall.  Then they cut back to the men
               and machines that are telling him nothing.  Witwer does not
               look well at all, When a TECHNICIAN leans close to his
               computer monitor,Witwer almost leaps across the room to get
               to him.  He looks over the man's shoulder.

 WITWER                          What is it?

 TECHNICIAN                          Must be a glitch ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 77. 

 WITWER                          What?

 TECHNICIAN                          Anderson just got IdentiScanned.

               Witwer grips the back of the technician's chair.  The
               technician types the data through again.

 TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)                          It's him -- he's been scanned.

 WITWER                          Where is he?

               The technician looks up at Witwer.

 TECHNICIAN                          But he's had his eyes done.  Right?
                         Sir?  Tries to think it through.

 WITWER                               (barely audible)
                         He had to have.

               The technician's computer flashes the next piece of
               information.  When he speaks, it's the last thing Witwer
               wants to hear.

 TECHNICIAN                          Jesus Christ, sir.  He's in the
                         basement of this building.

               All eyes turn to Witwer.  The unspoken question hangs in the
               air.  Anderson's come to murder Witwer?

 INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS 
               Throughout the building, every available Precrime Officer
               begins to receive orders to mobilize toward the basement.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Four officers stand guard in the chamber.  They listen to
               the orders coming in on their earpieces.  Three of the guards
               rush out of the room, one stays behind.

               The three Precogs sit in their oversized chairs, the female
               in the middle, the males on either side of her.  Their eyes
               are open ... and they are deeply alert.

               Two technicians tend to the Precogs.  At the back of the
               chamber, through a large window, we see Ennis Page sitting
               at the huge mainframe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 78. 

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               A ring of Precrime officers three men deep stand guard around
               Witwer.  Witwer looks like he wants to kill them all.

 WITWER                          This is ridiculous.

               Lieutenant Glaser replies forcefully

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Standing orders from the Security
                         Panel, sir.

 WITWER                          If he wants to get to me, he'll get
                         to me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          No, he won't, sir.

               Witwer looks at the confident young officer almost pityingly.
               Then his eyes flick to the wall clock.

 INT. THE BASEMENT 
               Armed Precrime officers clog the corridors, conducting
               defensive searches of one room after another.  All they are
               coming up with so far are some very startled housekeepers.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               In the chamber are one guard, two technicians, and three
               Precogs.  And all of them are left in sudden darkness, as
               the power is cut.

 INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND 
               The officers around Witwer reach for their maglite
               flashlights.  The Search and Command room suddenly looks
               exceedingly vulnerable.

               A technician calls out from the darkness

 TECHNICIAN                          Don't worry, air -emergency generators
                         will kick on in five seconds.

               The green glow from a roomful of wristwatches makes the room
               seem alive with fireflies.  Five seconds go by.  Then ten
               more.

 WITWER                          Explanation, please!

 TECHNICIAN                          Uh, sir.  It seems ... he got the
                         generators, too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79. 

               There is a long moment of silence.  And then Witwer begins
               to laugh.

 INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER 
               The room is utterly dark and silent.  The silence is broken
               by the SOUND of something rolling across the floor.  Somebody
               speaks, probably the guard.

 VOICE                          Shit.

               An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blasts.
               And leaping through the light is ANDERSON.  The temporarily
               blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees.
               Anderson stun guns them quickly.

               The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor.
               We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial features
               are returning to normal.

               He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs.  It is the
               equipment he is after.

               Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching in
               horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the
               Precog helmets to the mainframe.

               Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing
               it out and knocking Page unconscious.  Then he reaches into
               the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of
               blasts.

               Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a
               PRESENCE behind him.  Perhaps it is because the movement is
               so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection.

               A HAND, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes
               hold of his hand.

               Anderson whirls around, weapon out.  And there before him,
               is the FEMALE Precog.  He looks at her, then beyond her to
               the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in
               their chairs.

               Her helmet is off.  She is young, but her close-cropped hair
               is silver white.  And when she speaks, her voice is like the
               wind whispering through time.

 FEMALE                          Save us, Anderson.

               Anderson can feel the seconds ticking away, his carefully
               planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way.

 ANDERSON                          I have to get out of here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 80. 

               She grips his hand.

 FEMALE                          Save us.

               It is beyond pitiful, this frail little woman, pleading.
               And her eyes, she won't let him go.  She is beginning to
               weaken, to sway on her feet.

               A sudden realization floods over Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          You let me get here, didn't you?
                         You stopped giving them information,
                         so they couldn't track me.

               The Precog female is fading fast.  She tries to reach out
               for him and her legs give way.

 FEMALE                          Save -- 
  	       And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls?  
	       What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the 
	       fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom.

 INT. TUDICIAL CENTER 
               Lisa has been staring at the judge's monitor and the tv screen
               for over an hour.  The two versions of Anderson murdering
               Witwer play over and over.

 LISA                               (wearily, to herself)
                         Help me, Paul.

               She hits freeze-frame on the judge's monitor, at a moment
               during his confrontation with Witwer when Anderson's FACE
               fills the screen.

               Lisa looks with deep urgency into her husband's eyes.

               And it is his EYES, finally, that tell her everything.  Lisa's
               hand rises to her open mouth.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          They're blue.

               She keeps the image on freeze-frame, and turns and looks at
               the tv, which shows Precrime's disc over and over, the 1-800
               number scrolling along the bottom.

               When the same close-up of Anderson flashes onto the tv screen,
               she leans close to it and squints.

               Anderson stares right back at her.  And for the first time,
               Lisa sees that the tapes are not exactly identical.  His
               eyes...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 81. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          And now they're brown.

               For the first time in days she allows herself a small smile.

 INT. PRECOG CHAMBER 
               Power has been restored to Precrime Headquarters.  Witwer
               walks slowly through the ruins of the Chamber.  EMT teams
               work on Ennis Page and the other dazed personnel Anderson
               has left in his wake.

               Technicians cluster around the two remaining Precogs, the
               brothers.  Their eyes are closed and they are limp.  Their
               lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other.

               Lieutenant Glaser is with him, but when Witwer speaks it is
               almost to himself.

 WITWER                          Why didn't the Precogs know he was
                         coming to do this?

               The Lieutenant has no reply.  Witwer runs both hands through
               his hair.  It has begun to wear him down, the ticking of the
               clock ...

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The next time he shows up it'll be
                         to kill me.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We won't let that happen, sir.

               Witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him, then gives the
               Lieutenant a withering look.

 WITWER                          You won't, huh?

               When the Lieutenant tries to speak to him, Witwer walks away
               and goes over to the technicians working on the Precogs.  He
               stares at the Precogs.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (to a technician)
                         When can we get these things
                         operational?

 TECHNICIAN                          They're a hive mind, sir.  It takes
                         three for their predictive abilities
                         to be fully operational.

               Which Witwer does not want to hear.  Witwer leans very close
               to the technician.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82. 

 WITWER                          These two are all I have to find the
                         man who is about to murder me.  Hook
                         them up, and flood them with whatever
                         kind of fucking chemicals you have
                         to.  They are a machine, and I need
                         that machine at my disposal.

               The Precogs's lips stop for a microsecond, and then begin
               their silent movements again.

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE - ALEXANDRIA -- NIGHT 
               Ennis Page is a man unglued.  He sits on a tidy little sofa,
               in a tidy 1950's style living room.  But his movements have
               become untidy.  He puts a very tiny pill on his tongue.

               When he drinks from a glass of water, it dribbles down his
               chin onto his shirt.  Not like Ennis, at all.

               When his doorbell RINGS, he slowly looks up, then looks down
               at the floor again.  He doesn't answer it.  It RINGS some
               more.

               And then Lisa is standing there before him

 LISA                          Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis.  I
                         could just walk in here.

 PAGE                          I forgot.  To turn it on.

               She sits down beside him.

 LISA                          You don't look surprised to see me.

               She glances at the bubble pack of pills on the table beside
               him, three gone.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          I need your help.

               Unexpectedly, tears well up in Ennis's eyes.

 PAGE                          He took one of my babies.

 LISA                          He's desperate, Ennis.  He had to.
                              (beat)
                         We have to help him.

               Lisa holds the Precog disc in front of his eyes.  He closes
               them against the sight, as if it were an evil talisman.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 83. 

 LISA (CONT'D)                          It's a fake Ennis.

               Ennis's eyes open again.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This is the first disc.  You delivered
                         it to Director Anderson.  He reviewed
                         it.  And then he stole it, and went
                         on the run.

               Ennis tries to think through his fear and haze.  His words
               slur.

 PAGE                          I delivered ... a fake .. to him?

 LISA                          But he thought it was real, and ran
                         with it.

               The pills, his tidy world coming apart -- Ennis is losing
               it.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          An hour later, you delivered a second
                         disc of the same event.  Witwer
                         reviewed it.  It was real.  (Beat)
                         How do I know this?

               Ennis just wants her to go away.  He wants it all to go away.
               Tears stream down his face.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Director Anderson had his eyes
                         changed.  They were blue.  Now he
                         has brown ones.

               Ennis is sliding away.  Lisa takes hold of him.  Makes him
               listen, dammit.  She points to the disc in her hand.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          This disc, the fake one, shows a
                         blueeyed Anderson murdering Witwer
                         two days from now.  He doesn't have
                         blue eyes anymore.  The person who
                         faked this disc had no idea he would
                         change his eyes.

               Lisa shakes him.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          Listen!  But the second disc has to
                         be real, because he has brown eyes
                         when he murders Witwer.

                         Somebody tried to frame him with a
                         fake.  And somehow it all became real.
                         Why, Ennis?  How could this happen?

               Ennis gives her a look that's on the other side of
               comprehension.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You handle the discs.  How did a
                         fake one get delivered?

               Ennis's eyes roll back into his head.

               PAGE Coffee ...

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You want-- ?

 PAGE                          He spilled coffee everywhere ...
                         Everywhere ...

 LISA                          What coffee?  What are you -- ?

               But Ennis sags unconscious.  She shakes him hard, even slaps
               him, but Ennis is out.  She lets him drop down on the sofa.

               From outside the house, somewhere high in the clouds, comes
               the WHINE of a hovercraft.

               Lisa looks once more at Ennis, then gets out of there

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT 
               A small, dreary room, invisible with insignificance.  Which
               is just the kind of room you want if you've stolen a Precog.

               The female Precog lies on a cot.  Anderson sits on a metal
               folding chair watching her.

               Her eyes slowly open and look at him

 FEMALE                          My brothers aren't here.

 ANDERSON                          You didn't even look around.  You
                         knew.

 FEMALE                               (beat)
                         We can sense each other.  You must
                         save

	       Anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 85. 

 ANDERSON                          Stop.  I saved You.  It was the best
                         I could do.

               She turns away and looks at the yellowing paper on the wall.
               There is a fading pink cabbage rose.  She traces the outline
               of it with her thin finger.

               She turns back to him.

 FEMALE                          Thank you, Anderson.

               It is deeply eerie for him, chatting with a Precog.

 ANDERSON                          What am I going to do with you?

               Her eyes grow very serious.

 FEMALE                          Name me, Anderson.

 ANDERSON                          What?

 FEMALE                          Give me a name.  I've never had one.

               Anderson rises, moves around the small room.  He is shamed,
               embarrassed.

 ANDERSON                          Listen.

               She turns to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Listen to me.
                              (beat)
                         Listen to me ... Rose.

               It is heartrendingly touching, the smile she gives him when
               she faces him again.

 FEMALE                          Rose.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  They shifted your precognition
                         so you would locate me.

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         Yes.  And it hurt us, physically.
                         Did you know that?  The helmets, the
                         controls.  It hurts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 86. 

 ANDERSON                               (guiltily)
                         I didn't know.

               For a long moment he can't say anything.  But there are things
               he needs to understand ...

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          When they shifted you to find me,
                         you didn't reveal everything.  That
                         I was going to break into Precrime.

 ROSE                          We saw our chance.  You would need
                         to shut us down, you would have to
                         come.  We wanted you to come.

 ANDERSON                          You used me -- to save you.

 ROSE                          I have been used all my life,
                         Anderson.

               Anderson can't meet her eyes.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          No one cared that we were human.
                         From a human mother.  Taken at birth.
                         Hooked to machines.
                              (beat)
                         We have been alive, Anderson.
                         Enslaved, for the greater good.

               Her words are unbearable, for both of them.  She traces the
               outline of the wallpaper rose again.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          But now I have a name.  And I know
                         the man who has named - me will not
                         allow me to be enslaved again.

               Anderson looks at her, then goes to the window, carefully
               watches the street below.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What's going to happen to us?
                         Can you see that?

 ROSE                          I'm weak.  And away from my brothers.
                         I see glimpses and hints of things
                         nearby.  But it's all ... scattered.
                              (beat)
                         I'm tired of the future, Anderson.

               She lies on the bed, watching as Anderson comes back to her.
               He sits carefully on the side of her bed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 87. 

               Then be reaches out, and gently touches her cheek

 ANDERSON                          You didn't know I was going to do
                         that, did you?

               She is almost too overwhelmed to speak

 ROSE                          No.  Oh, Anderson.  It was lovely.

               And now it is Anderson who is overwhelmed

 INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE DAWN 
               If he were not already dead, it would've killed Ennis Page
               to see the state of his living room.  Precrime officers
               everywhere.  Blood on the rug.  A gun beside the sofa.

               Witwer stands in the corner of the room witching the Coroner
               crab walk Page's body.  It WHIRS and CLICKS as it probes and
               takes samples from various sites.

               The holographic doctor waits patiently as the Coroner crab
               makes its determinations.

               Lieutenant Glaser talks quietly to Witwer

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Who else could it've been?

               The crab probes the ragged hole in Page's head

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          He grabbed a Precog so he could commit
                         an undetected murder.

 WITWER                               (beat)
                         Page worshipped the system.  He fell
                         apart.  Shot himself.

               The Lieutenant rolls his eyes.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          Anderson.

               Witwer doesn't say anything.  He just stares at the body The
               crab finishes.  The holographic doctor unfolds his arms and
               turns his head to Witwer.  He is only a computer interface,
               but even so, it seems as if there is surprise in his
               digitalized voice.

 HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR                          Director Witwer.  This event is a

               No one says anything as the holographic doctor dematerializes
               and the Coroner crab walks across the floor and puts itself
               back in its box.

               At last, someone moves.  It is Witwer.  He lifts his arm,
               pulls back his shirtsleeve, and stares long and hard at his
               watch.

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- DAY LATER 
               Lisa sits biting her lip as Witwer watches two monitors play
               the two versions of Anderson's murder of Witwer.  Lisa points.

 LISA                          There.

               She reaches down and freezes on a close-up of Anderson on
               the two monitors.

 CLOSE ON - THE MONITORS 
               On the left monitor Anderson has blue eyes, on the right he
               has brown.

 LISA                          The one on the left, the first disc
                         -it's a fake.  He doesn't have blue
                         eyes anymore.

               Witwer stares for a long time.

 WITWER                          A fake.

 (BEAT)                          But the Precogs predict the infallible
                         truth.  They don't emit fake discs.

               And now Lisa smiles.  She has set her lawyerly mind to the
               solution.  It is her moment

 LISA                          Exactly.  You can't tamper with the

                         have made a fake disc on their own
                         and inserted it into the delivery
                         system.

               The simplicity of it is inconceivable.  Witwer speaks
               carefully, trying to process it

 WITWER                          Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake
                         disc in with that day's real ones...

                         We're all programmed to believe

                         The system has never been wrong ...

               Witwer stares at the proof before him.  -- the different
               colored eyes of Anderson.  He ejects both discs and holds
               them in his hands.

 LISA (CONT'D)                          You have to call off the hunt.  He
                         was set up.

               Witwer looks at the two discs he is holding

 LISA                          He was set up!  You both were.  If

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90. 

 LISA                          He's not a murderer.

 WITWER                          I think he is.  A murderer ... and a
                         future murderer.

                         one's real?

               Witwer's hands close tight on the discs.  Lisa stands there,
               motionless.  Then she turns, and leaves his office, abruptly.
               He watches her go.

 INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY 
               Rose sits in a chair near the window.  She is chewing lightly
               on a cracker.  Her face shows wonder -- at the cracker's
               texture and taste.  She holds it up and admires its shape.

               Anderson's mood is less wondrous

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Listen to me.  I'm going to
                         leave you here.  I have to keep

                         I've done what I can do!

               Rose waits for him to finish.  She looks out the window at
               the street scene.

 ROSE                          Come here, Anderson.

                         the tenth floor of that building.

 ANDERSON'S POV - THE BOY AND THE WORKERS 
               Two men struggle to lift a large window in place.  Way below
               the little boy in the blue hat walks on along the sidewalk
               holding his mother's hand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91. 

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          They'll drop the window, killing
                         him.  It is impossible to save him.

               Anderson turns to her, shocked And then he runs for the door,
               hurls it open, and disappears down the hall.

               Rose listens to his FOOTSTEPS crashing down the stairs

 EXT. THE STREET. 
               Even as Anderson rushes out of the boarding house, the WORKERS
               have lost their grip on the window.

               The little BOY in the blue hat and his MOTHER walk unwittingly
               toward disaster.  They do not appear to hear the MEN'S cries.

               The WINDOW falls end over end above the boy's head.  The
               sunlight sparks off of the glass, so that from a distance it
               looks like a star falling from the sky.

               A WOMAN across the street sees what is happening, and cries
               out.

               But what Anderson does is run.  He runs faster and harder
               than humanly possible.  He does not care if he is recognized
               or hit by a passing taxi.  He is going to get to that boy.
               He has to get to that boy ...

               ANDERSON rams the BOY from behind just as the corner of the
               window frame kisses the boy's blue hat.  He knocks the boy
               to safety as glass and metal SMASH into the sidewalk.

               The mother does not even have time to scream.  She is on the
               ground, stunned, But Anderson has saved the boy.

               He rolls away, and gets to his feet.  Before anyone can put
               together what has happened, Anderson has ducked into an alley,
               and is gone.

 INT. THE ROOM - LATER 
               Anderson enters the room again, out of breath, some small
               cuts on his face and hands.  He stands across the room staring
               at Rose.

               Rose considers him.  When she speaks her voice is near and
               distant at the same time.  For Anderson, it is as if the
               words are coming from a place inside his own head.

 ROSE                          It was impossible to save that boy
                         -- but you did, Anderson.  It's in
                         you.  It's what you are.

               Anderson sits on the floor and leans back wearily against a
               wall.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92. 

 ANDERSON                          You knew it wasn't impossible.  That
                         I'd get there.

               Rose reveals nothing.

 ROSE                          You are a man who saves others.
                              (beat)
                         Save my brothers.

               Anderson almost laughs.  Her persistence is unbelievable

 ANDERSON                          I'm in a lot of trouble right now.

 ROSE                          My brothers are in more trouble.
                         They've moved them to ... an awful
                         place.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Ed Witwer -he's in the most
                         trouble of all.  Who saves him?

               Rose suddenly grimaces in pain, and grips the side of her
               head.  She curls into a fetal position.

               Anderson goes to her, touches her thin shoulder.  Her eyes
               roll into the back of her head.

               Whose pain is she feeling?  Her own?  Someone else's?
               Anderson doesn't want to think about it.

 INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB -CHEVY CHASE, MD -- NIGHT 
               Because Anderson has destroyed the Precog Chamber, the two
               Precog brothers have been brought here.

               The room is makeshift, uncomfortable ... a place for
               experiments.  The brothers are strapped into chairs.  They
               are helmeted.

               But unlike before, large bore needles have been placed in
               their jugular veins.  Connected to the needles are long twists
               of IV tubing.  There are several IVs running at high drip
               rates.

               Witwer has his back to all this.  He stands with Dr. Resfield,
               watching a technician working the keyboard on a huge
               mainframe.

               Dr. Resfield, a man not given to squeamishness looks back at
               the Precogs, uneasy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93. 

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're not really set up for this
                         type of 

               He stops talking when he looks into Witwer's hollow eyes. Witwer 
               is somewhere beyond the influence and reach of words.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- MORNING 
               Anderson tries to get Rose to drink some water.  Her skin is
               translucent, unhealthy, glistening with sweat.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Try to drink.

               She pushes the cup away.  She closes her eyes, as if even
               the dim light of the room causes her pain.

 ROSE                          Your wife.  We have to get her here,
                         Anderson.

               She opens her eyes.  Anderson doesn't like the feel of this.

 ANDERSON                          Why?

 ROSE                          I don't know ...

 ANDERSON                          What are you seeing?

 ROSE                          Glimpses, Anderson.  Please.  We
                         have to get her here.

 ANDERSON                          You're scaring me, Rose

               She covers his mouth with her hand

 ROSE                          Stop talking.  It uses me up.

               For a long time, Rose says nothing, Her gaze is locked onto
               a distance beyond the room.  At last, she speaks.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          In three minutes your wife will take
                         a walk ..

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER 
               Lisa sits in her office.  But she can't stand it, the sitting
               and waiting.  She has to move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 94. 

               She gets up and hurriedly leaves her office

 INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- MOMENTS LATER 
               Witwer walks past Lisa's SECRETARY toward the open door of
               Lisa's office.

 SECRETARY                          Sir?  I'm sorry, she stepped out for
                         a few minutes.
                              (beat)
                         Sir?

               Witwer stares into the empty office.  There is a clock on
               Lisa's desk.  His eyes fix on it.

 EXT. JUDICIAL CENTER ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa moves quickly down the steps of the white marble
               building.  She takes a deep breath, then heads down Jefferson
               Boulevard toward the city.

               A sleek black TRANSPORT with two Precrime officers in it
               follows her from a discreet distance.

               In the sky above, the ubiquitous Precrime hovercraft

 INT. CITY STREET ALEXANDRIA 
               Lisa walks down the street.  She hugs herself, barely aware
               of her surroundings.  She passes by stores, restaurants,
               payphones, video kiosks ... oblivious.  People push past
               her.

               On a street corner, as she waits at a red light, the payphone
               beside her begins to RING.  If she hears it, she gives no
               indication.  A KID reaches for it, listens, hangs up.

               She walks on.  Stores.  Restaurants.  An art gallery.  As
               she comes abreast of another PAYPHONE, it suddenly starts to
               ring.  This time Lisa glances at it.  But again, walks on.

               The TRANSPORT weaves through traffic, nearby She walks past
               the K.L. Lawrence Graphics Museum.  And another restaurant.
               And a PAYPHONE.  And this time, finally, when it, too, RINGS,
               she turns and looks hard at it.

               A man begins to walk over to it.  Lisa almost knocks him out
               of the way to get to it.  She grabs at the receiver.

 LISA                          Hello?  Hello?

 ANDERSON'S VOICE                          I need you.

               Lisa's forehead sags against the side of the payphone.  She
               basks in the sound of him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95. 

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          It's 1:03.  Set your watch, exactly.

               Lisa pushes the buttons on her digital watch as she listens
               LISA Okay.

 ANDERSON'S VOICE (CONT'D)                          This is what you have to do ...

               We now hear ANDERSON continue in VOICE OVER as we follow
               Lisa through a SEQUENCE OF EVENTS ...

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa walks up the steps of the museum

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:07 hang up the phone and enter
                         the Lawrence Museum.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               Lisa walks quickly through a display of 19th century magazine
               advertising.

 INT. GRAPHICS GALLERY 
               The two Precrime officers walk into a room filled with Chinese
               graphics.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          At 1:13 the two Precrime officers
                         following you take a wrong turn into
                         a different room, losing sight of
                         you for ten seconds.

               The officers start toward the entrance way to another room,
               then hesitate uncertainly, and go for another entrance way.

 EXT. THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM 
               Lisa hurries down the steps

 INT. A SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa boards the "A" MagLev train

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          An undercover transport officer will
                         have received emergency orders to
                         follow you.
 (MORE)                          He's wearing a red tie.  He has short
                         blond hair.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 96. 

 INT. THE SUBWAY CAR 
               The blond transport officer with the red tie sits at the far
               end of Lisa's car, watching her.

               At the next stop Lisa gets off.  He follows, not too far
               behind.

 INT. SUBWAY STATION 
               Lisa starts up the stairs.  She looks at her watch, then
               makes herself pause a few moments, to keep within Anderson's
               time frame.  She starts up again.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          As you come around the bend, cry out
                         and turn around and slap the
                         officer...

               Lisa does this, and the officer reels back, surprised. At the
               same moment two big men rushing to catch a subway come into
               view, and see this happening.  Lisa starts to run.  When the
               undercover officer tries to stop her, the two men grab the
               officer, and they get into a fight.

               Lisa escapes.

 INT. A TAXI - THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa looks at her watch, then taps the window for the driver
               to stop.  She gets out.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          Stay on Ninth street.  Underneath
                         Ninth street is the main power feed
                         for The Sprawl.  It'll mess up the
                         navigational beacon on the hovercraft.
                              (beat)
                         Keep switching taxis.  But stay on
                         Ninth.

               She hails another taxi.  She holds her hand over the
               IdentiScan before it can read her.  The taxi driver looks at
               her, sees her smile, sees the prepaid cash card she holds
               out to him.

 LISA                          Two hundred dollars if you don't
                         scan me.

               It's The Sprawl -- stranger things have happened.  He grabs
               the card, and jerks his head for her to get in.  They take
               off.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 97. 

 EXT. NINTH STREET LATER 
               Lisa gets out of the taxi and looks briefly into the sky.
               It is dense with holographic billboards, skim-jets,
               dirigibles.  Somewhere in all that is a Precrime hovercraft.

               And the neighborhood around her is definitely downscale.

 ANDERSON (V.O.)                          The hovercraft will try to drop
                         altitude, but the air traffic will
                         slow it down.
                              (beat)
                         Precrime loses you.  You'll have to
                         walk two miles.  Don't get scanned.

 EXT. THE SPRAWL 
               Lisa walks hurriedly down a side street.  She stands out in
               her white dress -- a spot of vulnerable color in world of
               black.

               Too vulnerable to pass up.  A MAN in a gray overcoat slides
               out from between two buildings in front of her.  He is not
               coy about his intent.  He comes straight at her, all business.

               Lisa freezes in place.  She looks at her watch.  The man
               grabs her by the shoulder.  When she starts to scream, he
               claps his hand over her mouth, hard.

 MAN                          You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your
                         teeth out.

               Her eyes look around frantically.  He starts to drag her
               backwards into the dark.

               ANDERSON leaps into view, and slams the man's head into a
               light post.  It takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens
               his grip on Lisa.  His legs at last collapse under him.

               Anderson scoops Lisa off the ground.  She hugs him hard.

               Then pulls back from him.  She gives him a look.

 LISA                          Cut it a little close there,
                         honeybunch.

 ANDERSON                          Rose got the street wrong.  She's
                         getting weak.

 LISA                          Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 98. 

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- LATER 
               Rose sits up in bed silently watching Lisa and Anderson
               together.

               Lisa needs to touch him.  She keeps a hand on his arm, brushes
               back a loose look of his hair.  Rose is mesmerized by her
               actions.  She drinks in everything, every bit of life.

               Anderson and Lisa are deep in conversation.  They speak to
               each other as if Rose were hardly present in the room.

               Anderson is trying to process everything Lisa has told him.

 ANDERSON                          Two discs.  One fake.  One real.

 LISA                          I don't think there were supposed to
                         be two.  Whoever planned it, wasn't
                         counting on two.

               They are silent for a long time.  Rose watches them work it
               through.

 ANDERSON                          An infallible system.  Every disc
                         ever generated has been true ...

 LISA                          Somebody wants you out of the way --
                         so they make a fake disc.  Who ever
                         doubts the discs?

 ANDERSON                          I never doubted it.  I saw it.  And
                         believed it, absolutely.  I was
                         certain I was going to murder Witwer.

               Anderson is shaking.  Lisa wraps her arms around him.  His
               voice is a stunned whisper.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          I saw the fake, and believed so much
                         in the system, that I saw myself as
                         a murderer.
                              (beats)
                         And the Precogs picked up those
                         thoughts ...

 LISA                          And generated the second disc.  The
                         real one.

 ANDERSON                          A self-fulfilling prophesy.  I
                         believed it was true.  And that made
                         it true.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99. 

               Anderson and Lisa turn and look at Rose.  She lies curled on
               the bed, her face to the wall.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Rose.  If all this is based on a lie
                         -the fake disc -- then do I really
                         kill Witwer?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We see what we see.  I'm sorry,
                         Anderson.  It's been predicted.

               Such a small voice, delivering a message of such finality

 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- MIDNIGHT 
               Lieutenant Glaser tries to get through to Witwer.  Witwer's
               back is turned to him.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          We can't take chances, sir

               Witwer doesn't move or answer.

 LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)                          It happens in less than three hours.
                              (beat)
                         We put you in a hovercraft and keep
                         you airborne -- until after the event.

 WITWER                          The event.

               Lieutenant Glaser shifts uncomfortably

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I've been ordered to get you onto
                         the craft.  By force if necessary.

 WITWER                          The event is inevitable, Lieutenant.

	        Witwer doesn't turn around.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The Precogs are never wrong.  The
                         event will take place.  I'm a
                         believer.  Aren't you?

 LIEUTENANT GLASER                          I don't leave this room without you,
                         sir.  The Security Panel insists.

 INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE SIMULTANEOUS 
               Anderson and Lisa keep working it, peeling away the layers.
               Rose lies silent.

 ANDERSON                          Nobody could slip a fake disc past
                         Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head.

 LISA                          He was the weak link in the perfect
                         system.

 ANDERSON                          Obsessive compulsive niners can't
                         allow changes in the routine

 LISA                          Something threw him off.
                              (beat)
                         He tried to tell me.  It didn't make
                         any sense.  Something about "spilled
                         coffee."
                              (beat)
                         Someone was in his office with him.
                         And coffee spilled ...

               We stay CLOSE ON Anderson and Lisa as Rose's voice cuts in.

 ROSE (V.O.)                          We were always treated as if we
                         weren't alive.  As if we weren't
                         there.

               The camera pulls back and they are watching her as she
               continues to speak.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          Even now.  You forget that I'm here.
                         You talk between yourselves.  And
                         when you need me to see into the
                         future, then you turn to me.

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  What is it?

 ROSE                               (beat)
                         We weren't just lost in the future.
                         We were in the Chamber, too.  Our
                         eyes were open.  In the present.

               And then Anderson gets it.  He kneels beside her bed

 ANDERSON                          Your eyes were open.  What did you
                         see, Rose?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 101. 

 ROSE                          Who would I have told?  Who ever
                         talked to us?  Who cared that we
                         could talk?

 ANDERSON                          Rose.  Who spilled the coffee?
                         Straight ahead ...

               Rose stares stright ahead ...

 MEMORY HIT 
               Rose sits in her chair in the Precog Chamber.  Her brothers
               sit in their usual places on either side of her.  The
               technicians tend to them.

               Rose's eyes are open.  She sees everything in the room.  The
               technicians, the machines ... and across the room a large
               window where she can see Ennis Page working the mainframe
               computer.

               Rose watches through the window ...

               As the computer emits discs, Page gathers them

 ROSE (V.O.)                          Ed Witwer entered Page's office.

               Witwer carries a mug of coffee.

               Ennis Page goes red in the face, stares at the coffee.  Speaks
               to Witwer, angrily, pointing to the coffee.  We can't hear
               the words.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Page was so upset at the sight of
                         the coffee.

               Witwer goes to put the coffee down on a small table.  It
               tips, and spills.

               Page looks like his head will explode.  He pulls a neatly
               folded white handkerchief out of his back pocket and drops
               to his hands and knees and begins to obsessively blot at the
               coffee stain on his spotless rug.

 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)                          Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket,
                         reached over Page and put it in one
                         of the open cases.

               Witwer closes the case.  He looks through the window into
               the Precog Chamber, but the only one watching him is Rose --
               and what does she matter?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 102. 

               Page rises angrily from cleaning the rug.  Witwer shrugs in
               apology and leaves the room.  Page stares after him.

 BACK TO SCENE 
               Rose is weeping.  She looks at Anderson and Lisa.

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          I didn't understand what I'd seen.
                         And I had no one to tell ...

               Lisa puts her arms around Rose Anderson tries to comprehend
               what he has heard.

 ANDERSON                          Ed ...

               Lisa turns, and speaks softly to her husband.

 LISA                          The perfect system -brought down by
                         a cup of coffee.  My god.

 ANDERSON                               (long beat)
                         He set into motion his own death.
                         He didn't know it would go this far.
                              (to Rose)
                         What makes me leave this room?  If I
                         stay here I won't kill him.  Right?

               But Rose and her brothers have already answered that question
               for him.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. WITWER'S OFFICE 
               Lieutenant Glaser looks at his watch.  Witwer is still in
               his chair, turned away from him.

 WITWER                          You see, if you think you can put me
                         on a hovercraft and save me, then
                         you don't believe in the infallibility
                         of the Precog system.

               Lieutenant Glaser has his orders.  He begins to approach.

               And as he does, Witwer swivels his chair around, and lifts
               the weapon he has been holding and silently shoots Lieutenant
               Glaser in the forehead.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And what I do not want around me,
                         are nonbelievers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 103. 

               Witwer steps over the body as if it doesn't exist, and walks
               out of the office, locking the door behind him.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD -- LATER 
               Witwer gets out his car and looks at the two story concrete
               building that houses the lab.  The lights are out in all the
               windows except the back section of the second floor.  There,
               the lights burn brightly.

               Witwer sees Precrime officers posted at intervals around it.
               He smiles as if he knows something they don't.  He looks at
               his watch.  It is a cool night, but his face is slick with
               sweat.

               He walks to the entrance of the building.  An OFFICER 1s
               startled to see him.

 WITWER                          Things quiet?

 OFFICER                          Sir.  Should you ... be here?

 WITWER                          There's been a development.  A body's
                         been found in the Sprawl.

 OFFICER                          Anderson's?

 WITWER                          They're checking it out.  I need to
                         see what the Precogs have seen.

               Witwer is IdentiScanned.  The door opens and he goes in.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Dr. Resfield looks up as Witwer strides into the lab, carrying
               a tv under his arm.  Witwer is the last person he wants to
               see.

 WITWER                          Borrowed this from the technicians'
                         lounge.  You don't think they'll
                         mind, do you?

 DR.RESFIELD                          You shouldn't be here, Director.

               Dr. Resfield's eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall,
               the red numbers ticking off time in seconds.

               Witwer looks for a plug, finds one.  Plugs in the tv.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 104. 

 WITWER                          No, no.  This is exactly where I
                         should be.

 DR. RESFIELD                          You're under a lot of strain,
                         Director.

               Witwer finds what he's looking for -- the continuous loop of
               his murder by Anderson.  "Call Now!  Call Now!"

 WITWER                          And tv's so good for that -- soothes
                         the mind.

               Witwer turns his sweaty face to Resfield and gives him a
               bright smile.  The scientist looks like he wants to run out
               of the room.

               Witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the
               Precogs.  Two technicians hover over the Precogs adjusting
               IV's and turning dials on the Precogs's organic helmets.

               The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial.
               But they are no longer violently seizing -- they are too
               weak for that.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Bring me up to speed, Doc.

 DR. RESFIELD                          We're getting nothing from them.

 WITWER                          And that's because ... ?

               Witwer still grips him by the elbow.

 DR. RESFIELD                          I don't know.

 WITWER                          Do you think they know where Anderson
                         is?

 DR. RESFIELD                          It's impossible to tell.
                              (beat)
                         We've done everything.  Maybe even
                         too much.

 WITWER STARES AT THE PRECOGS 
 WITWER                          They know how to find Anderson for
                         me.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 105. 

 WITWER (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         They're the perfect machine, Doctor.
                         You just have to know which button
                         to push.

 INT. BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL 
               Rose looks like she's on fire.  Anderson wets another towel,
               wrings it over the sink.  Lisa takes it, and wipes down Rose's
               face and arms .

               Rose's lips are moving soundlessly.  Her eyes are shut tight.
               She begins to writhe in bed.

 ANDERSON                          Jesus Christ.

 LISA                          Come on, Rose.

 ANDERSON LOOKS AT HIS WATCH 
 ANDERSON                          One hour.  We hold it together for
                         an hour, Witwer lives -- and I'm not
                         a murderer.

 LISA                          She won't last an hour.

               It suddenly looks much worse than that.  Rose's body contorts
               horribly and she arches up off the bed.  Lisa can't control
               her.

               Anderson reaches for her, wraps her in his arms, trying to
               hold and comfort her.

 ANDERSON                          Rose!

               She begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms.

 ROSE                          He's killed him, Anderson!

               Rose stiffens into a seizure posture, then her body goes
               slack.  Anderson eases her back on the bed.  He stares at
               her, stricken.

               Her voice barely leaves her now

 ROSE (CONT'D)                          You didn't save my brother.

               Anderson reels at her words.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 106. 

 ANDERSON                          Did he kill both of them, Rose?
                         Rose!

               Rose manages to speak, one last time.  Her whispered words
               damn him.

 ROSE                          Does it matter, Anderson?

               Anderson rises.  Looks down at Rose.

               It matters.  He starts to move, quickly.

               Lisa takes hold of his arm.

 LISA                          If you leave this room...

	       Anderson kisses her.

 ANDERSON                          Then I'm a cop, just trying to do
                         hisjob.

               He reaches for his duffel bag.

               When the door closes behind him, Rose turns her head slightly
               and looks.  And then her eyes drift closed, as she goes to a
               place deep within her own mind.

 EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL - MOMENTS LATER 
               He passes by several cars on the street.  But they're all
               auto-drive, they won't do him any good.

               So he smashes a store window within forty-five seconds a
               city police transport zooms up, lights flashing.  Two city
               officers leap out of the transport.  They approach the
               smashed-in store window, weapons drawn.  Which is a mistake.
               Anderson rises into view behind them, and sonically blasts a
               small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on.

               As they trip and fall, he is already spraying them down with
               BindFoam.

               Their second mistake is they left the engine running to power
               the bank of Nits -Tracker lights on the car's hood and roof.
               Anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets
               of The Sprawl, a beacon of light in the darkness.

 INT. THE LAB 
               The DIGITAL CLOCK races through time.  Witwer reaches his
               hand up and touches the vanishing numbers.

               The camera pulls back, and we see Dr. Resfield and the two
               technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 107. 

               And when we see the lab in its entirety, there sprawled on
               the floor in front of his chair is one of the Precog brothers.
               A small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of
               his skull.

               The other Precog sits very still in his chair.  He is still
               connected to everything -- his helmet is in place, the TVs
               drip into him.  His eyes are open, and when Witwer moves,
               the Precog's eyes follow him.

               Witwer can feel them on him.  He turns around.

 WITWER                          Is he coming?  No?  Yes?  Maybe?
                              (beat)
                         I think yes.

               The Precog looks at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And you think yes.

               Witwer points to the tv screen, running Anderson's murder of
               Witwer.  Witwer smiles triumphantly.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Infallibly, immutably yes.

               The Precog looks at him.  Witwer's smile vanishes, and
               suddenly strides across the room, and claps his hand over
               the Precog's eyes.  Then he turns, and stares again at the
               clock.

 EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB 
               Three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the
               building, facing outward toward the parking lot, weapons
               cradled in their arms.

               Behind them is a line of yew bushes.  AS we watch, the officer
               on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes.
               Several moments pass, and the same thing happens to the
               officer on the right.

               The officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right.
               Then he looks hard.  He grips his weapon tight, and swings
               left.  No one there, either.

               ANDERSON drops him hard, from behind.  The officer crumples
               onto the cement.

               But Anderson's not done with him.  Anderson lifts him up,
               struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance.

               Anderson holds him upright in place.  The man's head lolls
               backward.  Which is.  Perfect for what Anderson needs to do.
               Anderson reaches his fingers towards the man's closed eyes.
               He pulls up on the eyelids.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 108. 

               An IdentiScan over the entrance clicks on and reads the man's
               eyes.  Access granted, the doors HISS open.  Anderson enters
               the building, dragging the officer with him.

 INT. THE LAB 
               Anderson enters the lab.  The very building sickens him.
               What he sees sickens him even more.

               The remaining Precog sits strapped into his chair.  Witwer
               sits beside him in the other Precog chair, the dead brother
               at his feet.  Witwer wears the dead Precog's helmet.  His
               hand is in his lap, holding a gun.

               He grins when Anderson appears.  He takes off the helmet,
               drops it on the floor.

 WITWER                          I figured, since I can see the future,
                         too, maybe I could get a little disc
                         action going.
                              (beat)
                         Just kidding.

               Anderson stares at his old partner.  Then he looks up at the
               digital clock.  Five-seventeen AM.  Witwer looks too, then
               turns back to Anderson.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You find you been doing that a lot
                         this week?  Looking at clocks?
                              (beat)
                         Three minutes to go.

               Anderson turns to the tv.

 ANDERSON                          There's never anything good on, you
                         know?

               Now Witwer smiles.

 WITWER                          There.  That's the old Paul.

 ANDERSON                          You're not the old Ed. You've lost
                         it.

               Witwer rises from the chair, the gun in his hand.

 WITWER                          You lost it.  You went weak in the
                         knees, partner.

 ANDERSON                          I'm not your partner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 109. 

               Witwer looks at him sadly.

 WITWER                          The air went out of you when Frank
                         D'Ignazio killed himself.

 ANDERSON                          He was guilty.  I accepted that.

 WITWER                          No you didn't.  The doubts were
                         creeping in on you.  The lab trying
                         to engineer more Precogs ... Malcolm
                         pressuring you to expand ...

               Witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining Precog
               brother's cheek.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          Belief is the basis of the system.
                         It was your job to be the ultimate
                         believer.

               Witwer is breathing hard.  He lifts a hand and wipes the
               sweat from his face.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          And when Frank died, you faltered.
                         I'm a cop, I see into the hearts of
                         men.
                              (beat)
                         And the thing about you is, you
                         wouldn't have just walked away.

 ANDERSON                          Never been my style.

	      Witwer gives him the flicker of a smile

 WITWER                          Precrime needs to grow.  You would
                         have stood in its way.  The Security
                         Panel wouldn't have understood that.
                         What you're capable of.  What a
                         bulldog you are.
                              (beat)
                         Look what you've been doing to us
                         all week.  Amazing.  You're the best.

 ANDERSON                          So you took matters into your own hands.

 WITWER                          I understood the threat.  I understood
 YOU 
               Anderson looks at the dead Precog

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 110. 

 ANDERSON                          You killed a Precog.  You ended the
                         system you wanted to protect.

 WITWER                          Wrong.  This lab will make more.
                         Believe it, Paul.

               They look at the CLOCK.  Five-nineteen.

 ANDERSON                          Knowing the exact moment of your
                         death -it's made you crazy, Ed.

               Witwer looks at the tv.  The TV REALITY is almost in synch
               with what is happening in the room.

               Witwer lifts his gun -- and then realizes something is
               terribly wrong.

               Anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the
               disc -- except there is a major difference.

 WITWER                          You sonofabitch!

               Anderson lifts up both hands

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You didn't bring your gun!

 ANDERSON                          That's right.  No gun.

 WITWER                          You see?!  That's exactly what I'm
                         talking about.  You don't Believe!

               Anderson just looks at Witwer, raging at him.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          The system is infallible.

               ANDERSON Doesn't Seem to be Witwer reaches behind him and
               pulls a second gun from out of his belt.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          I guess that's why I've always carried
                         two.

               He tosses the gun to Anderson.  It clatters at Anderson's
               feet.

 ANDERSON                          You can't have it both ways.  You
                         don't want to die.  That's why you
                         lured me here -- to kill me first.
 (MORE) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 111. 

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                               (beat)
                         But it you don't diet the system is
                         flawed, and you couldn't live with
                         that.

               Witwer SHOOTS him once, in the right thigh.  Anderson cries
               out, falls to the concrete floor.

 WITWER                          Pick it up

               Anderson speaks through his teeth ANDERSON It doesn't happen.

               Witwer looks frantically at the tv, at the clock.

               He reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back IV
               feeding into the Precog's main line.  A thick, yellow fluid
               begins to flow toward the Precog's jugular vein.

 WITWER (CONT'D)                          You're killing him, partner.

               And what choice, finally, does Anderson have?  He reaches
               for the gun.

 ANDERSON                          Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains
                         his gun on Anderson.  Anderson trains
                         his gun on Witwer.

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)                          Oh, Ed ...

               Witwer lowers his gun.  And stands there between Anderson
               and the doomed Precog.

               The yellow liquid has almost reached the Precog's jugular.

               Anderson shoots Witwer, once in the heart.  Witwer is thrown
               back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock.

               Anderson drags himself to the Precog, and rips the yellow IV
               out of the main line.  The yellow drips onto the floor,
               mingling with Witwer's red.

               Anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him.  Witwer
               whispers something, and Anderson leans close to hear him.

 WITWER                          Now do you believe?

               Anderson pulls away from Witwer, and lets him take his last
               breaths alone.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 112. 

 DARKNESS 
               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
               beautifully proportioned FACE.

               It is Rose's face.  The camera pulls back and we see that
               she is lying on a grassy hillside.  Her brother is lying
               beside her.

               They are looking up at the night sky, at a sky filled with
               stars.

               Rose stares up into the sky, and speaks in a soft voice to
               her brother.

 ROSE                          James.  Can you guess what I'm
                         thinking?

 JAMES                               (beat)
 NO. 
               James smiles.  And then, after a long moment, so does Rose.

 THE END
