EXT.  MANHATTAN ISLAND - DAY

A high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty
prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the
Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DAY

A car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is
having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.
DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full
bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The

building superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to
notice.

						DANA
				 (exasperated)
			Frank, do you think you could give me a hand
			with these bags?

						FRANK
			I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a
			building superintendent.

						DANA
			You're also a human being, Frank.

						FRANK
				 (reluctantly going to help)
			Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the
			hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the
			grocery bags from her.

						DANA
				 (setting the wheel brakes on
				 the buggy)
			Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this
			eventually.

She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and
makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.

						FRANK
				 (to the baby)
			Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?

						FRANK
				 (to Dana)
			That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms.
			Barrett.

						DANA
				 (finding her keys)
			Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to
			fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you
			last week.

						FRANK
			Didn't I do it?

BABY BUGGY

It starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY

He GURGLES with delight at the movement.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY

Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage.

						DANA
			No, you didn't, Frank.

						FRANK
			Okay, that's no problem.

						DANA
			That's exactly what you said last week.

BUGGY WHEELS

The brakes unlock themselves.

DANA

She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward
just out of her reach and stops.  Surprised by the movement, she reaches
for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even
further.  Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps
rolling down the street at ever increasing speed.

SIDEWALK

Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians
for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy
swerves and continues unchecked.

INTERSECTION

Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races
toward the corner.

DANA

She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

A city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy.

BUGGY

It careens toward the corner.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY

Its eyes are wide open with excitement.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

Bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and
into the crosswalk.

BUS

The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the
intersection at high speed.

BUGGY

It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street.  The bus
continues missing the buggy by inches.

INTERSECTION

Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the
intersection and snatches up the baby.  She hugs it close, deeply
relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the
supernatural has re-entered her life.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY STREET - GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO - DAY

THEME MUSIC kicks in strongly as we see the familiar "No Ghosts" symbol
and PULL BACK to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the
Ghostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the
Upper West Side.  RAY STANTZ is driving and WINSTON ZEDDEMORE is riding
shotgun.

EXT.  WEST 77TH STREET - DAY  (MOMENTS LATER)

The Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone.
Stantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump
out of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the
house.

INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

A WOMAN greets them and leads them through the expensively-furnished
house.

						STANTZ
				 (all business)
			How many of them are there, ma'am?

						WOMAN
			Fourteen.  They're in the back.  I hope you can
			handle them.  It's been like a nightmare.

						WINSTON
			How big are they?

She holds her hand out indicating about four feet.

						WINSTON
				 (resolute)
			We'll do our best, ma'am.

						WOMAN
			They're right out here.

She leads them to a set of French doors that open into another room.
Stantz and Winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment.

						STANTZ
			Ready?

						WINSTON
			I'm ready.

						STANTZ
			Then let's do it.

He pushes through the French doors and they step into the room.

INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

They are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming KIDS
between the ages of seven and ten.

						KIDS
				 (disappointed)
			Ghostbusters!!  Boooo!!

Tables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the
room is strewn with discarded toys and games.  A couple of weary parents
sink onto lawn chairs as Stantz and Winston take over the party.

						WINSTON
				 (trying his best)
			How you doin', kids?

						LITTLE BOY
				 (nasty)
			I though we were having He-Man.

						STANTZ
			He-Man couldn't make it today.  That's why
			we're here.

						BOY
			My dad says you're full of crap.

						STANTZ
				 (stopped cold)
			Well, a lot of people have trouble believing
			in the paranormal.

						BOY
			No, he just says you're full of crap and that's
			why you went out of business.

He kicks Stantz in the leg.  Stantz grabs him by the shirtfront.

						STANTZ
				 (low and menacing)
			I'm watching you.
				 (to Winston)
			Song.

Winston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the
Ghostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing

						STANTZ AND WINSTON
			'There's something wrong in the neighborhood.
			Who you gonna call?'

						KIDS
				 (all together)
			He-Man!!

												 CUT TO:

EXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)

Stantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile.

						WINSTON
			That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties.
			I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged
			nine-year-olds.

						STANTZ
			Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The
			holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.

They get in the car

INT.  ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.

						WINSTON
			Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past.
			Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year
			these kids won't even remember who we are.

						STANTZ
				 (tries to start the car again)
			Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we
			did for this city.

						WINSTON
			Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job
			we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow
			man and blew the top three floors off an uptown
			highrise.

						STANTZ
			Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a
			hamburger without chopping up a cow.

He turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and
CLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits
of metal onto the pavement.  Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty
exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies.  Frustrated, Stantz
bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel

												 CUT TO:

INT.  WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)

A bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR,
Channel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title
card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and
we return to the show in progress: "World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter
Venkman."  There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and
sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat
infamous ex-Ghostbuster.

VENKMAN

He turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone,
understated and intimate.

						VENKMAN
			Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,'
			I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest,
			author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton
			Anglund.
				 (to his guest)
			Milt, your new book is called The End of the
			World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about
			gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you
			think anybody wants to read a book about it?

						MILTON
			Well, I think it's important for people to know
			that the world is in danger.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to
			happen or do we have to buy the book?

						MILTON
			I predict that the world will end at the
			stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

						VENKMAN
			This year?  That's cutting it a little close,
			isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of
			view, the book just came out, right?  So you're
			not even looking at the paperback release for
			maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least
			another year after that if the thing has
			movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.
			You would have been better off predicting 1992
			or even '94 just to be safe.

						MILTON
				 (irritated)
			This is not just some money-making scheme!  I
			didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong
			psychic belief that the world will end on New
			Year's Eve.

						VENKMAN
				 (placating)
			Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But
			I think my other guest may disagree with you.
			Elaine, you had another date in mind?

The CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey
housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman.

						ELAINE
			According to my sources, the world will end
			on February 14, in the year 2016.

						VENKMAN
			Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer.
			Where did you get that date, Elaine?

						ELAINE
			I received this information from an alien.  I
			was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having
			a drink in the bar when he approached me and
			started talking.  Then he must have used some
			sort of ray or a mind control device because
			he made me follow him to his room and that's
			where he told me about the end of the world.

						VENKMAN
			Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?

						ELAINE
			It may have been a room on the spacecraft made
			up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I
			can't be sure, Peter.

						VENKMAN
				 (humoring her)
			No, you can't, and I think that's the whole
			problem with aliens; you just can't trust them.
			You may get some nice ones occasionally like
			Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to
			be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just
			about out of time.
				 (does his wrap-up right TO
				 the CAMERA)
			Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless
			pets.
				 (holds up a hairless cat)
			Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...
				 (puts a finger to his temple
				 and sends out a though to his
				 viewers)
			... Good night.

												 CUT TO:

INT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)

Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a
well-meaning young incompetent.

						VENKMAN
			Where do you find these people?  I thought
			we were having the telekinetic guy who bends
			the spoons?

						NORMAN
			A lot of the better psychics won't come on the
			show.  They think you're too skeptical.

						VENKMAN
			Skeptical!  Norman, I'm a pushover.  I think
			professional wrestling is real.

There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come
out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Norman)
			What's all this?

						NORMAN
			They just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.'

						VENKMAN
			The Mayor!  He's a friend of mine.

Venkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK
HARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio.

						VENKMAN
				 (calling to the Mayor)
			Lenny!

The Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know
him.

						VENKMAN
				 (starts to follow him)
			Lenny!  It's Pete Venkman!

The plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand
against Venkman's chest.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (snide)
			Can I help you?

						VENKMAN
				 (dangerous)
			Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.

						HARDEMEYER
			I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant.
			What can I do for you?

						VENKMAN
			I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just
			want to say hello to him.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (scornful)
			I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting
			any ghosts lately?

						VENKMAN
			No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor
			about.  We did a little job for the city a
			while back and we ended up getting sued,
			screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (bristling)
			Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall,
			barring a disaster, he's going to be elected
			governor of this state and the last thing we
			need is for him to be associated with two-bit
			frauds and publicity hounds like you and your
			friends.  You read me?

Hardemeyer walks off with the two cops.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, I get it.  But I want you to tell Lenny
			that, because of you, I'm not voting for him.

												 CUT TO:

EXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and
visitors.  Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and
enters the museum.

INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)

We are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO
THE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an
incredibly powerful evil presence.  Then we PULL BACK to reveal the
studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit
by large skylights in the ceiling.  Working on the Vigo painting is
JANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the
department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy.  Janosz is staring
longingly across the room at Dana.

DANA

She is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still
preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy.  Janosz
watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her
shoulder.

						JANOSZ
				 (with an East European accent)
			Still working on the Turner?

Dana jumps, startled by the intrusion.

						DANA
			Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning,
			Janosz.

						JANOSZ
			You know, you are really doing very good work
			here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist
			me in some of the more important restorations.

						DANA
			Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here,
			but now that my baby's a little older, I was
			hoping to rejoin the orchestra.

VIGO PAINTING

At the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his
head and looks at Dana.

JANOSZ AND DANA

Neither of them notice the movement in the painting.

						JANOSZ
				 (disappointed)
			We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I
			could take you to lunch today?

						DANA
			Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have
			an appointment.
				 (looks at her watch)
			In fact, I'd better go.

She starts gathering up her things.

						JANOSZ
			Every day I ask you, and every day you've got
			something else to do.  Do I have bad breath
			or something?

						DANA
				 (trying to brush him off)
			I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.

						JANOSZ
			Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.

Janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.

						JANOSZ
				 (to himself)
			I think she likes me.

He switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the
phrases as he resumes working.

												 CUT TO:

EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building.  A sign
identifies it as "The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research."

INT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)

Dana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly
intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an
experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom
are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean.  The device he is testing is a black
box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic
displays.

						DANA
			... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped
			dead in the middle of the street

						SPENGLER

			Did anyone else see this happen?

						DANA
			Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't
			imagine this.

						SPENGLER
			I'm not saying you did.  In science we always
			look for the simplest explanation.

An ASSISTANT interrupts.

						ASSISTANT
			We're ready, Dr. Spengler

						SPENGLER
				 (to the Assistant)
			We'll start with the negative calibration.

He picks up the device and prepares to test it.

						DANA
				 (curious)
			What are you working on, Egon?

						SPENGLER
			I'm trying to determine whether human
			emotional states have a measurable effect on
			the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a
			theory Ray and I were working on when we had
			to dissolve Ghostbusters.

An assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually
a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room.  Inside the
waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated
arguement.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Dana)
			They think they're here for marriage
			counseling.  We've kept them waiting for two
			hours and we've been gradually increasing the
			temperature in the room.
				 (checking a heat sensor)
			It's up to 95 degrees at the moment.  Now my
			assistant is going to enter and ask them if
			they'd mind waiting another half-hour.

As Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the
waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay.  They explode
with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them
through the glass.  After recording his readings, he returns to his
Assistant.

						SPENGLER
			We'll do the happiness index next.
				 (to Dana)
			I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if
			it's all right with you.

						DANA
			Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.

						SPENGLER
			Oh no.

						DANA
				 (affectedly casual)
			Do you ever see him?

						SPENGLER
			Occasionally

						DANA
			How is he these days?

						SPENGLER
			Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a
			while there.  Then he crossed the border.

						DANA
			Does he ever mention me?

						SPENGLER
			No.  Not that I can recall.

They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely
little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.

						DANA
				 (slightly disappointed)
			Well, we didn't part on very good terms and
			we sort of lost track of each other when I
			got married.

The Assistant interrupts again.

						ASSISTANT
			We're ready for the affection test.

						SPENGLER
				 (to the assistant)
			Good.  Send in the puppy.

						DANA
				 (continuing)
			I thought of calling him after my marriage
			ended, but --.  Anyway, I appreciate you're
			doing this, Egon

They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable
Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl.  Spengler monitors
her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.

						DANA
				 (handing him a card)
			This is my address and telephone number.
			Will you call me?

						SPENGLER
			Certainly.

						DANA
			Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of
			this to Peter if you don't mind.

						SPENGLER
			I won't.

						DANA
			Thank you.

She shakes his hand and exits.

						SPENGLER
				 (to his assistant)
			Now let's see how she reacts when we take
			away the puppy

												 CUT TO:

EXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER)

It's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in
Greenwich Village.  The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old
books full of arcane metaphysical lore.  The TELEPHONE RINGS.

						STANTZ
				 (v.o., answering the phone)
			Ray's Occult.

INT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS

The shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal.
Ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan
sweater over a T-shirt.  He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews
on a battered, reeking pipe.  As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup
of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.

						STANTZ
				 (on the phone)
			Yeah ... mmhmm ... What do you need? ... What
			have I got?  I've got alchemy, astrology,
			apparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon
			intercession, U.F.O. abductions, psychic
			surgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie
			sightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, I've
			got it all -- what are you looking for? ...
			Don't have any.  Try the stockyards.

He hangs up.

						SPENGLER
			Who was that?

						STANTZ
			Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come
			up with anything?

						SPENGLER
				 (referring to the book)
			This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a
			flower cart took off by itself and rolled
			approximately half a kilometer over level
			ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.

						STANTZ
			You might want to check those Duke University
			mean averaging studies on controlled
			psychokinesis.

						SPENGLER
				 (going to the stacks)
			Good idea.

The bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm
			looking for an aerosol love potion I could
			spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would
			make her unconditionally submit to an unusual
			personal request.

						STANTZ
			Oh, hiya, Pete.

						VENKMAN
			So, no goat hooves, huh?

						STANTZ
				 (strung)
			I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's
			up?  How's it going?

						VENKMAN
			Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and
			buy me a sub?

						STANTZ
				 (slightly evasive)
			Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.

Spengler steps out of the stacks.

						VENKMAN
			Egon!

						SPENGLER
			Hello, Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet
			those science chicks really dig that big
			cranium of yours, huh?

						SPENGLER
			I think they're more interested in my
			epididymis.

						VENKMAN
			I don't even want to know where that is.

Venkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge.

						STANTZ
			Oh, your book came in, Venkman.  Magical
			Paths to Fortune and Power.

He hands Venkman the book.

						VENKMAN
			Great.
				 (reading the contents)
			So what are you guys working on?

						STANTZ
			Oh, just checking something for an old friend.

						VENKMAN
			Who?

						STANTZ
				 (at a loss)
			Who?  Just -- someone we know.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, Ray --

He grabs Stantz by both ears and pulls up.

						VENKMAN
			Who?  Who?  Who?

						STANTZ
			Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!

						VENKMAN
			Who, Ray?

						STANTZ
				 (giving in)
			Dana!  Dana Barrett!

Venkman lets go of his ears and smiles.  Spengler looks at Stantz and
shakes his head.

												 CUT TO:

INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - DAY (LATER)

The apartment is old and creatively furnished with a comfortable mix of
modern and traditional pieces.  Maria, a young Hispanic woman who does
day care for Dana, is feeding the baby in the kitchen when the DOORBELL
RINGS.

												 CUT TO:

Dana enters from the bedroom and crosses to the front door.  She opens
it and admits Ray and Egon.

						DANA
				 (hugging Ray)
			Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for
			coming.

						STANTZ
			No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.

						DANA
				 (to Spengler)
			Hi, Egon.

She shakes his hand and is about to close the door when Venkman appears
in the doorway.

						VENKMAN
			Hi, Dana.

Dana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance.

						VENKMAN
			I knew you'd come crawling back to me.

She regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his
presumptuousness.

						DANA
			Hello, Peter.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Dana)
			You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you
			didn't call me first.  I'm still into all
			this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen
			my show?

						DANA
			I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.

						VENKMAN
			I can see that you're still very bitter about
			us, but in the interest of science, I'm going
			to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work,
			boys.

Stantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on
the baby and the immediate physical environment.

VENKMAN AND DANA

Venkman starts nosing around the apartment.  Dana follows him.

						VENKMAN
			So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he
			ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.

						DANA
			He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems,
			he got a good offer from an orchestra in
			England and he took it.

						VENKMAN
			He ditched you.  You should've married me,
			you know.

						DANA
			You never asked me, and every time I brought
			it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.

						VENKMAN
			Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to
			feel loved and desired, too.

						DANA
			Well, when you started introducing me as "the
			old ball and chain," that's when I left.

						VENKMAN
			I may have a few personal problems but one thing
			I am is a total professional.

He leaves her and crosses to Spengler.

SPENGLER

He's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby
with a tape measure and calipers.

						VENKMAN
			What are you going to do, Egon?  Knit him a
			snowsuit?

Spengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar.

						SPENGLER
			I'd like to have a stool specimen

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or
			professional reasons?

						VENKMAN
				 (picking up the baby)
			Okay, kid.  Up you go.

He starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing
his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking
him.

						VENKMAN
			Help!  Please somebody help me!  Get him off!
			Quickly!  He's gone completely berserk!

Dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby.

						DANA
			What do you think?

						VENKMAN
			There's no doubt about it.  He's got his
			father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely
			ugly.  And smelly.
				 (resumes playing with the baby)
			You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the
			stinkiest baby I ever smelled.
				 (to Dana)
			What's his name?

						DANA
			His name is Oscar.

						VENKMAN
			Oscar!  You poor kid!

						DANA
				 (losing patience)
			Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you
			think there's anything unusual about him.

						VENKMAN
			Unusual?
				 (holds up the baby and
				 scrutinizes him)
			I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of
			experience with babies.

He looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper
off.

						DANA
				 (taking the specimen jar)
			I'll do it.

						VENKMAN
			I'll supervise.

INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - NURSERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman enters and finds Stantz monitoring the room.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Stantz)
			Well, Holmes, what do you think?

						STANTZ
			It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything
			was going on it's totally subdued now.

Spengler enters.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Spengler)
			What now, Brainiac?

						SPENGLER
			I think we should see if we can find
			anything abnormal on the street.

						VENKMAN
			Finding something abnormal on the street
			shouldn't be too hard.

												 CUT TO:

EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)

Dana walks down the street with Venkman, retracing the path of the
runaway buggy.  Spengler and Stantz follow, monitoring PKE valences from
the pavement and the buildings.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Dana, nostalgic)
			Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't
			it?
				 (pointing out familiar
				 neighborhood sights)
			There's our old cash machine.  And the dry
			cleaners we used to go to.  And the old
			video store.
				 (he wipes away an imaginary
				 tear)
			We really had some good times, didn't we?

						DANA
			We definitely had a moment or two.

Dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.

						DANA
			That's where the buggy stopped.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, let's take a look.

Venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely
oblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning
like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill.  Then he signals
for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.

						STANTZ
				 (reading the PKE meter)
			Is this the spot?

						DANA
			A little to the left.  Right there!  That's
			where it stopped.

Stantz reads the PKE meter.

						STANTZ
			Nothing.  Not a trace.

						SPENGLER
			Why don't we try the Giga-meter?

						VENKMAN
			What's that?

						STANTZ
			Egon and I have been working on a gauge to
			measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -
			giga electron volts.

						SPENGLER
			That's a thousand million electron volts.

						VENKMAN
			I knew that.

Spengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the
lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped.
The indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING
WILDLY.

						STANTZ
			I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's
			something brewing under the street.

						DANA
				 (worried, to Venkman)
			Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic
			problem or something that makes me vulnerable
			to these supernatural things.

						VENKMAN
			You mean like the time you got possessed and
			turned into a monster terror dog?  No, not
			a chance.  Total coincidence.
				 (to Stantz and Spengler)
			Am I right?

Stantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the
coincidence theory.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - LATE AFTERNOON

The museum has just closed for the day and the last of the visitors and
employees are leaving.

INT.  RESTORATION STUDIO - SAME TIME

Janosz is working late on the painting of Vigo.

VIGO PAINTING

Unnoticed by Janosz, the eyes of Vigo start to glow.

JANOSZ

He touches his brush to the canvas and a powerful current of red,
crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body,
driving him to his knees.

PAINTING

The figure of Vigo comes to life, turns toward Janosz and gestures
dramatically at him.  Then he speaks to Janosz in a commanding voice.

						VIGO
			I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the
			sorrow of Moldavia, command you.

						JANOSZ
				 (in agony)
			Command me, lord.

						VIGO
			On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain,
			I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will
			be, what is will be no more.  Now is the
			season of evil.  Find me a child that I might
			live again.

Bolts of red-hot energy shoot from the eyes of Vigo into Janosz's eyes.
He screams and falls to his knees.

												 CUT TO:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT

Venkman and Stantz come out with small boxes containing coffee,
sandwiches and Danish and start walking up the street.

						VENKMAN
			I love this.  We're onto something really
			big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to
			make some headlines with this one.

						STANTZ
			Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts?
			If anybody found out about this we'd be in
			serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have
			been clearer - no ghostbusting.

						VENKMAN
			Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing
			nice and quiet, low key, no profile.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Spengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the
street.  Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is
lit by strong work lights.

POLICE CAR

It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift
worksite and stops.  The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler
doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.
Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.

						FIRST COP
			How ya doing?

						SPENGLER
				 (reeking with guilt)
			Fine!  It's cutting fine now.

						FIRST COP
				 (curious)
			Why are you cutting?

						SPENGLER
				 (looking for one of the
				 others)
			Why are we cutting?  Uh - boss!

Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a
good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman.

						FIRST COP
			What are you doing here?

						VENKMAN
				 (belligerent)
			What the hell's it look like we're doing?
			We're bustin out asses over here 'cause
			some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin'
			better to do than make idiots like us work
			late on a Friday night, right?
				 (looks to Spengler for
				 agreement)

						SPENGLER
				 (with a "right on" fist)
			Yo.

The cops seem satisfied by the explanation.

						FIRST COP
			Okay, boys, take it easy.

They drive off.  Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts
rubbing his sore shoulders.

						SPENGLER
			You were supposed to help me with this.

						VENKMAN
			You need the exercise.

Stantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the
rubble from the hole.  Suddenly he hits metal.  They clear away
generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.
The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.

						STANTZ
				 (examing it)
			NYPRR.  What the hell -- ?  Help me lift
			this.

They prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and
very deep abyss.

						STANTZ
				 (shining a flashlight into
				 the hole)
			Wow!  It's an old airshaft.  It just goes
			forever.

Spengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now.

						SPENGLER
			Very intense.  We need a deeper reading.
			Somebody has to go down there.

Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray.

						STANTZ
			Thanks, boys.

They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong
cable attached to a winch.  Ray calls out orders to them as he descends
deeper and deeper.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
				 (his voice echoing in the
				 airshaft)
			Keep going -- more -- more --

INT.  HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz rappels off the sides of the airshaft as he continues his descent
in total darkness.

						STANTZ
				 (using a radio now)
			Lower -- lower --
				 (to himself)
			Gee, this really is deep.

Suddenly, his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the airshaft
and swings free in some kind of tunnel.

						STANTZ
				 (shouts)
			Hold it!  Steady!

He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into
the tunnel below.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - NIGHT

He is suspended near the top of a beautifully preserved chamber with
rounded, polished tile walls ardorned with intricate, colorfully enameled
Art Nouveau mosaics.  A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE
STATION.

STANTZ

He pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework,
and speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie.

						STANTZ
				 (reverently)
			This is it, boys, the end of the line.  Van
			Horne Station.  The old New York Pneumatic.
			It's still here.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman has no idea what he's talking about.

						SPENGLER
				 (explaining)
			The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an
			experimental subway system.  Fan-forced
			air-trains, built around 1870.

						STANTZ
				 (over the walkie-talkie)
			This is about as deep as you can go under
			Manhattan without digging your own hole.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Stantz)
			What's the reading?

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely
high reading.

						STANTZ
				 (on the radio)
			Off the top of the scale.  This place is
			really hot.  Lower me to the floor.

As Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable, he pans his flashlight
down the wall of the station, then onto the floor.

						STANTZ
				 (shouts)
			Hold it!!  Stop!!  Whoa!!

INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - FLOOR - NIGHT

Below him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable
torrent of disgusting ooze.

As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely
amplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in
the bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING
through ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC,
and mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain
-- VOICES SHOUTING in anger, SCREAMING in fear, GROANING in pain, a sad
and eerie symphony.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ - NIGHT

						STANTZ
				 (ranting on the radio)
			Oh, my God!  It's a seething, bubbling,
			psychic cess!  Interlocked tubes of plasm,
			crackling with negative GEVs!  It's glowing
			and moving!  It's -- it's a river of slime!!

STANTZ

He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he
can.  He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on
it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end.
Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting
the pole.

SLIME

Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of
the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet.  He jerks his legs up
as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.

						STANTZ
				 (on the radio)
			Haul me up, Venkman!  Now!

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's
car drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier.  A
burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two
cops.

						SUPERVISOR
				 (no nonsense)
			Okay, what's the story here?

Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the
belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex
hardhat.

						VENKMAN
			What, I got time for this?  We got three
			thousand phones out in the Village and about
			eight million miles of cable to check.

						SUPERVISOR
				 (not buying it)
			The phone lines are over there.
				 (points to the curb)

Venkman pops Spengler on the head.

						VENKMAN
			I told ya!

Stantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
				 (filtered)
			Help!  Help!  Pull me up!  It's alive!  It's
			eating my boots.

Venkman switches off the walkie-talkie.

						FIRST COP
			You ain't with Con Ed or the phone company.
			We checked.  Tell me another one.

Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment.

						VENKMAN
			Gas leak?

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - SAME TIME

Stantz is hanging there, looking down into the shaft at the slime which
is now bubbling up the shaft after him.

						STANTZ
				 (shouting)
			Get me out of here!!

Desperate now, he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old,
rusting conduit.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

The conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line, ripping
through the cable with a SHOWER OF SPARKS.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman, Spengler, the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright
FLASH deep down in the hole and a SHOUT from Stantz.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - STREET - NIGHT

One by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the
buildings along East 77th street; then the whole neighborhood blacks
out, and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
			Sorry.

INT. DANA BARRETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

She walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over
the living room.  Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for
information about the blackout.  She listens to a special news report
for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby.
She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door
and looks in.  Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.
Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz
standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of
the hallway.  He looks slightly dazed and even creepier.

						DANA
				 (surprised)
			Janosz?

						JANOSZ
			Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the
			neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to
			see if everything's all right with you --
			you know, with the blackout and everything?
			Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?

His affected concern is chilling.  She is frightened but conceals it
from him.

						DANA
				 (mechanically and cautiously)
	We're fine, Janosz.

He tires to look around her into the apartment.

						JANOSZ
			Do you need anything?  You want me to come
			in?

						DANA
			No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks
			anyway.

						JANOSZ
			Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night,
			Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs
			bite you.

						DANA
			Good night, Janosz.

She closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there
staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid.

INT.  HALLWAY OF DANA'S BUILDING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Janosz stands there in semi-darkness, then his eyes light up like
headlights and he walks off down the hall.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - NEXT DAY

The JUDGE, a rather sour-looking jurist of the old school, calls the
court to order.

						JUDGE
			I want to make one thing very clear before
			we go any further.  The law does not recognize
			the existence of ghosts, and I don't believe
			in them either, so I don't want to hear a
			lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and
			demons.  We're going to stick to the facts
			in this case and save the ghost stories for
			the kiddies.  Understood?

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz leans over and whispers to Spengler.

						STANTZ
			Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?

						SPENGLER
			His nickname is "The Hammer."

Stantz and Spengler are seated with their attorney LOUIS TULLY, lawyer,
CPA and former demonic possession victim.  Louis is desperately paging
through a mountain of legal textbooks.

						LOUIS
				 (nervous)
			I think you're making a big mistake here,
			fellas.  I do mostly tax law and some probate
			stuff occasionally.  I got my law degree at
			night school.

						STANTZ
			That's all right.  We got arrested at night.

SPECTATORS' GALLERY

Venkman is talking to Dana at the wooden rail in front of the gallery.

						DANA
			I wish I could stay.  I feel personally
			responsible for you being here.

						VENKMAN
			You are personally responsible.  If I can
			get conjugal rights, will you visit me at
			Sing Sing?

						DANA
			Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.

						VENKMAN
			Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.

						DANA
			You mean you cough up hairballs all over
			the rug?

						VENKMAN
			I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.

						DANA
				 (sincerely)
			Good luck.

						VENKMAN
			Thanks.

She gives him a quick, unexpected kiss and exits.  Venkman savors it for
a moment then goes back to the defense table.

PROSECUTION TABLE

Jack Hardemeyer, the mayor's principal aide, is goading the PROSECUTOR,
a very sober, humorless woman in her late thirties.

						HARDEMEYER
			How are you doing, hon?  Just put these guys
			away fast and make sure they go away for a
			long, long time.

						PROSECUTOR
			It shouldn't be hard with this list of charges.

						HARDEMEYER
			Good.  Very good.  The mayor and future
			governor won't forget this.

He smiles conspiratorially and makes a point of passing the defense table
on his way out of the courtroom.

DEFENSE TABLE

The Ghostbusters look up as Hardemeyer approaches.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (gloating)
			Nice going, Venkman.  Violating a judicial
			restraining order, willful destruction of
			public property, fraud, malicious mischief
			-- smooth move.  See you in a couple years
			-- at your first parole hearing.

Herdemeyer exits.  Louis looks devastated.

						LOUIS
			Gee, the whole city's against us.  I think
			I'm going to be sick.

Spengler hands him a waste basket as the Prosecutor calls her first
witness.

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - DAY (LATER)

The Con Ed Supervisor is testifying.

						PROSECUTOR
			Mr. Fianella, please look at Exhibits A
			through F on the table over there.  Do you
			recognize that equipment?

EXHIBIT TABLE

Lying on the table are the basic tools of the Ghostbusting trade: three
proton packs and particle throwers, a couple of ghost traps, and various
meters and detection devices.

						CON ED
				 (o.c.)
			That's the stuff the cops found in their
			truck.

WITNESS STAND

She continues.

						PROSECUTOR
			Do you know what this equipment is used for?

						CON ED
				 (shrugs)
			I don't know.  Catching ghosts, I guess.

						PROSECUTOR
				 (to the Judge)
			May I remind the court that the defendants
			are under a judicial restraining order that
			specifically forbids them from performing
			services as paranormal investigators and
			eliminators.

						JUDGE
			So noted.

						PROSECUTOR
			Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the
			substance in the jar on the table marked
			Exhibit F?

PROSECUTOR

She goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing the
slime sample Stantz removed from the tunnel.

						CON ED
			I been working underground for Con Ed for
			27 years and I never saw anything like that
			in my life.  We checked out that tunnel the
			next day and we didn't find nothing.  If it
			was down there, they must have put it there.

DEFENSE TABLE

Venkman and Spengler look at Stantz.

						STANTZ
				 (defensively)
			Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have
			been ten thousand gallons of it down there.

						SPENGLER
			It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal
			source.

						LOUIS
				 (nervously)
			Should I say that?

						SPENGLER
			I doubt that they'd believe us.

Louis moans and goes back to his notes.

												 WIPE TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - LATER

Venkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him.

						LOUIS
			So like you were just trying to help out
			your old friend because she was scared and
			you didn't really mean to do anything bad
			and you really love the city and won't ever
			do anything like this again, right?

						PROSECUTOR
			Objection, your Honor.  He's leading the
			witness.

						JUDGE
			The witness is leading him.  Sustained.

						LOUIS
			Okay, let me rephrase that question.
				 (to venkman)
			Didn't you once coach a basketball team for
			underprivileged children?

						VENKMAN
			Yes, I did.  We were city champs.

						PROSECUTOR
			Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.

						JUDGE
			Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything
			to ask this witness that may have some
			bearing on this case?

						LOUIS
				 (to Venkman)
			Do I?

						VENKMAN
			No, I think you've helped them enough already.

						LOUIS
				 (to the Judge)
			No, I guess not.
				 (to the Prosecutor)
			Your witness.

The Prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish.

						PROSECUTOR
			So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court
			why it is you and your co-defendants took it
			upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the
			middle of the street.

						VENKMAN
			Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many
			holes already we didn't think anyone would
			notice.

The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order.

						JUDGE
			Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in
			contempt.

						VENKMAN
			Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets
			me up like that I can't resist.

						PROSECUTOR
			I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were
			you digging the hole?  And please remember
			that you're under oath.

						VENKMAN
			I had my fingers crossed when they swore me
			in, but I'm going to tell you the truth.
			There are things in this world that go way
			beyond human understanding, things that
			can't be explained and that most people don't
			want to know about anyway.  That's where we
			come in.

						PROSECUTOR
			So what are you saying?  That the world of
			the supernatural is your special province?

						VENKMAN
			No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens
			and somebody has to deal with it.

The spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order.

												 WIPE TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

The trial is nearing its end.  The Judge calls on Louis to make his
summation.

						JUDGE
			Does the counsel for the defense wish to
			make any final arguements?

Louis rises.

						LOUIS
			Your honor, may I approach the bench?

						JUDGE
				 (impatient)
			Yes.

Louis crosses to the judge's bench.

						LOUIS
				 (to the judge)
			Can I have some of your water?

						JUDGE
			Get on with it, counselor!

						LOUIS
				 (scared)
			Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --
				 (he remembers there's no
				 jury)
			audience.  I don't think it's fair to call
			my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was
			a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in
			an elevator for about three hours and I had
			to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I
			don't blame them because once I turned into
			a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.

He goes back to the defense table and sits down.  Stantz and Spengler
hang their heads.  Venkman pats Louis on the back.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Louis)
			Way to go.  Concise and to the point.

JUDGE

He stares at Louis, astonished at his summation.

						JUDGE
			That's it?  That's all you have to say?

						LOUIS
			Did I forget something?

He searches through a disorderly pile of notes.

						JUDGE
			That was unquestionably the worst
			presentation of a case I've ever heard in a
			court of law!  I ought to cite you for
			contempt and have you disbarred.  As for
			your clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz
			and Egon Spengler, on the charges of
			conspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction
			of public property, I find you guilty on all
			counts.  I order you to pay fines in the
			amount of $25,000 each and I sentence you to
			eighteen months in the city correctional
			facility at Ryker's Island.

STANTZ

He sees the activity in the jar

						STANTZ
			Uh-oh, she's twitchin'.

THE BENCH

The Judge continues

						JUDGE
			And on a more personal note, let me go on
			record as saying that there is no place in
			decent society for fakes, charlatans and
			tricksters like you who prey on the
			gullibility of innocent people.  You're
			beneath the contempt of this court.  And
			believe me, if my hands were not tied by the
			unalterable fetters of the law, a law which
			has become in my view far too permissive and
			inadequate in it's standards of punishment,
			I would invoke the tradition of our
			illustrious forebearers, reach back to a
			sterner, purer justice and have you burned
			at the stake!

He hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily.  Then
he feels a LOW RUMBLING TREMOR in the courtroom.

SPECIMEN JAR

The slime starts to pulse and swell, pushing up the lid on the jar.

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz anticipates big trouble.

						STANTZ
			Under the table, boys!

The Ghostbusters duck under the defense table.

LOUIS

He stands up and looks around fearfully.

INT.  COURTROOM - GHOST BATTLE - DAY

Everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases.  All eyes turn to the
exhibit table.  Then suddenly all Hell breaks loose as TWO FULL-TORSO
APPARITIONS explode out of the specimen jar.

JUDGE

He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and
recognizes them immediately.

						JUDGE
				 (in horror)
			Oh, my God!  The Scoleri Brothers!

SCOLERI BROTHERS

Big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten
feet tall.  They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are
metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still
attached.  Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their
bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to
get at the Judge.

JUDGE

Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense
table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the
spectral intruders.

						JUDGE
				 (terrified)
			You've got to do something!

						VENKMAN
			Who are they?

						JUDGE
			They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them
			for murder.  They were electrocuted up at
			Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.

						VENKMAN
			Maybe they just want to appeal.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense
table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING.

PROSECUTOR

She sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge
with them.

						VENKMAN
			These boys aren't playing around.

						JUDGE
				 (desperately)
			You've got to stop them.  Please!

						LOUIS
				 (thinking like a lawyer)
			Violating a judicial restraining order could
			expose my clients to serious criminal
			penalties.  As their attorney I'd have to
			advise them against it.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They start punching through the jury box.

JUDGE

He is just about hysterical with fear.

						JUDGE
			All right!  All right!  I'm recinding the
			order.  Case dismissed!!
				 (he pounds his gavel on
				 the floor)
			Now do something!

						STANTZ
			Let's go to work, boys.

With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash
across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were
being displayed as evidence.  They strap them on hastily as the Brothers
continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.

						VENKMAN
				 (slinging the pack onto
				 his back)
			Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.

						STANTZ
				 (grabbing other gear)
			Okay, let's heat 'em up!

They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle
throwers.

						STANTZ
			All right, throwers.  Set for full neutronas
			on stream.

They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts
them.

						VENKMAN
			Hey!  Why don't you pick on someone your own
			size?

The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot
lightning at their new adversaries.

						STANTZ
				 (to the others)
			On my signal, boys.  Open 'em up -- Now!

They all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible
powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom.

						VENKMAN
			Spengs, take the door.  Ray, let's try and
			work them down and into the corner.

Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the
streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on
the floor.

						STANTZ
			Watch it!  I'm coming under you, Pete.

They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while
ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers.  Finally, Ray
sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of
light energy.

						STANTZ
			Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now --
			Venky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him
			down -- trapping -- trapping -- now!

He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the
traps which snap shut.

INT.  COURTROOM - TRAPS - DAY

LEDs on the outer casing start flashing, indicating the presence of a
ghost inside each trap.

						VENKMAN
				 (checking the trap)
			Occupado.

INT.  COURTROOM - JUDGE - DAY (AFTER GHOST BATTLE)

He sticks his head up slowly from behind the debris of his bench and
looks around in total amazement.

LOUIS

He crawls out from under a chair.  Reporters and spectators get back on
their feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation.

PROSECUTOR

She's lying on the floor, attended to by the Bailiff and the Court Clerk.

						SPENGLER
				 (to the Prosecutor)
			Brilliant summation.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of
them standing in the wrecked courtroom.

						VENKMAN
			Case closed, boys.  We're back in business.

The spectators cheer and applaud.

EXT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

The old, dilapidated Ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground,
dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder, and the new logo is hoisted
into place over the main entrance.  It's just like the original "No
Ghosts" logo, but in the new one the ghost in the red circle is holding
up two fingers.  Venkman enters the firehouse.

INT.  BEDROOM SET (TV COMMERCIAL - FULL SCREEN VIDEO) - NIGHT

A man and his wife are lying in bed reading.  The man is played by Louis
Tully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist,
is playing his wife.  They are both terrible actors.  Suddenly, a ghost,
actually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom.  Janine
sees it and screams.

						LOUIS
			What is it, honey?

						JANINE
			It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know
			what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us
			alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.

						LOUIS
			Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.

He picks up the phone.

						JANINE
			Who are you going to call?

						LOUIS
				 (with a wink)
			Ghostbusters.

As he starts to dial, the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the Ghostbusters
standing in the bedroom.  Their acting isn't much better than Louis and
Janine's.

GHOSTBUSTERS

Stantz speaks directly TO the CAMERA.

						STANTZ
			I'm Ray --

						VENKMAN
			I'm Peter --

						SPENGLER
			I'm Egon --

						STANTZ
			And we're the ...

						ALL
				 (together)
			Ghostbusters.

						STANTZ
			That's right -- Ghostbusters.  We're back
			and we're better than ever with twice the
			know-how and twice the particle-power to
			deal with all your supernatural elimination
			needs.

During his speech, Winston can be seen in the b.g. pretending to trap the
fake ghost.

						STANTZ
			Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.
				 (TO CAMERA)
			And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're
			giving you twice the value with our special
			half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.

						VENKMAN
			Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone
			crazy?

						STANTZ
			I guess so, Pete, because that's not all.
			Tell them what else we've got, Egon.

Spengler actually mouths everyone else's dialogue along with them,
waiting for his cue.

						SPENGLER
			You mean the Ghostbusters hot beverage
			thermal mugs and free balloons for the kids?

He holds up a mug and a limp, uninflated balloon.

						STANTZ
			You bet.

As Stantz wraps it up, SUPERS APPEAR at the bottom of the SCREEN: FULLY
BONDED - FULLY LICENSED - SE HABLA ESPANOL.

						STANTZ
				 (TO CAMERA)
			So don't wait another minute.  Make your
			supernatural problem our supernatural problem.
			Call now, because we're still --

						ALL

Louis comes back into the garage bay and stops as he smells a foul odor.
He sniffs around, following the smell.

He freezes.

INT. OFFICE AREA - LOUIS'S POV

Slimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing
down Louis's bag lunch.  Slimer looks up and sees Louis.

SLIMER AND LOUIS

They both scream and run off in opposite directions.

SLIMER

He passes right through a wall and disappears.

LOUIS

He runs right into a wall, recovers and exits in a hurry.

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY (LATER)

Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog
along the track that circles the reservoir.  One of the runners looks
behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams.

GHOSTLY JOGGER

A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace.  Other runners
stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them.  Seemingly
oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to
his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse.

EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - DAY (SAME TIME)

Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the
newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup.

STANTZ

He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging
track.

GHOST JOGGER

He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting.  As the
ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit
concealed control buttons.  A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a
glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride.
Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger.

						VENKMAN
				 (checking his watch)
			You know he ran that last lap in under six

The Ectomobile is parked at the curb and a curious crowd looks on as the

INT.  ORREFORS GLASS STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

All the precious crystal is floating in the air, several feet above the
glass shelves and display tables.  Stantz and Venkman are talking to the
manager while Winston and Spengler set up an array of electronic devices
positioned in each corner of the store.

On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which
throw laser-type beams around the perimeter of the store.  The manager
watches in horror as all the GLASSWARE suddenly drops out of the air,
SMASHES through the GLASS SHELVES and SHATTERS on the display tables.
There is a long pregnant pause.

						STANTZ

			So will that be cash or a check?

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

Everyone else has gone home.  Dana is cleaning her brushes and putting

VIGO PAINTING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vigo turns his head and watches Dana as she walks past the painting.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

Louis is lurking behind a pillar, peeking out at the office area.  We PAN
DOWN TO the floor and see a foot pedal, then PAN ALONG the cord TO a
ghost trap sitting on Louis's desk.  Hanging from strings over the desk
are several pieces of Kentucky fried chicken.

WALL

Slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air, then spots the
chicken bait.  He licks his lips, materializes completely and flies to
the chicken.

LOUIS

His eyes light up and he stomps the foot pedal.

						LOUIS
				 (shouts)
			Gotcha!

DESK

The trap pops open and shoots out a powerful cone of energy.  Slimer
dodges it and escapes as a big section of the ceiling comes crashing down
on Louis's desk.

						LOUIS
				 (seeing the damage)
			Uh-oh.

He slinks off, defeated.

INT.  MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - SECURITY DESK - DAY

The Ghostbusters commercial is playing on a portable TV on the security

giant front-page headline: GHOSTBUSTERS SAVE JUDGE.  Venkman enters.

						VENKMAN
			I'm looking for Dana Barrett.

						SECURITY GUARD
			Room 304 -- Restorations.
				 (recognizing him)
			Hey!  Dr. Venkman -- 'World of the Psychic.'
			I'm a big, big fan.  That used to be one of
			my two favorite shows.

						VENKMAN
				 (flattered)
			Thanks.  What's the other one?

						SECURITY GUARD
			'Bass Masters.'  It's a fishing show.  Ever
			see it?

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, really great.  Take it easy.

He exits.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Dana is working on a valuable Flemish still-life by Ver Meer.  Janosz is
at the other end of the room, still working on the painting of Vigo.
Venkman enters and sneaks up behind Dana.

						VENKMAN
				 (looking at the Ver Meer)
			So this is what you do, huh?

						DANA
				 (glad to see him)
			Oh, hello, Peter.

						VENKMAN
			You're really good, you know.

						DANA
			I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it.
			It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about
			ten million dollars.

VIGO

He turns his head and watches Venkman and Dana.

VENKMAN

Unaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life,
holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do.

						VENKMAN
			You know you can go to Art World and get
			these huge sofa-size paintings for about
			forty-five bucks.

He starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio.

						DANA
			I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk
			about art.

						VENKMAN
			As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell
			you that I haven't forgotten your problem
			and that we're still on the case.

They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz.

						JANOSZ
				 (smiling at Venkman)
			Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to
			your friend?

						DANA
			Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman.
			Peter, Janosz Poha.

Venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up.

						JANOSZ
				 (avoiding his gaze)
			Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on
			television.

						VENKMAN
			How are you?
				 (looking over at the Vigo
				 painting)
			What's that you're working on, Johnny?

Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go.  Venkman and Dana cross to
the Vigo painting.  Janosz steps protectively in front of it.

						JANOSZ
			It's a painting I'm restoring for the new
			Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait
			of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled
			most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th
			Century.

						VENKMAN
				 (staring at the painting)
			Too bad for the Moldavians.

						JANOSZ
				 (defensive)

			He was a very powerful magician.  A genius
			in many ways and quite a skilled painter.

						DANA
			He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.
			I hate this painting.  I've felt very
			uncomfortable since they brought it up from
			storage.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want
			to hang in the rec room.  You know what it
			needs?
				 (picking up a brush)
			A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.

Venkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand.

						JANOSZ
				 (with forced good will)
			We don't go around altering valuable
			paintings, Dr. Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			Well, I'd make an exception in this case if
			I were you.

Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Janosz)
			I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting
			you.

						JANOSZ
			My pleasure.

Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially)
			I may be wrong, but I think you've got a
			little crush on this guy.

						DANA
			Good-bye, Peter.

						VENKMAN
				 (dragging his feet)
			I'd like to stay, but I really don't have
			time to hang around here.  I'll call you.
				 (calls out to Janosz)
			Later, Johnny!

He exits.

VIGO

Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  FIREHOUSE - LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

Venkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the lab
area.

						STANTZ
			Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have
			something really amazing to show you.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Spengler)
			It's not that thing you do with your
			nostrils, is it?

Stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among
the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a
Tupperware container.

						STANTZ
				 (to Venkman)
			We've been studying the stuff that we took
			from the subway tunnel.

He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute.

						VENKMAN
			And now you're going to eat it?

						STANTZ
			No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

He takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a
large Petri dish.

						STANTZ
			Now watch this.

He leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it.

						STANTZ
				 (simulating anger)
			You worthless piece of slime!!
				 (as the slime starts to
				 twitch and glow)
			You ignorant disgusting blob!!

SPECIMEN

It bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult.

						STANTZ
			You foul, obnoxious muck!!

STANTZ

He continues venting his rage on the slime.

						STANTZ
			I've seen some real crud in my time, but
			you're a chemical disgrace!!

The specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the
Petri dish.

STANTZ AND SPENGLER

They turn to Venkman for his reaction.  He's dumbfounded.

						VENKMAN
			This is what you do with your spare time?

						STANTZ
				 (very excited)
			This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman.
			A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this
			is, it clearly responds to human emotional
			states.

						VENKMAN
			'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff
			and sell it.

						SPENGLER
			We've found it at every event site we've
			been to lately.

						WINSTON
				 (poking at the slime)
			You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad
			vibes'?

						STANTZ
			Like a goat on garbage.

						STANTZ
			We're running tests to see if we can get an
			equally strong positive reaction.

						VENKMAN
			What kind of tests?

						STANTZ
				 (a little embarrassed)
			Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say
			supportive, nurturing things --

						VENKMAN
			You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?

Spengler reacts as if he might be.

						STANTZ
			It really responds to music.
				 (to Spengler)
			Let's calm it down.

Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing "Cumbaya" to
the slime specimen.

SPECIMEN

It stops bubbling and starts to shrink.

						WINSTON
			Does it have any favorites?

						STANTZ
			It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,'
			'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small
			World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the
psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster.

						STANTZ
			Watch this.

Stantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilson's "HIGHER AND HIGHER"
BLASTS from the speakers.

TOASTER

It shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the MUSIC.

VENKMAN

He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of
toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat.

						VENKMAN
			I don't care what you say.  This could be a
			major Christmas gift item.

						WINSTON
			Right, and the first time someone gets mad,
			their toaster will eat their hand.

						VENKMAN
			So we'll put a warning on the label.

Stantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving.  Venkman looks
at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the toaster)
			Go ahead.  I dare you.

Suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand
and won't let go.  The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and
easily withdraws his hand.

						VENKMAN
			Just kidding.

INT.  DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet.  She's
wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby.  She
turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water
temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby.

						DANA
				 (talking sweetly to the
				 baby)
			Look at you.  I think we got more food on
			your shirt than we got in your mouth.

BATHTUB

The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the
bottom of the tub.  Dana reaches over and turns off the water without
looking into the tub.  When she turns away, both taps start to spin by
themselves and the tub flexes and bulges.

DANA

Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath
into the tub.

BATHTUB

The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the
bubble bath.

DANA
She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub.
She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to
close up around the baby like a hugh mouth.  Dana screams, snatches the
baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the
bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER)

The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old
magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment.  Venkman is asleep on the
floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed
just short of the bedroom.  The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to
his feet and answers it.  He opens the door and sees Dana standing there.
She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked,
wrapped in a baby blanket.

						DANA
				 (somewhat embarrassed to
				 be there)
			I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?

						VENKMAN
				 (surprised to see her)
			No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago.
			Come on in.
				 (noting her apparel)
			Are we having a pajama party?

						DANA
				 (upset)
			Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.

Venkman looks at her for a long moment.

						VENKMAN
			You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd
			have serious doubts.  But coming from you,
			I can't honestly say I'm surprised.

						DANA
			I must be losing my mind.  At the museum
			today I could have sworn that terrible
			painting of Vigo looked right at me.

						VENKMAN
			Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this
			nightgown?

						DANA
				 (distraught)
			I don't know what to do anymore.

						VENKMAN
			I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the
			bathtub.  You better stay here.

He exits to the bathroom.  She looks around the loft, amazed at the
disorder.  Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and
takes Oscar from her.

						VENKMAN
			Now this kid has a serious nudity problem.

He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts
tying it around him like a diaper.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the baby)
			This is Joe Namath's old number, you know.
			You could get a lot of chicks with this.
			Just don't pee in it.

						DANA
			Peter, what about the bathtub?

						VENKMAN
				 (grabs the phone and dials)
			We'll take care of that.
				 (on the phone)
			Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right
			away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one --
			tried to eat the kid.

						DANA
			It was full of this awful pink ooze.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Ray)
			Sounds like another slime job ... No,
			they're all right.  They're here now ...
			Right ... Let me know.

He hangs up.

						VENKMAN
			They're going over there right now.  You
			might as well make yourself at home.  Let
			me show you around.
				 (he crosses to the kitchen area)
			This is the cuisine de maison --

It's an incredible mess. The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the
counters are littered with all sorts of food trash.  He grabs a big open
Hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.

						VENKMAN
				 (looking at the sink)
			We may have to wash some of these if you get
			hungry --
				 (he looks in the fridge)
			-- but there's no food anyway so forget
			about it.  I have all kinds of carry-out
			menus if you feel like ordering.

He opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then
crosses to the bathroom.

						VENKMAN
			Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy
			up a few things.

						DANA
			Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have
			to do any of this, you know.

He goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING, the TOILET FLUSHING
and more items going into the Hefty bag.

						VENKMAN (O.S.)
			The shower works but it's a little tricky.
			They're both marked "Hot."  It takes a little
			practice, but at least this one won't try
			and eat you.

He comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his
shoulder.

						VENKMAN
			Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter.
			But the bed's good and I just changed the
			sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In
			fact, I think you should definitely plan on
			spending the night here.

						DANA
			Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping
			arrangements?

						VENKMAN
			For me it's best if I sleep on my side and
			you spoon up right behind me with your arms
			around me.  If we go the other way I'm
			afraid your hair will be getting in my face
			all night.

						DANA
			How about you on the sofa and me in bed with
			the baby.

						VENKMAN
			Or we could do that.

						DANA
			Thank you.
				 (she picks up Oscar)
			Poor baby.  I think I should put him down
			now.

						VENKMAN
			I'll put him down for you.
				 (taking the baby)
			You are way too short!  And your belly-button
			sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to
			your poor mother!

Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living
room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.

EXT.  MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

Venkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and
Stantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.

						VENKMAN
			Did you find anything at Dana's?

						STANTZ
			Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in
			and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up
			some interesting stuff on this Vigo character
			you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the
			Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,
			Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:

						SPENGLER
				 (reads from xerox of entry)
			"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"

						VENKMAN
			A hundred and five years?  He really hung
			on, didn't he.

						STANTZ
			And he didn't die of old age either.  He was
			poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,
			disemboweled, drawn and quartered.

						WINSTON
			I guess he wasn't too popular at the end
			there.

						SPENGLER
			No, not exactly a man of the people.
				 (reads)
			"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the
			Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the
			Unholy."

						STANTZ
			This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in
			all the Black Arts, and listen to this
			prophecy.  Just before his head died, his
			last words were, "Death is but a door, time
			is but a window.  I'll be back."

						VENKMAN
			That's it?  "I'll be back?"

						SPENGLER
			It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.

They enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.

Rudy the guard looks up in surprise as the Ghostbusters enter.

						RUDY
			Hey, Dr. Venkman.  What's going on?

						VENKMAN
			We're just going up to Restorations for a
			minute.

						RUDY
			Oh, I can't let you do that.  Mr. Poha told
			me not to let you up there anymore.

						VENKMAN
				 (with mock seriousness)
			Okay, we were trying to keep this quiet but
			I think you can be trusted.  Tell him, Ray.

						STANTZ
				 (very official)
			Mister, you have an Ecto-paritic,
			subfusionary flux in this building.

						RUDY
			We got a flux?

						WINSTON
			You got a flux and a half.

						STANTZ
			Now if you don't want to be the --
				 (he counts)
			-- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock
			from a planar rift, I suggest you get down
			behind that desk and don't move until we
			give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."

Rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters
head upstairs.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Janosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter.  He
rushes over and stops them at the door.

						JANOSZ
			Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.

						VENKMAN
			I know.

						JANOSZ
			Then why have you come?

						VENKMAN
			We got a major creep alert and we're just
			going down the list.  Your name was first.

						STANTZ
				 (to Spengler and Winston)
			Let's sweep it, boys.

They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Janosz)
			You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you
			from, Johnny?

						JANOSZ
				 (nervous)
			The Upper West Side.

						SPENGLER
				 (consulting his PKE meter)
			This entire room is extremely hot, Peter.

						JANOSZ
			What exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman?

						VENKMAN
			We'll know when we find it.  You just sit
			tight.  This won't take long.

STANTZ

Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to
the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio.  Venkman
comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels.

						VENKMAN
			This is the one that looked at Dana.

						JANOSZ
			It must be the chemical fumes in the studio.
			People start imagining things --

						VENKMAN
				 (interrupts)
			I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing
			theory.  If she says it looked at her, it
			looked at her.
				 (to Vigo)
			Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking
			to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking
			to you.

They watch the painting for any sign of movement.

VIGO

His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.

STANTZ AND VENKMAN

Venkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Vigo)
			Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby.
			Just have fun with it.
				 (to Stantz)
			Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish
			up and get out of here.

						STANTZ
			I'll get one more reading.

Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting.  Stantz scans
the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.

VIGO

His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul.

STANTZ

He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle
transformation occurs within him.  Winston comes up behind him and breaks
the spell.

						WINSTON
				 (looking at the painting)
			Now that's one ugly dude.

						STANTZ
				 (coming back to his senses)
			Huh?  What?

						WINSTON
			You finished here?

						STANTZ
				 (distracted)
			What?  Yeah.

						WINSTON
			Are you all right?  You coming down with
			something?

						STANTZ
			No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for
			a second there.  Let's go.

They head for the door.

JANOSZ

He escorts the Ghostbusters to the door.

						JANOSZ
			So you see, everything is in order, is it
			not?

						VENKMAN
			Not.  Don't leave town and report any change
			in your address to the proper authorities.
			We'll be back.

They exit.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)

The Ghostbusters cross to ECTO-2.

						SPENGLER
			There's definitely something going on in
			that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus
			and the Giga-meter was showing all red.

						WINSTON
			I'd put my money on that Vigo character.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, that's a safe bet.
				 (to Stantz)
			You and Spengman see what else you can dig
			up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha.
			Those two were made for each other.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (LATER)

The Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse.  Stantz is at the
wheel.  His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense.  Stantz
swerves suddenly and HONKS the horn angrily.

						STANTZ
				 (to another driver)
			Idiot!
				 (honking)
			Move it, you jerk!

Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks.

EXT.  STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously
through traffic.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Winston looks at Ray, concerned.

						WINSTON
			Going a little fast, aren't we, Ray?

Stantz turns on him.

						STANTZ
				 (viciously)
			Are you telling me how to drive?

						WINSTON
			No, I just thought --

						STANTZ
			Well don't think!

He HONKS again and tromps hard on the accelerator.

EXT.  STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Ecto-2 is now barreling down the avenue.  Pedestrians leap to safety as
Stantz runs a red light.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

They hang on to the safety straps as Stantz continues his maniacal ride.

						WINSTON
				 (to Stantz, really worried
				 now)
			Are you crazy, man?  You're going to kill
			somebody!

Stantz looks at him and smile demonically.

						STANTZ
			No, I'm going to kill everybody!

He swerves off the road.

EXT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The car heads right for a big tree.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

At the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel
and steps across to stomp on the brakes.

EXT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The car skids into the tree and stops.  The Ghostbusters stumble out
dazed and shaken, but unhurt.  Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the
others, completely at a loss.

						STANTZ
				 (himself again)
			What happened?

						VENKMAN
			You just picked up three penalty points on
			your driver's license.

						WINSTON
			Are you all right?

						STANTZ
			Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest
			thing.  I knew what I was doing but I
			couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling
			came over me and -- I don't know -- I just
			felt like driving into that tree and ending
			it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.

They inspect the damage to the car.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially, to
				 Spengler)
			Watch him, Egon.  Don't even let him shave.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER)

There's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman
enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small
suitcase of Dana's.

						VENKMAN
				 (calls out)
			I'm home!

He looks around the large open loft.

						VENKMAN
				 (to himself)
			I knew it.  She cleaned.

He hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom.  The door is
half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through
the transparent vinyl curtain.  He closes the bathroom door and looks at
the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling
off.  Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the
bathroom wrapped in a towel.  She jumps back into the bathroom.

She comes out again, this time wearing a robe.

						VENKMAN
			Are you all squeaky clean now?

						DANA
				 (humoring him)
			Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything
			at my apartment?

She squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.

						VENKMAN
				 (through the door)
			Nothing.  They stayed there all night, went
			through your personal stuff, made a bunch of
			long-distance phone calls and cleaned out
			your refrigerator.  And didn't find anything.

Dana opens the bedroom door.

						DANA
			They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub
			... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do
			I do now?

						VENKMAN
			Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a
			babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you
			need it.

						DANA
			I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar
			in a strange place with someone I don't know.

						VENKMAN
			It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's
			one of my most valuable employees.

						DANA
			Does she know anything about babies?

						VENKMAN
			Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?
				 (handing her the flowers)
			Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your
			clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I
			brought along some interesting possibilities.

						DANA
			Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.

She smiles and closes the door again.  He opens the closet and starts
looking for his good suit.

						VENKMAN
			Did you happen to see some shirts on the
			floor in here?

						DANA (O.S.)
			I put them in your hamper.  I thought they
			were dirty.

						VENKMAN
				 (shaking his head)
			I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first,
			okay.  I have more than two grades of
			laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels
			between clean and dirty.

He pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them.

						VENKMAN
			These aren't so bad yet.  You just hang them
			up for a while and they're fine.

												 CUT TO:
INT.  FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING

Janine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights.
Then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs.  She starts
primping and freshening up her makeup.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME

Louis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once
and for all.  He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband.

						LOUIS
				 (to himself)
			Okay, Stinky, this is it.  Showdown time.
			You and me, pal.  You think you're smarter
			than I am?  We'll see about that.
				 (loud)
			Oh, hello, Pizza Man!  Oh, two larges!  I
			only ordered one.  Oh, pepperoni and
			pineapple.  My absolute favorite.  I guess
			I'll have to eat these both by myself.

THE CEILING

Slimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging
upside down.

LOUIS

He spots Slimer through the rearview mirror.

						LOUIS
				 (quietly)
			Okay, let's boogie!

He whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a
gash across the ceiling.

THE STAIRS

Janine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and
strikes the wall behind her.  Slimer disappears.

						LOUIS
				 (embarrassed and apologetic)
			Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do
			that.  It was an accident.

						JANINE
			What are you doing up here?

						LOUIS
			I was trying to get that smelly green thing.
			The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the
			fifth Ghostbuster.

						JANINE
			Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if
			you're already an accountant?

						LOUIS
			Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls
			in sick or gets hurt.

Louis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down.

						JANINE
			Have you made any plans yet?  You know
			tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

						LOUIS
			No, I celebrate at the beginning of my
			corporate tax year which is March first.
			That way I beat the crowds.

						JANINE
			That's very practical.  I hate going out on
			New Year's Eve, too.

There is an awkward silence between them and Janine starts to leave.

						JANINE
			Well, good night, Louis.

						LOUIS
				 (on an impulse)
			Janine, do you feel like maybe getting
			something to eat on the way home?

						JANINE
			I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd
			babysit.
				 (seductively)
			Do you want to babysit with me?

						LOUIS
			Oh, sure, that sounds great.

They exit.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)

There is a KNOCK at the door and Venkman goes to answer it.  He's dressed
for the evening and looking very dapper.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman opens the door and finds Stantz, Spengler and Winston standing
there wearing over-the-hip rubberized waders, firemen's slickers, and
miners' helmets, carrying tons of sensing devices, meters, collection
jars and photographic equipment.  They look like they're rigged out for a
major spelunking expedition.

						VENKMAN
				 (ushering them in)
			Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat
			barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?

						STANTZ
			We're going down into the sewer system to
			see if we can trace the source of the
			psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you
			might want to come along.

						VENKMAN
			Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going.
			I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.

						SPENGLER
			You know, animals and lower life forms often
			anticipate major disasters.  Given the new
			magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous
			breeding surge in the cockroach population.

						VENKMAN
			Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.
				 (calls out)
			Dana?  The boys are going down under the
			sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon
			thinks there might even be some kind of big
			roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about
			dinner and go with them instead?

Dana steps into the living room looking very beautiful.

						STANTZ
			Wow.

Dana looks curiously at their outfits.

						DANA
			Hi.

They nod and wave back.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Ray and Egon)
			I think we're going to have to pass on the
			sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find
			out.

						STANTZ
				 (on his exit)
			Okay, but you're missing all the fun.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (LATER)

Stantz, Spengler and Winston come down the stairs into the station,
guided by a very old map of the underground city.

						STANTZ
			This is it.  Van Horne Station.  Right where
			the old transit map said it would be.

They cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime.

						STANTZ
			Let's get a sounding on the depth of that
			flow.

Stantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of
it attached to his utility belt.

						STANTZ
			Stand back.

He takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and
casts it out into the middle of the flow.  The plumb bob sinks and
Spengler reads the depth.

						SPENGLER
			Six feet -- seven -- eight --

						STANTZ
			That's it.  It's on the bottom.

						SPENGLER
			Nine feet -- ten --

						WINSTON
			Is the line sinking?

						SPENGLER
			No, the slime is rising.

Stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the
platform and around his boots.

						STANTZ
				 (alarmed)
			Let's get out of here, boys.

He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck.

Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger
than all three of them.  As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and
closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his
belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt.  Spengler lets go in time
but Winston doesn't.  He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow.
Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in
after him.

INT.  ARMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)

Dana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling
caviar and toasting with very expensive champagne.

						VENKMAN
				 (very intimate)
			Here's to -- us.

She sighs and drinks.

						VENKMAN
			So -- are you making any New Year's
			resolutions?

						DANA
			I want to stop getting involved with men who
			aren't good for me.

						VENKMAN
			Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow,
			or could you hold off for a few days maybe?

						DANA
			For one night in your life, do you think
			it's possible for us to be completely real?

						VENKMAN
			All right, you want to be real?  So tell me
			why did you dump me?

						DANA
			Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had
			to protect myself.  You really weren't very
			good for me, you know.

						VENKMAN
			I'm not even good for me.

						DANA
			Why do you say things like that?  You're so
			much better than you know.

						VENKMAN
			Thank you.  If I had that kind of support
			on a daily basis, I could definitely shape
			up by the turn of the century.

						DANA
				 (already feeling the
				 effects of the champagne)
			So why don't you give me a jingle in the
			year 2000?

						VENKMAN
			Let me jingle you right now.

He leans over to kiss her.

						DANA
			Maybe I should call Janine.

						VENKMAN
			Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way
			with children.

They kiss.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Janine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby.

						JANINE
				 (looking around)
			I can't believe a person could actually live
			like this.

						LOUIS
				 (to the baby)
			So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in
			a small mining operation and then one day a
			beautiful princess came to live with them.

						JANINE
			It's really not a bad place.  It just needs
			a woman's touch.

						LOUIS
				 (continuing)
			So they bartered room and board in exchange
			for housekeeping services, which was a good
			deal for all of them because then they didn't
			have to withhold tax and social security,
			which I'm not saying is right but it's just
			a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can
			finish this later if you're tired.

Louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down.

						JANINE
			You're really good with children, Louis.  I
			can tell.
				 (as he returns)
			Why don't you come here and sit with me?

						LOUIS
			Okay.

He sits stiffly beside her on the sofa.

						JANINE
				 (getting close)
			Motherhood is a very natural instinct for
			me.  I'd like to have a baby myself.
			Wouldn't you?

						LOUIS
				 (gulps)
			Tonight?

EXT.  STREET - MANHOLE COVER - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

A manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below.  It slides away,
and Winston crawls out of the manhole followed by Stantz and Spengler.
They are exhausted and covered with slime.

						WINSTON
				 (uncharacteristically
				 angry)
			Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to
			do -- drown me?

						STANTZ
				 (unusually mean)
			Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were
			too stupid to drop that line.

						WINSTON
				 (shoves him)
			You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll
			punch your lights out.

						STANTZ
			Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead
			and try it.

Spengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression.

						SPENGLER
			If you two are looking for a fight, you got
			one.
				 (putting up his fists)
			Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me,
			sucker.

						STANTZ
				 (squaring off)
			Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had
			it with you.

They grab each other and start to tussle.  Suddenly Spengler comes to his
senses and pulls them apart.

						SPENGLER
				 (forcefully)
			Strip!  Right now!  Get out of those clothes!

He starts yanking off his slicker and waders.  Bewildered, Stantz and
Winston start doing the same.  Spengler helps pull off their clothes and
throws them into the open manhole.  Now wearing only long underwear, they
seem to return to normal.

						WINSTON
			What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill
			you.

						STANTZ
			Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff
			is like pure, concentrated evil.

Stantz looks around and sees that they are standing right in front of the
museum.

						SPENGLER
			And it's all flowing right to this spot.

			Can I help you?

Stantz looks around and spots Venkman.

						STANTZ
			That's all right, I see him.

They blow right by the Maitre d' who jumps back in horror as they pass.

VENKMAN

He's just about to pour more champagne when he sees Ray, Egon and Winston
coming toward him through the restaurant.

						STANTZ
				 (very excited)
			You should've been there, Venkman.
			Absolutely incredible!

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, sorry I missed it.
				 (noting their attire)
			I guess you guys didn't know about the dress
			code here.  It's really kind of a coat and
			tie place.

						STANTZ
			It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under
			it actually.

						WINSTON
			Rivers of the stuff!

						SPENGLER
			And it's all flowing toward the museum.

He gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and
lands on a well-dressed diner.

						STANTZ
				 (calls out)
			Sorry!

						DANA
			Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.

Venkman notes the look of alarm on Dana's face and pulls his colleagues
aside.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially)
			Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights.
			Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?

						SPENGLER
				 (to Venkman)
			This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman.
			It's hot and it's ready to pop.

MAITRE D'

He hurries through the restaurant with two city COPS right behind him and
makes straight for Venkman's table.

						MAITRE D'
			Arrest these men.

						COP
				 (recognizing them)
			Hey!  It's the Ghostbusters.  You're out of
			uniform, gentlemen

Stantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look.

						STANTZ
				 (self-conscious)
			Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but
			forget that.  We have to see the mayor as
			soon as possible.

						COP
			Look, Doc, why don't you just go home.
			You'll get a good night's sleep and then you
			can give the mayor a call in the morning.
			Come on.

He takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists.

						STANTZ
			We're not going anywhere with you.  I told
			you we have to see the mayor now.

						COP
				 (grabbing Stantz)
			I'm warning you.  You can come along
			peaceably or --

						VENKMAN
				 (grabs the Cop)
			Hey, don't be an idiot.  This is serious.

						COP
				 (angry)
			Look, pal, keep this up and you're going
			with them.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, yeah?

						COP
				 (has had enough)
			Yeah, let's go.  You're all under arrest.

The Cop catches Venkman in an armlock and starts walking him out of the
restaurant.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Dana)
			Finish your dessert -- it's already paid
			for.  I'll call you.

They all exit, causing a major commotion among the other diners.

EXT.  ARMAND'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The police car is parked right behind Ecto-2.  Spengler stops at the

						SPENGLER
			Look, we're not drunk and we're not crazy.
			This is a matter of vital importance.

Venkman steps in and looks at the policemen's nametags.

						COP
			What are you doing?

						VENKMAN
			I just want to get your names right for when

Dana frowns.

						DANA
			Is everything all right with Oscar?

						JANINE
			Oh, he's fine.  He's such a good baby.  He

at 88th Street and disappears into an underground entrance.  The CAMERA
PANS UP to reveal Gracie Mansion, the residence of the Mayor of New York
City.

INT.  GRACIE MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

The Ghostbusters, now wearing police raincoats over their longjohns are
ushered through the house by a butler to a set of double oak doors.  The
butler knocks lightly, then opens the door to reveal the MAYOR sitting in
front of the fireplace in his well-appointed private study, flanked by
Jack Hardemeyer, both in tuxedoes.  The Ghostbusters enter.

INT.  STUDY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The Mayor is impatient and a little angry at having been pulled out of
his formal reception.  He frowns at their bizarre attire.

						MAYOR
			All right -- the Ghostbusters.  I'll tell
			you right now; I've got two hundred of the
			heaviest campaign contributors in the city
			out there eating bad roast chicken waiting
			for me to give the speech of my life.
			You've got two minutes.  Make it good.

						STANTZ
			You get enough negative energy flowing in a
			dense environment like Manhattan, it starts
			to build up, and if we don't do something
			fast this whole place will blow like a frog
			on a hotplate.

						WINSTON
			Tell him about the toaster.

						VENKMAN
			I don't think he's ready for the toaster.

						MAYOR
				 (shaking his head)
			Being miserable and treating other people
			like dirt is every New Yorker's God-given
			right.  What am I supposed to do -- go on
			television and tell eight million people
			they have to be nice to each other?  I'm
			sorry, none of this makes any sense to me,
			and if anything does happen we've got plenty
			of paid professionals to deal with it.  Your
			two minutes are up.  Good night, gentlemen.

The mayor exits, leaving the Ghostbusters to Hardemeyer.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (smirking)
			That's quite a story.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, I think the Times might be interested,
			don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun
			with it, too.

Hardemeyer's eyes go cold and calculating.

						HARDEMEYER
			Before you go running to the newspapers with
			this, would you consider telling this slime
			thing to some people downtown?

						VENKMAN
			Now you're talking.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT (LATER)

An attendant opens a locked door with a wire mesh window and the
Ghostbusters, in straitjackets, are led into the psych ward as Hardemeyer
confers with the chief PSYCHIATRIST.

						WINSTON
				 (protesting)
			I'm telling you, we're not crazy.  He is!

HARDEMEYER

He laughs off the remark.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (to the Psychiatrist)
			The mayor wants them kept under strict
			observation for a few days.  We think
			they're seriously disturbed and potentially
			dangerous.

						PSYCHIATRIST
			We'll do whatever's necessary.

Hardemeyer shakes his hand and exits as the door slams shut on the
Ghostbusters.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Louis and Janine are watching an old rerun on TV, eating popcorn, while
Dana is stretched out on the other sofa.

						DANA
				 (wishing they'd leave)
			You know you really don't have to stay.
			Peter should be back soon.

						LOUIS
			Oh no, we don't mind.

She hears a little CRY from the nursery and sits up.

						DANA
			Excuse me.  I think Oscar is up.

She crosses to the bedroom.

INT.  VENKMAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Dana enters and immediately notices that the crib is empty and the window
is open.

						DANA
				 (screams)
			Louis!

Frantic now, Dana rushes to the window and looks out, as Louis and Janine
come running in.

EXT.  WINDOW LEDGE - DANA'S POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)

The baby is standing out on the ledge at the corner of the building,
fifty feet above the street, staring off into the distance as if he's
waiting for something.

EXT.  WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Dana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby.
Then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes.

LOUIS AND JANINE

They lean out the window, gaping at the apparition.

EXT.  VENKMAN'S LEDGE - APPARITION

A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling
on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground.  Her face looks
remarkably like Janosz Poha's.  The nanny extends her hand to the BABY
who GURGLES sweetly as he reaches out to take it.

DANA

She watches in helpless horror.

						DANA
				 (screams)
			No!!

GHOST NANNY

She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and
smiles at Dana.  The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny
shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby.

DANA

She watches the creature fly off with Oscar, then climbs back through
the window assisted by Louis and Janine.

						DANA
				 (resolutely)
			Louis, you have to find Peter and tell him
			what happened.

						LOUIS
				 (confused and worried)
			Where're you going?

						DANA
			To get my baby back.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (A LITTLE LATER)

A taxi pulls up, Dana jumps out and rushes into the museum.  The moment
the door closes behind her, there is a loud THUNDERCLAP, the ground
trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of
the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the
building.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  PARKVIEW PSYCHIATRIC - PADDED ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are in a padded cell.  They are
handcuffed and the cuffs are chained to thick leather belts around their
waists.  Venkman stands there banging his head into the padded wall
while the others try to explain the situation to a skeptical
Psychiatrist.

						STANTZ
			We think the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian
			is alive in a painting at the Manhattan
			Museum.

						PSYCHIATRIST
			I see. And are there any other paintings in
			the museum with bad spirits in them?

						SPENGLER
				 (impatient)
			You're wasting valuable time!  We have reason
			to believe that Vigo is drawing strength from
			a psychomagnetheric slime flow that's been
			collecting under the city.

						PSYCHIATRIST
			Yes, tell me about the slime.

						WINSTON
			It's potent stuff.  We made a toaster dance
			with it, then a bathtub tried to eat his
			friend's baby.

The psychiatrist looks at Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			Don't look at me.  I think they're nuts.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  MUSEUM RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Moonlight streams through the skylight above, bathing the studio in
eerie white light.  Oscar is lying safely on a table in front of the
painting of Vigo.  Dana enters cautiously and sees the baby.  Seeing no
one else about, she quickly sneaks down to the table and picks up the
baby, hugging hin tight, greatly relieved to find him unharmed and
intact.

						JANOSZ (O.S.)
			I knew you would come.

Startled, Dana turns at the sound of his voice as Janosz steps out from
behind the Vigo painting.

						DANA
				 (defiantly)
			What do you want with my baby?

						JANOSZ
			No harm will come to the child.  You might
			even say it's a privilege.  He will be the
			vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you --
			well, you will be the mother of the ruler
			of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?

						DANA
			If this is what the world will be like, I
			don't want to live in it.

						JANOSZ
				 (confidentially, indicating
				 Vigo)
			I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.

						DANA
			Everybody has a choice.

						JANOSZ
			Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look.
			That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there.
			He's Vigo!

						DANA
			I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my
			baby.

Dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly Oscar flies out of her arms,
floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle.

DANA

She turns and looks at Vigo, for the first time feeling his power.

						JANOSZ
			You will see.  It's all for the best.

INT.  PARKVIEW PSYCHIATRIC WARD - DAY (SAME TIME)

The Ghostbusters are sitting in the dayroom, a dingy lounge for patients
in the locked ward.  There is a television set, a Ping-Pong table and a
few tables and chairs.  Stantz is looking at the sky through the heavy
wire mesh covering the windows.

						STANTZ
			This is it. boys.  It's starting.  Shit-storm
			2000.

Venkman is doing occupational therapy, weaving on a little hand-loom.

						VENKMAN
			It better not start yet.  I'm trying to
			finish my potholder before lunch.

						WINSTON
			You think all those predictions about the
			world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?

A PATIENT at the next table joins the discussion.

				 (with certainty)
			1997.  My dog told me.

						VENKMAN
			What kind of dog?

			Labrador.

						LOUIS
			Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this
			for me.  I'm begging you.

						SHERMAN
			I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I
			could lose my license.

						LOUIS
			Why can't you just have them released?
			You're a doctor.

						SHERMAN
			I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders
			on the psych ward.

						LOUIS
			Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.

						SHERMAN
			Like what?

						LOUIS
			I got you out of those bad tax shelters.

						SHERMAN
			You were the one who got me in.

						LOUIS
			I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she
			put out, didn't she?

						SHERMAN
			Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion
			for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get
			in a lot of trouble.

						LOUIS
			I'm telling you, we're all going to be in
			big trouble if we don't do something fast.
			That ghost guy came and took my friend's
			baby and we got to get it back.  It's just

						SHERMAN
			Then you should go to the police.  I don't

Sherman looks out the window.

EXT.  SKY - SHERMAN'S POV

The sky begins to go dark as the sun is magically eclipsed.

With the Plaza Hotel in the background, the fountain starts to spout
psycho-reactive slime.

HOTEL ENTRANCE

A well-heeled MAN and WOMAN step out of a limousine and walk up the steps
toward the revolving door.  She looks up at the sky and frowns.

						WOMAN
				 (shrewish)
			I told you we should have stayed in Palm
			Beach.  The weather here gets stranger every
			year.

						MAN
			Yes, dear.

She doesn't notice it, but a small amount of slime falls on the back of
her luxurious, full-length, white mink coat.  The doorman nods
courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs.

WOMAN

She yelps in pain.

						WOMAN
				 (to the doorman)
			Something just bit me!

The doorman looks curiously at her, then recoils in shock as her coat
comes alive.  MINK HEADS pop out of the thick fur, SNARLING, BARKING and
YAPPING, their sharp, little teeth biting the air.  Reacting quickly, the
doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and
starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror.
The coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street.

						LIEUTENANT

EXT.  PIER 34 - THEIR POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)

The name "R.M.S. Titanic" is clearly visible on the side of the huge

While he's talking, the Ghostbusters jump in the Ectomobile and drive
off, leaving him and Louis standing at the curb.

			Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.

EXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)(LATER)

ECTO-2 pulls to the curb across the street from the museum.  Hundreds of
spectators are already there gawking at the building as the Ghostbusters
jump out and gape at the sight that greets them.

EXT.  MUSEUM THEIR POV - BUILDING

The building is now totally covered in a shell of psycho-reactive slime.
CITY WORKMEN and FIREMEN are trying to cut their way in with blowtorches,
jackhammers, power tools and the "jaws of life," but they can't even make
a dent.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They size up the situation as they don their proton packs.

						STANTZ
			It looks like a giant Jello mold.

						VENKMAN
			I hate Jello.

They stride manfully across the street and approach the main entrance to
the museum.

						STANTZ
				 (to the Fire Captain)
			Okay, give it a rest, Captain.  We'll take
			it from here.

						FIRE CAPTAIN
				 (skeptical)
			Be my guest.  We been cutting here for three
			hours.  What the hell's going on?  You know
			the Titanic arrived this morning?

						VENKMAN
			Well, better late than never.

The workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the
Ghostbusters draw their particle throwers.

						SPENGLER
				 (monitoring valences)
			Full neutronas, maser assist.

They adjust their settings and prepare to fire.

						STANTZ
			Throw 'em!

They trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building
with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the firemen)
			Okay, who knows "Cumbaya?"

A few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands.  Venkman
grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum.

						VENKMAN
			All right.  Nice and sweet --
				 (starts singing)
			Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya --

Stantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding
hands and swaying to the music.

						ALL
				 (singing)
			Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Cumbaya, milord,
			cumbaya, Oh, Lord, cumbaya.

Stantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra-goggles and finds that
they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime.

						STANTZ
			Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't
			get through this stuff.

						VENKMAN
			Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say
			supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?

						SPENGLER
			It won't work.  There's no way we could
			generate enough positive energy to crack
			that shell.

						STANTZ
			I can't believe things have gotten so bad
			in this city that there's no way back.
			Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy.
			And there are too many people who'd just as
			soon step on your face as look at you.  But
			there've got to be a few sparks of sweet
			humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We
			just have to mobilize it.

						SPENGLER
			We need something that everyone can get
			behind, a symbol --

His eyes fall on ECTO-2's New York State license plate which features a
line drawing of the Statue of Liberty.

						STANTZ
				 (he sees it, too)
			Something that appeals to the best in each
			and every one of us --

						SPENGLER
			Something good --

						VENKMAN
			And pure --

						WINSTON
			And decent.

EXT.  THE STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

There is a commotion among the crowd as the Mayor's limousine arrives
with a police escort.  Jack Hardemeyer steps out followed by the Mayor
himself and they cross to the museum entrance.

Hardemeyer, his ASSISTANT and several police BODYGUARDS confront the
Ghostbusters.

						HARDEMEYER
			Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff
			together, get back in that clown car and get
			out of here.  This is a city matter and
			everything's under control.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for
			you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law
			in there and he's got my girlfriend and her
			kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when
			you're partying uptown, this guy's going to
			come to life and start doing amateur head
			transplants.  And that's just round one.

						MAYOR
			Are you telling me there're people trapped
			in there?

						HARDEMEYER
				 (to his assistant)
			This is dynamite.  Call A.P., U.P.I., and
			C.N.N. and get them down here right away.
			When the police bring this kid out I want
			them to hand it right to the mayor and I
			want it all on camera.

						STANTZ
			Mr. Mayor, if we don't do something by
			midnight, you're going to go down in history
			as the man who let New York get sucked down
			into the tenth level of hell.

The Mayor stops to consider the situation.

						MAYOR
				 (to the Fire Captain)
			Can you get into that museum?

						FIRE CAPTAIN
			If I had a nuclear warhead, maybe.

The Mayor turns to Venkman.

						MAYOR
			You know why all these things are happening?

						VENKMAN
			We tried to tell you last night, but Mr.
			Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony
			bin.

Hardemeyer flips out.

						HARDEMEYER
			This is preposterous!  You can't seriously
			believe all this mumbo-jumbo!  It's the
			Twentieth Century, for crying out loud!
				 (viciously, to Venkman)
			Look, mister, I don't know what this stuff
			is or how you got it all over the museum,
			but you better get it off and I mean right
			now!

He pounds the wall of slime with his fist, and they all watch in
amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily
through the slime curtain.  Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the
slime.

						MAYOR
				 (to Venkman)
			Okay, just tell me what you need.

EXT.  LIBERTY ISLAND (NEW YORK HARBOR) - NIGHT

With the city skyline in the b.g., the Ghostbusters prepare their
equipment.  Each of them dons a makeshift backpack consisting of tanks,
hoses, nozzles and an abundance of gauges, valves and regulators.
Venkman looks up at the Statue of Liberty looming above them.

						VENKMAN
			Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

						WINSTON
			Wonder what?

						VENKMAN
			If she's naked under that toga.  She's
			French, you know.

						SPENGLER
			There's nothing under that toga but 300 tons

Stantz is looking worried.

Spengler and Winston are busy assembling hundreds of wires connected to
various relays on the interior surface of the statue.  Venkman and Stantz
are mounting large auditorium loudspeakers near the top of the staircase.
They finish the installation, then Stantz dons one of the new backpacks
and gives the order.

			Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really

statue.

STANTZ

He plugs the main cable lead into a transformer.

						STANTZ
			It's all yours, Pete.
				 (checks his watch)
			There's not much time left.

Venkman plugs the speaker cable into a Walkman and gives a downbeat.

						VENKMAN

He hits "Play" on the Walkman and "HIGHER AND HIGHER" BOOMS from the huge
SPEAKERS, amplified by the statue's vast hollow interior.

The head of the statue lurches suddenly, but the Ghostbusters cling to
the rail and manage to keep their feet.

			perks that come with being the mother of a
			living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us
			a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car
			and free parking.

						DANA
			I hate and despise you and everything you
			stand for with all my heart and soul.  I
			could never forgive what you've done to me
			and my child.

						JANOSZ
			Many marriages begin with a certain amount
			of distance, but after a while I believe we
			could learn to love each other.  Think about
			it.

						DANA
			I'd rather not.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

People are jammed together shoulder to shoulder filling Times Square,
watching the big Seiko clock count down the last ten minutes to midnight.
Suddenly, they look down Broadway and see a magnificent sight.

EXT.  BROADWAY - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The Statue of Liberty is walking up Broadway approaching 42nd Street,
with "Higher and Higher" BOOMING from the SPEAKERS inside.  A great cheer
goes up, and the crowd goes wild with joy, dancing and singing along with
the MUSIC.

INT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Spengler reads the Giga-meter.

						SPENGLER
			It's working.  The positive GeV's are
			climbing.

						VENKMAN
				 (patting the Statue)
			They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT (LATER)

The avenue has been closed to traffic and barricades placed, blocking all
the side streets.  A squadron of police motorcycles comes speeding around
the corner at 72nd Street and proceeds up Fifth Avenue in the direction
of the museum.  Then MUSIC is heard BOOMING in the distance, the ground
shakes and the Statue of Liberty comes walking around the corner onto
Fifth Avenue followed by a wildly cheering throng.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The Ghostbusters can see the museum ahead.

						VENKMAN
			So far so good.

						SPENGLER
				 (worried)
			I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her
			to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.

						STANTZ
			I don't think they make Nikes in her size.

						VENKMAN
			We're almost there, Lib.
				 (to Stantz)
			Step on it.

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The Statue's huge foot comes down and squashes a car.

INT.  OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The Ghostbusters look down at the flattened car.

						STANTZ
				 (shouts out the window)
			My Fault!

						VENKMAN
				 (shouts)
			She's new in town.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - SAME TIME

Janosz is painting the last of the mystical symbols on the baby's chest.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

The people still in the square start counting off the last ten seconds to
midnight and the New Year.

						CROWD
				 (chanting)
			Ten .. nine ... eight ... seven ...

												 CUT TO:

INT.  MUSEUM - PAINTING - NIGHT

A strange light spreads over the painting.  As the light moves onto his
face, Vigo spreads his arms wide and his upper body starts to emerge from
the canvas.

						VIGO
			Soon my life begins.  Then woe to the weak,
			all power to me, the world is mine.

INT.  MUSEUM - JANOSZ - NIGHT

The baby's body begins to glow as Vigo reaches out for it.  Then suddenly
a dark shadow falls across the skylight.  Janosz looks up.

INT.  MUSEUM - JANOSZ'S POV - SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

The Statue of Liberty is looming over the skylight looking down on Janosz
with an expression of righteous anger on it's face.

EXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Kneeling beside the museum, the statue draws back it's mighty right arm
and smashes the skylight with its torch.

INT.  RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Janosz retreats from the shower of broken glass as the Ghostbusters come
sliding down ropes into the studio and confront Janosz with their new
weapons.  Quick as a flash, Dana seizes the moment, dashes across the
studio and snatches the baby from Vigo's outstretched arms.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Janosz)
			Happy New Year.

INT.  MUSEUM - VIGO PAINTING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Vigo bellows in rage.

INT.  MUSEUM - STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Janosz steps in front of the painting.

						SPENGLER
			Hi there.  Feel free to try something stupid.

Janosz sneers, trusting the invincibility of Vigo.

						JANOSZ
			You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare
			to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't
			you realize what you are dealing with?  He's
			Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to
			him.

						VENKMAN
				 (sighs)
			Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.

With that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from
head to toe, blowing him into the corner.  Then they turn to Vigo.

VIGO

He is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the
knees down.  He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash
his magic powers.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been
neutralized by the good will of the people.

						STANTZ
			Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad
			little monkey.

						VENKMAN
			The whole city's together on this one.  We
			took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you
			know.

						WINSTON
				 (arming his slime-blower)
			Say goodnight now.

Suddenly Vigo grabs Stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield.

						SPENGLER
			Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!

						STANTZ
				 (strangling)
			Do it!  Just do it!

Winston fires and hoses both Vigo and Ray.

VIGO

He bellows and drops Ray, then falls back into the painting.

INT.  MUSEUM - PAINTING - NIGHT

The paint turns liquid, melts off the canvas and runs onto the floor
revealing another painting underneath it.

INT.  MUSEUM - GHOSTBUSTERS - NIGHT (AFTER BATTLE)

Venkman, Spengler and Winston rush over to Ray and kneel beside him.  He
is completely covered with slime and motionless.

						SPENGLER
				 (examining him)
			He's breathing.

Winston wipes the slime off Ray's face and Ray opens his eyes.

						WINSTON
			Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?

						STANTZ
				 (smiles lovingly)
			Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, no.  We've got to live with this?

They pull him to his feet.

						STANTZ
			I love you guys.  You're the best friends
			I've ever had.

He hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well.  Venkman recoils
in disgust.

						VENKMAN
			Hey, I just had this suit cleaned.
				 (indicating Janosz)
			Take care of the wiggler, will you.

Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby.  She hugs Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			What is this -- a love in?
				 (notes the symbols painted
				 on the baby's body)
			Hey, sailor.  I think the tattoos are a
			little much, don't you?

He picks up the baby.

						DANA
				 (to Venkman)
			I think he likes you.  I think I do too.

						VENKMAN
			Finally came to your senses, huh?

They hug and kiss.

SPENGLER, WINSTON AND STANTZ

They help Janosz to his feet.  He's dazed but unhurt.

						JANOSZ
				 (restored to normalcy)
			What happened?

						STANTZ
				 (calmly)
			Sir, you had a violent, prolonged,
			transformative psychic episode.  But it's
			over now.  Want a coffee?

						JANOSZ
				 (extremely nice)
			That's very kind of you.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Stantz)
			He's fine, Ray.  Physically intact,
			psychomagnetherically neutral.

						JANOSZ
			Is that good?

						WINSTON
			It's where you want to be.

As they exit they stop to examine the painting that was concealed by
Vigo's self-portrait.

						SPENGLER
			Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or
			Brunelleschi.

						WINSTON
				 (staring at it)
			There's something very familiar about this
			painting.

INT.  MUSEUM - NEW PAINTING - NIGHT

It's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four
archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby.  One holds a harp,
one, an olive branch, the third, a book, and the last, a sword.  Most
remarkably, their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to Venkman, Stantz,
Spengler and Winston.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

A city bus pulls up near the museum and Louis steps off.  He waves his
thanks to Slimer who is behind the wheel.

						LOUIS
				 (to Slimer)
			Okay, so Monday night we'll get something
			to eat and maybe go bowling?  Can you bowl
			with those little arms?

SLIMER GRUNTS and SLOBBERS a reply, flexing his scrawny biceps.

						LOUIS
			Okay, I have to go save Dana.  I'll see you
			later.

												 CUT TO:

EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT (LITTLE LATER)

The Ghostbusters are greeted by wild cheering and applause as they come
out the main entrance with Dana and the baby.  Everybody starts singing
"Auld Lang Syne."  Louis picks his way through the celebrating crowd and
finds the Ghostbusters.

						LOUIS
			Am I too late?

						STANTZ
			No, you're right on time.

Stantz pops the cork on a bottle of champagne and hands it to him.

EXT.  MUSEUM ENTRANCE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Hardemeyer staggers out of the museum covered in slime.  He looks at the
celebrating crowd and his eyes fill with tears.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (weepy)
			Happy New Year, everybody!

He joins in on "Auld Lang Syne."

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT (LATER)

The Statue of Liberty is sprawled inert on her back in the park behind
the museum, her toga up over her knees.  The Mayor looks nearly suicidal.
The Ghostbusters stand beside him commiserating.

						VENKMAN
			She's all right.  She's just sleeping it off.

						MAYOR
				 (stricken)
			We just had it restored.

						VENKMAN
			This probably isn't a good time to bring
			this up, but the last time we did a job for
			the city you stiffed us.

						STANTZ
				 (handing the Mayor an
				 invoice)
			This is a bill for tonight's job.

The Mayor looks at it and gasps at the amount.

						MAYOR
			What!  This is way too much.
				 (hands the bill back to
				 Venkman)
			We won't pay.

Venkman looks at the Statue.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Stantz)
			I think she looks pretty good here, don't
			you?

						STANTZ
			Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.

Realizing he has no alternative, the Mayor sighs and takes the bill back.

				MAYOR
		All right, all right.  If you can wait until
		Monday I'll issue you a check.

				SPENGLER
		Sorry.  No checks.  Company policy.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY (WEEKS LATER)

The sun is shining brightly and Liberty is back on her pedestal where she
belongs.  The Mayor and a host of officials are commemorating her return.
The Ghostbusters, Dana, Janine and Louis are there as honored guests.

				VENKMAN
			(looking up at the statue)
		Pretty impressive, huh?

				SPENGLER
			(musing)
		It's probably the first thing my
		grandparents saw when they came to this
		country.

				VENKMAN
		From where -- Neptune?

				SPENGLER
		They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.

				VENKMAN
		Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.

				STANTZ
			(in a similarly reflective
			mood)
		My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still
		have the pictures they took of the statue
		from the boat when they arrived.

				VENKMAN
		Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to
		America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I
		recall.  How about you, Winston?

						WINSTON
			My people weren't taking any pictures from
			those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't
			any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome
			them, either.  What are you, Dana?

						VENKMAN
			Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here
			since the year 12.

						DANA
			That's not true.  It was 1620.

						VENKMAN
			Same difference.

						STANTZ
			What's your story, Pete?

						VENKMAN
			Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish,
			some German, some French, Dutch -- the women
			in my family slept around.  And that's what
			made this country great.

						DANA
			That's a terrible thing to say.

						VENKMAN
			So what?  It's a free country.
				 (looking up at the Statue)
			Thanks, Lib.

They all look up at the Statue.

EXT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - HEAD OF STATUE - DAY

Slimer flies out one of the observation windows, THEME MUSIC KICKS IN and
the CAMERA PULLS UP and AWAY FROM the island TO a HIGH SHOT of the
Statue, lower Manhattan and the shining sea beyond.

											FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT.  FOREST - DAY

Germania.  The far reaches of the Roman Empire.

Winter 180 A.D.

Incongruously enough, the first sound we hear is a
beautiful tenor voice.  Singing.  A boy's voice.

CREDITS as we hear the haunting song float through dense
forests.  We finally come to a rough, muddy road slashing
through the forest.  On the road a GERMAN PEASANT FATHER
is herding along three sickly looking cows.  His two SONS
are with him.  His youngest son sits on one of the cows
and sings a soft, plaintive song.

They become aware of another sound behind them on the road
-- the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather.  The
Father immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the
road.  They stand-still, eyes down:  the familiar posture
of subjugated peoples throughout history.

A wagon train rumbles past them.  Three ornate wagons
followed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily-armed
PRAETORIAN GUARDS.

The young boy dares to glance up at the passing Romans.
His eyes burn with hatred.

INT.  WAGON - DAY

Mist momentarily obscures a man's face.  Frozen breath.
The man is in his 20's, imperious and handsome.  He is
swathed in fur, only his face exposed.  He is COMMODUS.

He glances up.

					COMMODUS
		Do you think he's really dying?

The woman across from him returns his gaze evenly.  She is
slightly older, beautiful and patrician.  A formidable
woman.

She is LUCILLA.

					LUCILLA
		He's been dying for ten years.

					COMMODUS
		I think he's really dying this time.

A beat.  Their breath turns instantly to mist.

					COMMODUS
		He has to be bled every night now.

					LUCILLA
		How do you know that?

					COMMODUS
		I've been so informed.

She arches an eyebrow.

					COMMODUS
		If he weren't really dying he
		wouldn't have sent for us.

					LUCILLA
			(a smile)
		Maybe he just misses us.

					COMMODUS
		And the Senators.  He wouldn't have
		summoned them if --

					LUCILLA
		Peace, Commodus.  After two weeks on
		the road your incessant scheming is
		hurting my head.

A beat.

					COMMODUS
		The first thing I shall do is honor
		him with games worthy of his
		majesty.

					LUCILLA
		The first thing I shall do is have a
		hot bath.

The wagon rumbles to a halt.  Voices are heard outside.

Commodus leaps out...

EXT.  WAGON - OUTPOST - DAY

Three Roman SOLDIERS guard an outpost, a watchtower, on
the roadside.

					COMMODUS
		Why have we stopped?

					PRAETORIAN GUARD MEMBER
		We're here, sir.

					COMMODUS
			(to Soldier #1)
		Where is my father?

					SOLDIER #1
		He's at the front, sir.

					COMMODUS
		Is the battle won?

					SOLDIER #1
		Don't know, sir.  They've been gone
		for eight days.

Commodus tosses off his furs -- beneath them he wears a
beautiful set of Lorica Segmentata -- the traditional
formed armor of Rome.  He moves to a horse as:

					COMMODUS
			(to Soldier #1)
		My sister wants a bath, take her to
		the camp.
			(to Soldier #2)
		Take me to my father.

He leaps onto the horse and canters back to the Praetorian
Guard unit.

Soldier #2 climbs on his horse and leads them.  Commodus
rides off with most of the Praetorian Guard unit.

Lucilla peeks her head from the wagon.  She glances at the
remaining soldiers.  Distinctly unpromising.

					LUCILLA
			(dry)
		Civilization at last.  Gods preserve
		us.

EXT.  HILL - TWILIGHT

The mighty catapults dwarf the humans.  Soldiers from the
elite Felix Regiment -- a legion of the Roman Army -- haul
the monstrous machines up a hill.

The commanding General of the Felix Regiment, MAXIMUS,
walks between two of the catapults.  He is a striking and
intense man in his 30's.  Like all the soldiers who
surround him, he is caked with mud and exhausted.

He trudges up the hill with his two lieutenants, TITUS and
QUINTUS.

					TITUS
		You would do as well to read the
		mind of a rhinoceros.

					QUINTUS
		These barbarians would rather drown
		in blood than yield an inch.  If I
		didn't hate them so much I would
		admire them.

They have reached the top of the hill.  Stunning martial
preparations are underway.  The catapults join ten others.
Archers are taking up position.  Brutal "Scorpions" --
devices for firing multiple crossbow bolts -- are being
loaded.  Soldiers are also loading the catapults with
enormous "Greek fire pots" -- large, round terra cotta
pots.

Maximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop.
Below them they can see a German encampment.

					TITUS
		They simply will not surrender.

A beat as Maximus gazes down at the German position.

					MAXIMUS
			(quietly)
		A people should know when they are
		conquered.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		At the first signal release the
		catapults.  We'll use the cavalry to
		cut off the retreat.

					QUINTUS
		General, I don't recommend that.
		Our cavalry might be caught in the
		flames.

					MAXIMUS
		I hope not, because I'm going to be
		leading them.

A beat as he gazes down at the enemy.

					MAXIMUS
		Why don't they know they're already
		dead?

EXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT

Maximus and Titus are on their horses, the cavalry of two
hundred Felix Regiment warriors surrounds them.  Steam
flares from their horses' nostrils.  They wait in a thick
stand of trees -- the German position can be seen across a
muddy plain.

A large wolf -- "The Wolf of Rome" -- waits at Maximus'
side.

Maximus nods to an archer.  The archer lights the tip of
an arrow and sends it flaming into the night sky.

EXT.  HILLTOP - TWILIGHT

Quintus waits.  The catapults are loaded and waiting.  So
too the Scorpions.  So too the 200 archers of the Felix
Regiment.

He sees the flaming arrow flying up from below.

					QUINTUS
		Now!

The mighty catapults are released.  The Greek fire pots
arc dramatically through the air.  A moment later soldiers
release the Scorpions and hundreds of bolts streak through
the sky.  The archers fire a murderous barrage of flaming
arrows.

EXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT

The screaming is almost immediate.

Maximus and his cavalry watch as the fire pots crash down
into the German encampment.

EXT.  GERMAN CAMP - TWILIGHT

The fire pots shatter -- pitch splashes everywhere --
seconds later the bolts and flaming arrows slice down and
ignite the pitch -- FLAME EXPLODES -- it is a hellish,
napalm-like vision -- the conflagration illuminating the
twilight.

The deadly rain of flaming arrows spreads terror through
the German camp --

EXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT

Maximus watches the German camp.

					MAXIMUS
			(to his men)
		Hold steady... steady...

He can see the nightmare destruction of the encampment
continuing -- fire pots and Scorpion bolts and flaming
arrows -- panic in the German encampment.

					MAXIMUS
		Steady...

He sees the Germans begin fleeing across the plain.  He
quickly raises his sword and whispers a prayer, then turns
to his men:

					MAXIMUS
		Brothers -- I salute you!  For Rome!

He spurs his horse and races out of the trees to the
plain...

EXT.  PLAIN - BATTLEGROUND - TWILIGHT

Maximus leads the terrifying and relentless cavalry charge
-- Titus at his side -- the Felix Regiment screams out
fearsome war cries as they gallop across the muddy plain
toward the Germans --

Fire pots and flaming arrows are crashing down everywhere
around them --

The cavalry SLAMS into the Germans at full gallop --

It is carnage.

The Felix Regiment warriors slash ruthlessly with short
swords -- slicing a path of sheer destruction through the
Germans -- but the Germans fight with equal brutality --
and the Germans also fight with the desperation of a
hopeless last chance -- they pull and spear Roman soldiers
off horses whenever they can --

Maximus spins his horse and swings his sword with expert
efficiency -- a spear stabs through the neck of his horse
and it immediately collapses forward --

Maximus sails over the horse's head and crashes to the
muddy ground -- he jumps up and is in the midst of the
battle --

The flaming arrows and exploding fire pots create a
ferocious inferno everywhere around the battle -- the
flames silhouetting the fighting --

On the ground, Maximus proves his absolute worth as a
warrior -- he hacks and dodges -- ghastly images of true
ancient warfare -- Maximus' eyes burn with a zealous fire
as he fights for his life --

He finds he is momentarily at a terrible disadvantage --
Germans are surrounding him from all sides -- as he fights
he looks for an advantage -- for his soldiers -- for
anything -- he is doomed --

Then -- an almost mystical image -- Maximus' wolf leaps
through a wall of flame --

"The Wolf of Rome" savages several Germans around Maximus
-- giving him the help he needed.

The wolf and his master fight, side-by-side.

EXT.  HILLTOP - TWILIGHT

We see an old man's face, staring down at the battle.  The
face is weather-beaten, ailing.  The roaring flames from
the battlefield below flicker in his sad eyes.

MARCUS AURELIUS, the Emperor of Rome, is on a horse.  A
metal brace extends from the back of his saddle.  He is
strapped to the brace with thick, leather straps.

He watches as the Felix Regiment below concludes the
battle.  The cheering of the Regiment can be heard as the
final, isolated pockets of Germans are cut down.

Behind Marcus the sun is setting, painting the world blood
red.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - SUNSET

Maximus, bloody and spent, walks through the aftermath of
the carnage.  The Wolf of Rome is at his side.  Dead and
dying by the hundreds are scattered everywhere.  Roman
surgeons are attending to the wounded.

Marcus walks to him, embraces him warmly.

					MAXIMUS
		Caesar.

					MARCUS
		Maximus, you prove your valor again.
		Let us hope for the final time here.

					MAXIMUS
		I don't think there's anyone left to
		fight.

					MARCUS
		There are always people left to
		fight...

Marcus takes Maximus' arm and they walk through the masses
of bodies.  Maximus holds Marcus' arm firmly, quietly
supporting him as they walk.

					MARCUS
		But this night, at least, Germania
		is at last defeated... What will you
		do now, my friend?

					MAXIMUS
		Should Caesar permit, I'll go home.
		I've been away too long.  I've
		forgotten my wife's face and I
		barely know my son.

Suddenly, a tethered GERMAN PRISONER they are passing
calls out to them:

					GERMAN PRISONER
		THIS BLOOD MEANS NOTHING, CONQUEROR!

Maximus and Marcus stop.  A soldier moves quickly to
silence the German Prisoner.

					MARCUS
			(to Soldier)
		Stop...
			(to Prisoner)
		... You speak our language?

					GERMAN PRISONER
		You have been in my homeland for
		twelve years.  Of course I speak
		your language.  So did my son, who
		you murdered.  So did my daughter,
		who you raped.

					MAXIMUS
			(to Marcus)
		Come, Caesar...

					MARCUS
		No.  Let him speak...
			(to Prisoner)
		... I am Rome, what would you say to
		me?

					GERMAN PRISONER
			(points to sunset)
		You are that sun, Rome, and your
		time is over... You can slit a
		thousand throats here, and you can
		put a thousand babies to the sword,
		but it will always be our home.

					MARCUS
		Now it is Rome.

					GERMAN PRISONER
		It will never be Rome.  Not as long
		as one German breathes.

The soldier moves to kill the insolent Prisoner.

					MARCUS
		No... Release him.  Give him safe
		passage.  Let him go to his family.

The soldier leads the German Prisoner away.

Maximus and Marcus continue walking in silence for a beat.
Then:

					MARCUS
		Tell me again, Maximus, why are we
		here?

					MAXIMUS
		For the glory of the empire, sire.

					MARCUS
			(quietly)
		Yes.  I remember.

They continue walking through the mountains of bodies...

EXT.  ROAD - SUNSET

Maximus and Marcus are now walking along a road through
the dense forest.  Slaves follow behind them, leading
their horses.

Both sides of the road are filled with the men of the
Felix Regiment.  As Maximus and Marcus pass, the battered
and bloody soldiers drag themselves to their feet, raising
their swords, paying silent homage.

					MAXIMUS
		They honor you, Caesar.

					MARCUS
		I don't think they're standing for
		me, Maximus.  They honor you.

Just then Commodus canters into view with his Praetorian
Guard escort.  He watches the army honor Maximus with rank
envy as he nears.

He rides up to Maximus and Marcus.

					COMMODUS
		Have I missed it?

He leaps from his horse.

					COMMODUS
		Have I missed the battle?

					MARCUS
		You've missed the war.  We're done
		here.

Commodus embraces him, awkward.

					COMMODUS
		Father.  Congratulations.  I shall
		sacrifice a thousand doves to honor
		your triumph.

					MARCUS
		Spare the doves and honor Maximus,
		he won the battle.

Commodus embraces Maximus, even more awkward.

					COMMODUS
		General, Rome salutes you and I
		embrace you as a brother.

					MAXIMUS
		Highness.

They walk, Maximus still supporting Marcus, as:

					COMMODUS
		Your Spaniards seem invincible.  May
		the Gods favor the Felix Regiment
		now and always...
			(to his father)
		Here, Father, take my arm.

					MARCUS
			(ignores this)
		Where's your sister?

					COMMODUS
		She's at the camp.  She had no
		desire to see the gore of the
		battlefield.

					MARCUS
			(smiles)
		Lucilla would eat every corpse here
		if it brought her one step closer to
		the throne.

Maximus laughs.

					MAXIMUS
			(smiles)
		Caesar, you do the lady injustice.

					MARCUS
		It's a foolish old cobra who doesn't
		recognize his own off-spring...
			(he suddenly stops,
			not feeling well)
		I think... I should ride now.

Maximus waves for Marcus' horse.  It is brought up.
Several soldiers carefully help the old man into the
saddle.  He is then tethered to the brace on his saddle.
It is a slow, graceful and embarrassing ordeal for the
Emperor of Rome.

When at last he is strapped in, he looks to Maximus.

					MARCUS
		So much for the glory of Rome.

Without a word to his son, Marcus nods and the horse is
slowly lead away.

Commodus and Maximus watch him go.

					COMMODUS
			(neutral)
		He's dying.

A beat.

					COMMODUS
		Poor old man.

					MAXIMUS
			(terse)
		If you'll excuse me, Highness.

He turns and stalks away.

EXT.  TENT CITY - NIGHT

We see the Roman encampment, a sea of tents.  Hundreds of
campfires burn before the tents.

INT.  HOSPITAL TENT - NIGHT

Maximus enters a large tent and is met by a spectacle of
the dead and dying.  Roman surgeons are working feverishly
to save lives.  Limbs are amputated, the bloody stumps
quickly cauterized with hot irons.  Leeches and bronze
cups are employed for blood-letting to balance "humours."

Anesthesia as we know it is nonexistent.  Wine amphoras
are passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward
the patients.  Mostly, though, they just hold down the
writhing patients.

Maximus moves through the tent, offering a word of comfort
here and there.  All the wounded are delighted to see him.

He goes to an older soldier, GALLUS, who has one wooden
hand.  His other hand is bandaged.

					MAXIMUS
		What, Gallus, losing your other
		hand?

					GALLUS
		Aye, General, they're going to make
		a bronze one for it.  Long fingers
		this time.

					MAXIMUS
		And the women of your village will
		crave your touch even more.

					GALLUS
		Ah, then you know the women of my
		village.

Maximus smiles and moves on.

He stops at a young soldier, VALERIUS, whose head has been
shaved.  A hole has been bored into his skull to relieve
the pressure on his brain.  The young soldier is dying.

					MAXIMUS
		What's your name, son?

					VALERIUS
		Valerius, General.

					MAXIMUS
		The name suits you.

					VALERIUS
		Why am I dying?

A beat.  Maximus sits by his cot.  He takes Valerius'
hand.

					MAXIMUS
		You're dying because you love Rome,
		as I do.

					VALERIUS
		I've never been to Rome.

					MAXIMUS
		Neither have I.  Rome for us lives
		here...
			(he touches his
			heart)
		... it's a thing inside us that came
		from our ancestors and that we give
		to our children.

					VALERIUS
		It must be glorious, Rome.  I've
		only seen pictures.  Is it a
		glorious place?

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		Yes, it's a glorious place.

					VALERIUS
		It must be.

He smiles.  And he is dead.

Maximus sits for a moment.  He gently closes Valerius'
eyes.  And Maximus finds that he is weeping.

He is not ashamed of the tears.

INT.  MESS TENT - NIGHT

An immediate swirl of noise.  The grand mess tent is
crowded with soldiers.  They are still filthy with caked-
on mud and blood.  Wounds are bandaged and tankards are
raised in celebration of the victory.

Marcus sits in a central position and receives visitors.
Currently two Senators, FALCO and GAIUS, are bowing before
him.

					FALCO
		Hail, Marcus Aurelius.

					MARCUS
		Stand up, Senators.  That unfamiliar
		posture doesn't suit you.

					GAIUS
		We live in supplication to your
		glory.

					MARCUS
		All the while conspiring with that
		fat man in Rome.  How is the old
		monster?

					GAIUS
		Senator Gracchus is hale, sire.

					MARCUS
		Still damning me to the four winds?

					GAIUS
		Still eager for your triumphant
		return to Rome, Caesar.

					MARCUS
		I would have silenced him decades
		ago -- but I just like him too much.

Meanwhile, Maximus stands with his lieutenants, Titus and
Quintus.  A wound on Maximus' arm has been bound.

					MAXIMUS
			(to Titus)
		If you want to stay on, I support
		you.  So do the men.  I'll ask the
		Emperor to appoint you in my place.

					TITUS
		It won't be the Felix Regiment
		without you.

					MAXIMUS
		I'll return after a season at home.
		Maybe two.

					QUINTUS
		That means after three or four more
		babies.

					TITUS
		And you'll be too fat from Vibia's
		cooking to get on your horse by
		then.

					MAXIMUS
		Should the Gods so bless me.  I
		would be thankful.

Commodus perambulates up to them.

					COMMODUS
		Hail, warriors.  My congratulations.

					TITUS AND QUINTUS
			(bowing)
		Highness.

					COMMODUS
			(to Maximus)
		My old friend, my father tells me
		you're returning to Spain?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					COMMODUS
		A pity.  I'll need men like you in
		my army...

An awkward glance between the soldiers.  This sort of talk
is offensively premature.

					COMMODUS
		There are larger division that might
		appeal to you.  Even the Praetorian
		Guard.  You've never been to Rome.
		Imagine arriving as head of the
		Praetorians!  They have really
		splendid uniforms.

					MAXIMUS
			(cold)
		I'm going home.

Senators Gaius and Falco join them.

					GAIUS
			(to Maximus)
		... And why not apply for entry to
		the Senate?

					FALCO
		A war hero with a handsome face and
		a strong heart could go far.

					COMMODUS
		General Maximus, may I present
		Senators Gaius and Falco.  Beware of
		this Gaius, he'll pour a honeyed
		potion in your ear and you'll wake
		up one day and all you'll say is
		"Republic, Republic, Republic..."

Laughter.

					FALCO
		Have you never considered Rome?

					MAXIMUS
		No.

					COMMODUS
		You've had my ear since we were
		children.  You could be a valuable
		ally in the Senate.

					GAIUS
		Are you a believer in Republicanism?

					COMMODUS
			(laughs)
		There -- I warned you.

					MAXIMUS
		I'm a soldier, not a politician.

Meanwhile, a dark eye is studying the men through a hidden
slit in the tent wall.  The eye is particularly drawn to
Maximus.

					GAIUS
		If your heart lies with the people,
		I would back you for the Senate.
		I'm sure Gracchus would as well.

					COMMODUS
		Not a word about that sodomite
		bastard.

					GAIUS
			(smiles to Maximus)
		The august Senator Gracchus has been
		rather a gadfly on the flesh of the
		imperial family.

					FALCO
		He's a damned provocateur.

					GAIUS
		He lives under the antiquated
		assumption that the Senate should
		represent the people with vigor.

					COMMODUS
		I won't tolerate it.  His incessant
		criticism exhausts me.  The man can
		speak for five hours without taking
		a breath.

					GAIUS
		He serves Rome best when he serves
		it with honesty.

					COMMODUS
			(sharply)
		Enough... Maximus, I would like to
		inspect the Felix Regiment at dawn.
		Please arrange it.

					MAXIMUS
		I can't do that.

					COMMODUS
		Excuse me?

					MAXIMUS
		My men have been fighting for five
		solid days.  They're too busy dying
		to go on dress parade.

A beat.  Commodus' eyes flash fire at this public rebuke.
He very quickly gets control.

					COMMODUS
			(smiles)
		Of course, how foolish of me.  Some
		other time...

He notes his father being helped out of the tent by
several body slaves.

					COMMODUS
		Caesar retires early tonight.

INT.  TENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Marcus is helped out of the mess tent into a tent corridor
attached.

He sees his daughter Lucilla in the corridor, spying in
through the slit in the tent wall.  He watches her,
smiles.

					MARCUS
		If only you had been born a man...

She turns to him.  He leaves his body slaves and goes to
her.

					LUCILLA
		Father.

					MARCUS
		What a Caesar you would have made.

					LUCILLA
		You're right.

					MARCUS
		I think you would have been strong.
		I wonder if you would have been
		just?

					LUCILLA
		I would have been what you taught me
		to be.

A beat.  They stare at each other.  He finally smiles.

					MARCUS
		Well, pretend to be my loving
		daughter tonight and walk with me to
		my chamber.

She smiles and takes his arm.  They slowly walk down the
tent corridor as:

					MARCUS
		This is a pleasant fiction, isn't
		it?

They disappear into darkness.

EXT.  TENT CITY - DAWN

Maximus is slogging through the mud and snow that blankets
the Rome camp.  He stops to observe an unusual sight.

Commodus is stripped almost naked, his chiseled body
covered in a fine sheen of sweat.  He and his six
CENTURION BODY GUARDS are going through their daily
ritual.  They defy the sub-zero temperatures and hack at
small trees with swords.

It is an eerie, zen-like workout.  Commodus' intense
concentration is unnerving.

Maximus watches for a moment then moves on.  He approaches
a large network of tents.  He enters.

INT.  MARCUS' TENT - DAY

Maximus enters Marcus' darkened tent.  Flickering braziers
provide the only light in the enormous Imperial tent.
Heavy beams support the canopy and they creak like the
timbers of a ship as the tent sways slightly in the wind.

Marcus stands before a map of the Roman Empire.

					MAXIMUS
			(bows)
		Caesar.

Marcus holds out a scroll.

					MARCUS
		Read this.

					MAXIMUS
		I never acquired the art, sir.

					MARCUS
		Of course.  No matter.  In this
		letter I denote my intention to
		nominate you to stand for the
		Emperorship after my death.

A stunned pause.  Maximus stares at him.

					MARCUS
		My son is not a moral man.  You have
		known this since you were young.  He
		cannot rule.

					MAXIMUS
		Caesar, I am honored but --

					MARCUS
		For twenty years I have been
		spilling blood.  For twenty years I
		have written philosophy and
		ruminated and conquered.  Since I
		became Caesar I have only had four
		years without war.  Four years of
		peace in twenty.  So perhaps I can
		be... forgiven.

A long beat.

					MARCUS
		While I have been fighting, Rome has
		grown mad and corpulent and
		diseased.  I did this.  And now I
		shall make it right.

					MAXIMUS
		Sire, you brought the light of the
		Gods to barbarian darkness.  You
		brought civilization and justice to
		the farthest --

					MARCUS
			(fierce)
		I have brought the sword -- nothing
		more!  Rome is far away and we
		shouldn't be here.  What matter is
		it to the Gods if we subdue one more
		tribe of Parthians or Gauls?  What
		matter is it to Rome if a thousand
		more barbarians bend to our lash?

A beat.

Marcus sits.  He doesn't look at Maximus.

A pause.

					MARCUS
		Winter, Maximus.  It's winter now...

A beat.

					MARCUS
		There was a dream that was Rome.  I
		can only whisper of it now.
		Anything more than a whisper and the
		dream vanishes.  It's so... fragile.
		The true glory of Rome is in a very
		fragile idea.  Imagine a place
		devoted to the rights of the
		citizen.  Where every free man has a
		voice.  That was the dream... And I
		fear it will not survive the winter.

He holds out a hand to Maximus.  Maximus takes his hand,
deeply moved, kneeling.

					MARCUS
		Let's just whisper here, you and I.

					MAXIMUS
		Yes, Caesar.

					MARCUS
		If the dream is ever to live again
		the people must have a true voice.
		The voice I took from them.  That
		all the Caesars took from them, bit
		by bit, conquest by conquest.  And
		now that I am dying I am going to
		give them that voice again.

					MAXIMUS
		You're not dying.

					MARCUS
		I am, Maximus.  It's strange... I
		find as I near the end I think
		little of the waning moments around
		me... instead I think much of the
		past... and of the future.  How will
		the world speak my name in years to
		come?  Will I be known as the
		philosopher?  The warrior?  The
		tyrant?  Or will there be a more
		golden sounding to my name?  Will I
		be the Emperor who gave Rome back
		her freedom?

A beat.

					MARCUS
		Before I die I will give the people
		this final gift.  I will give them
		the Senate reborn.  The voice of the
		people empowered again, as it was
		always meant to be.  It is my design
		that they will elect the next
		Emperor.  And I would put forward
		your name with my backing.

					MAXIMUS
		Caesar, you do me honor -- but your
		son has pride of place for
		succession.

					MARCUS
		You are the son I should have had...
		Although I fear in my deepest heart
		that if you had truly been my son my
		blood would have polluted you as it
		did Commodus.  We're a cursed
		bloodline.  We have lived so long in
		power and depravity that we no
		longer remember a life without it.
		We can no longer even imagine a life
		without it.

A beat.

					MARCUS
		Look at me, son.

Maximus looks at him.

					MARCUS
		Son... I know that one grove of your
		vineyard is worth more to you than
		all the treasures of Rome.  I know
		one loving word from your wife is
		worth more than the accolades of an
		Empire.  But... a fond old man, who
		loves you more than he can say, begs
		you to at least think about what he
		has said tonight.

					MAXIMUS
		I shall, Caesar.

A beat.

					MARCUS
		I'll keep this letter to myself.  I
		hope that with the sunrise you will
		agree.  And embrace me as a father.

Maximus nods and rises.  He begins to go.  Stops.

					MAXIMUS
		You have always been my father.

He goes.

INT.  TENT CORRIDOR - DAY

Maximus emerges from Marcus' tent into a long tent
corridor, deep in thought.

					LUCILLA'S VOICE
		He always favored you...

He turns.  Lucilla is waiting.  She glides to him.

					LUCILLA
		Even over his son.

					MAXIMUS
			(turning away)
		That's not true.

					LUCILLA
		Maximus, stop...
			(he stops)
		Let me see your face.

He turns to her.

					LUCILLA
		You've been crying.

					MAXIMUS
		I lost too many men.

					LUCILLA
		What does my father intend?

He turns and walks.  She walks with him.

					MAXIMUS
		I don't know.

					LUCILLA
		You're lying.  I could tell when you
		were lying even when we were
		children.  You hate it.

					MAXIMUS
		I never acquired your comfort with
		it.

					LUCILLA
		True.  But then you never had to.
		Maximus, stop...
			(he stops again)
		... Is it really so terrible seeing
		me again?

					MAXIMUS
		No.  I'm sorry.  I'm tired from the
		battle.

					LUCILLA
		And you are hurt to see my father
		dying.

A beat.

					LUCILLA
		He will announce Commodus'
		succession.  That's why he summoned
		us.  Will you serve my brother as
		you served his father?

					MAXIMUS
		I will always serve the ideals of
		Rome.

A beat.

					LUCILLA
		Do you know I still remember you in
		my prayers...?  Oh yes, I pray...
		Ever since that day you saved me
		from drowning off Capri.  Do you
		remember?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					LUCILLA
		Commodus was so angry that a mere
		peasant -- a Spaniard no less --
		touched the royal person, do you
		remember his anger?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					LUCILLA
		Mark this, Maximus:  that is the man
		who will be Emperor.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		May I be permitted to go, Highness?

She smiles sadly.

					LUCILLA
		There was a time when you didn't
		call me "Highness."

					MAXIMUS
		And there was a time when you were
		just a little girl drowning in the
		sea.  All that was a different life.

					LUCILLA
			(quietly)
		Very different... I wonder if it was
		better?

					MAXIMUS
		It was more honest.

A moment between them.  We sense there is much to be said,
much that could be said.

Finally:

					MAXIMUS
		I thank you for your prayers.

He goes.  She watches him walk away.

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT

Maximus kneels before a small altar in his tent.  He faces
six small figures that represent his dead ancestors.

					MAXIMUS
		Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you
		for your guidance.  Bring me your
		solace and your wisdom.  Blessed
		Mother, come to me in my dreams with
		the Gods' desire for my future.
		Blessed Father, watch over my wife
		and my son with a ready sword.  Keep
		them safe until my return.  Whisper
		to them in their sleep that I live
		only to hold them again and all else
		is dust and air.  Ancestors, true
		bloodline, I honor you and will try
		to live with the dignity you have
		taught me.

He looks at his "ancestors" for a moment and then blows
out the candles around them.

INT.  MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT

Commodus' eyes are red with weeping.  He sits, head down,
at the foot of Marcus' bed and speaks to his father.

					COMMODUS
			(quietly)
		I search the faces of the Gods for
		ways to please you... to make you
		proud... and I can never do it.  One
		kind word -- one full hug where you
		pressed me to your chest and held me
		tight -- would have been like the
		sun on my heart for a thousand
		years... What is it in me you hate
		so much?  My eyes are your eyes.  My
		hands are your hands.  All I have
		ever wanted was to live up to you.
		Caesar.  Father.

He stands.  We see that he is holding the scroll denoting
Marcus' intention to nominate Maximus as Emperor to the
Senate.  Commodus cannot control his tears.

					COMMODUS
		Why does Maximus deserve what I
		could never have? -- Why do you love
		his eyes over mine? -- I would
		butcher the whole world -- if you
		would only love me...

Commodus weeps.

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT

Quintus is waking Maximus --

					QUINTUS
		General -- Maximus --

					MAXIMUS
		Quintus -- ?

					QUINTUS
		The Emperor needs you.  It's urgent.

Maximus leaps up and throws on a cloak, strides out with
Quintus...

EXT.  TENT CITY - NIGHT

Dead of night.  Maximus and Quintus stride quickly through
the sleeping camp toward Marcus' tent.

					MAXIMUS
		What is it?  Is he ill?

					QUINTUS
		I don't know...

They continue on toward Marcus' tent.

INT.  MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT

Maximus and Quintus stride into the tent -- Maximus slams
to a halt.  Stunned.

Commodus stands before him.  Lucilla stands in a corner of
the tent, head down.

And Marcus Aurelius dead, lying on his bed.

Maximus stares at Marcus.

					COMMODUS
		Lament with me, brother, our great
		father is dead.  I want --

Maximus, not even hearing, steps past him to Marcus.

He stands for a moment and then slowly kneels before
Marcus and gently kisses the old man's forehead.  A ritual
farewell.

A moment of silent mourning and then Maximus stands.  He
turns very, very slowly to Commodus.

					COMMODUS
		General, the Gods' have taken the
		great man and left me alone.  My
		first desire as Emperor is that you
		take my hand in friendship.  I need
		you at my side, Maximus, at this
		moment above all others.  Stand with
		me.

Maximus glares at him:

					MAXIMUS
		How did he die?

Commodus does not respond.

					MAXIMUS
		How did he die?

					COMMODUS
		The surgeons say it was his breath
		that gave out.

Maximus glances to Lucilla, she avoids his eyes.

					COMMODUS
		Take my hand, Maximus.  I only offer
		it once.

A beat.

Maximus turns back to Marcus.

					MAXIMUS
		How will the world speak your name
		now, old man?

Without a glance to Commodus, he stalks out.

A silent beat.  Then Commodus nods to Quintus.  Quintus
goes.

Lucilla looks at Commodus for a long moment, her face an
enigmatic tornado of complex emotions.

Then:

					LUCILLA
		Hail, Caesar.

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT

Maximus is kneeling before his ancestors, head down, his
fists clenched, praying.

Quintus and four Praetorian ASSASSINS suddenly burst in --
the assassins move immediately to bind Maximus -- swords
at his throat --

					MAXIMUS
		What -- ?!

					QUINTUS
			(ashamed)
		Please don't fight, Maximus --

					MAXIMUS
		Quintus --

Quintus goes to Maximus' armor, which hangs nearby, and
slowly removes his seal of office.

					QUINTUS
		I'm sorry, General, Caesar has
		spoken.

They pull Maximus out --

EXT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - TENT CITY - NIGHT

Five horses are waiting.

					MAXIMUS
		Quintus, what -- ?

					QUINTUS
			(anguish)
		I have no choice --

They are almost run over by a stern cohort of twenty
Praetorians who gallop past.  Maximus knows immediately
what this means.

					MAXIMUS
			(suddenly)
		My family?!

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		What about my family, Quintus?

					QUINTUS
			(quietly)
		They will greet you in the
		afterlife.

Maximus lunges at him -- the Praetorians subdue him --
slamming him with a sword hilt -- knocking him
unconscious.

					QUINTUS
			(quietly, to
			assassins)
		Take him as far as the sunrise and
		then kill him.

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN

The four Praetorian assassins lead Maximus along a road.
He sits slumped in his saddle, drained.

					ASSASSIN #1
		All right, this is far enough.

The three other assassins climb from their horses.
Assassin #2 pushes Maximus from his horse.  He falls to
the ground hard.

					ASSASSIN #1
		You two take him down there where no
		one will find him.

					ASSASSIN #3
		Come on, General...

Assassin #3 and Assassin #4 drag Maximus down a densely
forested hill along the road.  Maximus' hands are still
bound in front of him.  He seems totally lacking in any
resistance.

EXT.  FOREST - BELOW THE ROAD - DAWN

Maximus eyes the two assassins as they troop down the
hill away from the road, he notes their sparkling armor.
The armor of men who have never seen real battle.

					MAXIMUS
		Have you ever done this before?

					ASSASSIN #3
		What?

					MAXIMUS
		Killed a man with a sword?

					ASSASSIN #3
		Not like this, exactly... this is
		good, you can stop.

They stop.  They are far down the hill, out of sight of
the road.

					MAXIMUS
		It can be very messy -- you could
		get blood all over your armor.  You
		don't want to hack me up now.  You
		want one clean stroke.

					ASSASSIN #3
		Would you kneel, General?

Maximus kneels, his whole body secretly coiling.  Assassin
#3 stands over him as:

					MAXIMUS
		One good stroke -- you do know
		where, don't you?

					ASSASSIN #4
		Be quiet.

					MAXIMUS
		If you miss the spot there'll be
		blood everywhere.  Quite a spray.

					ASSASSINS #3
		All right, where?

					MAXIMUS
		Here -- you don't want to hit the
		vein on the neck --

Maximus points his bound hands at a spot on the back of
his neck.

					MAXIMUS
		Put the point of your sword here...
		you want one, good blow right at
		this spot --

Assassin #3 dutifully puts the point of his sword on the
spot on Maximus' neck.

A grave mistake.

Maximus instantly grabs the blade of the sword with his
hands and yanks it from Assassin #3 -- EXPLODING up -- his
hands are bleeding but he tosses the sword into the air
and catches it -- swings the sword with brutal efficiency
-- decapitating both assassins --

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN

On the road above, the other two Assassins are on their
horses, waiting.

They hear a quick yelp from below.  And then nothing.

Assassin #1 nods for Assassin #2 to check on the
execution.  Assassin #2 canters off the road and down the
hill...

EXT.  FOREST - BELOW THE ROAD - DAWN

Assassin #2 canters down the hillside.

He senses movement behind him -- spins around, drawing his
sword -- too late --

Maximus throws a sword -- it flashes through the air --
and into Assassin #2.

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN

Assassin #1 waits on his horse.  He hears the commotion
below -- spins his horse around just as Maximus bursts to
the road.  He stands with a sword.

Assassin #1 spurs his horse and gallops toward Maximus at
full speed -- Maximus crouches and prepares --

Assassin #1 and Maximus swirl together for an instant --
both slashing brutally --

Assassin #1 continues to gallop past Maximus.  He stops.
He looks down.  A wound in his stomach.  He falls off his
horse.  Dead.

Maximus has also been wounded -- a deep gash on his side.
He fights the pain as he moves toward the horses...

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAY

Maximus is galloping through the forest at lightning
speed, leading four horses behind him.  The gash in his
side bleeding.

EXT.  TENT CITY - DAY

A gloomy day.  Emperor Commodus stands before the
assembled Felix Regiment.

The soldiers are already uneasy.  They note Quintus
standing by Commodus, wearing Maximus' seal of office.
Where is Maximus?

					COMMODUS
		Even as the Gods curse this dark day
		with clouds, so too does the sun
		begin to shine forth on a promised
		tomorrow.  Even as we mourn the
		passing of our father, so too do we
		celebrate the coming of a bright,
		new age for Rome.  At my side,
		brothers, you shall pull fresh
		glories from the heavens.  At my
		side, brothers, you shall know the
		adoration of the Gods.  Doubly-dark
		is this day because my friend, your
		noble commander Maximus Meridas, has
		been called to Rome to deal with
		urgent matters of state...

Titus glances quickly to Gallus, whose hand is bandaged
from surgery.  They know this cannot be true.

					COMMODUS
		Until his promised return I
		appointed Quintus Domitian to serve
		in his stead.  I salute you,
		Legionnaires!

					QUINTUS
			(raising his sword)
		Hail, Caesar!

The Felix Regiment responds, many unsure.

					FELIX REGIMENT
		Hail, Caesar!

Commodus strides off and the Felix Regiment slowly
disbands, muttering to one another in confusion.

Titus and Gallus go to Quintus.

					TITUS
		Quintus, what is -- ?

					QUINTUS
			(firmly)
		Don't speak of it.  Never speak of
		it.

He stalks off.  Titus and Gallus, concerned, watch him
follow after Commodus.

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - DAY

Lucilla stands in Maximus' tent.  She looks around.  She
gently touches his Lorica Segmentata.  Her fingertips move
along the contours of his armor.  She tries to retain her
neutral demeanor.

She notes his "ancestors" on the small alter.

EXT.  HILLSIDE - NIGHT

Maximus continues to gallop, he is on a different horse.
He leads only two horses now.

EXT.  VINEYARD - DAY

Maximus' home in Spain is beautiful beyond measure.

We see verdant farmlands and vineyards and a spacious
house nestled amid gently rolling hills.

Maximus' eight-year-old SON is in a paddock playing with
his pony.  He stops, sees something.  Over a hill, he can
just glimpse a battle flag, approaching.

He screams with joy and runs toward the flag as he calls:

					MAXIMUS' SON
		MOTHER!  MOTHER!  FATHER'S HOME!

Maximus' WIFE emerges from the house, drying her hands on
a cloth and smiles.

Maximus' Son races toward the flag.  He can just see the
soldiers beginning to appear over the hill.  Not a Roman
Legion at all.  Twenty Praetorians canter over the hill.

Maximus' Son stops, confused.

EXT.  OLIVE GROVE - DAY

Maximus is galloping up a hill, leading only one horse
now.  The horse he is on is exhausted, spent, foam coats
its neck.  It can't make it.

The horse collapses and Maximus falls.  He immediately
leaps onto the remaining horse and continues riding up the
hill.

EXT.  HILLS AROUND VINEYARD - SUNSET

Maximus is racing over the countryside, galloping in a
frenzy.  His wound is bleeding profusely, coating the side
of his horse.

He rears the horse to a stop for a moment.  Over a hill he
can see thick black smoke rising.  He spurs the horse and
gallops over the hill...

EXT.  VINEYARD - SUNSET

And his worst nightmares are realized.

His home and his vineyards have been destroyed.  The earth
has been scorched and his house is still smoldering.  He
rides up to the house and practically falls off the horse.

He pulls himself up and walks past the smoldering debris
of his house, fearing what he knows he will find.

He sees the bodies of servants scattered about in the
ruins.  He sees a Praetorian battle flag.

He continues on, his wound bleeding more with every
tortured step.  He finally stops.  He stares up.

His wife and his son have been crucified and burnt.  They
are nothing more than grotesquely twisted, charred shapes.

Maximus instantly collapses to his knees -- he howls out
his torment in a heartrending keen of despair as he coats
his face in the ashes of his dead world.  He sinks into
unconsciousness, praying for death.

EXT.  VINEYARD - DAY

An unusual jingling sound is heard.  Maximus appears to be
dead, his gaping wound beginning to fester.

The source of the jingling becomes clear when we see the
feet of Bedouin brigands, with delicate anklets, shuffling
around him.  A hand touches his sandals.  Rich sandals.
Another touches his tunic.  Good cloth.

Suddenly Maximus groans.  The hands stop.  He's alive.  A
bit of quick language in an unknown tongue.

Then the hands grab Maximus and drag him away.

EXT.  SLAVE WAGON TRAIN - DAY

Maximus' eyes slowly open --

Inches away from his face -- a lion roars --

Maximus lurches back.

He looks around to realize he is in a filthy slave wagon.
Three other wagons slowly move over the desert landscape.
Exotic animals are caged in pens or led alongside the
wagons:  lions, panthers, zebras, a giraffe.  A dozen
slaves are chained together alongside sacks of spices and
other cargo.  Bedouin slave traders jabber in a surreal
babel of foreign tongues.

And someone is looking at him.  JUBA, a striking African,
is gazing at him impassively as he chews something.  Juba
is also chained.

					MAXIMUS
			(weakly)
		Am I in Hades?

					JUBA
		Yes.

Juba spits what he has been chewing into his hands and
moves to Maximus.

					JUBA
		For your wound...

Maximus stares at him.

					JUBA
			(nods)
		For your wound.

Maximus looks down -- the bloody wound at his side.

Juba carefully places his poultice over the wound --
Maximus hisses in pain -- Juba massages the poultice into
the wound gently as:

					JUBA
		If you die in the wagons they feed
		you to the lions... The lions are
		worth more than we are.  I think we
		are worth more than the zebras
		though.  So they don't feed us to
		them.

Maximus stares at him.  Juba looks down at him with the
barest hint of a smile.

					JUBA
		I'm not sure about the giraffe.

EXT.  SLAVE MARKET - DAY

The heat of Morocco is unlike anything Maximus has ever
known.  Shimmering heat waves undulate over the sand.

The provincial market is bustling like the proverbial
anthill.  Slave traders and dealers and merchants move
around, all talking very quickly and very emphatically.

Maximus, Juba and a number of other slaves are on display,
poked and prodded and fondled.  Their BEDOUIN SLAVE TRADER
sings out their praises to any passers.

The crowd parts almost magically for the dramatic arrival
of PROXIMO.  Proximo is a large man of immense appetites.
He has the ferocious appearance of a true pirate.  Two
slaves follow behind him and impotently swat at flies with
switches.

					SLAVE TRADER
		Proximo, my old friend, see what I
		have for you today -- !

Proximo SLAMS a fist into the Slave Trader's face.  The
Slave Trader sails back.

					PROXIMO
		Those giraffes you sold me won't
		mate!  All they do is run around not
		mating!  YOU SOLD ME EUNUCH
		GIRAFFES!!

The Slave Trader pulls himself up, hugely obsequious.

					SLAVE TRADER
		I will make it up to you, Master.
		It's bargain day for you!  Look,
		look, look -- I have two lions and a
		panther -- hear how they roar for
		you!  "Bring me home, Proximo!"

Proximo examines the animals.

					PROXIMO
		How much for the lot?

					SLAVE TRADER
		For you -- 8,000 sesterces.

					PROXIMO
		For me -- 6,000 sesterces and I want
		to see their balls first.  And you
		throw in those two slaves.

					SLAVE TRADER
			(moves to Maximus)
		What about this one?  Look at the
		arms!

Proximo moves to Maximus.  The Slave Trader forces open
Maximus' mouth.

					PROXIMO
		Good teeth --

Proximo notes the many old battle scars on Maximus' body.

					PROXIMO
		Where did you get those scars?   

Maximus doesn't respond.

					PROXIMO
		Are you a soldier?

Maximus doesn't respond.

					PROXIMO
		Do you speak? --
			(he roars back to a
			slave)
		KEEP THOSE DAMN FLIES OFF ME!
			(back to Maximus)
		He's dying.

					SLAVE TRADER
		1,000 sesterces.

					PROXIMO
		My ass...
			(moves to Juba)
		You throw in this one and we'll make
		it 7,000 sesterces for the whole
		lot.

					SLAVE TRADER
		I have to eat, Master!  He's my
		finest, I couldn't let him go as
		part of the lot for less than 9,000
		total...
			(back to Maximus)
		I tell you this one is prime.  He's
		a Spaniard and killed fourteen of my
		men before he could be subdued!

Proximo looks at Maximus, notes the many battle scars
again.  The scars, and something he senses in Maximus'
eyes, is enough for Proximo to consider it.

					PROXIMO
			(to trader)
		All right, let's see.

The Slave Trader and his colleagues grab Maximus and
bustle him across the market, unlocking his chains.
Maximus has no idea what's going on.

In the center of the market place, a veritable GIANT of a
man sits on a small stool, a wooden sword in his hand.  He
is hunched over and chained to the ground by a ten foot
chain shackled to his ankle.  A think metal helmet is
riveted around his entire head, only long turfs of hair
emerging.  His dim eyes stare listlessly through a slot in
the helmet.

The Slave Trader puts a wooden sword in Maximus' hand and
shoves him toward the Giant.  The Giant stands.  He towers
over Maximus.

The Giant suddenly swings his sword -- he moves with
remarkable quickness -- Maximus makes no attempt to block
the blow -- it sends him flying to the ground.

Maximus pulls himself up.

The Giant moves in and hits him again -- Maximus recoils
-- the Giant hits him again -- Maximus falls.

Maximus pulls himself up.

The Giant moves in again -- he slams him a few more times
-- Maximus makes no attempt to protect himself -- he
falls.

Maximus pulls himself up.

The Giant is about to attack again --

					PROXIMO
			(to Slave Trader)
		That's enough.

					SLAVE TRADER
		STOP!  STOP!

His colleagues race into the ring and haul the Giant away
from Maximus.  The Giant quietly sits back on his stool.

Proximo studies Maximus for a moment and then glances to
the Slave Trader.

					PROXIMO
		I'll give you 500 sesterces.

					SLAVE TRADER
		No -- no -- 1,000!

					PROXIMO
			(laughs)
		Come, don't quibble with your old
		friend.  I'll take the lions, the
		panther, the Numidian and this one
		for 7,000.  And I'll buy you the
		best whore in the town for two
		nights.  She's an enormous mountain
		of flesh who craves a stern hand.

					SLAVE TRADER
		How could I say no to my old friend
		Proximo?

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - DAY

Maximus and Juba are crammed into a wagon with about ten
other slaves, including a very scared and reedy SCRIBE.
Other wagons are filled with exotic animals, including
several lions.

The wagons move through a crowded casbah and are taken
through an imposing set of gates to...

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - DAY

An open compound in Proximo's school.  On one side of the
compound is a series of cages filled with wild animals of
every description -- including Proximo's two hapless
giraffes.

Proximo's house slaves begin unloading the newly purchased
exotic animals into cages as Maximus and the new slaves
are unloaded.  Heavily armed guards supervise everything.

But Proximo's slaves are having a bit of a problem with
one of the new lions -- it growls and resists them.

Without the slightest hesitation, Proximo thunders to the
lion and grabs it by the mane -- manhandling it into a
cage.

					PROXIMO
		COME ON, YOU FILTHY BEAST!

He kicks the lion in the rear as he shoves it into the
cage.

Proximo's provincial school resembles nothing so much as a
seedy prison.  The fading grandeur of the decaying
battlements and the sweeping North African architecture
only slightly mitigate the brutal feel of the place.

And if Maximus had any doubts as to Proximo's profession
-- all doubts are washed away when he sees the compound.

Twenty GLADIATORS are working out in the compound --
hacking at practice dummies and sparring.  The many
heavily armed guards oversee everything.  The gladiators
stop working out as they see the new slaves enter.  They
eye their potential new opponents warily.

One huge, glowering gladiator -- VIBIUS -- watches with
particular interest.  His eye is quickly drawn to the most
obvious athlete:  Juba.

The new slaves are herded to the middle of the compound
and house slaves immediately begin throwing buckets of
water on them, cleaning them.

Meanwhile, Proximo shrugs off his cloak.  A slave brings
him wine as he give his "welcoming speech" to the new
slaves:

					PROXIMO
		Slaves.  I am Proximo, trainer of
		gladiators.  You live and die at my
		pleasure.  Fight well and you will
		live.  Fight poorly and you will
		die.  It is better to live.

Slaves now toss thick handfuls of powdered lime on the new
slaves -- they cough and clench their eyes shut, the lime
coats and stings their wet bodies.

					PROXIMO
		Here you will be trained in the art
		of combat.  Here you will be given
		the tools to survive.  Please my
		patrons in the arena and all the
		gifts of the world will be showered
		upon you.  Imagine riches beyond
		your paltry dreams of riches!
		Imagine fame beyond your rude
		understanding of the word!  All this
		can belong to the select few who
		prove their worth in the arena.

Slaves throw more water on the new slaves -- washing off
the lime.

					PROXIMO
		If... on the other hand... you
		disappoint me... you will be
		dismembered and fed to my jackals
		limb by limb.

He gazes evenly at his new acquisitions.

					PROXIMO
		And my jackals are always hungry.

He strides off and the guards shove the new gladiators
toward their cells.

INT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - MAXIMUS' CELL - NIGHT

Maximus and Juba share a small, filthy cell.  The cell
door faces the open compound.  Across the compound they
can see the much more comfortable cells of the "star"
gladiators such as Vibius.

They both sit on the floor, leaning against the wall.
Juba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon.
Maximus' bowl and spoon are at his side, he has not
touched them.

					JUBA
		Have you killed a man before?

Maximus does not respond.

					JUBA
		You should eat.  You'll need your
		strength tomorrow.

Maximus does not respond.

					JUBA
		I've never killed a man.  But I
		think you have.

Maximus does not respond.

					JUBA
		I almost killed once.  The Romans
		destroyed my village.  I was with a
		hunting party and when we
		returned... I would have killed
		every Roman in the world.

A long beat.

					JUBA
		If you don't eat you will die.

Maximus does not respond.

A beat.

					JUBA
		In the village I come from there was
		a man once.  He went fishing one day
		and his boat was attacked by
		crocodiles.  One of them ate his
		leg.  He pulled himself to the shore
		and a lion attacked him.  It ate one
		of his arms.  He dragged himself
		through the desert on the way home
		and a scorpion stung his eye.  So he
		only had one eye.  When he reached
		the village I sat with him.  I said,
		"You have lost a leg, an arm and one
		eye.  You must have a mighty will to
		live."  He said, "No, Lord, it's
		just better than the alternative."

Maximus finally looks at him.

					JUBA
		Life is a gift from our fathers to
		us.  Who are you to give it up for
		lack of lifting a spoon?

Maximus does not respond.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - NIGHT

Maximus and Juba are being observed.  Proximo stands in
the shadows of the compound and watches intently.

EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - PROVINCIAL STREETS - DAY

Blood appears to be flowing across an oxen's back.  But
the blood is too rich, too red.

The oxen are pulling an open slave wagon through the
crowded streets of the town.  Hanging above the street is
dyed wool drying in the sun.  Vermilion and crimson dyes
drip down and splash across the oxen -- and splash across
the gladiators.

Maximus, Juba, the formidable Vibius are chained in the
back of the wagon.  Also the frightened Scribe.

Proximo and a few of his guards drive the wagon.  Proximo
has an umbrella over him, colored with years of dripping
dyes.

They pass a banner honoring Vibius, the star of Proximo's
stable.

Meanwhile, the terrified Scribe is almost weeping,
chattering nervously to Vibius, chained next to him:

					SCRIBE
		I know nothing of armaments and
		warfare!  I'm a scribe -- I write
		down words!  I can write down seven
		languages --

					VIBIUS
		Be still.

					SCRIBE
		I don't -- how do you hold the
		sword?!  I've never held a sword!

					VIBIUS
		You point the sharp end at your
		opponent and you shove it in his
		guts.

					SCRIBE
		I can't -- I --

He suddenly vomits.

					VIBIUS
			(calling to Proximo)
		Proximo!  You insult me with this
		carrion!  Chain him to someone else!

					PROXIMO
			(calling back)
		Don't worry, noble Vibius, he won't
		be bothering you for long.

The Scribe begins to weep.

The crowds in the street jeer at the passing gladiators.
Occasionally throwing trash at them.  A pack of children
run alongside the wagon, chanting:

					CHILDREN
		Dead guts!  Dead guts!  Dead guts!

Maximus watches the children for a moment and then another
sight draws his attention.  Over some buildings he can see
vultures circling in the distance.

EXT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DUGOUT - DAY

In the cramped holding area of the arena, a dugout beneath
the stands, Maximus and the other gladiators are waiting.

Proximo walks before them, giving a final "pep talk."  He
gazes at them evenly, his eyes going from face to face.

					PROXIMO
		Some of you say you can't fight, you
		won't fight... They all say that...
		But one day you will pick up a sword
		and thrust it into another man.  And
		the crowd will cheer you and love
		you.  And you will love them for it.
		On that day... you will be a
		gladiator.

He stops at Maximus.

					PROXIMO
		In this life, we all die.  All we
		can choose is how we die.  And how
		we are remembered.  Be remembered
		proudly.

Drums are heard from the arena.  Proximo nods to a waiting
blacksmith.

The blacksmith begins slamming shackles on the gladiator's
wrists -- chaining them together in teams of two by a
chain about four feet long.

The blacksmith is about to chain Maximus to the Scribe.

					PROXIMO
		No...
			(he points to Juba)
		... give the Spaniard to him.  Give
		the Scribe to Vibius.

Proximo nods to Vibius, who, for reasons we shall soon
see, makes no protest to being chained to the whimpering
Scribe.

Proximo watches the blacksmith shackle Maximus and Juba
together and then strides off.

					JUBA
			(to Maximus)
		Are we going to fight each other?

EXT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DAY

Proximo sits in a box with several other GLADIATOR
TRAINERS.  They drink wine and eat constantly.  A
perpetual chatter of wagers and odds and side bets.

The arena is only sparsely attended this day.

					PROXIMO
		Make it 600 sesterces for each
		decapitation.

					TRAINER #1
		How many strokes?

					PROXIMO
		Two.

					TRAINER #1
		For the great Vibius, one stroke.

					PROXIMO
		Done.  400 sesterces for two
		strokes.

In the arena:

Proximo's chained teams enter the arena, five teams.
Maximus and Juba are chained together.  Some of the small
crowd cheers for Vibius.  He acknowledges the cheers.  He
is chained to the weeping Scribe.

In the box:

Trainer #1 laughs.

					TRAINER #1
			(re: Vibius)
		Who's he with?

					PROXIMO
		A Greek Scribe.

					TRAINER #1
		I'll raise the wager.

					PROXIMO
			(smiles)
		Give me odds, friend.

In the arena:

From the opposite end of the arena a dozen armored, very
scary Andabatae thunder into the arena.  Some of the crowd
cheers.

The Andabatae immediately race for the chained teams and
the battle is on.

Vibius spins into action -- dragging the weeping Scribe
after him as he circles opponents and fights -- the Scribe
is almost instantly killed -- Vibius immediately hacks
through the Scribe's wrist and frees himself, as Proximo
surely intended.  Vibius is now free to fight alone,
swinging the chain as an additional weapon.

Juba's eyes dart everywhere as he tries to move with
Maximus -- Maximus neither helps nor hinders -- allowing
Juba to pull him along --

Proximo, now that his star Vibius is safe, watched Maximus
and Juba closely.

Juba fights well, with a strange elegance, his body
flowing like liquid -- but he is inexperienced.  He
strikes a few blows and then tries to move away -- finally
he is in trouble -- cornered -- a huge Andabata is slicing
at him -- it is a desperate battle -- Juba is losing --
his sword is slammed away -- the Andabata raises his sword
for the kill --

And Maximus strikes.

With a sudden roar he EXPLODES into action -- he swings
past Juba and blocks the blow meant for Juba -- then he
slashes the Andabata -- killing him -- he pulls Juba after
him as he fights --

It is a dazzling display of Maximus' skill -- he moves
through the Andabatae at amazing speed -- spinning around
Juba and protecting him -- slashing ruthlessly -- pulling
Juba after him and commanding the battle -- Juba recovers
a sword and they fight together.

In the box:

Proximo watches, smiles.  A gladiator is born.

EXT.  ROME - WAGON - DAY

SENATOR GRACCHUS, an imposing, moral and corpulent man in
his 60's, is riding in a luxurious wagon with Senator
Gaius.

And CAPTAIN MARCELLUS, the handsome Head of the Roman City
Guard.

Their wagon slowly maneuvers through the crowded streets
of Rome.  The cosmopolitan bustle of the great urban
center is everywhere around them.

					GRACCHUS
		We have plague in the Hebrew Quarter
		and it is spreading... we have
		looting at the granaries... we have
		so much filth in the Tiber that the
		water is undrinkable... we have
		Praetorian Guard units that are
		demanding protection payments from
		the merchants at the exchange --

					MARCELLUS
		My City Guard units have tried to
		curtail these excesses but no
		constabulary can police the entire
		city.  And the Praetorians outnumber
		us two to one.

					GRACCHUS
		Rome dies as the Emperor plays at
		beneficence.  At least Nero gave us
		music!

					GAIUS
		Do you think he'll listen to us?

					GRACCHUS
		It is his duty to hear the will of
		the Senate.

Their wagon stops -- hopelessly stuck in a massive traffic
jam of chariots, wagons and sedan chairs.

					GRACCHUS
		Not to mention the damn traffic!

INT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

Emperor Commodus is standing before a group of male
children and their tutors in his throne room.

The throne room is still very much the province of his
father.  Manuscripts and astronomical charts and papyrus
scrolls and wax tablets litter the heavy desk.  A large
bust of Marcus Aurelius is in one corner.

Lucilla and Senator Falco are present.  So too Senators
Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus.

A well-rehearsed child presents Commodus with a laurel
wreath.

					CHILD
		We honor Caesar with the laurel to
		show our love and appreciation for
		his benevolence.

					COMMODUS
		Caesar is honored to accept your
		tribute, Citizen Scholar.

The child smiles and moves back to his fellows.

					COMMODUS
			(to all)
		It is the most sacred duty of the
		Emperor to oversee the education of
		the young.  If I could leave no
		other legacy than the scholarship of
		all children my life would be
		blessed.  Tutors, you hold the
		future of Rome in your hands.  Teach
		them well so that they will bring
		honor to the Empire.  I salute you.

Commodus actually bows before them, an unimaginable honor.

The tutors bow in response and herd the children out.

					COMMODUS
		Look at them, Senators... my truest
		gift to Rome.

					GRACCHUS
		Darling children, to be sure, now if
		I may proceed?

					COMMODUS
			(sighs)
		Very well...

Commodus moves to the desk, standing over it and gazing at
Marcus' scrolls as:

					GRACCHUS
		Caesar, your presence in Rome is an
		invaluable opportunity to begin
		correcting some of the ills that
		have beset the city since your
		father went to the wars.  We would
		like to --

					COMMODUS
		Peace, good Gracchus, peace...

Commodus slowly begins pushing Marcus' papyrus scrolls off
the desk to the floor, one by one, as:

					COMMODUS
		My beloved father was a careless
		shepherd to his flock.  I shall be a
		good father to my children.  I shall
		remain in Rome and show them how
		they are loved.

					GRACCHUS
		With respect, sire, the people don't
		need love -- they need law.  The
		Senate has prepared a series of
		protocols to begin addressing the
		corruption in the city --
			(Gaius hands him a
			scroll)
		-- starting with basic sanitation in
		the Hebrew Quarter.  If Caesar could
		study this and --

					COMMODUS
		You see that's the very problem,
		isn't it, my old, old friend?  My
		father spent all his time at study.
		At books and learning and
		philosophy...

As Commodus speaks he moves to the chair behind the desk,
tries it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave.  The chair is
whisked away.

					COMMODUS
		He spent his twilight hours reading
		scrolls from the Senate.  All the
		while, the people were forgotten.

					GRACCHUS
		The Senate is the people.

					COMMODUS
		I doubt many of the people eat so
		well as you do, Senator Gracchus...

As Commodus speaks he moves to the bust of Marcus, studies
it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave and the bust is
whisked away.  Lucilla watches this closely.

					COMMODUS
		I doubt many of the people have such
		splendid armor, Captain Marcellus.
		Or such fine mistresses, Senator
		Gaius.  No... only their true father
		knows what the people need.  I shall
		show them they are loved.  I shall
		hold them to my bosom and embrace
		them tightly --

					GRACCHUS
		Have you ever embraced someone dying
		of plague, sire?

Commodus stops.  Looks at him.  A lethal moment.

					COMMODUS
		No.  But if you interrupt me one
		more time I assure you that you
		shall.  I will emulate the immortal
		Caesars of the past.  I will give
		the people what they truly want.
		Starting this day I will draw all of
		Rome to the Colosseum.  I will give
		them bread.  And they will want
		nothing more.

Startled looks between Gracchus, Gaius and Marcellus.

					GRACCHUS
		You want to hold games?

					COMMODUS
		Not just any games, Senator!  A
		series of games that will make the
		Gods envious and leave my children
		happy!  I will subsidize the arena
		from this day forth -- and I will
		culminate this celebration in a
		great spectacle the likes of which
		the world has never seen!  A great
		spectacle to honor my father!
		Magnificent, unending weeks of
		festivity all in the name of Marcus
		Aurelius!

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		If I may, Caesar... how are you
		going to pay for this?

					COMMODUS
		That is not your concern.

Gracchus ignores a warning look from Gaius.

					GRACCHUS
		Respectfully, sire, taxation and
		import duties are the exclusive
		province of the Senate --

Commodus spins on him so quickly and with such feral
violence that everyone is shocked --

					COMMODUS
		MY FATHER DESERVES TO BE HONORED AND
		I WILL HONOR HIM! -- AND THE PEOPLE
		WILL LOVE ME! -- AND THE SENATE WILL
		OBEY ME OR EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL
		BURN!  BURN!  BURN! -- I WILL HAVE
		ORDER!

He snarls like a great jungle cat and he stalks away.
Senator Falco quickly follows.

A dreadful silence.

Then:

					LUCILLA
		Gentlemen, in the future do not
		concern my brother with these
		matters.  Come to me.

She sweeps out.

A beat.

					MARCELLUS
		Games?  He wants to hold games?

					GAIUS
		It's madness.

					GRACCHUS
		No... it's not...

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		He knows who Rome is.  Rome is the
		mob.  He will conjure magic for them
		and they will be distracted.  And he
		will takes their lives.  And he will
		take their freedom.  And still they
		will roar.  The beating heart of
		Rome isn't the marble of the Senate.
		It's the sand of the Colosseum.  He
		will give them death.  And they will
		love him for it.

INT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DUGOUT - TUNNELS - DAY

Maximus is marching relentlessly through the dugout and
cramped, serpentine trench-like tunnels that lead to the
arena.

We don't really see Maximus well in the dark tunnels.

Proximo scurries to keep up with him -- they brush past
gladiators who line the walls.  Some are wounded, some are
being attended to by surgeons, some are shell-shocked,
some are nervously waiting to go on, whispering prayers.

We twist and turn in the tunnels with Proximo and Maximus
as:

					PROXIMO
			(quickly)
		I've wagered on you against the
		Celts -- ignore the others and go
		for them -- there are two axe-and-
		net and two long spear.  Now the
		Celts aren't used to the sun so you
		have the advantage there...

The roar of the crowd is growing, they are nearing the
arena...

					PROXIMO
		And keep them moving, their lungs
		aren't strong, ground the spears as
		soon as you can and then go for the
		ax-men.  If you get all four there's
		an extra bonus so don't be
		distracted by the Spartans...

Without a word to Proximo, or a moment's hesitation,
Maximus strides into the arena.

EXT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DAY

We continue with Maximus as he strides into the roaring
arena.

We finally see him in the blazing sunlight -- he wears
traditional gladiator armor and now has longer hair and a
beard --

A battle is already in progress, fighting and dead and
dying gladiators crowd the arena --

We stay with Maximus as he wades through his opponents,
fighting them heroically, slashing through them without
stopping --

The large crowd cheers mightily -- chants of "Spaniard!
Spaniard!  Spaniard!"

We stay with Maximus as he cuts through the four Celts
like a scythe through wheat and then we dramatically pull
up and away --

Taking in the roaring arena and the hero.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - NIGHT

A large mess area has been set up.  The tables around the
compound are crowded with gladiators.  Guards everywhere.

Maximus and Juba enter.  Move to get food.  All
conversation gradually drains away as the other gladiators
watch them.  Silence.

Maximus and Juba note the strange silence as they move to
a large table.

Vibius is at the table with a number of other gladiators.
There are no places for Maximus and Juba.

Vibius stands and kicks two other gladiators off their
bench.

					VIBIUS
		MOVE ASIDE!  THIS IS A TABLE FOR
		MEN!

Maximus and Juba sit.

Vibius remains standing.  He begins to pound on the table
with his fist.  Soon all the gladiators are pounding on
their tables.  It is a cacophonous din honoring Maximus.

INT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

Proximo sits on a terrace overlooking his compound,
sipping wine.  Various gladiators can be seen working out
below.

A guard brings Maximus.  Proximo nods for the guard to
leave.

					PROXIMO
			(holding up a plate)
		Butterfly?

The plate is filled with honeyed butterflies, their wings
still moving slightly.

Maximus shakes his head.  Proximo pops one into his mouth.
He chews as he looks at Maximus.

					PROXIMO
		Perhaps you'd like a woman?

Maximus shakes his head.

					PROXIMO
		Boy?

Maximus shakes his head.

A beat.

					PROXIMO
		Gold?

Maximus shakes his head.

					PROXIMO
		Well, I have nothing left to offer
		you!  A man who turns down a
		butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold
		confuses me.  Personally, I'd grab
		them all and then grab some more
		because the Gods are fanciful and
		take us at their whim.  Does the
		Spaniard have any needs?

Maximus shakes his head.

A beat.  Proximo studies him.

					PROXIMO
		You fight like a soldier.  You have
		wounds like a soldier who has been
		on long campaigns.  You eye the
		world around you like an enemy.
		What is your name, Roman soldier?

					MAXIMUS
		Gladiator.

A beat.

					PROXIMO
		And nothing more?

					MAXIMUS
		Nothing more.

A beat.

Proximo watches Maximus very closely for the following:

					PROXIMO
		In two days we leave for Rome.

Maximus' eyes suddenly flash to Proximo.  He is
transfixed, his eyes burning.

					PROXIMO
		Ah... so it's Rome you want.  Well
		you shall have her, Gladiator.  The
		new Emperor has ordered a series of
		matches to culminate in a grand
		spectacle.  If you do well I shall
		become very, very rich.  If you do
		well enough I shall set you free.
		Is it freedom you want?

A beat.

Maximus shakes his head.

					PROXIMO
			(quietly)
		Not even that.

					MAXIMUS
			(barely controlled)
		The Emperor -- will he be there?

					PROXIMO
		Oh yes.  He's apparently quite mad
		about the games.  Spending a
		fortune, which is, needless to say,
		good for me again.  But what is good
		for you, Gladiator?

					MAXIMUS
		Have you -- how does one meet the
		Emperor?

					PROXIMO
		As a gladiator?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					PROXIMO
		One doesn't.

A beat.  Proximo sees that Maximus' mind is racing.

					PROXIMO
		Except... If one has proven oneself
		in battle.  If at the end of the
		games you are the final man standing
		-- the Emperor will present you with
		a small wooden sword.  The sword is
		your freedom.

					MAXIMUS
		He give it personally?

					PROXIMO
		He did to me...
			(Maximus is surprised
			at this)
		Our great father Marcus Aurelius
		looked into my eyes and touched me
		on the shoulder.

					MAXIMUS
		You knew Marcus?

					PROXIMO
		I didn't know him.  He touched me on
		the shoulder.  Just once.  But that
		was enough.

A beat.

					PROXIMO
		All right, Gladiator.  We shall go
		to Rome together and have bloody
		adventures.  The Great Whore will
		suckle us until we are fat and happy
		and can't suck another drop.  That
		is Rome.

INT./ EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - OUTSIDE ROME - EVENING

Maximus is crouched in the back of an enclosed slave wagon
with Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators.

In the distance, Rome.

INT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Commodus sits on his bed, rubbing his aching head.
Lucilla is preparing a drink for him, a medicinal tonic.

					COMMODUS
		All my desires are splitting my head
		to pieces -- there's so much I want
		to do -- but all my efforts to show
		my children they are loved go
		unappreciated by those dragons in
		the Senate --

					LUCILLA
			(mixing tonic)
		Quiet, brother...

Unseen by him, she adds a little special powder to the
drink from a vial secreted in her robe.

					LUCILLA
		Leave the Senate to me.  Don't
		trouble yourself.

					COMMODUS
		All I want is to be a good father to
		my people.  Why don't they
		understand that?

She goes to him.

					LUCILLA
		Shhh.  The tonic will help...

She takes a sip and then hands it to him.

					LUCILLA
		Yes, just drink this down.

She sits on the edge of the bed.  He drinks as:

					COMMODUS
		I must take a firmer hand with them.
		They must know their father can be
		firm.  As our father was firm with
		us.

					LUCILLA
		Our father lost his way.  His
		mistake was believing the old songs
		of the "Republic."  We know better.
		So let the Senate talk.  They have
		no real power.

					COMMODUS
		Yes... yes... you always know the
		way.  You were always so wise in
		these matters...
			(he takes her hand)
		You know if I didn't have my duty to
		Rome I think I should be an artist.
		I should go away and paint pictures
		of the sea and leave all the
		politics to you...

A beat.  He is sleepy, he lies back on his bed.

					COMMODUS
		Will you stay with me?

					LUCILLA
			(smiles gently)
		Still afraid of the dark, brother?

					COMMODUS
		Still.  Always.

A beat.

					COMMODUS
		My dreams would terrify the world.

A beat.

					LUCILLA
		I'll stay with you until you are
		asleep.

					COMMODUS
			(falling asleep)
		And after... just sit with me.  Keep
		me safe...

He is asleep.

She watches him for a moment and then rises.

She goes.

INT.  PALACE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lucilla moves down a long corridor in the palace and blows
out candles as she goes.

She finally arrives at her own chamber and enters...

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Senators Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus are
waiting.

					LUCILLA
		He's asleep.  Be quick.

					GRACCHUS
		We've taking a sounding, the Senate
		is with us.

					LUCILLA
		Good.

					GRACCHUS
		But we are only words.  We are air.
		We need steel.

					MARCELLUS
		The City Guard is faithful to the
		Republic.  But we don't stand a
		chance against the Praetorians.

					LUCILLA
		Can they be bought?

					MARCELLUS
		They are zealots -- totally
		committed to your brother.

					GRACCHUS
		Well, can they at least be rented
		for a day?

					MARCELLUS
		I doubt it.  He pays them exorbitant
		salaries and lets them loot and
		extort as they see fit.  The city
		belongs to them.

					LUCILLA
		And they've started arresting
		scholars now.  Anyone who dares
		speak out -- even satirists and
		chroniclers.

					MARCELLUS
		And mathematicians and Christians.
		All to fill the arena.

					GAIUS
		And what pays for it?  These games
		are costing a fortune and yet we
		have no new taxes.

					LUCILLA
		The future.  The future pays for
		it...

A beat.  She looks at them.

					LUCILLA
		He's started selling the grain
		reserves.   

					GAIUS
		No.

					MARCELLUS
		That can't be true...

					LUCILLA
		He's selling Rome's reserves of
		grain.  The people will be starving
		in two years.  I hope they are
		enjoying the spectacles because soon
		enough they will be dead because of
		them.

					MARCELLUS
		Rome must know this.

					LUCILLA
		And who will tell them?!  You,
		Marcellus?  You, Senator Gaius?
		Will you make a speech on the Senate
		floor denouncing my brother?  And
		then see your family in the
		Colosseum?  What town-crier would
		dare?

A long beat.

					LUCILLA
		He must die.

A beat as her words sink in.

					GAIUS
		The Praetorians would only seize
		control themselves.

					LUCILLA
		No -- cut off the head and the snake
		cannot strike.

					GRACCHUS
		Lucilla, Gaius is right.  Until the
		City Guard can neutralize the
		Praetorians we can accomplish
		nothing.

					MARCELLUS
		And I haven't enough men.

					LUCILLA
		What about the army?

					GAIUS
		No Roman army has entered the
		capital in a hundred years.

					LUCILLA
		So we do nothing?!

A door opens, a voice...

					LUCIUS' VOICE
		Mother...

An eight-year-old boy stands in a doorway, sleepy.  He is
LUCIUS, Lucilla's son.

					LUCIUS
		I heard voices...

					LUCILLA
			(going to him)
		It's all right, darling, you --

Lucius suddenly notices Senator Gracchus:

					LUCIUS
			(running to Gracchus)
		Senator!  What did you bring me?!

He leaps onto Gracchus -- Gracchus laughs and pulls
something from his robe.

					GRACCHUS
		For you prince Lucius... a sea
		monster!

Gracchus gives Lucius a beautifully painted toy of a sea
serpent.

					GRACCHUS
		Off the coast of Achaea they grow
		twenty times this size, with
		snapping teeth to devour any nasty
		Praetorians they come across... now,
		where is Achaea?

					LUCIUS
		Below Macedonia!

					GRACCHUS
		Show me on the map.

Lucius runs to a map and stabs his finger at Achaea.  We
sense this is an old game between them.

					LUCILLA
		Lucius, you go in now, I'll be in
		shortly.

					LUCIUS
			(to Gracchus)
		Thank you, Senator Mountain!

					GRACCHUS
		You're welcome, Prince Anthill!

Lucius goes.  Lucilla shuts the door after him.  A moment.
She turns to the others, a deep anguish in her eyes.

					LUCILLA
		What are you going to do?

Gracchus goes to her, holds her.

					GRACCHUS
		Peace child... One dark night the
		Gods will light our path.  They will
		give us the voice we need.  Have
		faith in that.  Have faith.

INT./ EXT.  ROMAN STREETS - SLAVE WAGON - NIGHT

Maximus cranes for a sight of the Eternal City through a
hole in the wooden slats that cover the slave cart.

He can see only glimpses of Rome as they pass.  But the
images are not what he expected.  Alongside the undeniable
glory of the city, the madness and disease Marcus Aurelius
spoke of are readily apparent.

Maximus sees flashes of plague victims being tossed on
carts heaped with bodies -- he sees getting and spending
and commerce everywhere -- he sees fascist Praetorian
Guard units trooping past -- he sees the magnificent
architecture of the city -- he sees starving children
begging from filthy gutters -- he sees rich citizens out
for a stroll -- he sees a swirling combination of
sophistication and depravity, of civilization and
corruption.

He sits back in the cart, deep in thought.  Vibius looks
at him.

					VIBIUS
		Not what you expected?

					MAXIMUS
		No.

					VIBIUS
		Rome is nothing but a slaughter
		house.  And we are the meat.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

The slave wagon pulls up to Proximo's rather grand Roman
compound.  Guards unlock imposing gates and the wagon
drives in...

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Inside the gates is a large courtyard, much like Proximo's
Moroccan school but much more impressive.  A fountain with
an enormous statue of the war god Mars is central in the
courtyard.

The gladiators climb from the wagon, stretching after the
long journey.  Vibius leads Maximus and Juba to the
statue.  He wades through the fountain and kisses the toe
of Mars.

					VIBIUS
		Tradition.  He watches over us.

Juba steps up and kisses the toe.

					VIBIUS
			(to Maximus)
		Oh go on, it won't kill you.

Maximus kisses the toe as well.

					PROXIMO
			(calling to them)
		Stop that!  You'll get some
		monstrous disease and then you'll be
		worth nothing to me!

Guards come and lead them to their cells, which line one
side of the courtyard.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Later.  Maximus and Juba again share a cell.  It is more
comfortable than their cell in Morocco, befitting Maximus'
new status as one of the "stars."  A high, barred window
on one wall opens to the city.  Another barred window is
directly over them, twenty feet above.

Maximus pulls himself up to the side window, he looks out.

And sees at last... The Colosseum.

It is a breathtaking sight.  Monolithic Albert Speer-like
columns of light shine up from the Colosseum.  It seems to
illuminate the whole city and the heavens above.

Maximus drops back to the floor.

					JUBA
		Do you think it will be much
		different?  Here in Rome?

					MAXIMUS
		Bigger arena.  Same killing.

A beat.

					JUBA
		Are you scared for tomorrow?

					MAXIMUS
		No.

A beat.

					JUBA
		Me too.

A beat.

					JUBA
		I never though it would be so easy
		to kill.

A beat.

					JUBA
		So you're finally home.

					MAXIMUS
		This isn't my home.

					JUBA
		For all Romans... this is home.

A beat.

					JUBA
			(quietly)
		Among my people we honor the soil of
		our home.  Our ancestors are in that
		soil.  All their dreams live there.
		I will never see my home again.  The
		soil is dead and no one honors them,
		so the dreams die.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		Perhaps one day you'll return.

Juba looks at him.

					JUBA
		How can I go back?  I am not what I
		was.  When a man kills for no
		reason, he has lost himself.

A long beat.

Juba leans his head back and quietly begins to sing.  A
haunting lament in his native tongue.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

A flurry of images from around the Colosseum, the energy
mounting.  At this point we see practically nothing of the
inside of the Colosseum:

Slaves are balancing high above the empty arena.  They are
on ropes unrolling huge rolls of muslin; sun tarps that
provide shade below...

Merchants open stalls in the curved arcade around outside
of the Colosseum.  They sell everything from food to magic
elixirs, from toys to aphrodisiacs.  They immediately
start declaiming and demonstrating the virtues of their
products...

Gangs of whores of both sexes trawl the streets.  They
have bizarrely-colored hair and elaborate makeup...

Citizens begin arriving, pushing past the vendors and the
pickpockets.  We see whole families with picnic lunches...

Ferocious animals are brought into the Colosseum in barred
cages...

In the busy arcade, barbers and blood-letters practice
their craft alongside exotic alchemists, fire eaters and
contortionists...

Richer citizens arrive in sedan chairs and chariots, they
feign indifference to the hooting mob...

Mounted City Guard police units try to retain some
order...

Gamblers crowd betting booths and haggle mercilessly...

Finally, we see Maximus and the other gladiators in a
slave cart.  Maximus watches everything as the slave cart
disappears into the Colosseum...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - ROUTE TO HOLDING CELLS - DAY

The interior of the Colosseum is a busy world unto itself.

Maximus and the others are lead by Proximo's guards down a
long ramp and past countless animal cages.  Gamblers
circulate everywhere and observe the warriors, angling for
the best odds and the best matches.

Maximus and the others are led even deeper into the bowels
of the Colosseum to a new whole subterranean realm.
Numerous cells line the walls.  Racks and racks of
weaponry and armor.

And, most striking, everywhere around them is the heavy
machinery of the spectacles above.  Huge "elevator"
platforms and ramps and pulleys and counterweights are
manned by teams of sweating slaves.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Finally, Proximo's guards lead the gladiators to their
holding cells.  These cells are right at the edge of the
arena.  Barred windows offer a sand-level view of the
action.

Maximus immediately goes to a window and looks out.

He cannot see much of the entire arena, but what he does
see transfixes him.

A band of Christians are huddled together.  An eerie
silence from the Colosseum but for the prayers of the
Christians.

Maximus watches them.  One little girl peels past her
mother's arm.  She sees Maximus.  She smiles.

Suddenly a dozen ferocious lions race up a ramp by Maximus
-- they roar into the arena --

We do not see the carnage.  We watch Maximus' face as we
hear the sounds of the slaughter.

And the sound of the roaring crowd.

Maximus finally cannot watch.  He drops his head.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - TRAINER'S LAIR - DAY

Proximo is with a dozen other gladiator trainers and the
Colosseum's orator and majordomo, CASSIUS.  They are
haggling in an secluded area not far from the arena
itself.  Huge chalkboards chart the day's matches and
wagers and odds.

Colosseum touts continually erase and mark new figures on
the chalkboards to keep up with the swiftly changing
bouts.

The roar of the lions and the unnerving screams of the
Christians can clearly be heard.

					CASSIUS
		... and the Emperor will have no
		more animal battles today --

Upset roars from some of the trainers.

					TRAINER #1
		You promised me a bear match,
		Cassius!

					TRAINER #2
		I have ten damned gorillas!  You
		said gorillas yesterday!

					CASSIUS
		Talk to the man in the imperial box.
		Who has the next slot...?
			(he checks the
			boards)
		-- Lentulus, Gideon, Trebonius and
		Proximo --
			(to Proximo)
		-- Nice to have you back, you
		piratical bastard -- now listen, the
		Emperor wants the Carthage
		spectacle.

The four trainers explode in a flurry of resistance --

					PROXIMO
		No -- have pity, Cassius -- !

					TRAINER #3
		My men are too good for -- !

					CASSIUS
		You give us the Carthage match or
		lose your spot on the rotation --
		but don't worry -- gold is flowing
		from the Emperor's fingers.

					TRAINER #3
		It'll cost you --

					PROXIMO
		I won't do it for less than 100,000
		sesterces -- !

					TRAINER #4
		120,000!  All I have is my best
		Thracians!

					CASSIUS
			(to Proximo)
		And I want to see this famous
		Spaniard of yours -- his reputation
		soars from the provinces.  The
		people are eager for him --

					PROXIMO
		I won't throw my Spaniard into a
		spectacle!  Damn you and damn the
		rotation!

					CASSIUS
		You will and the price will be
		90,000 sesterces each --
			(to all)
		-- which you all know is exorbitant
		-- AND IF YOU EXTORTING BLOOD-WHORES
		TRY TO PAWN OFF LESSER FIGHTERS ON
		ME I WILL SEE YOU DEAD IN THE ARENA
		TOMORROW!

					TRAINER #4
		My Thracians are worth -- !

					CASSIUS
		Give me your best, brothers.  They
		die before Caesar.

He strides back to the arena.  The touts instantly begin
making new marks on the boards to represent the mysterious
"Carthage Spectacle" as some of the trainers hurry out.

Proximo walks with Trainer #4:

					PROXIMO
		I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will
		kill at least one of your Thracians.

					TRAINER #4
		30,000?!  On a Spaniard?!  That
		provincial sun has curdled your
		brain!

					PROXIMO
		Then make the wager, you smug
		bastard!

They disappear down a dark corridor, negotiating all the
while.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Maximus, Juba, Vibius and another of Proximo's gladiators
are being armed.  They all wear mask-like helmets.

Proximo hurries to them.

					PROXIMO
		All right -- there are three other
		teams, four men each --
			(to Maximus)
		You know what a Thracian looks like?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes, but --

					PROXIMO
		Ignore the others -- go for the
		Thracians.  The sun is to the east
		-- over the gate -- keep your back
		to the gate and you won't have the
		sun.

					MAXIMUS
		What -- ?

Trumpets begin sounding from the arena.

					PROXIMO
		Hurry -- !

The guards quickly bustle the four toward a gate leading
to a dark tunnel to the arena.

					PROXIMO
		Die well and we'll sing songs about
		you for a generation.

Short swords are shoved into their hands and the gate
rises.  They are pushed into the dark tunnel leading to
the arena.  The gate closes behind them.

The four gladiators stand for a moment and then slowly
walk down the tunnel to...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

At last we see it.

The mighty Colosseum Arena.

Nothing we could have possibly imagined could have
prepared us for the sight of the thousands and thousands
of screaming spectators, the row after row of cheering
faces.

It is staggering.

But for Maximus none of this exists.  His full attention
is focused on one spot alone.  The Imperial Box.

He can see Commodus and Lucilla sitting in the box.  The
box is elevated fifteen feet above the arena floor at the
top of a sheer black marble wall.  A cohort of fifty
imposing Praetorian Guard Archers surround the box.
Commodus' personal Body Guard of six Centurions actually
stand in the box itself, eyes constantly watching like
modern Secret Service agents.

Commodus is untouchable.

Meanwhile, three teams move from different entrances to
the arena.

As Cassius orates to the crowd:

					CASSIUS
		This day we reach back to hallowed
		antiquity to bring you... THE FALL
		OF MIGHTY CARTHAGE...!
			(the crowd cheers)
		... On the barren armies of the
		barbarian Hannibal!  Ferocious
		mercenaries and warriors of all
		brute nations bent on merciless
		conquest!  Your Emperor is pleased
		to give you... THE BARBARIAN HORDE!

He gestures to the gladiators in the arena.  The crowd
laughs, jeering the "barbarians."

The drummers begin pounding out a more insistent, heroic
beat.

					CASSIUS
		But on that illustrious day the Gods
		sent against them Rome's greatest
		warriors...!  The very life-image of
		nobility and glorious valor... who
		would on this day, and on these same
		arid Numidian deserts, decide THE
		FATE OF THE EMPIRE... Your Emperor
		is pleased to give you... THE
		LEGIONNAIRES OF SCIPIO AFRICANUS!!

The crowd EXPLODES in cheers as the huge doors at one end
of the arena suddenly burst open and ten chariots thunder
in --

Each chariot has a driver and an archer, both dressed in
theatrical versions of the familiar Roman Lorica
Segmentata.

A chaos of dust -- and the battle is on --

The chariots zoom around the arena -- the archers keeping
up a deadly hail of arrows.

Maximus immediately dives onto a passing chariot and kills
the charioteer and archer -- he dramatically leaps from
the front of the chariot to a lead horse and cuts it free.

And Maximus takes control, we see the General of the Felix
Regiment gloriously alive again as he barks out orders and
leads his gladiators in battle.  They follow him
faithfully, his stern commands unquestioned.

His strategies are quick and smart, he makes the
gladiators work together.

This kind of slaughter could last for hours...

We see flashes of the endless battle... Maximus races on
his horse past another chariot, kills the driver, the
chariot smashes into a wall... the sun sinks lower, the
shadows on the sand lengthen... areas of the sand are
swamps of blood, Juba slips, pulls himself up fighting...
Maximus uses Vibius to create a diversion, two chariots
collide... the crowd roars... a gladiator is dragged
between a chariot and the side wall of the arena... the
drummers pound out their relentless tattoo...

Finally...

Maximus is on his horse across from the final chariot.

We can see that Juba and Vibius and a few other gladiators
are still alive.  The rest of the arena is polluted with
the dead and injured.

Maximus spurs his horse and gallops toward the final
chariot -- the charioteer whips his horses and zooms
toward Maximus --

The crowd is breathless -- watching the final battle --

Maximus and the chariot speed toward each other -- like
Medieval jousters --

And collide in a flashing explosion of steel --

Maximus sails from his horse -- as the charioteer sails
from his chariot --

Maximus lands hard but quickly pulls himself up, he races
to the final charioteer.  The charioteer is defeated but
not dead.

Maximus glances around, all his opponents are defeated.

He stands over the final charioteer.  Then he simply
tosses down his sword.

The crowd is stunned by this strange act of mercy.  But
then an enormous roar grows from the crowd -- wave after
wave of adulation for the hero of the day.

Maximus looks around, taking it all in.

Then he turns to the Imperial Box.

Maximus slowly walks to before the the Imperial Box.  The
Praetorian Archers immediately raise their bows, pointing
down at him.

Maximus glares up at Commodus through his helmet mask.
Commodus returns his gaze, curious.

The crowd is intrigued, growing quiet.  What is going on?

Then Maximus simply turns and begins walking away.

					COMMODUS
		Slave!  Who are you?

The Colosseum is suddenly silent.  The Emperor is speaking
to a gladiator.

Maximus keeps walking.

					COMMODUS
		SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU?

Maximus keeps walking, his fists clenched now.

Commodus suddenly grabs a spear from a nearby Praetorian
and hurls it with perfect aim -- the crowd gasps -- the
spear sails past Maximus -- actually nicking his shoulder
-- it slices into the sand ahead of Maximus.

Maximus stops.

					COMMODUS
		SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU?!

Maximus can hold it no longer.  He spins to Commodus --
ripping off his helmet mask -- and THUNDERING:

					MAXIMUS
		I AM MAXIMUS MERIDAS, GENERAL OF THE
		FELIX REGIMENT OF THE ROMAN ARMY AND
		SERVANT TO THE EMPEROR MARCUS
		AURELIUS!

Commodus eyes shoot wide -- Lucilla bolts up -- Gracchus
leans forward -- Proximo is stunned -- the crowd is
mystified --

					MAXIMUS
		I AM FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND
		HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE AND
		LANDLORD TO A MURDERED WORLD -- AND
		I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE!

The Praetorian Archers tense their bows -- ready to kill
the defiant slave --

But something extraordinary stops them.  Almost as one
being the crowd roars -- they leaps to their feet and
thrust their thumbs up!  They cheer and stomp their
approval of Maximus.

Commodus looks around at the people of Rome, amazed.

He finally plasters on a benevolent smile and thrusts his
thumb up!  The Praetorians lower their bows.

And the crowd cheers.  Never in the long, long history of
the Colosseum have they ever seen such a thing.

Maximus leads his gladiators out of the arena.

INT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

To our great surprise, Commodus is not raging.  He sits
quietly on the polished marble floor in front of a model
of the Colosseum.  He moves model pieces around in the
Colosseum, planning his festival.

Lucilla stands, tense.

					COMMODUS
		Why is he still alive?

					LUCILLA
		I don't know.

					COMMODUS
		He shouldn't be alive.  That vexes
		me.  I am terribly vexed...

Lucilla watches her brother cautiously, expecting the
explosion.  He carefully moves some model pieces in the
arena.

					COMMODUS
		There, that's better.  Do you like
		the platform here?

					LUCILLA
		Mmm.

					COMMODUS
		I do too.  Simple, elegant...

Lucilla is growing more and more unnerved at Commodus'
unusual serenity.

					COMMODUS
		Father would have wanted something
		more ornate but he's dead now.

A beat.  Commodus laughs.  A beat.

					COMMODUS
		Maximus Meridas haunts me.  I see
		Father turning away from me and
		gazing at him.  How many times did I
		suffer that indignity, I wonder?

					LUCILLA
		What are you going to do?

					COMMODUS
		I'm going to kill him.

					LUCILLA
		Good.

					COMMODUS
			(glances at her)
		Oh, you're too clever, Sister.
		Don't tell me part of you won't weep
		for him.

					LUCILLA
		When he defies my brother the
		Emperor, he defies me.  But you
		shouldn't send assassins.

					COMMODUS
		No?

					LUCILLA
		The people embraced him today.  They
		will be expecting his next match...
			(she kneels next to
			him)
		... let him die in the arena like
		the slave he is.  Let the people see
		what comes of defying Caesar.

A beat as he looks at her.

					COMMODUS
		He wounded you deeply, didn't he?
		Long ago.

She does not answer.

					COMMODUS
		Nonetheless, your political acumen
		is, as always, unerring.

He picks up a model tiger and puts it in the arena.  He
looks at the model tiger and smiles.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Maximus silently awaits Commodus' assassins with Juba.
They hear footsteps outside the cell.  Maximus stands,
preparing for death.

					JUBA
			(also standing)
		I will fight with you.

					MAXIMUS
		This isn't your battle.

					JUBA
		Better to die for a friend than to
		die for gold.

The door swings open and they are surprised to see Proximo
sweeping in with a cloaked woman.  The woman gives Proximo
a bag of money.

					PROXIMO
		Enjoy yourself, Madame...
			(he glances to
			Maximus)
		General, perform well and there will
		be riches for you.

He beckons to Juba, they go, shutting the door behind
them.  The woman pulls off her cloak, it is Lucilla.

Maximus glares at her, his muscles tensing.

					LUCILLA
		Rich matrons pay well to be
		pleasured by the bravest champions.

Maximus backs up, fighting the urge to strangle her on the
spot.  He finally bumps into a wall of the cell.

					MAXIMUS
		I knew your brother would send
		assassins.  I didn't think he would
		send his best.

					LUCILLA
		Maximus, listen to me --

					MAXIMUS
		My family were crucified and burnt
		while they were still alive.

					LUCILLA
		I knew nothing of that.

					MAXIMUS
			(low)
		Don't lie to me.

					LUCILLA
		I wept for them.

					MAXIMUS
		Don't.

A long, tense moment.

She does not look at him.

					LUCILLA
		Do you know what it is to be the
		daughter of the Emperor?  I learned
		on the night my father had my
		husband killed.  I loved my husband
		very much.  Very... simply.  He was
		a man who believed in the Republic.
		He was a man who thought Marcus
		should be tending to Rome and not
		conquering the world.  One night my
		father had him strangled for
		conspiring with the Senate.  My
		father never spoke of it.  I never
		spoke of it.  That is what it is to
		be the daughter of Rome.

She finally looks up at Maximus.

					LUCILLA
		My son will live.  He will survive
		this cursed bloodline.  Rome will
		die and the jackals will pick her
		clean -- but my son will survive.
		Empires come and go.  Cities crumble
		to dust.  Only family matters.

A beat.  Despite himself, Maximus is moved.

					MAXIMUS
		My son was innocent.

					LUCILLA
		So is mine.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		I want your brother dead.

					LUCILLA
		So do I.

A beat.  Maximus is surprised at her direct answer.

					LUCILLA
		My son will never be safe while he
		lives.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		How do you plan it?

					LUCILLA
		The Senate is with us, and the City
		Guard.  We have growing power in the
		streets.  But we need a leader.
		Someone the people can --

					MAXIMUS
		So the crown passes to your son.

					LUCILLA
		No.  So that my son will be safe.
		So that we may leave this charnel
		house forever and never look back.
		Look into my eyes, Maximus, and
		believe what I say to you...

She rivets him intensely with her eyes.

					LUCILLA
		By all the Gods, and in the name of
		my father who loved you, and in the
		name of the husband I loved... I
		swear to stand by your side in this
		now and always.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		What is your son's name?

					LUCILLA
		Lucius Verus.  Like his father.

					MAXIMUS
		I weep for him.

A long beat.  Maximus' cold eyes give away nothing.

Lucilla turns and starts to go.  She stops, not looking
back.

					LUCILLA
		Commodus plans to kill you in your
		next match in the arena.  He's
		planning something.  I will pray for
		you.  As I have always done.

She then pulls something from her robes and sets it down,
a little bundle wrapped in cloth.  She sweeps out.  The
sound of the door being bolted shut on the other side.

Maximus stands for a moment and then goes to what she has
left.  He opens the cloth.  Inside are his six "ancestor"
figures.

He picks up one of the figures.  He looks at it deeply,
gently feeling along the contours with a finger.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

The Colosseum is again packed.  Commodus, Lucilla and her
son Lucius are in the Imperial Box.

It is late in the day and teams of slaves are cleaning the
arena after a bout.  They haul off carcasses and toss down
fresh sand.

Meanwhile, Cassius is orating to the crowd:

					CASSIUS
		... in his majestic charity the
		Emperor has deigned to this day
		favor the people of Rome with an
		historical final match.  Returning
		to the Colosseum today... after five
		years in retirement... Caesar is
		pleased to bring you... THE ONLY
		UNDEFEATED CHAMPION IN ROMAN
		HISTORY...
			(the crowd is going
			mad)
		... THE LEGENDARY... TIGER OF GAUL!!

The crowd erupts in paroxysms of joy as TIGER explodes
into the arena in an ornate chariot.  Tiger is a fierce
man in his 40's, his brutal, scarred face and hugely
muscled body a testament to his many years in the arena.

Tiger speeds around the rim of the arena in his chariot,
raising an arm in triumph.  The crowd roars.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Proximo stands with Maximus, who is busy strapping on
armor.

					PROXIMO
		Gods!  That old Homicide!  The
		Emperor must truly hate you.

					MAXIMUS
		What can you tell me?

					PROXIMO
		He cheats.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Tiger waits.  He stands in the center of the arena.  He
has only a traditional short sword.  The crowd is
breathless with anticipation.  As:

					CASSIUS
			(orating)
		And from the rocky promontories and
		martial bloodlines of Spain...
		representing the training lyceum of
		Proximo Antoninus... I give you...
		THE WARRIOR MAXIMUS!

The crowd cheers.  Maximus appears from his gate.  His
fans have increased in number considerably.  They eagerly
crane forward and celebrate him.

Meanwhile, Maximus looks at Tiger.  Only one man with a
sword?  Maximus approaches, cautious but confident.

He stops a few feet from Tiger.  They lock eyes, salute
each other and then turn to the Imperial Box, raising
their swords.

The crowd waits eagerly for the immortal words...

					MAXIMUS AND TIGER
		We who are about to die salute you.

The crowd cheers and Maximus immediately turns and starts
slashing -- Tiger easily blocks and strikes back --

The sword play is very fast -- they block and parry and
hack like lightning -- constantly attacking -- they are
perfectly matched --

As he fights Maximus becomes aware of a strange sound over
the roar of the crowd -- a low rumbling -- then he feels
something -- a vibration in the ground --

Suddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous
platforms rise into view.  On each platform is a snarling
Bengal tiger restrained by a chain.  Tiger's teams of
"cornermen" hold the chains through a pulley system.  The
cornermen are safely inside cages.  The platforms stop at
ground level.

The four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the
battleground.

Tiger takes advantage of Maximus' momentary confusion and
assaults brutally -- forcing him back toward one of the
tigers -- the tiger claws for Maximus -- Maximus just
evades it claws -- rolls for a new position -- another
tiger snaps at him --

Tiger attacks -- Maximus is on the defensive -- fighting
off Tiger and evading the four snarling beasts --

And then all four tigers are suddenly closer.  The teams
of cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit,
gradually reducing the size of the battle ground.  The
crowd roars.

But the fight is hardly fair.

Whenever Tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen
pull back the tiger slightly -- when Maximus is near a
tiger they let it out a bit.

Maximus and Tiger fight -- swirling action -- finally,
Maximus has the edge -- he circles so that the sun stabs
into Tiger's eyes -- then Maximus lunges forward under
Tiger's swinging sword and SLAMS into him -- they fall --
a tiger swats at Maximus' face -- he jerks his head back
-- he shoots out a leg and kicks Tiger's sword toward one
of the tigers -- it is out of reach -- Maximus leaps up
and stands over the winded Tiger, sword to his throat.

Tiger is gasping for breath, crushed.

Then one of Tiger's corners suddenly cheats -- they
completely release a tiger -- it leaps for Maximus --

Maximus barely has time to turn -- the tiger crashes into
him -- its claws slashing into his back, cutting through
his leather armor -- Maximus shoves an armored forearm
into the tiger's jaws and stabs with his sword --

Tiger takes this chance to pull himself up -- one of his
corners throws him another sword -- the crowd boos --

Maximus wrestles with the tiger -- spinning it around with
superhuman effort so it is always between himself and
Tiger -- so that Tiger can't get at him --

Maximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for Tiger -- he
quickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground --

Maximus stands over him -- ready to administer the coup de
grace.

All eyes turn to the Emperor.

Commodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the
Imperial Box.  He raises his arm and gives the fatal
thumbs down.

Maximus looks up at him.

And then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground,
refusing to kill Tiger.

Commodus is stunned.

The crowd gasps -- a collective intake of breath -- and
then an enormous roar building.  It cascades around the
Colosseum.  It is a roaring celebration of the unexpected
act of mercy.  And the delicious act of defiance of the
Emperor.

Commodus slowly sits.

Maximus walks across the arena -- the people stand and
cheer for him.  Cries of "Maximus the Merciful" can be
heard.

It is the birth of a hero.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Maximus is resting in his cell after the battle, head
down, deep in thought.

					LUCIUS' VOICE
		Is it true you're a General...?

Maximus looks up, Lucius is standing at his cell.  Maximus
has no idea who the boy is -- just another young fan --
but Maximus is immediately struck by Lucius' resemblance
to his own son.

					MAXIMUS
		I was a General.

					LUCIUS
		I saw you fight.  The Carthage
		battle too.  I've never seen so much
		courage.

					MAXIMUS
		It doesn't take courage to kill.

					LUCIUS
		My father was killed.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		I'm sorry.

					LUCIUS
		He still comes to me in my dreams.
		Do you have a father?

					MAXIMUS
		I had a father.  He wasn't really my
		father but I cared for him very much.

					LUCIUS
		I hope he comes to you in your
		dreams.  My father and I ride horses
		in mine.

These simple words strike something deep in Maximus.

Lucilla appears from the shadows and puts her hands on
Lucius' shoulders.

					LUCILLA
		Lucius, run along now.  I need to
		talk to the General.

Lucius runs off to his Male ATTENDANT, who leads him away.

A long beat as Maximus and Lucilla look at each other.

Finally:

					MAXIMUS
		Where is my army?

A drum beat is heard.  It increases throughout the
following scenes, building momentum like a Roman gallery
accelerating to ramming speed.

The conspiracy scenes are enclosed in a montage of scenes
in and around the arena showing Maximus' growing
popularity with the People of Rome...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Maximus is fighting an opponent.

The drums continue...

INT.  THE SENATE - DAY

Lucilla conspires with Senators Gracchus and Gaius and
Captain Marcellus in a dark corner of the Senate.
Whispers.

					LUCILLA
		... Maximus will summon his army
		from Ostia and he will strike from
		the inside as his army strikes from
		the outside.  But he insists that
		the Senate be present.

					GAIUS
		We've been ordered to attend.

					LUCILLA
		How many are with us?

					GRACCHUS
		About half.  But once the tyrant is
		dead.  All.

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		I want to meet him.

					LUCILLA
		I'll arrange it.

					GAIUS
		And what of the Emperor?

A beat.

					LUCILLA
		He has withdrawn.  He's not eating.
		He doesn't go out.  He won't even
		see me... I don't know what tempests
		rage within him but...

					GRACCHUS
		We should fear for the blackest
		storm.

					LUCILLA
		Yes.

A beat.

					GAIUS
		One question... who is to be the
		actual Regicide?

A beat.  She glances at him.

The drums continue...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Maximus defeats his opponent.  He stands over him.  He
does not kill him.

He tosses his sword down and walks away.  The crowd goes
crazy, roaring their approval of Maximus.

Senator Falco, sits in the stands and watches with some
alarm.  He glances around as the crowd exalts Maximus.  He
is becoming a hero to the people.

The drums continue...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Maximus returns to the holding cells.  Vibius and Juba are
waiting.

					VIBIUS
		You didn't kill him.

					MAXIMUS
		I will not kill another warrior.
		There is no honor to it.

Maximus goes.  Vibius thinks about it, listening to the
adulation of the crowd.

The drums continue...

INT./ EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - ROMAN STREETS - DAY

Maximus and the other gladiators are in a slave cart on
the way from the arena.  A gang of children run alongside
the cart, cheering and chanting:

					KIDS
		Maximus the Merciful!  Maximus the
		Merciful!

The drums continue...

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Maximus and Juba are with Lucilla and Gracchus.  Lucilla
is writing on a piece of parchment.

					MAXIMUS
		Tell him we will enter Rome on the
		first day of Commodus' festival.

					LUCILLA
		And they will march on Rome for you?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.  But this letter must go to the
		lieutenant named Titus, no one else.

					LUCILLA
		Captain Marcellus will take it.  And
		his City Guard will by with you when
		you get to Rome.  Is that enough to
		face the Praetorian Guard?

					MAXIMUS
			(looks to her)
		The Felix Regiment will never be
		defeated.

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		I only have one question for you,
		General... Why?

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		You will lead an army of your
		brothers on Rome.  Many will die.
		Why?

					MAXIMUS
		I want Commodus dead.

					GRACCHUS
		That's not the reason.  Tell me the
		truth.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		Because one night an old man
		whispered to me about a dream.  I
		will die for that dream.

A long beat.

					GRACCHUS
		I knew the old man well.  And I
		loved him very much.  In our youth
		we would spend hours building that
		dream together.  After he went to
		the wars and lost his way... I was
		very cruel.  I tormented him to
		remember that dream we spoke of.

					MAXIMUS
		He did.

					GRACCHUS
		You can have no idea how much that
		means to me.

A beat.

					GRACCHUS
		Any man who will die for a whispered
		dream deserves my respect.  I honor
		you, General.

The drums continue...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Vibius defeats an opponent -- he stands over him.  He
looks around at the crowd.  Then he tosses down his sword
and walks off.

The crowd goes mad with pleasure.  Vibius eats it up,
raising his arms and soaking up the applause.

Maximus watches from the holding cells.  He smiles.

The drums continue...

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Proximo supervises as a huge banner is unfurled.  It
covers the side of a tall building.

It shows a dramatic painting of Maximus.

Proximo supervises happily as torches and braziers are lit
to illuminate the mammoth banner.

The drums continue...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

The ending of a group fight -- Proximo's gladiators
triumphant.

The crowd waits for the delicious act of defiance.  We
note many placard and banners honoring "MAXIMUS THE
MERCIFUL."

Maximus, Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators toss down
their weapons and walk off, leaving their opponents alive.

The crowd roars.  They have completely embraced Maximus
and his fellow gladiators.

Gracchus, in the stands, laughs.

The drums finally conclude.

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBER - DAY

Lucilla is with her HANDMAIDEN.  They sit before a large
mirror, the Handmaiden perfecting Lucilla's makeup for the
day.

One of Commodus' Centurion Body Guards enters, bows.

					CENTURION
		Madame, the Emperor would like to
		see you.

Lucilla quickly glances to her Handmaiden in the mirror
and then braces herself, stands, and quickly leaves with
the Centurion.

INT.  PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

Lucilla strides quickly, nervously, down the long corridor
to Commodus' chambers.  She enters...

INT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - DAY

Commodus is wrapped in a sheet, gazing out a window.

					LUCILLA
		Caesar...

He turns.  She stops.

He looks as if he has not slept for days.  If a word could
now sum up his clouded face it is this:  tormented.

She goes to him, embraces him.  He holds her tightly.

					COMMODUS
		I am sorry to have kept you away...
		I needed this time to think...

					LUCILLA
		Of course...

He moves away from her, slowly moving around the room.

					COMMODUS
		I limited my world to these four
		walls so as to let my mind free...
		again and again my mind settles on
		but one question... What kind of
		world are we making when the people
		of Rome prefer a slave in the arena
		to their father?

A beat.  Commodus' strange philosophical bent is unnerving
Lucilla.

					COMMODUS
		It is my responsibility to make the
		world as it should be.  How is it I
		have made this world?

					LUCILLA
		Brother, do not be influenced by the
		mob.  They are a great, faceless
		beast --

					COMMODUS
		They are not "the mob," Lucilla,
		they are the people.  They are my
		children and all I want to do is
		love them.

A beat.  He stands before a bust of Marcus Aurelius.  He
touches it.

					COMMODUS
		Our father loved Maximus... and I
		love him still... yet he defies me,
		he tasks me in front of my children.
		And they love him for it.  Just as
		Marcus loved him for it.  Tell me
		why, Lucilla.

					LUCILLA
		They see themselves in him.  They
		throw in their own sad dreams
		alongside his.  They think he fights
		for them.

					COMMODUS
		And what do I do but fight for
		them?!  I give them games to please
		them.  I strangle dissent to give
		them peace.  I empower the
		Praetorians to give them order.
		What more can I do?!

A beat.

					COMMODUS
		Say I should fight him, in the
		arena.  Let my children see who the
		Gods truly favor.

					LUCILLA
		And what if he should win?

A beat.

Commodus continues to slowly move around the room.

					COMMODUS
		A God is more powerful than a man...

This odd statement hangs in the air for a moment.  Then:

					LUCILLA
		Caesar, you let this unduly worry
		you.  At best he is a passing fancy
		-- he is a name, an image on a
		banner, ephemeral -- he will be
		forgotten as the next fancy
		appears --

					COMMODUS
		But I need to know -- why do they
		love him?

					LUCILLA
		Mercy.

He stops.  Looks at her.

					LUCILLA
		He will not kill in the arena.  He
		is merciful.  As they all wish they
		were in their own hearts.

Something in her words has struck a chord in him.

					COMMODUS
		And for that moment in the arena
		they are merciful too.  For a
		moment... they are Gods.  Offering
		life.

He looks at her.

					COMMODUS
		But who can be more merciful than
		the Emperor of Rome?

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Maximus is fighting a thick GIANT of a man.  A few quick
blows and the Giant falls -- like a mighty tree he crashes
to the sand.

The arena cheers their hero.

Maximus stands over the beaten Giant.  The crowd waits for
the famous act.

Maximus salutes the Giant and tosses down his sword,
refusing to kill.  He walks away.

The arena explodes in cheers -- a chant of "Maximus the
Merciful" grows to deafening proportions.

Suddenly the arena is filled with Praetorians -- they
block Maximus' exit from the arena -- the crowd boos --
horrified --

The Praetorians surround Maximus.  He is unarmed, but
coils for the inevitable battle.

Then the Praetorians part...

And Commodus walks through them.  He carries something
wrapped in a rich cloth.  Maximus glares at him.

The Praetorians move back and the crowd watches eagerly.
The Emperor and the Gladiator, at last.

Maximus and Commodus stare at each other.  The crowd
cannot hear what is said, but strain to observe this
incredible confrontation.

					COMMODUS
		Brother... we've taken a sad path
		since we were children at Capri,
		have we not?

Maximus doesn't answer.

					COMMODUS
		For my own part... I am sorry it
		came to this.  And to you alone of
		all men, I acknowledge my errors.
		And my regret.  I shall live with my
		sin for all my days.

					MAXIMUS
		As will I, Commodus.  As will I.

Commodus unwraps the cloth bundle.  Inside is a small
wooden sword.  He holds it up so the crowd can see.

A collective gasp.  The wooden sword, prized by all
gladiators above all else.  Freedom.

					COMMODUS
		As the first act of my contrition I
		offer you the wooden sword of
		freedom.

He holds out the wooden sword.  A beat.

					COMMODUS
		Take it, brother.  Stand at my side
		as a free man worthy of your
		ancestors.

					MAXIMUS
		I only have ancestors because of
		you, brother.  You killed everything
		that ever lived alongside me.

A beat.

					COMMODUS
		Take it, Maximus.  Let us heal that
		fatal wound together.

					MAXIMUS
		This is the new home you cursed me
		to.  And I am safer here from your
		treachery than I could ever be
		outside.

					COMMODUS
		Will you always mistrust me?

					MAXIMUS
		Why don't you ask your father that?

Commodus visibly flinches at that, but still holds the
wooden sword out.  The crowd is breathless.

					MAXIMUS
		I have more power as a slave in the
		arena than I could ever have as a
		free man.  As the Colosseum goes,
		the people go.  As the people go,
		the Empire goes.

					COMMODUS
			(tense)
		You think this is power?  I could
		show you power, slave --

					MAXIMUS
		No, Caesar... I will show you.

With that, Maximus does the unimaginable.  He simply turns
his back on the Emperor and walks away.

And the crowd goes mad.  They cheer the defiant gladiator,
their champion.

And, equally, they deride the Emperor.  They mock him by
holding out food and trash like Commodus is holding out
the wooden sword.  They laugh and jeer.

Commodus glances around at his children, lost.

Then he turns to the Imperial Box.  He sees Lucilla
slipping out the back of the box.  He watches her go.

And the crowd continues to jeer.

EXT.  STREET THEATER - NIGHT

The crowd laughs riotously as Roman Actors perform a
typically ribald comedy in a secluded street:

An outrageously dressed version of Maximus is parading
around on an outrageously dressed version of Commodus,
riding him like a donkey and slapping his rear with a
wooden sword.  The "Commodus" actor mews and brays and
wails like an infant.

Captain Marcellus of the City Guard gallops past them, on
his way out of Rome.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - DAY

Maximus stands with Juba and Vibius.  He draws a circle in
the sand with a stick.  He draws a line to the circle.

					MAXIMUS
		The Felix Regiment will come from
		here.  We'll face the body of the
		Praetorians outside -- here.  Once
		inside, my archers will take up
		position to counter opposition
		inside the Colosseum.  I'll enter
		and join you -- we'll attack here --

Maximus draws a line to the Imperial Box.

					MAXIMUS
		-- a covert assault from within.

					VIBIUS
		We'll be killed.

					MAXIMUS
		Probably.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		But if we aren't... think of the
		glory.  Do you remember glory,
		Gladiator?

					JUBA
		And if we die that day -- we die
		free men worthy of our ancestors.

					VIBIUS
		You didn't know my ancestors.  A
		rotten bunch.

Maximus points to the huge statue of Mars.

					MAXIMUS
		Then be worthy of him.  The old
		Titan who would rather die bravely
		in a just battle than slink off to
		grow old and fat.

					JUBA
		And impotent.

A beat.  Vibius thinks about it.

					VIBIUS
		If I die, I want a hundred whores at
		my funeral.

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - EVENING

Commodus sweeps in.  Thinks Lucilla is standing there.
The woman turns, it is Lucilla's Handmaiden.

					COMMODUS
		Where is my sister?

					HANDMAIDEN
		She's out, sir...

					COMMODUS
		Where?

					HANDMAIDEN
		I... don't know, Caesar.

Commodus looks at her for a moment.

And then he slowly walks right to her.  His face an inch
away from hers.

					COMMODUS
		Where is my sister?

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

Proximo sits, considering Maximus.

					MAXIMUS
		Was it Centurion...?  General...?

					PROXIMO
		Captain.

A beat.

					PROXIMO
		How did you know?

					MAXIMUS
		A soldier knows a soldier.

A beat.

					PROXIMO
		All that was a long time ago.  Too
		much wine and too many women.  And
		too much money.

					MAXIMUS
		No --

					PROXIMO
		This is who I am...
			(he pats his ample
			belly)
		You see?  There was a time I would
		stand against ten men and never give
		an inch, spitting into the jaws of
		Hades all the while.  There was a
		time my heart swelled to strap on
		the armor of Rome.  But now...

Something flashes across Proximo's eyes, something like
tragedy.

					PROXIMO
		Now I am just an entertainer.

A pause.

					MAXIMUS
		You said something to me once.  You
		said in this life, we all die.  All
		we can choose is how we die.  And
		how we are remembered.  Do you
		recall those words?

					PROXIMO
		Yes.

					MAXIMUS
		Then be remembered proudly.  This is
		your time, Proximo.  Stand at my
		side and be what you were.  What you
		truly are.  One last time.

A beat.

Proximo suddenly begins to weep rather histrionically --
Maximus is a bit taken aback -- Proximo dramatically
flicks tears from his eyes -- and then can't keep the show
up -- he bursts into laughter.

Maximus stares at him.

					PROXIMO
			(laughing)
		You might have spared yourself the
		speech, General.  The lady Lucilla
		bought all my gladiators two hours
		ago!

					MAXIMUS
		You pox-ridden bastard -- !   

					PROXIMO
		I am the richest trainer in the
		Empire!  And I will let my
		gladiators do anything you like!
		Conspire away, General!

Maximus can only laugh as well.

					PROXIMO
		But I tell you -- if you survive
		this madness I want you to go into
		business with me.  I'll give you a
		quarter of my holdings.

					MAXIMUS
			(standing)
		A quarter?!

					PROXIMO
		A third.  And not a hair more.  And
		you'll have to start in the
		provinces!  Cleaning up the lion
		shit!

					MAXIMUS
		You know, if you were half so awful
		as you pretend, you'd be a
		terrifying man.

Maximus shakes his head, smiling, and goes.

Proximo sits for a moment.

Then he rises and goes to a heavy chest.  He looks at the
chest for a moment and then opens it.

Inside is his old Lorica Segmentata.  He gazes at his
armor, considering what he once was.  And what he now is.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Maximus enters.  Lucilla is waiting, extremely tense.

					MAXIMUS
		Lucilla --

					LUCILLA
		Don't even say it.  I know it's
		dangerous -- but I had to see you.
		Captain Marcellus has gone to the
		army with your message as you
		instructed.

					MAXIMUS
		Good.

					LUCILLA
		He says the City Guard will be ready
		at the south road at noon.  They can
		only wait for an hour so --

					MAXIMUS
		You've told me this already.

					LUCILLA
		Did I?  All right then.  So
		everything is prepared.  The Senate
		will be in attendance and you have
		your gladiators -- the usual cohort
		of Praetorians will be inside the
		arena --

					MAXIMUS
		Lucilla... why are you here?

A pause.

					LUCILLA
		Tell me honestly... please... do you
		think it will work?

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		No.

					LUCILLA
		Do you think we'll all die?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

She leans against a wall.

A pause.

					LUCILLA
		Will you swear something to me?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					LUCILLA
		Will you swear it on the memory of
		your son?

A long beat.

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.

					LUCILLA
		By all that you have ever loved...
		swear that if you survive you will
		take my son out of Rome.  Swear that
		you will go far away and never
		return.

He steps to her.

					MAXIMUS
			(deeply)
		I will.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		And if I should not survive... swear
		to me that you will honor my family
		in your prayers always.

					LUCILLA
		I will.

A long, difficult beat.  She fights back tears.

					LUCILLA
		Had I not been the daughter of
		Rome...

He puts a gentle finger to her lips.

					MAXIMUS
		Shhh... my heart breaks enough.

He holds her closely, tenderly.

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Lucilla enters, deep in thought, still drained from her
meeting with Maximus.

She suddenly stops.  Frozen.

Commodus is sitting across the chamber, Lucius at his
knee.  An open scroll on Commodus' lap.

					COMMODUS
		Sister... join us.  I've been
		reading to dear Lucius.

					LUCIUS
		I've been reading too.

					COMMODUS
		Yes, he's a very smart little boy.
		He'll make a grand Emperor one day.

Lucilla has not moved.

					COMMODUS
		Join us, sister.

Lucilla goes to them, sits.

					COMMODUS
		We've been reading about the great
		Julius and his adventures in Egypt.

					LUCIUS
		She killed herself with a snake!

					COMMODUS
			(to Lucius)
		And just wait until you hear what
		happened to some of our other
		ancestors!  If you're very good,
		tomorrow night I'll tell you the
		story of Emperor Claudius.  He was
		betrayed!  By those closest to
		him...
			(he glances up to
			Lucilla)
		... by his own blood... they
		whispered in dark corners and went
		out late at night and conspired and
		conspired...

Lucilla looks as if she is going to be ill.

Lucius is busy scanning the scroll.  Commodus gently
strokes his hair, his cold eyes never leaving Lucilla's.

					COMMODUS
		But the Emperor Claudius knew that
		they were up to something dire.  He
		knew they were busy little bees.
		And one night he sat down with one
		of them and he looked at her and he
		said:  "Tell me what you have been
		doing, busy little bee, or I shall
		strike down those dearest to you.
		You shall watch as I bathe in their
		blood."  And the bee knew he spoke
		the truth, for the Emperor always
		speaks the truth.  And what do you
		think happened then, Lucius?

					LUCIUS
			(still pouring over
			the scrolls)
		I don't know, Uncle.

					COMMODUS
			(glaring at Lucilla)
		The bee told him everything.

Lucilla's face is tortured.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

Proximo is asleep -- a sound outside wakes him -- the
steady clip-clop of horses on stone.  A lot of horses.

He rises and goes to a window overlooking the street
outside.

A stern Praetorian Guard cavalry unit is cantering into
position at his gates.  Proximo grabs his clothes --

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

With cool military precision the Praetorians take up
position at the gates before Proximo's compound, an
unassailable line.  They quickly prepare their bows.

Meanwhile, another Praetorian unit has taken up position
at the other end of Proximo's compound -- sealing that
entrance as well.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Proximo is hurrying across his open courtyard when the
first flaming arrow arches into the compound -- it is
followed by hundreds more --

The Praetorians on either end of his compound keep up a
ceaseless hail of flaming arrows -- everything begins to
burn -- the caged gladiators are stirring now --
shouting --

Proximo races to his panicked guards --

					PROXIMO
		Release them!  Release them all!
		ARM THEM!

The guards sprint to the cells -- unlocking the gladiators
as quickly as they can --

Not quick enough for many -- Praetorians are now pouring
pitch through the gutter that runs along the bottom of the
cells -- igniting it and incinerating all those trapped
inside --

The compound is soon a raging inferno --

Proximo releases Maximus and Juba --

					PROXIMO
		Come --

					MAXIMUS
		But --

					PROXIMO
		If you want to live -- follow me --

					VIBIUS
			(calling to them)
		Go, Spaniard!  We'll show these
		Roman dogs how gladiators fight!   

Proximo hauls Maximus and Juba off as Vibius and the other
gladiators arm themselves --

INT.  TUNNELS - NIGHT

Proximo is leading Maximus and Juba quickly through a
decaying cramped tunnel.

					PROXIMO
		All the old gladiator schools have
		tunnels to the Colosseum -- most
		have long since collapsed --

					JUBA
		How did they know?

					MAXIMUS
		We were betrayed.

					JUBA
			(stops)
		I'll stay here.  In case they
		follow.

Maximus stops as well.

					JUBA
		Go!  Bring us the army!

Maximus nods.

					PROXIMO
		Quickly --

He leads Maximus down the disintegrating catacomb of
tunnels --

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Vibius hoped to die fighting -- he never got the chance.

It is not a battle, it is a slaughter.

The Praetorians ruthlessly shoot anyone even approaching
the gates -- all the walls are covered -- most of the
gladiators die in the hellish inferno -- the relentless
rain of flaming arrows continues --

Vibius coughs in the thick smoke and rages for someone to
fight -- Praetorian snipers cut him down -- he dies
reaching for the statue of Mars.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - SUBTERRANEAN - NIGHT

Proximo and Maximus emerge deep in the bowels of the
Colosseum.

					PROXIMO
			(points)
		Down that corridor is the butchery
		-- the blood sloughs lead to the
		Tiber.  Gods watch over you.

					MAXIMUS
		You're not coming?

					PROXIMO
		They are killing my men!

He races back into the tunnel.

Maximus moves quickly down the corridor.  He can finally
see...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - BUTCHERY - NIGHT

Grisly carcasses of every description hang from hooks.
Two bored butchers hack them up.  The good bits are tossed
into a wagon to fed to the Colosseum animals.  The waste
and offal are shoveled into a large sewer opening.  A
butcher occasionally lifts a sluice-gate and a gush of
water flows into the sewer from above, washing down the
blood and carcasses.

Maximus crouches and creeps through the nightmare of
hanging carcasses and flies.

When the butchers are looking elsewhere, Maximus creeps to
the sewer opening and climbs in -- he immediately slides
down for a few yards in the slanting, slippery blood
sluice -- out of sight --

Then he thuds to a stop.  He can go no further because the
remains of an animal carcass blocks his way.  He tries to
slither past the carcass --

Finally, one of the butchers above lifts the sluice-gate
and a torrent of water flows down.

Maximus is washed down the hideous sewer.

INT.  TUNNELS - NIGHT

Proximo and Juba are quickly marching back down the tunnel
toward the compound -- they are very close now -- the roar
of flame is heard -- the creak of falling timber -- and
the screams of burning men.  They run.

They round a corner and see there is no way past the world
of flame ahead of them.  The tunnel to the compound has
collapsed.

					PROXIMO
		Gods... they're killing them all.

Proximo leads them up a cramped stairway to...

EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

They emerge through a sewer entrance -- right into the
arms of the Praetorian Guard.  Proximo and Juba are bound.
Proximo sees his compound burning.  Sees the Praetorian
archers taking out any last survivors.  Hears the screams.

INT./ EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - ARREST MONTAGE - NIGHT

A quick sequence of brutal arrests as Praetorian Guard
units round up many associated with the plot.  And many
that are not.

GAIUS' BEDROOM:  Gaius and his wife are yanked awake and
hauled out.

CHRISTIAN HOME:  A congregation of Christians is chained
together, their secret altar smashed.

CAFE:  Greek Scholars are hauled away from their scrolls.

STREET THEATER:  Actors are dragged off in the midst of a
performance.

GRACCHUS' STEAM ROOM:  Gracchus is enjoying grapes with
his handsome catamite.  A unit of Praetorian bursts in.
Gracchus looks at them.  Sighs.

INT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

Commodus stands with Lucius on a balcony overlooking the
city.

The roaring flames of the fire at Proximo's compound can
easily be seen.

					LUCIUS
		What is that fire?

					COMMODUS
		Why that's a bonfire, Lucius.  I
		arranged it just for you.

He puts his hand on the boy's shoulder.

Behind them, Lucilla sits slumped in a chair.  Her face is
a mask of anguish at what she has been forced to do.

Two Praetorians enter with a bucket.

					PRAETORIAN
		Caesar...

Commodus goes to them.  He talks quietly with them for a
moment and glances at what they are carrying.

					COMMODUS
		Oh... that's for my sister.

They bring the bucket to Lucilla and set it before her.

Commodus ignores her and goes back to Lucius on the
balcony.

Lucilla glances inside the bucket...

Captain Marcellus' head is floating in brine.  Lucilla
moans.  All is lost.

EXT.  TIBER RIVER - NIGHT

Maximus splashes to the surface of the filthy Tiber,
gasping for air.

Animal carcasses float up next to him.  He grabs onto one
and floats down the gently flowing river.

EXT.  ITALIAN FRONT - CAMP - DAWN

The Wolf of Rome sleeps.  Then its ears rise.  Then its
head.  It sniffs the air.  The wolf slowly rises and
begins loping through the camp.

It passes slumbering soldiers and tents, smoke lazily
drifting up from campfires.

The wolf finally stops and looks up.

Maximus is on a horse.  He climbs down.  The wolf goes to
him and licks his hand.

Maximus begins marching through the camp, the wolf at his
side.  Soldiers stir, amazed to see their General is
alive.

Gallus leaps up, stunned, and goes to Maximus.  They
continue to march through the camp, more and more
astonished soldiers joining them.

They march toward the large tents at the center of the
encampment.

Titus emerges from his tent.  Slams to a stop --

					TITUS
		By all the Gods...

He goes to Maximus and embraces him.

					MAXIMUS
		Old friend...

					TITUS
		You're returned from Hades!  By all
		the Gods!

					MAXIMUS
		Where is he?

Just then Quintus emerges from the largest tent.  He
stares at Maximus, unbelieving.

A long beat as they look at each other.

Quintus knows his destiny.  With quiet dignity he begins
whispering a prayer.  Maximus moves to him, embracing him:

					MAXIMUS
		I forgive you.

He stabs Quintus with a dagger as he embraces him.
Quintus falls.

A beat.

Titus goes to the dead Quintus and pulls the seal of
office from his uniform.  He hands it to Maximus.

An enormous roar of celebration from the Felix Regiment.

INT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - MORNING

A castrati choir sings a gentle hymn of celebration.
Their eerie voices and otherworldly harmonies undulate
around Commodus' bedroom.

The Emperor himself is in a chair, wrapped in a robe.  His
body slaves work over him closely.

He is staring into a mirror, lost in another world as the
slaves carefully apply golden eye makeup to him.

The castrati hymn continues...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE COLOSSEUM - DAY

The hymn is all we hear as we see crowds moving into the
Colosseum...

It seems that all of Rome is here for this great day.
Huge throngs of citizens move like a massive wave toward
the Colosseum entrances.  Vendors are doing brisk
business.  Praetorian units in full dress uniform canter
past.

We elegantly float up along the outer tiers of the
Colosseum and then glide over the edge to see the arena
stands...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

The hymn is all we hear as we see...   

The stands are filling.  We see the rich and poor alike.
We see the orator Cassius.  We see Senator Falco and most
of the Senate.  We see the cohort of fifty Praetorian
taking up position around the Imperial Box.

A golden platform, with stairs down to the arena sand, now
extends about twenty feet from the Imperial Box to a spot
over the arena.

We float down the stairs and then we see the arena
itself...

It is stunning in its simplicity.

The days victims are tied to posts in the center of the
arena.  Suspended above them is an enormous cloud.  A
thick, tumescent bladder painted to look like a
threatening rain cloud.

We see Proximo and Juba.  We see Senators Gracchus and
Gaius.  We see Gaius' wife and Gracchus catamite and
Christian families and scholars and actors.

Seven stylized hills surround them.

The hymn comes to its soaring conclusion as we see the
damned.

TIME CUT:

Later.  By now, the Colosseum is packed.  All fifty-five
thousand seats are taken.  Another ten thousand stand
wherever they can.  A feral anticipation buzzes through
the crowd.

Outside the Colosseum, the streets are crowded with
thousands more who couldn't get in.

Trumpets blare.

Commodus' six Centurion Body Guards stride into the
Imperial Box.

Then Commodus enters.  He is shrouded in a full lion's
skin, the head of the lion concealing his own.  His head
is down, he does not look up.

Lucilla and Lucius enter after him and sit.  Lucilla's
face is drained, her eyes defeated.  Lucius is wearing a
miniature set of Lorica Segmentata, complete with
ceremonial dagger.

EXT.  ROMAN STREET - DAY

A mangy dog is slowly crossing a dusty street on the
outskirts of Rome.  The street is deserted.  It seems that
almost everyone is at the Colosseum.

The dog stops.  Looks up.

Then a sound is heard.  The steady cadence of horses'
hooves.

The Felix Regiment rounds a corner.  Maximus leads the
cavalry.  He wears Lorica Segmentata.  His corps of
archers and soldiers follow.  They troop down the dusty
street.

Maximus and the cavalry canter past the mystified dog.

QUICK CUTS:

The Felix Regiment moves through the streets.  The few
pedestrians quickly disappear into shops and around
corners.  The roar of the Colosseum can be heard far in
the distance...

Arrows slice into isolated Praetorian sentries.  The Felix
Regiment continues its stealth invasion...

Finally, Maximus reins his horse and his troops stop.

The mounted City Guard are waiting.

Without a word, the City Guard joins Maximus and the two
combined forces continue their inexorable march to the
Colosseum.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

Commodus, still swathed in the lion skin, his head down,
slowly walks out on the platform that now extends from the
Imperial Box.

The crowd grows hushed.

Commodus reaches the end of the platform and waits for a
moment.  Then he dramatically flings off the lion skin.

The crowd gasps.

He is almost naked, his entire chiseled body is painted in
gold.  His eyes are lost in an eerie reverie as he looks
around at his people.

He finally speaks:

					COMMODUS
			(serene)
		Rome... This is the day that was
		foretold.  This is the day when your
		father takes away all fear...
			(he holds up his
			hands)
		With these hands I shall destroy
		your enemies so that you may sleep
		always and forever in peace.  From
		this day forth let it be known that
		I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,
		have surmounted mortality.  That I,
		Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,
		assume my destined place... at the
		side of the Gods.

The crowd is stunned.  A few scattered laughs.

Lucilla stares at him, disbelieving.

					COMMODUS
		And as a righteous God, I shall ever
		protect you.  I shall cradle the
		world on my benevolent hands and
		clasp it to my heart.  So I have
		spoken!  And let the heavens tremble
		at my might!

EXT.  ROMAN STREETS - DAY

Maximus continues to lead the combined Felix Regiment and
City Guard cavalry through the streets.  The roaring is
closer now.  They are nearing the Colosseum, they can just
glimpse the edge of the top tier over some building.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

Commodus continues:

					COMMODUS
		This day I reclaim Rome for her
		people.  I shall give you the
		rebirth of your Empire!  Reborn and
		cleansed of her enemies!

He raises his arms.  At his cue the Praetorian archers
raise their bows, ready, aiming at the victims.

					COMMODUS
		I will make a new Rome!  Founded as
		it was at the beginning!  Archers --
		GIVE US BLOOD!

The Praetorians suddenly point their bows higher and
fire --

They shoot the cloud -- the bladder EXPLODES and thick
blood rains down on the victims -- the blood splashes over
them, coating them.

EXT.  OUTSIDE COLOSSEUM - DAY

The roar from the Colosseum is now deafening as Maximus
and the City Guard round the final corner -- the Colosseum
is before them -- the massive Praetorian Guard force is
caught of guard -- with crisp military efficiency the
Felix Regiment and the City Guard quickly canter into
place, an unbroken line of seasoned warriors facing the
Praetorians.

The huge mob outside the Colosseum is confused, intrigued,
watching the face-off.  The mounted archers of the Felix
Regiment have drawn their bows.

Maximus looks down from his horse at a Praetorian Officer.

					MAXIMUS
		Throw down your weapons or we will
		kill you.

A beat.

The Praetorian Officer glances at the formidable force
against him.  He drops his sword.  His men follow suit.

					MAXIMUS
			(he turns to his men)
		FELIX REGIMENT!  DO HONOR TO YOUR
		ANCESTORS!  I SALUTE YOU!

He spurs his horse and the Felix Regiment roars, springing
into action -- they gallop through the crowd and to the
Colosseum -- meanwhile the City Guard disarm and guard the
Praetorian --

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

Commodus continues:

					COMMODUS
		As it was at the beginning so is it
		now.  The great She-Wolf of Rome
		will again suckle us, again ravage
		our enemies -- AND BRING US A WORLD
		REBORN!

At his cue, two elevator platforms rumble into view,
rising from the bowels of the Colosseum to the arena sand.

On each platform is a cage full of ferocious wolves, they
snap and growl, straining to be released.

					COMMODUS
		So it was for Romulus and Remus,
		sons of Mars, so shall it be for us!
		The great She-Wolf will --

Suddenly -- the huge wooden doors of the arena burst open
and Maximus leads the Felix Regiment cavalry thundering
into the arena.

The crowd is stunned -- Commodus is stunned -- Lucilla
bolts up --

Commodus immediately spins to Lucilla, his eyes burning --

His Praetorian are momentarily confused --

At Gallus' command the Felix Regiment archers let fly --
multiple arrows and bolts cut through most of the
Praetorians -- some confusing skirmishes as the remaining
Praetorians fire back --

Maximus leaps from his horse and begins cutting the
prisoners free --

Meanwhile, Commodus strides back down the platform toward
Lucilla in the Imperial Box, murder in his eyes --

She suddenly hugs Lucius quickly and kisses him --

					LUCILLA
		Remember your mother.

She pulls the ceremonial dagger from his little uniform
and pushes him to his attendant -- his attendant pulls him
away as --

Lucilla spins to Commodus -- he grabs her into an embrace
-- he turns the knife on her -- thrusting deeply as he
kisses her --

A long kiss as he holds her tightly to him.  Then he
gently sits her down on her throne.  Her eyes wide, dying.

One of Commodus' Body Guards grabs him:

					CENTURION BODY GUARD
		Caesar -- we must go -- !

Commodus' six Centurion Body Guards begin hustling him out
of the Imperial Box --

					COMMODUS
		GET THE BOY!

He grabs Lucius from his attendant and drags him off --

They try to escape out the back of the Imperial Box -- but
Felix Regiment troops are blocking their way -- racing up
toward them --

					CENTURION BODY GUARD
		THIS WAY, CAESAR!

Below, through the confusion, Maximus sees Commodus
escaping with Lucius down through a side tunnel.

Maximus cuts Juba and Proximo free.  Juba immediately
snatches up a sword.  Maximus quickly offers a sword to
Proximo.

					MAXIMUS
		Captain?

Proximo takes the sword.

					MAXIMUS
			(re: Commodus and
			the others)
		Where are they going?!

					PROXIMO
		This way!

They race across the arena and into a tunnel...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - BOWELS - DAY

Proximo leads them through a series of catacombs -- damp
tunnels shoot off in every direction -- everywhere around
them the heavy machinery of the games rise like mammoth
creatures to the arena above -- a baroque network of ropes
and pulleys and counterweights and elevator platforms and
air shafts and blood sewers -- And they suddenly run
directly into Commodus, dragging Lucius, and his six
Centurions coming the other direction.

The final battle begins with no preamble --

Maximus launches himself forward -- instantly separating
Commodus and Lucius -- he slams at Commodus with his sword
-- Commodus slams back --

Proximo and Juba race into the six Centurions -- a wild
free-for-all as they prove their worth as warriors -- Juba
fights with his usual elegant precision -- Proximo fights
as a man reborn, alive again --

Proximo takes cagey advantage of his knowledge of this
subterranean world -- spinning around machinery and
leaping over blood sewers and swinging heavy
counterweights --

Maximus and Commodus hack at each other with all the fiery
passion in them -- Commodus is a perfect match for Maximus
and equally ruthless -- their swords thrust and parry and
slice at amazing speed -- one false move, one mistake,
means death --

Meanwhile, the battle is turning into a victory for Juba
and Proximo -- they are defeating the Centurions --
Commodus sees this -- and sees Lucius crying in a
corner --

He screams to one of his remaining Centurions:

					COMMODUS
		KILL THE BOY!

Maximus whirls to Lucius -- Commodus attacks -- slashing
Maximus' shoulders -- Maximus sees Proximo racing to try
and save Lucius as he spins back to battle Commodus --

A Centurion raises his sword to kill Lucius -- Juba kills
his final opponent, turns -- Proximo just manages to push
Lucius out of the way -- the Centurion's sword slices into
him --

Juba flings his sword across the room -- the final
Centurion falls --

Maximus sees Proximo collapse to a wall -- dying --
Proximo locks eyes with Maximus as he slides down the
wall.  The old pirate shrugs.  And is dead.

Juba races to Lucius and holds the boy, turning his face
away from the slaughter --

Maximus, his furious passion redoubled at Proximo's death,
attacks Commodus with every ounce of strength in him --

Commodus' eyes begin to flash with something we have never
seen before, fear.

Maximus strikes mercilessly -- forcing Commodus steadily
back until they are fighting atop one of the elevator
platforms to the arena above.

					MAXIMUS
		For my wife!

Maximus strike hard -- Commodus barely blocks the blow --

					MAXIMUS
		For my son!

He strikes harder -- Commodus is losing --

					MAXIMUS
		For my father!

He strikes with everything he's got -- slashing Commodus
-- Commodus sails back -- his sword falling --

Maximus stands over him.  Glaring.  Commodus is panting,
defeated, glaring up at him.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		We who are about to die salute you.

Maximus raises his sword high -- Commodus raises an arm --
Maximus SMASHES the sword down -- and Commodus is dead.

A moment as Maximus stands over Commodus.  Then he looks
at the series of counterweight ropes around the elevator
platform.

He slices through one of the ropes and the platform begins
to rise...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

A trap door springs open and the elevator platform rises
to the sand of the arena.  Maximus stands above the dead
Emperor.

The crowd stares in amazement -- and then begins to cheer
in joy at the return of their hero.  A chant begins...
"Maximus the Merciful... Maximus the Merciful... Maximus
the Merciful..." which then grows to a refrain of
"Caesar... Caesar... Caesar..."

Maximus ignores them, his eyes drawn to one sight:
Lucilla.

He goes to the steps of the platform leading to the
Imperial Box.  He slowly climbs the steps.

In the Imperial Box, Senator Gracchus is standing.  So too
Juba and others.

Lucius is kneeling by his mother, holding her hand, his
head down.  Lucilla is dead.  Lucius mourns with quiet
dignity.

Maximus looks at Lucilla and kneels.  He takes her other
hand.  A long moment.  He looks at Lucius.

Then he slowly bends forward and kisses Lucilla deeply,
the ritual farewell.

He stands.

Senator Gracchus steps to him:

					GRACCHUS
		General, the purple is yours if you
		so desire.  The Senate will support
		you.

Maximus looks at him.  And then at the people.  The chant
of "Caesar... Caesar... Caesar..." is like a powerful
beating heart.

Maximus moves to the edge of the Imperial Box to address
the people.  The crowd grows silent.

Maximus looks around at the blood of the arena.

					MAXIMUS
		Rome... you are better than this.
		Look inside yourselves.  I challenge
		you to find your true voice.  Help
		the Senate speak for you.  Make them
		your champion... And dare to think
		what could be.

A beat.

					MAXIMUS
		I give you back the dream.

With that he slowly turns and walks down the steps to the
arena sand.  The crowd is absolutely silent.

He goes to Titus:

					MAXIMUS
		When everything has calmed down,
		lead an orderly withdrawal.  Take
		them home.

Titus salutes.

Maximus return the salute and then leaps onto his horse.
As he canters toward the exit he turns for one final look
at Lucilla.

He sees that Lucius is now at the foot of the stairs, on
the arena sand, gazing at him.

Maximus stops his horse.

He canters back to Lucius.  The boy looks up at him.  A
moment between them.

Lucius thrusts up his hand.  Maximus grabs his hand and
swings him onto the horse behind him.

A look to Juba.  Juba bows his head with respect.
Farewell.

Maximus spins the horse around and begins cantering out of
the Colosseum.

Juba disappears into the crowd.

Maximus and Lucius canter across the arena and through the
huge doors...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

From high above we see Maximus and Lucius riding out of
the Colosseum and disappearing into the streets of Rome.

								FADE TO:

EXT.  VINEYARD - DAWN

Maximus stands with Lucius at his old vineyard.

It is still scorched and dead, weeds overgrowing the
vineyards, the house ruined.

Maximus puts a hand on the boy's shoulder, this boy so
like his own son.

					MAXIMUS
		It doesn't look it now... but soon
		we'll have it growing again... Next
		year there will be vines, and then
		there will be grapes... It will be
		alive.

We leave them, dreaming of the future.

								FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     An iguana...

     Crawling off its nest, leaving its eggs exposed.


  1  EXT. MORUROA ATOLL ISLANDS, FRENCH POLYNESIA - PACIFIC       1

     Grainy, Kodak color, nineteen sixties documentary
     footage of a beautiful Polynesian island. We SEE quick
     shots of Kimono Dragons, Gila Monsters and Chameleons
     all in their natural tropical environment.

     Super: Moruro Atoll Islands, French Polynesia - June
     1968

     Incongruously over this jungle environment we HEAR a
     static ridden radio filtered VOICE, slowly counting down
     in French. It is almost as through the reptiles of the
     island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously
     move about.

     Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a
     nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky.

     We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the
     over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the
     French government held in this tropical region.

     Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One
     building after the next, accelerating in momentum,
     culminating in one final EXPLOSION.

     The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like
     fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands
     below.

     We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile,
     unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the
     lizard's eggs.

     Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to
     clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the
     eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash. WE
     continue to push in, getting closer...closer...

                                             SMASH CUT TO:


  2  EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - OIL TANKER - RAINSTORM - NIGHT          2

     Smashing through the choppy waters, barely by the storm
     we SEE the CORI AKIDO, a Japanese oil supertanker.

     Super: Pacific Ocean, present day


  3  INT. CORI AKIDO - BRIDGE - NIGHT                             3

     We TRACK across the complicated computerized
     navigational console that is actually steering the
     immense ship. In the b.g. we HEAR a Japanese t.v.
     program playing.

     At the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an
     overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy
     satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match.

     Suddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled,
     the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to
     the console.

     The SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly
     toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a
     KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the
     radio/intercom.

                            SKIPPER
                      (in Japanese)
               Captain. This is the bridge. We have
               an emergency.


  4  INT. SUPERTANKER'S HALLWAYS - SAME - NIGHT                   4

     Alarms BLARING. The crew rushes out of their quarters
     and into the hall. Quickly they race for the upper
     decks.


  5  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - BY KITCHEN                              5

     The ship's elderly COOK pokes his head out of the
     kitchen and yells at some of the crew as they pass by.

                            COOK
                      (in Japanese)
               What's going on? What's happening?

     Before anyone can answer, the ship is ROCKED by an
     enormous THUD as something hits the side of the immense
     ship. The crew TUMBLES as the ship SWAYS VIOLENTLY.

     The old Cook is thrown to the floor. He looks up
     nervously.


  6  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   6

     The CAPTAIN enters quickly, joining the Skipper at the
     console.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (in Japanese)
               What was that!?

                            SKIPPER
                      (in Japanese)
               I can't tell...

     Again, the ship is HIT. An enormous CRASHING SOUND is
     HEARD as the ship ROCKS to one side, tossing the Captain
     and Skipper to the floor.

     Suddenly we HEAR the tell-tale, famous SCREAMING WAIL of
     our creature from somewhere outside. Terror shines in
     the Captain's eyes at the sound.


  7  INT. HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                           7

     The crew, getting back on their feet, reacts to the
     horrible WAILING SOUND.

     Suddenly the ship is HIT AGAIN. This time something
     enormous RIPS THROUGH THE HULL, crushing one of the crew
     members as it TEARS THROUGH THE WALLS.

     Water RUSHES THROUGH the large gaping hole, quickly
     filling the hallway. The Cook and what's left of the
     crew scurry for the stairs, as the water level chases
     them.


  8  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   8

     The ship's computers are WHIRLING with warning lights
     and alarms. As the Skipper tries to adjust the controls
     in vain, the Captain grabs the ship's p.a. system.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (in Japanese)
               Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the
               lifeboats...

     But before he can say anything more, something WHIPS
     across the bridge's enormous windshield, SHATTERING THE
     GLASS. Was it a tail? No way, far too big.


  9  EXT. SHIP'S DECK - SAME - NIGHT                              9

     The doors BURST open as the crew and the Cook rush out
     onto the deck. Again, the ship is HIT, ROCKING it
     violently.


     A TARP

     is ripped away, revealing a life boat. Two more life
     boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately
     tries to hoist them up and over the side.


     ANGLE - WATER BESIDE THE TANKER

     Something ENORMOUS jolts out of the water towards the
     ship. Through the rainstorm it is hard to make out what
     it is, but it SLAMS into the side of the ship, RIPPING
     INTO IT, pulling down the starboard side as it does.
     Could that have been a CLAW?


     THE CREW

     Are thrown backwards. The lifeboats swing WILDLY,
     several of them SMASHING INTO BITS as they slam against
     the ship.


     THE CLAW

     Or whatever it is, RIPS INTO THE SIDE AGAIN. This time
     the entire ship begins to FLIP OVER.


     A LIFEBOAT

     Bounces off the deck and slides off the side. Following
     it is the Cook.

     Desperately, the Cook grabs onto the ship's side railing
     to keep from falling off. He looks back and SEES
     something so horrible that he SCREAMS IN TERROR and lets
     go of the railing.

     The old Cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker
     FLIPS OVER.

                                             CUT TO:


     WINDSHIELD WIPERS

     Clearing at their highest speed, we see through the rain
     doused windshield, DR. NIKO "NICK" TATOPOULOS. Music
     blares from the tiny headphones of his Walkman.

                            NICK
                      (singing)
               ...I'm singing in the rain, just
               singing in the rain...

                                             CUT TO:


 10  INT. RUSSIAN TOWN - RAIN - DAY                              10

     The utility van races through this small Russian town
     right past a roadblock marked with the international
     signs for "no trespass" and "nuclear radiation."

                            NICK
               ..."What a glorious feeling. I'm happy
               again..."

     As the van disappears down the road, we CRANE UP
     revealing a city sign reading: CHERNOBYL, RUSSIA.


 11  EXT. CHERNOBYL DIRT PARK - RAIN - DAY                       11

     With the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the
     distance, the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this
     field of dirt.

     Nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van.
     He opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic
     cases.

     Walking a few yards away from the van, he dumps the
     cases on the ground, opening them to REVEAL an
     assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment.

     Taped to the inside are several photos of a girl we'll
     meet later. Some of the photos are of her looking young
     and beautiful. Others are of the two of them happily
     together.

     With a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to
     life. Inside one of the cases are several cables
     attached to long SPIKES. He grabs them and dashes away.

                            NICK
               ..."I'm laughing at clouds, so dark up
               above..."

     Nick rushes over to a small patch of land and begins to
     SHOVE the spikes into the muddy earth.

                            NICK
               ..."The sun's in my heart and I'm
               ready for love..."

     Once firmly in the ground, he rushes back over to the
     van and pops the hood.


     CLOSE - VAN'S ENGINE

     We SEE the steaming engine and a large electric car
     BATTERY.

                            NICK
               ..."Let the cloudy skies chase..."

     He attaches the cables to the battery and they SPARK!
     Nick YELPS and jumps back. Shaking off the shock, he
     rushes back over to the mud pit, dropping down to his
     knees.

     Suddenly, raising from the mud we see DOZENS OF
     EARTHWORMS. Excitedly Tatopoulos grabs a big empty glass
     jar and begins filling the jar with worms, happily in
     his element.

                            NICK
               ..."I'm singin' in the mud, just
               scooping up my worms..."

     Unable to hear over his Walkman, he is oblivious as an
     enormous RUSSIAN MILITARY HELICOPTER lands right behind
     him.

     From the intense wind kicked up by the helicopter,
     Tatopoulos finally turns in time to see several RUSSIAN
     OFFICERS coming toward him. Nick scrambles to his feet.

                            NICK
                      (broken Russian)
               Good day. I am here with
               permission...I have a, a...
                      (in English)
               Permit. How do you say permit?

     He goes through his pockets looking for his permits.

                            MALE VOICE (O.S.)
               Dr. Nick Topopolosis?

     Tatopoulos looks up as the Russian soldiers move past
     him and over towards his cases of equipment. A man in a
     long raincoat comes forward.

                            NICK
               It's Tatopoulos.

                            TERRINGTON
               The worm guy, right?
                      (extending his hand as he
                      approaches)
               Kyle Terrington, U.S. State
               Department.

     The Russian soldiers close up his equipment and take it
     off to the Helicopter.

                            NICK
               What are they doing?

                            TERRINGTON
               You've been reassigned.

                            NICK
               You can't shut me down now! My
               research here's not finished!

                            TERRINGTON
               It is now.

                                             CUT TO:


 12  EXT. PAPEETE - TAHITI - STREET - DAY                        12

     Coastal town of Papeete, Tahiti. With the ocean in the
     distance, through the heat waves we SEE a row of
     official looking black sedans coming toward us.


 13  EXT. PAPEETE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                    13

     The doors to the sedans open as a group of very official
     looking Government types. Stopping to light his
     cigarette is PHILLIP RAYMOND, 40's, intense, dangerous
     and worst of all...French.


 14  INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                 14

     Raymond leads the official looking group down the hall.
     A BRIEFING OFFICER rushes over. (The following dialog is
     entirely in French with subtitles)

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               The Japanese consulate has been
               calling and we've been getting
               pressure from the Americans.

                            RAYMOND
               What did you tell them?

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               Nothing yet.

                            RAYMOND
               Are there any other survivors?

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               Only one, Sir. He was very lucky.

     The group arrives at a door at the end of the hall. The
     Briefing Officer opens the door.


     RAYMOND'S P.O.V. - THROUGH OPEN DOOR

     In the corner of the large room we see the old Cook from
     the tanker curled up in the fetal position. The doctors
     and a few nurses are attending to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Get them out of there.

     Two of the Officials move in and escort the Doctors and
     Nurses out of the room. Raymond nods to two other
     Officials who begin to unpack some recording equipment,
     including a video camera.


 15  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME                                   15

     Raymond enters and moves close to the old Cook, kneeling
     down in front of him, inspecting his distant glare. The
     old Cook seems to be in a world of his own, rocking back
     and forth. Raymond nods to another Official who comes
     forward.

                            RAYMOND
                      (in French)
               Ask him what happened.

     The Second Official ask him in Japanese, but the old
     Cook does not respond. He asks again but the old Cook
     seems to be in a world of his own.

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
                      (in English)
               It's no use. He's been like this since
               we fished him out of the ocean.
               Whatever happened to that tanker put
               him in a complete state of shock.

     Raymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high.
     The old Cook's eyes slowly come back to life, transfixed
     by the fire. Slowly he brings the flame close to the old
     Cook's face.

                            RAYMOND
                      (in English)
               What did you see, old man?

     Drawn out of himself by the flame...

                            OLD COOK
                      (weakly)
               Gojira...Gojira...

     Raymond shoots a look at the Second Official for an
     explanation.

                            SECOND OFFICIAL
                      (in English)
               I have no idea what he is saying.

                            OLD COOK
                      (stronger)
               ...Gojira!...Gojira!...GOJIRA!!

 16  EXT. GULF OF DEN SAN MIGUEL, PANAMA - DAY                   16

     A small sea plane flies over this jungle region of
     Panama, darting up the Gulf into the lush greenery of
     the countryside.

     Super: Guilfo de San Miguel, Panama - 45 km outside
     of La Paz

     Slowly the plane begins to descend, landing by a small
     village.


 17  EXT. VILLAGE FISHING DOCK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY             17

     Several soldiers unload Nick's cargo as he steps out of
     the plane onto the dock. As he walks towards shore he
     SEES...


     NICK'S P.O.V. - POLICE BARRICADE

     Dozens of citizens as well as the press are gathered at
     a police barricade; their access to the village denied.
     Panamanian Police and U.S. military working together to
     keep people out.

     Marching up the shore to greet Nick is MAJOR TONY HICKS,
     30's, efficient, who is spearheading this operation.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Dr. Niko Topopolosis?

                            NICK
                      (correcting)
               It's Tatopoulos.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Right. The worm guy.
                      (to guards at blockade)
               Can someone get those people off the
               beach?

                            NICK
               Excuse me, would you mind telling me
               what the hell I'm doing here?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Follow me.

     The Major leads Nick up the beach away from the crowds.

                            NICK
               You didn't answer my question. In
               fact, for the last 18 hours no one has
               answered any of my questions.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We have a situation on our hands that
               requires your particular expertise.


     ANGLE - DESTROYED VILLAGE HUT

     Several soldiers and researchers are investigating the
     site when Nick and the Major walk past.

                            NICK
               Look, I may work for the Nuclear
               Regulatory Commission but accidents
               and spills are not my field.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We know.

     Major Hicks motions to some guards who clear a blockade
     away from a jungle pathway. Major Hicks takes the
     pathway.

                            NICK
               Do you know that you just interrupted
               a three year study of the Chernobyl
               earthworm?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Yeah, you're the worm guy.

                            NICK
               The radioactive contamination in that
               area altered the earthworm's DNA! You
               have any idea what that means?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               No, but I have the feeling I'm about

                            NICK
               It means that due to a man made
               accident the Chernobyl earthworms are
               now over seventeen percent larger than
               they were before. Mutated by seventeen
               percent?

     Major Hicks stops, turns to Nick.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (bemused)
               Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.

                            NICK
               They're enormous! A new species
               created by man's recklessness. That's
               what I've been trying to tell you, I'm
               only a biologist. I take radioactive
               samples and study them.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Then you're perfect.
                      (pointing to the ground)
               Here's your radioactive sample. Study
               it.

     With that Major Hicks walks away.

                            NICK
               What sample?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You're standing on it.

     Nick looks down, sees nothing.

                            NICK
               I don't see it.
                      (no response)
               Where is it?

     We CRANE UP above him, pulling back farther and farther,
     until we SEE he's standing inside of a 15 YARD LONG
     GIGANTIC FOOTPRINT in the sand.

                            NICK (CONT'D)
               I don't see it!

     Two scientists have spread out a tape measure to
     document its length as two others inspect it with Geiger
     counters. Nick sees them and realizes he's standing in a
     remarkable discovery. He looks up ahead and SEES...


     OVERHEAD TITLT SHOT - Foot steps...-

     Five gigantic footsteps in front of him. Other
     researchers examining the prints with all kinds of
     equipment. Geiger counters, CLICK, CLICKING away. Nick
     is stunned.


18   EXT. TATTERED VILLAGE REMAINS - MOMENTS LATER               18

     Nick rushes to catch up with Major Hicks who walks
     towards a command tent in the distance.

                            NICK
                      (flabbergasted)
               That was a footprint. I was standing
               inside a footprint.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               That's right.

                            NICK
               But there's no animal in the world
               that can make prints like that? Is
               there?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We're hoping you're going to help us
               figure that out.

     The Major gestures to the many villagers who are being
     attended to. Some are injured, others are being examined
     for radiation. The village has been decimated.

                            NICK
               Somebody must have seen it.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               It happened so fast no one knew what
               hit them 'til is was over.

     A jeep pulls up and PETERS, a young researcher, comes
     rushing over with a video tape in his hands. As he passes
     Major Hicks...

                            PETERS
                      (on the run)
               Tape's in. The French finally released
               it.

     Peters takes off for the command' tent. Nick and the
     Major follow.


     COMMAND TENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Part military, part scientific command post. Lots of
     activity. Peters waves the tape as he rushes over to a
     television. Major Hicks and Nick follow.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               A tanker was attacked and sunk
               yesterday near the French Polynesians.
               We think there's a connection.

                            WOMAN SCIENTIST (ELSIE)
               Is that the tape of the witness?

     Excitedly, ELSIE CHAPMAN, heavy set, early 30's,
     paleontologist and head of the research team, leads
     several of her colleagues over to the t.v.

                            NICK
               Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...

                            ELSIE
               Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.

     She's clearly attracted to him. This doesn't escape
     Nick, who's not too comfortable with her flirtatious
     glare. She turns to a scientist standing next to her,
     DR. CLIVE CRAVEN.

                            ELSIE (CONT'D)
               Dr. Craven, have you met the worm
               guy?

                            DR. CRAVEN
               Nice to meet you.

     The t.v. turns on and we SEE the old Cook, rocking on
     his bed, repeating over and over the same word...

                            OLD COOK
                      (filtered through t.v.)
               ...Gojira...Gojira...Gojira...

     This is all too overwhelming for him. He turns from the
     t.v. and looks out into the jungle.

     Slowly he walks away, staring at something in the
     distance with total awe. Elsie walks up next to him.

                            ELSIE
               What could have possibly done all
               that?

     We REVERSE ANGLE and SEE what they are staring at.

     A gigantic path cut through the jungle.

     Something of immense size has trampled and cut a deep
     and wide path right through the jungle forest that goes
     on for miles on end. Over the stunned face of Nick we
     HEAR...

                            OLD COOK (O.S.)

 19  INT. WNEW T.V. STATION - DAY                                19

     As we WIDEN we see this is one of several wall mounted
     monitors all showing channel WNEW. Through the glass
     doorway nearby we see CHARLES CAIMAN, 40's, handsome,
     entering the office.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               Murray wants these copied to each
               field producer...


     ANGLE - SECRETARY DESK

     Standing in front of the desk is AUDREY TIMMONDS, early
     thirties, attractive, small town girl who still hasn't
     toughened in the big city and talking with her
     co-worker, LUCY, sitting.

                            AUDREY
               And I'm supposed to remind you to call
               him on all of Caiman's expense
               p.o.'s.

                            LUCY
               Speak of the devil.

     Just then Caiman passes behind them.

                            AUDREY
                      (nervous)
               Think I should ask him? I'm going to
               ask him. You think I should? I will.

     Audrey makes the decision and bolts after Caiman. Lucy
     rolls her eyes.

                            LUCY
               Oh girl...


     ANGLE - CAIMAN

     As he walks towards his office Audrey races up to him.
     Seeing her, he walks faster hoping to avoid her. He
     can't.

                            AUDREY
               Did you talk with Humphries?

                            CAIMAN
               This is not the place...

                            AUDREY
               Just tell me, did you talk with him?

                            CAIMAN
               He said he'd consider it. It's between
               you and Rodriguez.

                            AUDREY
               Are you serious? He's going to
               consider me for he job? What else did
               he say?

     They arrive at his office. An enormous standee of
     himself with the ACTION NEWS CREW is there.

                            CAIMAN
               Why don't I tell you over dinner
               tonight? Your place.

     He stops at his door. Audrey is startled.

                            AUDREY
               Mr. Caiman, you're married.

                            CAIMAN
               And you're beautiful...

                            AUDREY
               Mr. Caiman...

                            CAIMAN
               Call me Charlie.

                            AUDREY
                      (stubbornly)
               Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra
               research for you after hours and
               weekends for nearly a year. And I've
               never asked for anything but this job
               is really important to me. I'm too old
               to be an assistant anymore. I need to
               know this job is going someplace.

                            CAIMAN
               So have dinner with me tonight.

                            AUDREY
               I can't.

                            CAIMAN
               It's your choice.

     Caiman shuts the door on her. She turns and is face to
     face with the standee of Caiman. She takes out her
     chewing gum and plasters it on his nose.

 20  EXT. JAMAICAN HIGHWAY - AERIAL SHOT - DAY                   20

     Over the bumpy Jamaican highway we FOLLOW from above
     several military jeeps racing in convoy.

     Super: Great Pedro Bluff, Jamaica


 21  INT. JEEP - SAME                                            21

     Elsie, Nick and Clive are cramped together along with
     Nick's equipment in the back of the jeep. Nick looks
     very uncomfortable. Elsie looks at Nick...lasciviously.

                            ELSIE
               Three years digging up worms in
               Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos
               handle it?

                            NICK
               Oh, I'm not married.

                            ELSIE
               Really? A girlfriend then?

                            NICK
               No. Perhaps I work too much.

                            ELSIE
                      (filtered)
               You mean to tell me that there is no
               one who holds a special place in your
               heart?

     Nick seems to get lost in thought.

                            NICK
               Not for a long time, now.

                            ELSIE
               Well, I think you're cute.

                            NICK
                      (awkward)
               Oh, thank you.
                      (whispered to Clive)
               Is she always like this?

                            CLIVE
                      (conspiratorially)
               I had to beat her off with a stick.

     A helicopter ZOOMS past our convoy. As we FOLLOW the
     helicopter we REVEAL...


     JAMAICAN BEACH WITH A BEACHED CARGO SHIP - DAY

     Taking up nearly the entire beach, an enormous cargo
     ship lays on its side in the sand. Two gigantic holes,
     ripped into its hull.


     MILITARY JEEPS

     Nick hops out and joins Major Hicks et al as they push
     past the gathered crowd of onlookers. The group gives a
     collective gasp as they see the ship for the first
     time.

     Three men (who we'll recognize from the Tahiti hospital)
     take measurements of the holes in the ship.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Who are they? Lieutenant, get those
               people away from there.

                            RAYMOND
                      (French accent)
               They are with me!

     Everyone in the group turns to find Mr. Phillip
     Raymond.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               And who are you?

     Raymond hands him, as well as anyone who wants one, his
     business card.

                            RAYMOND
               CHARGEURES, property and casualty
               insurance. We are preparing a report.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You're fast.

                            RAYMOND
               That is our job.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Well your people are getting in the
               way of my job.

                            RAYMOND
               Major, what do you think could have
               done this?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Get your people out of there or I
               will.

     The Major walks away. Raymond studies him as he does.


     ANGLE - SHIP

     Nick can't take his eyes off the enormous holes in the
     hull. He steps closer and turns to Peters, who's taking
     radiation counts of the ship.

                            NICK
               Mind if I borrow this?

     Peter hands him his Geiger counter and walks into the
     cracked hull of the ship.


 22  INT. CARGO HULL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                          22

     Inside is eerily dark and creepy. The guts of the ship
     are tangled inside. Holding a Geiger counter, he gets
     readings from all over the area. One particular spot,
     above him, seems slightly stronger.

     Nick SEES something there. He opens his knapsack and
     puts on some rubber gloves, removing a glass jar (like
     the ones from Chernobyl)

     Carefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp
     shard of metal. Clinging to it he finds a MEATY CHUNK OF
     REPTILE FLESH.

     He tries remove it but he only gets half. He places it
     into his jar. Just as he reaches for the other half,
     SOMETHING GIVES WAY.

     With a JOLT, the section above him collapses. A rush of
     water falls and a HUMAN BODY swings down, just in front
     of him.

     Nick tumbles backwards, his heart pounding. The body
     swings lifelessly as it hangs from above.

     The others rush to his side, checking to see if he's all
     right.

                            PETERS
               You okay, Nick?

                            NICK
               Yeah, I'm...wait...I lost...

     Nick looks around frantically when the glass sample jar
     is suddenly handed to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Are you looking for this?

                            NICK
               Thanks.

     Raymond studies Nick as he joins the rest outside.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     UNDERWATER - NETS - MOVING P.O.V.

     We are moving very quickly underwater. Ahead of us are
     some large FISHING NETS with a catch of fish carried in
     the bunt. Quickly we are heading for a collision.


 23  EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - OFF NEW ENGLAND COAST - DAY           23

     A great day for fishing. Slicing through the water we
     SEE three New England Fishing TRAWLERS, the HARPO, the
     CHICO, and the GROUCHO.

     ARTHUR is at the wheel. Suddenly the engines WHINE as

     his throttle.


 25  EXT. THE CHICO - SAME - DAY                                 25

     LEONARD and his 1st MATE are puzzled by the engine WHINE
     of their own ship.

                            LEONARD
               Jerry, why are we slowing down?

                            JERRY (O.S.)
               She's heavy in the bunt.

 26  EXT. THE GROUCHO - SAME - DAY                               26

     The captain, JULES, hasn't noticed a thing as he lays on
     his deck tanning himself, a boom-abox blaring next to
     him. Suddenly THUD. The ship JOLTS for a second. Jules
     slides and BANGS his head into the boom-box. He yelps.

                            DECK HAND
               The nets are full!

                            JULES
               Then bring 'em in!

                            DECK HAND
               We can't. She won't budge!

     Jules gets up to move aft when THUD, again the ship
     ROCKS.


     ALL THREE BOATS SLOW TO A CRAWL

     Arthur tries to GUN his engine but it only WHINES. Soon
     all three boats STOP DEAD. Nothing but quiet for a long
     beat.

                            ARTHUR
               What is going on?

     Then with another JOLT all three boats begin to move
     BACKWARDS, DRAGGED BY THEIR OWN NETS!

                            LEONARD
               She's going sternway!

                            FIRST MATE
               What the hell did we catch?

     The three boats begin to PICK UP SPEED, moving BACKWARDS
     in the water. Water SPLASHES up into the boats, winches
     begin to CRACK under the building pressure.

     The boats begin to move incredibly FAST backwards.
     Things on the boat begin to BREAK and CRASH DOWN onto
     the decks of the ships.

                            JULES
               Cut us free! Cut the nets!

     The same cry is heard on all three boats. Leonard grabs
     an AXE and starts HACKING AWAY at the tow lines.

     Jules and his deck hands do the same. WIRE SHEERS are
     brought out for the larger CABLES connected to the nets.
     Desperately they try and free themselves as their boats
     are dragged helplessly backwards.

                            ARTHUR
                      (screaming at his men)
               Cut the damned cables!


     A CABLE SNAPS!

     Jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either
     cut or snapped from the pressure. Their boat stops.


     ANOTHER CABLE SNAPS!

     Leonard and his crew TUMBLE to the deck as their boat is
     freed.


     THE HARPO

     Is not so fortunate. The lone boat dragged backwards,
     faster now without the weight of the other boats. Then
     suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get PULLED DOWN,
     dipping into the water.

     With an unstoppable force the Harpo gets PULLED UNDER
     WATER. Deck hands LEAP off the boat as the top cabin is
     CRUSHED as the entire ship slowly DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE
     SEA.

     For a moment all is quiet. No one can believe what just
     happened. Hearts pounding, catching their breath.

     Then with a WHOOSH of air pressure, the Harpo BURSTS out
     of the water. With a gigantic SPLASH, the boat FLOPS on
     its side and capsizes. The waters calm, but the nerves
     of Jules and Leonard don't.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


 27  EXT. CLOUDY SKIES - MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - DAY          27

     A storm is brewing ahead as this large Military
     Transport plane glides into view then BANKS away.


     PETRI DISH

     A small piece of Nick's SAMPLE is cut away and placed on
     a glass microscope slide.

                                             WIDE TO REVEAL:


 28  INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - SAME - DAY                  28

     Nick sits on the floor surrounded by his sloppily
     unpacked equipment as he places the slide under his
     microscope, examining his specimen.

     Quickly stepping over him a young SOLDIER rushes over to
     Major Hicks, seated with the rest of the team on the
     plane's opposing benches. The Solider interrupts their
     discussion.

                            SOLDIER
               Major, we just got a report of a
               fishing trawler going down. Exact
               position, forty seven degrees
               latitude, 67 longitude.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What makes you think it's related?

                            SOLDIER
               The trawler was pulled under.

     The team exchanges worried glances. Hicks moves over to
     a map where the other incidents have been marked. He
     traces his finger up the 67th longitude until he hits
     the 47th parallel. Just off the East Coast.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Jesus Christ! It's only two hundred
               miles off the American Eastern
               seaboard and we don't even know what
               it is.

                            ELSIE
               Theropoda Allosaurus. Some type of
               enormous reptile the likes of which we
               haven't seen since the age of
               prehistoric dinosaurs.

                            CLIVE
                      (sarcastic)
               So where's been hiding the last sixty
               million years?

                            ELSIE
               The depth and breath of the ocean
               floor has barely been explored. His
               kind could have survived there
               completely undetected.

                            NICK (O.S.)
               What about the traces of radiation?

     Everyone turns to discover Nick has walked over holding
     his loosely scribbled notes in his hand.

                            NICK
               The radiation is not an anomaly, it's
               the clue. This creature is far too
               unique on every level to be some lost
               dinosaur.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Don't tell me why it's not, tell me
               what the hell it is.

                            NICK
               What do we know? It was first sighted
               off the French Polynesian Pacific. An
               area that has been exposed to dozens
               of nuclear tests over the last thirty
               years.

                            ELSIE
               Hence the radiation.

                            NICK
               More than that. I believe this is a
               mutated aberration, a hybrid from the
               fall out in that region.

                            CLIVE
                      (sarcastic)
               Like your earthworms?

                            NICK
               Yes! We're looking at a completely
               incipient creature. The dawn of a new
               species. The first of its kind.

                                             CUT TO:


     OCEAN WATER

     Racing close to the ocean waters below, something DARK
     and ENORMOUS moves swiftly below the surface. We TILT UP
     from the raging tides up to REVEAL...


 29  EXT. MANHATTAN ISLAND - SKYLINE - RAIN - DAY                29

     A storm has arrived as rain moistens the city ahead.


 30  INT. DINER - SAME - DAY                                     30

     Dripping wet, Audrey enters from the rain, removing her
     raincoat. She walks to a booth where Lucy and ANIMAL, a
     slovenly, Italian video cameraman is his mid-thirties,
     are taking their lunch break. Animal has two plates of
     food he cobbles down.

                            AUDREY
                      (sitting)
               My life sucks.

                            LUCY
               Oh, please, your life doesn't suck.
               His life sucks.

                            ANIMAL
                      (between chews)
               That's cuz I'm married to you.

                            LUCY
               Shut up. How can you eat like that?

                            ANIMAL
               Big bites.

                            AUDREY
               I can't believe he put the moves on
               me. After everything I've done for
               him.

                            LUCY
               He's scum! As far as he's concerned
               you're just a pair of breasts that
               talk.

                            ANIMAL
               I like that image.

                            AUDREY
               You know how I spent last weekend?
               Walking his damned dog.

                            LUCY
               I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a
               douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap,
               puke chunks...

                            ANIMAL
               Hey, hey! I'm eating here!

                            LUCY
               Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's
               your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in
               this town. You gotta be a killer to
               get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'?
               I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't
               got what it takes.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, you don't think that's true,
               do you?

                            ANIMAL
               Nice guys finish last. First rule of
               the jungle.

                            AUDREY
               Well, I can be tough if I want.

                            ANIMAL & LUCY
               Yeah, sure.

                            AUDREY
                      (seeing something)
               Oh my God!

     Everything turns to see what Audrey is looking at.
     Audrey gets up and rushes over to a television above the
     counter.

                            AUDREY
                      (excitedly)
               Turn that up, turn it up.

     The waitress does. On the t.v. plays the same news story
     we saw from before from Panama. This time we SEE Nick
     and Major Hicks walking on the beach.

                            AUDREY
               It's Nick! I know that guy. I know
               him!

                            LUCY
                      (unimpressed)
               Who is he?

                            AUDREY
               He was my college sweetie! Look at
               him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What
               the hell is he doing in Panama.


 31  EXT. NEW YORK FISH MARKET - BELOW JFK HIGHWAY - DAY         31

     Even in the rain doesn't keep people away. Buyers haggle
     with sellers. A large MARKET, truck loads of fish. No
     one seems to notice the river across from them...


     MOUTH OF THE EAST RIVER

     Enormous turbulence in the water. Slowly something
     begins to LIFT, sheets of water fall. Bursting out, the
     backside TALONS of the enormous reptile pierce through.
     The TAIL slices through the turbulence.

     Two ships anchored at dock begin to LIFT UPWARDS as the
     beast below them begins to rise.


     ANGLE FISH MARKET

     A groaning WAIL ROARS, echoing. The people of the fish
     market turn just in time to see...


     THE ANCHORED SHIPS

     Lifting impossibly into the air above the pier. Suddenly
     a TIDAL WAVE of water comes CRASHING down, flooding the
     fish market.


 32  INT. TRANSIT BUS - P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD - RAIN -       32
     DAY

     Through the swinging windshield wipers of the bus we see
     the JFK highway in front of us. Suddenly we see...


     AN ENORMOUS FOOT

     Comes crashing down atop JFK highway, crushing it. The
     TRANSIT BUS tumbles off the demolished highway.

     The man in the MARKET TRUCK is TOSSED and ENORMOUS TEETH
     puncture the top and bottom of his truck as it's LIFTED
     IN THE AIR. The man LEAPS from the open back of the
     truck.

     He lands, HARD, down in front of one of the fish market
     stores as hundreds of fish RAIN DOWN from above. With a
     loud CRASH, the demolished truck SLAMS to the ground
     nearby.


 33  EXT. POLITICAL RALLY - BUILDING STEPS - RAIN - DAY          33

     With a large RE-ELECT MAYOR FAUSTINO poster behind him,
     the MAYOR is at the podium. Before him is a sea of
     umbrellas.

                            MAYOR
               I'd like to thank you all for coming
               out on this beautiful New York City
               day.

     Some in the crowd laugh as others applaud. Lost in the
     sounds of the crowd we HEAR a soft THUMPING in the
     distance.

                            MAYOR
               When I came into office four years
               ago, people didn't think we could
               reduce crime and I did.


     ANGLE - COP IN BACK OF CROWD

     leaning to the cop next to him.

                            COP
                      (sarcastic)
               Yeah, he did.

                            MAYOR
               People didn't think I could restore
               order...

     This time the THUMPING is HEARD, growing much louder.

                            MAYOR
               ...and I did. The city is a safer
               place today...

     Before he can continue the crowd begins to murmur with
     fear as the THUMPING grows LOUDER and CLOSER. Suddenly
     with a large CRASHING SOUND a building nearby begins to
     CRUMBLE.

                            MAYOR
                      (to his aides)
               What the hell....

     People SCRAMBLE to get out of the way as DEBRIS from the
     falling BUILDING litters the area. The Mayor is pulled
     inside by his security men.

     Bursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we
     SEE the enormous LEG of the reptile as it KICKS debris
     out of its way.


     SIDE ANGLE - WALL STREET - FAST TRAVELING SHOT

     Several cars are SQUASHED quickly as the enormous FEET
     of the beast STOMPS through the street. Cars FLATTEN and
     SCATTER, flipping toward us, from the weight of the
     beast. We try to keep up with it, but it's too fast.

     After it passes, the Mayor sticks his head out of the
     doorway to see the demolished street scene.

                            MAYOR
               What was that?


 34  INT. WNEW - CAIMAN'S OFFICE - SAME - DAY                    34

     Caiman's on the phone as his SECRETARY enters with some
     files. Rain and thunder continue outside.

                            CAIMAN
                      (into phone)
               I don't give a crap about some war in
               a country I can't pronounce. That's
               not a lead story. Find me a damned
               story, will ya!

     Just then his Secretary notices a desk lamp, the shade
     SHAKING and the light FLICKERING. She hears the THUMPING
     approaching. She turns and SEES...


     GIGANTIC TEETH

     The enormous head of GODZILLA growls as it passes by
     Caiman's office window.

                            SECRETARY
               Mr. Caiman. I think your story just
               walked by the window.

     Caiman turns but there's nothing there. He's confused,
     she's dazed.

                            CAIMAN
               What?

     Just then the TAIL WHIRLS past with a THUNDERS whip.


 35  INT. DINER - SAME - DAY                                     35

     Animal, Lucy and Audrey are at the cashier paying.

                            LUCY
               Did Romeo have a name?

                            AUDREY
               Nick Tatopoulos.

                            ANIMAL
               That why you dumped him?

                            AUDREY
               No! I just couldn't see myself with
               some boring egg head who spends his
               summer picking apart cockroaches. I
               wanted to have some adventure, some
               fun...

                            LUCY
               And now you live the glamorous life of
               Caiman's assistant. Life's a bitch,
               ain't it?

     In the distance we can HEAR the THUMPING approaching.

                            ANIMAL
               How long where you and dis guy goin'
               steady?

                            AUDREY
               Nearly four years...

                            LUCY
               Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he
               didn't ask you to marry him.

                            AUDREY
               That's the problem. He did.

     Suddenly the THUMPING gets LOUDER very quickly. Everyone
     in the diner reacts.

                            LUCY
               Tell me that's not another goddamned
               parade.

     The next THUMP RATTLES the entire diner. Things begin to
     fall. Through the window we see people RUNNING in
     PANIC.

                            ANIMAL
               That's ain't no parade...

     Before anyone can speak the entire building is SHAKING.
     Through the front window we SEE...


     GODZILLA'S FOOT

     Smashing down directly outside the window. Cars are
     SMASHED. One car SAILS directly INTO THE WINDOW,
     shattering it.

     Animal uses his size to COVER the girls from the falling
     debris. As the danger passes, Animal charges for the
     door.

                            LUCY
               Victor, wait!


 36  EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS - RAIN - DAY                       36

     Animal comes rushing out. Water sprays from displaced
     fire hydrants, debris still falls, cars burn. Animal
     goes over to his NEWS VAN that has been partially
     crushed.

     He pries open the rear door and takes out his video
     camera and takes off running. Audrey and Lucy arrive too
     late to stop him.

                            LUCY
               Victor, don't!


     ANIMAL RUNNING

     Turning the corner Animal runs full speed through the
     debris, trying to jam a video cassette into his camera.
     It won't fit. He SEES up ahead...


     P.O.V. THE TAIL

     Just as it disappears around the corner a few blocks
     ahead. Thinking quickly, Animal bolts down a small
     alleyway.


 37  EXT. OTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS                              37

     His camera damaged, Animal struggles to get the tape
     inside as he exits the other side of the alley. He darts
     out into the street to get his shot.

     The THUMPING is OVERPOWERINGLY LOUD. He looks up to see,
     CARS FLIPPING, PEOPLE SCATTERING.

     Then, for the first time, we can clearly see the entire
     massive creature that is...


     GODZILLA

     as he comes barreling towards us. The titanic lizard is
     ferocious and agile. Swiftly he moves closer.

     Animal's hands fumble with the tape. He JAMS it in,
     sweating. He fingers the POWER BUTTON, the red light
     goes on. Quickly he shoulders the camera.


     P.O.V. THROUGH CAMERA - GODZILLA

     Nearly on top of him, Godzilla's own image is suddenly
     covered by his own immense foot as it's lifted and about
     to come down directly on us.

                            ANIMAL
               Oh shit!

     Before he can do anything about it...


     GODZILLA'S FOOT

     Towering above him. He has no time to flinch as the
     gargantuan foot SMASHES DOWN.

     In terrifying amazement, Animal remains standing IN
     BETWEEN THE BEAST'S TOES. Abruptly the foot LIFTS
     again. Animal is unscathed and frozen with fear.


     ANGLE - ANIMAL

     Close on Animal as the endless TAIL of the creature
     DRAGS just past him. It seems to go on forever. Finally
     it disappears.


     WIDE ANGLE - TABLEAU OF A DEMOLISHED STREET

     Deserted and demolished. Cars burn, debris falls.
     Animal, the lone figure, just stands there, his chest
     heaving, hyper ventilating.

                                             CUT TO:


 38  EXT. NEW JERSEY STREETS - LOW ANGLE - AFTERNOON             38

     A military CONVOY with Police escort RACES past us.


     ABOVE - HELICOPTER SHOT - CONVOY

     Sirens BLARING, the convoy and escort speed onward.


 39  INT. MILITARY SEDAN - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SAME             39

     Just as they arrive at a military roadblock. Crowds have
     gathered as the military try to keep them at bay.


 40  EXT. NEW JERSEY SHORE - CLIFF SIDE - DAY                    40

     The guards let the convoy pass. The military is putting
     up a number of large tents. A SERGEANT moves over
     quickly to greet the team as they exit their vehicles.

                            SERGEANT
                      (quick salute)
               Sergeant O'Neal, Sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Any word from the Mayor's office?

     Just then dozens of NEWS VANS pull up. Reporters and
     camera crews come rushing toward them. The guards rush
     to intercept. Stepping out of the next car in the
     convoy, Nick and Elise join Major Hicks.

                            SERGEANT
               They've agreed to evacuate the city.
               They've called out the National Guard
               and riot police are on alert.

     As they walk towards the tents the crowd crushes close.
     Nick and Elsie are overwhelmed.

                            ELSIE
                      (aside to Nick)
               Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three
               million people. Has that ever been
               done before?

                            NICK
               I don't think so.

     Several military guards have to clear a path for them as
     they enter the tents.


 41  INT. COMMAND TENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY                        41

     Still in construction. The team enters.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Status report?

                            SERGEANT
               We've lost sight of it, Sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You want to run that by me again?

                            SERGEANT
                      (nervous)
               After the initial attack he
               just...disappeared.

                            OFFICER
                      (interrupting)
               Major, Secretary of Defense Burk on
               the line.

     This takes Major Hicks off guard. The last person he
     wants to talk to. Nick walks over to the Sergeant.

                            NICK
               I don't understand. How can something
               that large just disappear?

                            SERGEANT
               We're not sure. We're scanning the
               area now.

                            ELSIE
               He probably returned to the river.
               Just like everywhere else we've been,
               we're always one step behind.

     Nick turns and notices the back of the tent is open
     revealing a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline.
     Several soldiers enter, setting up telescopes.

                            NICK
               I don't think so.

     Over Manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from
     the destruction. Military helicopters scan the city.
     Staring out at the skyline, Nick is mesmerized.

                            NICK
               I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An
               island, water on all sides. But like
               no other island in the world, this is
               a place where he can easily hide.
                      (beat)
               He's in there someplace.

     A SOLDIER comes rushing in.

                            SOLDIER
               Channel eight caught it on film!

     He rushes over to a bank of monitors, turns one on. On
     the screen we SEE the shaky video Animal took of the
     creature just as it was about to step on him.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...WNEW's exclusive images of the
               creature were taken less than a half
               hour ago.

     Nick and Elsie's jaws nearly hit the floor at the sight
     of the immense creature.

                            CAIMAN
               Cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti
               barely survived this vicious attack to
               provide us with this footage.

     The sounds of applause lead us to...


 42  INT. WNEW BUILDING - SAME - DAY                             42

     Everyone is applauding as Animal, carrying crates of
     equipment, passes the t.v. playing the same news story.
     Embarrassed, Animal smiles awkwardly.

                            CO-WORKERS
               Way to go Animal! That's my man!

     Animal passes Audrey and Lucy who are packing up some
     files.

                            AUDREY
               Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you
               scared?

                            ANIMAL
               Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna
               kill me.

                            LUCY
               Damned right, you crazy Wop!

     We SEE the room is in disarray from packing up cartons
     of boxes and equipment. The workers have taken a break
     from the packing as they watch the t.v. broadcast. The
     station manager, MURRAY enters anxiously.

                            MURRAY
               People! We have to be completely
               relocated to the New Jersey station
               before our 5:30 broadcast.
                      (reading from list)
               Okay, Caiman, Devoe and Animal, you're
               on the helicopter. Everyone else we'll
               see you in Jersey.

                            ANIMAL
               Gotta go, honey. You guys gonna be all
               right?

                            LUCY
               Audrey's going to stay with us
               tonight.

                            ANIMAL
               Great. See ya then.

     Animal hurries out after him. Audrey and Lucy go back to
     packing. Audrey looks up at the t.v. just as they replay
     the footage of Nick and Elsie being led into the command
     tent.

                            FIELD REPORTER
                      (filtered)
               ...military and government health
               officials set up a command post on the
               New Jersey coast this afternoon...

     Surprised at first, Audrey suddenly becomes very
     excited. She SEES Caiman exiting the studio at the end
     of the hall. She rushes over to him.

                            AUDREY
               Caiman, wait. Take me with you.

                            CAIMAN
               What?

                            AUDREY
               I've got something on this. I know a
               guy on the inside with the
               military...

                            CAIMAN
               Not now. You got my bag?

     Audrey holds up his bag as they walk towards the
     elevator.

                            AUDREY
               You don't understand, I can get us
               information...

                            CAIMAN
               Listen, this is the time when the big
               boys have to go to work, okay Honey?

     With that, Caiman walks into the elevator. Pissed,
     Audrey just stares at him.

                            CAIMAN
               The bag?

     Audrey THROWS the bag at him, knocking him backwards as
     the elevator doors close. Lucy walks over.

                            LUCY
               Come on, Girl, we've gotta go!


 43  EXT. WNEW OFFICE BUILDING - MINUTES LATER - DAY             43

     Lucy and Audrey carry their bags outside into the chaos
     that has taken over the city. Hundreds of people trying
     to leave at once. Gridlock.

     As they move into an overcrowded subway entrance,
     Audrey looks up just in time to SEE the WNEW NEWS
     HELICOPTER lifting off from the building behind them.

                                             CUT TO:


 44  EXT. MANHATTAN - HELICOPTER SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON           44

     We SEE the destroyed parts of downtown Manhattan. Police
     barricade the streets as firemen work to contain the
     fires.

                            CAIMAN (O.S.)
               ...in what city officials are calling
               the worst act of destruction since the
               World Trade Tower bombing...


 45  INT. WNEW NEW HELICOPTER - SAME - LATER AFTERNOON           45

     Caiman stares earnestly at his video camera.

                            CAIMAN
               ...Police and the National Guard have
               quarantined off over twenty square
               city blocks...


 46  EXT. OVERHEAD HELICOPTER SHOT OF MANHATTAN - SAME           46

     Below we see the largest traffic jam in the history of
     the city. Police and National Guardsmen guide the
     traffic.

                            CAIMAN
               ...hundreds of thousands have jammed
               the streets in the largest evacuation
               in the history of the city. And many
               people are not happy about it.


 47  EXT. MAN ON THE STREET INTERVIEW - VIDEO FOOTAGE            47

     Quick cuts of people who where interviewed earlier.

                            WOMAN
               I don't understand why we have to
               leave our homes. It's over already,
               isn't it?

                            MAN
               What are we running from? A big
               lizard? I've got cockroaches in my
               building that could kick the crap out
               of it.


 48  EXT. TIMES SQUARE - GRIDLOCK - LATE AFTERNOON               48

     Near chaos as police and National guardsmen attempt to
     bring order to the hundreds of honking, screaming
     motorists.


     RIOT POLICE VAN

     Dozens of armed officers pile out of the van.


     NATIONAL GUARDSMEN

     Maintaining blockades in front of their military
     vehicles.


 49  EXT. SEVENTH AVE E - ROADBLOCK - LATER AFTERNOON            49

     The evacuation effort is made more difficult as traffic
     must be diverted away from the quarantined destruction
     area ahead. Police block the street, smoldering
     buildings behind them. The detour only makes things
     worse.


 50  EXT. CITY BANK BUILDING - WALL STREET - SAME                50

     Several National Guardsmen walk up to the City Bank
     building where they find an ENORMOUS HOLE smashed into
     the side of the building. The Guardsmen peek inside.


     GUARDSMEN'S P.O.V. - INTO BUILDING

     We SEE THROUGH the building to a hold on the other side.
     Godzilla apparently walked RIGHT THROUGH. The Guardsmen
     are visibly shaken.


 51  INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME                                  51

     Way beyond capacity, the flooded subway platform bursts
     with people pushing and shoving to get into the trains.
     Caught in the craziness we find Audrey and Lucy trying
     desperately to get on board.

                            P.A.
               Please don't push. People are getting
               shoved down onto the tracks and the
               trains can't leave...

     The last to fit inside, Lucy and Audrey cram in just as
     the doors shut behind them. People left behind BANG on
     the closed doors as the subway pulls out.


 52  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - SAME      52

     A gigantic traffic back up all the way down the Westside
     Highway. The bridge is a veritable parking lot.

                            MAYOR (O.S.)
               Well this is great!


 53  INT. MAYOR'S HELICOPTER - LATER AFTERNOON                   53

     With his close aides in tow, the Mayor stares at the
     melee below.

                            MAYOR
               If we're wrong on this evacuation
               they'll string me up from the Liberty
               torch.


 54  EXT. COMMAND CENTER - JERSEY CLIFF SIDE - LATE              54
     AFTERNOON

     The Mayor's helicopter sails over the George Washington
     Bridge and over to a small landing pad near the Command
     Center. A large group of people dressed in business
     suits await the helicopter.


 55  INT. MAYOR'S HELICOPTER - LATE AFTERNOON                    55

     Just as the helicopter is landing, the crowd moves
     toward the chopper.

                            MAYOR
               Who the hell are they?

                            AIDE
               It's a contingent of building owners
               and community business
               representatives.

                            MAYOR
               I don't have time for this nonsense.

                            AIDE
               Most of them are campaign
               contributors.

     Well that's a different story.


 56  EXT. LANDING PAD - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON              56

     As the Mayor steps out he's greeted by a nervous crowd
     of people shouting, "How long do we have to shut our
     business down? Will the city cover the damages? Etc."
     Among them, DONALD TRUMP tries to get the Mayor's
     attention.

                            MAYOR
               I share your concerns. I want to get
               the city back in business as soon as
               possible.

     As he pushes through the dense crowd he runs directly
     into...


     RAYMOND

     Who waits for the Mayor. The Mayor is momentarily
     stopped.

                            RAYMOND
                      (handing his card)
               CHARGURES Insurance. We represent
               nearly thirteen percent of the
               buildings in your city.

                            MAYOR
               If you'll excuse me...

                            RAYMOND
               We are very happy that you are in
               control of this situation.

     With that he gently pats the Mayor on the back, leaving
     a small, nearly undetectable DEVICE on the Mayor's
     collar.

                            RAYMOND
               You can count on our emotional and
               financial support.

                            MAYOR
               Oh, well, thank you very much.

     Briskly he shakes his hand as he pushes his way through
     the crowd. Raymond watches him pass, seeing the device
     stuck to the Mayor's collar.


     ANGLE - WNEW NEWS CHOPPER

     Rushing over from the parked news chopper, Animal and
     Caiman race for the Mayor who walks through a mob of
     reporters.

                            CAIMAN
               Hurry, we're going to miss the Mayor.

     But before he can get close, two POLICE OFFICERS stop
     them.

                            POLICE OFFICER
               Sorry, you gotta have a press ID past
               this point.

                            CAIMAN
               Don't you watch t.v.?

                            POLICE OFFICER
               Can we see your press pass, sir?

     Flustered, Caiman searches his pockets for his press
     pass.

                            CAIMAN
               I had one here on my bag. Where the
               hell did I put it?


     CAIMAN'S PRESS PASS - ECU

     We SEE Caiman's plastic smile on his press ID. Suddenly
     AUDREY'S picture is placed on top of Caiman's.

                                             WIDEN TO
                                             REVEAL:


 57  INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME - LATER AFTERNOON                57

     Smashed together like sardines, Audrey plays with
     Caiman's press pass, trying to put her photo over his.

                            LUCY
               What the hell are you doing?

                            AUDREY
               Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?

                            LUCY
               Your old sweetheart?

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, well he just turned up in New
               Jersey at the military command post.
               Somehow all this is related to what
               happened down in Panama. There's a
               story here. I know it. You got any
               tape or glue?

                            LUCY
               I left my forgery kit back at the
               office.

     Audrey looks over at a young ten year old boy holding
     his backpack, a RULER sticking out of the back.

                            AUDREY
               Hey, do you have any glue in your
               bag?

                            KID
               What's it to you?

                            AUDREY
               Can I use some?

                            KID
               What do I get?

                            AUDREY
               The warm feeling of helping your
               fellow man.

                            KID
               Five bucks.

                            AUDREY
               You're kidding, right?

     The Kid simply puts his hand out.


 58  EXT. NEW JERSEY TRAIN STATION - LATER                       58

     People FLOOD off the train out into the station.

                            P.A. ANNOUNCER
               Please exit the station. For those of
               you without accommodations, the city

     Audrey and Lucy walk through the crowd. Audrey turns and
     gives Lucy a kiss.

                            AUDREY
               Wish me luck!

                            LUCY
               Audrey, I don't think this is a very
               good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll
               have your job.

                            AUDREY
               I'm tired of waiting for someone else
               to give me an opportunity, Luce. If
               there's a story here I'm going to find
               it.

     Lucy nods in acceptance as Audrey disappears into the
     dense crowd. Lucy worries for her friend.

     "YUM YUM DOUGHNUTS" BAG - PRE-SUNSET

     Carried along with a Styrofoam cup of coffee. We WIDEN
     TO REVEAL a MAN carrying the junk food to a GREY VAN
     parked not too far from the Command Center Tent across
     the way.

     The man knocks on the back of the van. The van opens to
     reveal...


 59  INT. RAYMOND'S VAN - PRE-SUNSET                             59

     Filled with high tech monitoring equipment, Raymond and
     his men are listening in to a conversation. The man with
     junk food hands it to Raymond.

                            RAYMOND
               Merci.

     He opens the bag and takes out a croissant. He bites
     into it and grimaces. To wash away the taste, he drinks
     from the coffee. It's worse than the croissant.

                            RAYMOND
               You call this coffee?

                            MAN
                      (French accent)
               I call this America.

     The man takes a seat near Raymond as Raymond turns up
     the volume on his headset.

                            MAYOR (O.S.)
                      (mid argument)
               You're telling me that in an election
               month I've evacuated the entire city
               for nothing?


 60  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM (TENT) - PRE-SUNSET            60

     From behind the Mayor's head we SEE the monitoring
     device attracted to his collar. As he speaks we WIDEN TO
     REVEAL...

                            MAYOR
               Do you realize what this evacuation
               will cost the people of this city!?

     Representatives of all branches of the military,
     National Guard and the Mayor's office are here. The room
     overflows with people. Nick, Elsie and the scientist
     stand near the back of the tent.

                            ADMIRAL PHELPS
               We're been monitoring the waters
               around the island. As far as we can
               tell it hasn't left the area.

                            MAYOR
               But you don't know for sure.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We think there's a strong reason to
               believe it may be hiding inside one of
               the buildings within the sequestered
               area.

                            MAYOR
               But you don't know for sure!

     Just then Sergeant O'Neal enters hurriedly. He wants to
     speak but waits for the opportunity.

                            MAJOR
                      (controlling his temper)
               Mr. Mayor, if he's not in one of those
               buildings then we give the all clear.
               But not until we've checked each
               building!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Sir, that may be more difficult than
               we originally projected.

                            MAJOR
               More good news?!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               We've run into a problem.

                                             CUT TO:


     A SIGN READING: SUBWAY STATION: 23RD STREET - SUNSET

     We CRANE DOWN to reveal several military sedans pulling
     up into FLAT IRON SQUARE (where Broadway meets 5th).
     Sergeant O'Neal leads the team out of the cars and down
     a subway entrance.


 61  INT. SUBWAY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS - SUNSET                 61

     Marching down the stairs, the team enters into the very
     large subway station. For all we see it seems like a
     normal subway station except for the fact that every one
     of the team members look ASTONISHED.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Lt. Anderson and his men found this
               late this afternoon.

     The camera makes a hundred and eighty degree turn as we
     suddenly SEE what the team is staring at...


     AN ENORMOUS HOLE

     The four normal subway tunnels have been CARVED OUT
     making one GIGANTIC TUNNEL. Debris and crumbled brick
     are everywhere. Several SOLDIERS with flashlights
     approach the hole.

     Lt. Anderson moves over to the astonished group. Some of
     the scientists fan out, examining the area.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               We were checking the office building
               above when we discovered the floor was
               gone.


     LOW ANGLE - REVEALING THE HOLE IN THE CEILING

     We SEE that not only is the ceiling gone but the
     building above is hollowed and torn to shreds. Another
     hole in the building leads to the street.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               When we learned he could burrow his
               way through the tunnels we realized he
               could be out of the quarantined zone.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Christ. How many tunnels lead off the
               island?

                            LT. ANDERSON
               Only five, Sir. We've checked them
               all. He hasn't used any of them.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Have them sealed off.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               And how should we do that, Sir?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Fill them with cement, brick them up,
               put land mines in them, bombs, I don't
               know, just make sure that goddamned
               thing doesn't leave the island!


     ANGLE - INSIDE DARKENED TUNNEL

     As the SOLDIERS slowly move down deeper into the
     tunnels, their flashlight beams scan the area. Could
     they stumble onto something dangerous?


     ANGLE - NICK

     as he approaches Major Hicks and Sergeant O'Neal.

                            NICK
               You know, he's not an enemy trying to
               evade you. He's just an animal.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What are you suggesting?

                            NICK
               When I needed to catch earthworms, I
               knew the best way to catch them was
               not to chase them. I had to draw them
               out.


     ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS

     Still moving deeper into the tunnel we get the feeling
     these soldiers may just waken a sleeping giant.


     BACK TO TEAM

     Nick moves to the edge of the platform, looking off into
     the dark tunnel.

                            NICK
               All we need to do is find out what it
               wants, what it needs, and he'll come
               to us.


     ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS

     The lead Soldier SEES something. Cautiously he moves
     forward thinking he's onto something. We HEAR something
     MOVING in the darkness.

     We FOLLOW his beam as the noise grows clearer. The beam
     falls onto something on the floor...


     A FISH

     Flopping on the ground is a large FISH. As the beam
     moves farther along we see two, no, three fish ahead.

                                             CUT TO:


 62  EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - POST-SUNSET (MAGIC HOUR)        62

     behind.


     COBRA HELICOPTERS - SAME - MAGIC HOUR

     Banking in formation, the helicopters swerve, heading
     towards mid-town Manhattan.


     SAND BAG FORTIFICATION

 63  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                   63

     Major Hicks moves over to a jeep and grabs the radio.


 64  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                       64

     Major Hicks sits by a bank of communications
     technicians.

               Delta niner, what is convoy position?


 65  EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                    65

     Led by armored military vehicles we SEE a convoy of
     TWENTY YELLOW DUMP TRUCKS passing over the bridge.

                            DRIVER (O.S.)
               Command, we're just entering the
               city.

               Convoy ETA, five minutes.

     The Sergeant signals several military technicians, who
     are mounting several video cameras to hurry.


 67  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                       67

     A buzz of activity. Military Officials and personnel.
     The Mayor enters and joins his aides in the back of the
     room.

                            MAYOR
                      (whispering to Aide)
               They find anything yet?

     The Aide shakes his head. Monitors come to life with a
     live video feed-from several cameras we saw mounted.


     A CABLE REPAIRMAN - MAGIC HOUR

     In blue overalls, the REPAIRMAN walks up to a large
     satellite dish. We WIDEN to REVEAL the dish is parked
     next to the Command Tent. He kneels down next to some
     cables leading away from the dish toward the Command
     Tent.


 68  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAGIC HOUR                              68

     Suddenly all the screens FUZZ OUT. Just as quickly the
     monitors return to normal. No one seems to notice.


 69  EXT. SATELLITE DISH - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                     69

     The Repairman finishes affixing a small DEVICE to the
     cable. He taps his earpiece and speaks into his own
     lapel.

                            REPAIRMAN
                      (French accent)
               It is good.


 70  INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                         70

     We SEE Raymond and his men have turned this dingy Motel
     room into a command central of their own. Raymond is
     putting sugar into his coffee when a bank of monitors
     turn on. They are seeing THE SAME VIDEO FEED as the
     Mayor. Pleased, he takes a sip. It's awful.

                            RAYMOND
               You said this was French Roast!

     His aid turns, holding a package labeled FRENCH ROAST.

                            RAYMOND
                      (defeated)
               More cream.

     His associate hands him some milk. He adds it to the
     coffee. No use, it still sucks. On the monitors we SEE
     the DUMP TRUCKS entering Flat Iron Square.


 71  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                   71

     The DUMP TRUCKS arrive and the soldiers guide the
     trucks, forming a circle, their tails facing each other.
     As the last one passes it REVEALS Nick and Sergeant
     O'Neal.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               I sure hope your plan works.

                            NICK
               I'm kind of hoping the same thing.

     The twenty of them, in concert, begin to dump their
     cargo.


     LOW ANGLE - CENTER OF THE DUMP TRUCK CIRCLE

     Tons and tons of FISH are DUMPED directly on top of us.


 72  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                    72

     On the monitors they watch in astonishment as the fish
     get dumped into a large pile in the center of Flat Iron
     Square.

                            AIDE
               Tres bizarre.

                            RAYMOND
               No.
                      (leaning forward)
               Very clever.


 73  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - FISH PILE - SAME - NIGHT            73

     A MOUNTAIN OF FISH have been piled into the center of
     Flat Iron Square.

                            NICK
               That's a lot of fish.

     A master of the obvious. Sergeant O'Neal shoots him a
     glare and moves over to the men. Together they march
     into a building at the edge of the square.


     SOLDIERS

     Loading up rifles, taking positions. GAS MASKS being
     handed out down a long line for all the soldiers.

     The TANKS move into their final positions. The National
     Guardsmen and Soldiers supporting the Tanks take
     positions.


 74  EXT. TOP OF THE SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                       74

     Entering from the stairs out onto the roof, Sergeant
     O'Neal and his men take positions, observing from
     above.

     Everyone is waiting. The silence is deafening.


     ANGLE - NICK

     As everyone waits, Nick scans the area, thinking.
     Suddenly something catches his eye...


     STEAM VENT

     Through a steam vent in the streets. Nick sees STEAM
     lifting into the air. He notices several other vents
     doing the same thing around the square. Quickly Nick
     rushes over to a YOUNG OFFICER.

                            NICK
               I need your radio.

     The Young Officer leads Nick over to his jeep. Nick
     grabs the receiver.

                            NICK
               Sergeant O'Neal, the subway vents. We
               have to shut them down...


 75  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               75

     O'Neal listens to Nick on his radio.

                            NICK (O.S.)
                      (filtered)
               ...With the air pressure pushing up,
               he'll never smell the bait!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (turning to soldier)
               Get some men down into those air
               vents. Shut 'em down!


 76  INT. SUBTERRANEAN AIR VENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT          76

     With a loud WHINE we HEAR the vents shutting down. The
     large whirling FAN BLADES slow to a stop.


 77  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME                                77

     One by one the steam pillars begin to disappear as the
     vents are turned off. There is a long tense moment of
     waiting. When will it come? Will it come?

     Before the Young Officer can stop him, Nick rushes over
     to a manhole cover in the center of the street. The
     cover is to heavy. He yells back.

                            NICK
               We need to open all the manhole covers
               in the area. Let the scent waft down.

     The Young Officer signals other soldiers. Nick steps
     back and lets the soldiers go to work. As he walks back,
     he spots another manhole cover at the next intersection
     down a side street. He runs over to it.


     ANGLE - SIDE STREET - MANHOLE COVER

     A particularly heavy one in the center of this
     intersection (a block away from Flat Iron Square), Nick,
     alone, wrestles to remove it. With all his might, he
     drags it clear.

     Suddenly, through the hole he HEARS some STRANGE NOISES
     from below. Rattled, he slowly backs away from the hole.
     The NOISES grow increasingly louder.

     Then with a DEAFENING ROAR, the ground behind Nick
     ERUPTS and GODZILLA RISES, ripping up the boulevard as
     he does.

     Nick SPINS only to find himself face to face with the
     gigantic creature. Godzilla's head slopes down,
     apparently looking Nick in the eye.

     All around foot soldiers appear, guns trained, shoulder
     hoisted rocket launchers prepared.

     Out of the corner of his eye, Nick sees all this. He
     gently signals with his hands that they should NOT fire.

     Sensing no danger from Nick, Godzilla simply STEPS OVER
     Nick.


     NICK'S POV - UNDER GODZILLA

     As the gargantuan creature walks over us, making a
     beeline for the fish.

     Nick turns and RUNS, following him.


 78  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                  78

     Godzilla moves into the square. The military hunkers
     down, ready to strike. Cautiously the beast moves over
     to the mountain of fish.


 79  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                    79

     Major Hicks watches the monitors as Godzilla approaches
     the fish.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Commence phase one. Let's gas it!


 80  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               80

     Everyone on the rooftop puts on their GAS MASKS.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Let 'em fly!


     ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - SAME

     All the soldiers PUT ON their GAS MASKS. A team of
     EIGHT, pull out a GAS CANISTERS and yank the releases.
     They DROP them down the long barrels of air cannons,
     preparing to fire.


     SAND BAG FORTIFICATION - SAME

     Nick runs past the fortification, trying to get a closer
     look. The Young Officer yells after him.

                            YOUNG OFFICER
               Where're you going? Nick!

     Nick stops briefly as the Young Officer TOSSES a gas
     mask to Nick who quickly puts it on and dashes for a
     closer spot. Suddenly SAILING OVER HIS HEAD we SEE...


     GAS CANISTERS

     Firing from the air cannons, the GAS CANISTERS streak
     across the sky landing behind Godzilla. The Yellow gas
     forms a wall of smoke that drifts upwards.


     ANOTHER ANGLE - OPPOSITE CORNER

     Across the way eight MORE CANISTERS are FIRED at the
     beast. Quickly Godzilla is surrounded by the gas fumes.


     ANGLE - NICK

     Frustrated at his inability to see through the smoke, he
     DASHES forward over to a large BRONZE STATUE.


     GODZILLA

     The smoke annoying and distracting him, Godzilla spins,
     his tail waving the smoke away. But the smoke returns.
     Godzilla YELLS OUT. Frustrated he rears back and
     BLASTS!

     For the first time we SEE the infamous POWER BREATH of
     Godzilla. With amazing FORCE the smoke, canisters, cars
     and anything that isn't nailed down SAILS BACKWARDS from
     the intense pressure.

     Nick is HIT by the WAVE of air pressure and is sent
     FLYING BACKWARDS, impossibly high in the air.

     An enormous fabric BANNER advertising this season at the
     MET, catches Nick who SLIDES down the banner, hitting
     the ground, HARD. Just as he looks up he SEES...


     A LARGE TRUCK

     Tumbling toward him from the power breath. Nick
     SCRAMBLES to his feet just in time as the rolling Truck
     SMASHES into the building behind where he just sat.


     ANGLE - TROOPS - FORTIFICATION

     The troops have to SCATTER as the tumbling trucks and
     cars are FLUNG AT THEM, disabling their attack forces.
     Trucks and rocket launches are CRUSHED by the tumbling
     debris.

     Godzilla CONTINUES to BLOW at everything around him.
     Cars and trucks ROLLING. Soldiers DIVING for cover. It's
     chaos.

     The glass in all the surrounding buildings SHATTER,
     shards of glass raining down. Windows, street lamps, all
     blown out by the tremendous gale force winds.


 81  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              81

     On the monitors we SEE the melee.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Fire at will!


 82  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               82

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Fire at will. Fire at will.


 83  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                        83

     From all angles, soldiers rush back to their equipment
     and attempt to FIRE. Very few are able to get off
     rounds.


 84  EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME - NIGHT                                 84

     O'Neal tries to steady himself as the soldiers FIRE down
     at the creature below. One HOISTS a MISSILE launcher.


     ANGLE - GODZILLA - NIGHT

     As the FIREPOWER begins around Godzilla, he takes a hit
     in the shoulder and SCREAMS OUT. Suddenly he LEAPS away
     just as several MISSLES HIT the Flat Iron Building
     behind where Godzilla was standing only moments
     earlier.

     Dashing down a side street, Godzilla LEAPS over the
     waiting tanks who cannot adjust their cannons in time.
     WE'VE NEVER SEEM HIM MOVE THIS QUICKLY. Several tanks
     are SQUASHED as the beast bull dozes right through the
     regiment.


 85  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                            85

     We SEE the Flat Iron Building crumbling on one of the
     monitors near Major Hicks. In the rear of the room the
     Mayor looks sick.


 86  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                        86

     Soldiers come out from behind the crashed vehicles and
     debris. Only the smoldering devastation is left behind.


 87  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              87

     The monitors only show static or devastation.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               O'Neal, what the hell is going on
               there!?


 88  EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME                                         88

     Quickly his men are packing up.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               He's gone, Sir. Echo division's in
               pursuit.


 89  EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS (6TH AVE.) - SAME - NIGHT       89

     Four ARMORED MILITARY VEHICLES come SKIDDING around the
     corner in hot pursuit. Each with a team manning enormous
     mounted weaponry.


     REVERSE ANGLE - 6TH AVE. - GODZILLA

     Galloping like a Gisele uptown, Godzilla is SPEEDING up
     the boulevard. The armored vehicles OPEN FIRE. Some
     shots CLIP into Godzilla's back. Ahead he is running
     directly into...


     MOBILE MISSILE LAUNCHERS

     Blocking off the street in front of him. They FIRE.
     Pinned down, the creature SCREAMS and DUCKS away down
     another side street. The missiles can't turn fast enough
     and SLAM into a building, DEMOLISHING it.


 90  EXT. ELECTRONICS STORE - SAME - NIGHT                       90

     The window is SMASHED in. A small group of LOOTERS are
     loading up their mini-van. Finishing up the group is
     about to leave.

                            LOOTER #1
               Jimmy, let's go.

                            LOOTER #2
               Wait. I want this. Help me!

     The group rejoins Jimmy as they try to pull an enormous
     Pin Ball machine from the window. As they carry the
     machine back towards the mini-van...


     SQUASH! - GIGANTIC FOOT

     Godzilla's enormous foot flattens the mini-van like a
     pancake. The Looters go pale. As the Military Armored
     Vehicles RACE by in hot pursuit.


 91  EXT. BROADWAY - SAME - NIGHT                                91

     Godzilla BOUNDS onto Broadway and FREEZES, looking
     around. As he looks downtown he SEES...


     GODZILLA'S P.O.V. - MILITARY ARMORED VEHICLES

     Skidding around the corner a few blocks back, the
     armored vehicles reappear.

     Godzilla turns uptown and BOLTS. As he gets up to full
     speed...


     COBRA HELICOPTERS

     A team of FOUR COBRA HELICOPTERS swoops down heading
     directly for Godzilla.


 92  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - NIGHT                     92

     The Mayor stands over a Radio technician.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT (O.S.)
                      (filtered)
               We have him, locked on.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Then FIRE damn it!


 93  EXT. TIMES SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                            93

     Godzilla runs into the famous lighted square (looking
     remarkably like Tokyo) just as the COBRA'S come SWEEPING
     DOWN out of the sky.

     Godzilla SPOTS them and leaps away just as they FIRE
     missiles, which RIP INTO the famous JUMBO TRON VIDEO
     BILLBOARD, demolishing the building.

     The Cobra's SWERVE quickly, pursuing Godzilla down a
     side street.


 94  EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - SAME - NIGHT                        94

     Godzilla appears, turning the corner and racing down the
     street. From behind, the Cobra helicopters come
     SCREAMING down on him, they FIRE ROCKETS at Godzilla
     who, again, deftly turns a corner.

     The errant rockets BLAST into the CHRYSLER BUILDING, as
     they attempt to follow him but fail. Shards of glass come
     RAINING DOWN as the building crumbles.


     ANGLE - ARMORED VEHICLES

     As they race around the corner they SLAM ON THE BREAKS
     just as the familier CONE of the Chrysler building comes
     CRASHING DOWN just inches in front of the vehicles,
     tumbling into the street.


 95  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                            95

     The static increases over the radio.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT
                      (filtered)
               That is a negative impact.

     The Mayor, in the back of the room stands, furious.

                            MAYOR
               Negative impact!?! It's the goddamned
               Chrysler building, that's what it is!

     His aides try to calm him.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               You said he was locked on!


 96  EXT. SIDE STREET - COBRA HELICOPTER P.O.V. - NIGHT          96

     Moving through the narrow side street.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT (O.S.)
               The heat seekers can't lock. He's
               colder than the buildings around him.


 97  EXT. 5TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                        97

     The four Cobra helicopters ZOOM around the corner and
     into 5th avenue.


     COBRA HELICOPTER P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     Godzilla is ahead of us. The choppers FIRE again, this
     time using their gun turrets, ACCELERATING toward the
     beast.

     Under heavy bullet firepower and the choppers nearly on
     top of him, Godzilla DIVES into an office building.

     The helicopters surround the crumbling building, and
     OPEN FIRE, decimating it. They STOP firing and stare
     into the smoldering mess they've made.

                            PILOT
               I think we got him.

     Just then ERUPTING out of a building behind them...


     GODZILLA

     POUNCES OUT of the building, snapping up two of the
     helicopters in one bite!

     He WHIRLS around and SWIPES another out of the air with
     his ENORMOUS CLAW. The CLAWED helicopter SLAMS into the
     ground just as...


     ARMORED VEHICLES

     come sliding around the corner, directly into the
     CRASHING HELICOPTER which explodes on impact. The entire
     team is taken out with the concussion.


 98  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              98

     Major Hicks is on his feet, steaming mad.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Echo four, where is he!?


 99  EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS - SAME - NIGHT                  99

     As the remaining Cobra helicopter SWERVES around,
     Godzilla is gone.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT #4
               I don't know sir. He just vanished.

     As the helicopter PASSES a dark building we SEE a SHAPE
     MOVE! We realize that like a chameleon, Godzilla had
     TAKEN THE COLOR of the building and hid. With the
     helicopter past him, he CHASES FROM THE REAR.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT #4
                      (realizing)
               Oh Jesus!

     The chopper GUNS IT, full throttle. Godzilla GIVES
     CHASE. Even at its top speed it can't out run the big
     creature.

     The chopper tries to LIFT AWAY but before he can get the
     height, Godzilla SNAPS his gigantic jaws and SWALLOWS
     THE HELICOPTER WHOLE.


     STREET - WIDE ANGLE

     The fires burn and the rubble crumbles. Godzilla gives
     one final SCREAM and DIVES into a building,
     disappearing.


100  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           100

     The Major's aide try to hold him back as the Mayor is
     charging at Major Hicks.

                            MAYOR
               What the hell is the matter with you
               people?! You caused more damage than
               that thing did!


101  EXT. 5TH AVENUE - SAME - NIGHT                             101

     Empty and devastated. Fires continue to burn.


102  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                       102

     Nick, Sergeant O'Neal and several of his men walk
     through the devastated area. Nick kneels down and
     SEES...


     NICK'S P.O.V. - PUDDLE OF BLOOD

     There is a large reddish brown puddle of blood. Nick
     takes out a small glass container and scoops some up.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               I can't believe it. He did all this
               and we did nothing to him.

     Nick walks over to him, consoling.

                            NICK
               That's not true. We fed him.


     REVERSE ANGLE

     Only a few scattered fish remain where the mountain of
     fish once was. Our team stands there amidst the rubble.

     A network news ANCHOR speaks directly at us as a video
     of the Chrysler building getting destroyed plays behind
     him.

                            ANCHOR
               While it may have looked like Beirut,
               it was in fact, Manhattan where man
               and nature have collided with brute
               force.

     The video switches to the White House where we SEE the
     President signing a bill.

                            ANCHOR
               The President today declared a state

104  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - VIDEO FEEDS - SAME - NIGHT          104

     We SEE that we've been watching the video on one of MANY
     video monitors showing all the news broadcasts. As an
     assistant moves away from the monitors we FOLLOW him out
     of the truck.


105  EXT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - CONTINUOUS - SAME - NIGHT           105

     We continue to FOLLOW the assistant outside, revealing
     the enormous MOB of reporters that have gathered just
     outside the military command tents. As we FOLLOW the
     assistant he passes several reporters doing "stand-up"
     reports.

                            REPORTER #1
               ...rumors continue to mount as to the
               origin of this, perhaps, lost
               dinosaur...

                            REPORTER #2
               ...having shut down the United Nations
               in the evacuation, foreign diplomats
               are demanding an international
               coalition be assembled to track the
               creature...

     The assistant finally arrives at Caiman who is doing a
     live remote. Animal works the camera.

                            CAIMAN
               ...Maintaining a total media blackout,
               officials remain silent this evening
               as to their progress in containing
               this creature...

     Behind him, in the crowd we SEE Audrey pushing her way
     through the reporters, her fake ID pinned on her shirt.
     She turns and sees Caiman. Quickly she ducks down and
     moves deeper into the crowds.

     Suddenly there is movement as the crowd turns their
     collective attention over to a group of cars pulling up
     nearby. Audrey pushes her way to see what's happening.

     The cars are BLOCKED from returning to the command tents
     as the reporters MOB the first car in line.


106  INT. SEDAN - NICK - NIGHT                                  106

     Nick observes the chaos. Through the crowd he SEES a
     Pharmacy, a neon sign reading: Never Closes. He looks
     back down at the blood sample he holds in his lap and
     gets an idea.

                            NICK
                      (to the driver)
               It's okay, I'll get out here.

     He opens the car door and pushes his way through the
     crowds who are less interested in him as they are the
     military officials.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - MEDIA CIRCUS - CROWDS - NIGHT

     Pushing his way through, Nick SEES what a circus this
     has become; t.v. news camera crews, journalists,
     concerned citizens, worried mothers, and of course,
     merchandising...


     STREET STANDS

     Nick passes several vendors selling dinosaur toys,
     copies of Animal's now famous news video clip and, of
     course, tee shirts with still images from that same
     clip.


     ANGLE - AUDREY

     Through the dense crowd, Audrey SEES Nick in the
     distance. Excited she starts to push her way through.


107  INT. PHARMACY - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT                      107

     Ringing the night bell, Nick calls for the PHARMACIST
     who enters, weary eyed.

                            PHARMACIST
               Can I help you, young man?

                            NICK
               Do you have any home pregnancy tests?
               Especially ones that test for
               catastrophic hormones or clomiphene
               citrate.

                            PHARMACIST
               This is all we've got.

     The Pharmacist puts onto the counter six different off
     the shelf home pregnancy tests.

                            NICK
               I'll take them all.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               You must have quite some harem.

     Nick spins to find Audrey standing right behind him.
     Embarrassed, Nick awkwardly pays for the tests.

                            NICK
               Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You
               look, wow, uh, how've you been?

                            AUDREY
               It's good to see you, Nick.

     The Pharmacist puts out Nick's change. He scoops it out
     and we FOLLOW them as they exit together.

                            NICK
               So you made it.

                            AUDREY
               What?

     He points to her fake press ID she's still wearing.

                            NICK
               You're a reporter. That's what you
               always wanted to be, right? I'm happy
               for you. Really, I am.

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, well...


108  EXT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                         108

     Nick opens the door for Audrey and follows her out.

                            AUDREY
               So, you still picking apart
               cockroaches?

                            NICK
               No, I'm into earthworms now. You
               wouldn't be interested. They're real
               "boring" creatures. Very reliable,
               dependable, no surprises...

                            AUDREY
               You're still mad at me, aren't you?

                            NICK
               You just left me without a phone call,
               a letter, nothing. All this time.
               Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.

                            AUDREY
               That was eight years ago. Some people
               change, you know.

                            NICK
               Most people don't.

                            AUDREY
               I'm sorry you feel that way.

     Audrey turns and walks away. Nick regrets his behavior
     and calls after her.

                            NICK
               Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight
               years is a long time. Can I offer you
               a cup of tea?

                            AUDREY
               Sure. I'd like that.

     There's an awkward moment as neither knows what to say.

                            AUDREY
               One, thing, though. Who'd you get
               pregnant?

     Off Nick's awkward reaction...

                                             CUT TO:


109  INT. NICK'S TENT - LATER - NIGHT                           109

     Nick has set up a mini-lab in his private, small, tent.
     The home pregnancy tests have been ripped apart. Nick
     mixes some of the contents together.

                            AUDREY
               I still can't believe it. How does a
               guy go from an anti-nuke activists to
               working for the Nuclear Regulatory
               Commission?

                            NICK
               When you and I use to attend rallies
               in college, we helped to create
               awareness. But from the inside now I
               can actually effect change.
                      (pointedly)
               I never lost my idealism.

                            AUDREY
               And exactly what changes are you
               trying to effect?

                            NICK
               I have this theory that we're
               inadvertently creating new species as
               a direct result of what we've done to
               nature.

                            AUDREY
               And you think this creature is one of
               them?

                            NICK
               Yes. The first of its kind. I found
               this blood sample earlier this
               evening...

                            AUDREY
               Blood sample? How close did you get to
               that thing?

                            NICK
               I got pretty close.

                            AUDREY
               What else do you know about it?

     Nick finishes his concoction, adding the blood sample
     into it He takes the piece of litmus paper from one of
     the home test boxes and dips it in.

                            NICK
               Well, we know he eats fish, he's of
               reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's
               amphibious and...

     Nick points out the litmus paper. It turns RED.

                            NICK
               ...he's pregnant.

                            AUDREY
               Are you sure?

     Nick gets up and starts to gather his materials.

                            NICK
                      (thrilled)
               Well, obviously these tests weren't
               designed for this but fundamentally
               they're looking for the same hormonal
               patterns that would indicate
               pregnancy.

                            AUDREY
               I don't get it. If it's the first of
               its kind, how can it be pregnant?

     Excitedly Nick begins to pace.

                            NICK
               The ultimate expression of evolution,
               it reproduces asexually. Think about
               it, all kinds of creatures have been
               known to travel great distances for
               reproduction. That's why he came to
               New York. Like every species of
               insufficient progenitors, he's
               nesting!

                            AUDREY
               Nesting?

                            NICK
               Yes. Do you realize that a creature
               like this could lay as many as a dozen
               eggs at a time!

     Nick moves to the front exit of the tent.

                            NICK
               Forgive me but I've got to get this
               into the lab, to confirm all this.
               I'll be right back.

     Nick rushes from the tent. Alone, Audrey can't help but
     poke around a bit. She opens one of his CASES. Taped to
     the roof of the case she SEES...


     INSERT PHOTOS - NICK AND AUDREY

     Happy times long ago. They're both young and in love.
     Audrey is surprised Nick still keeps them. She's
     touched.

     Feeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back
     down. As she does she notices a video tape labeled
     FIRST SIGHTING. Unable to resist, she puts it in and
     turns on the t.v. The shot of the Japanese Cook
     appears.

                            COOK
                      (filtered through t.v.)
               ...Gojira...Gojira...

     She hits the fast forward tape and SEES, the enormous
     footprints in Panama. She fast forwards again and sees
     the beached cargo ship in Jamaica.

     Audrey is torn. She makes a decision, pops the tape back
     out, puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the
     tent. Moments later, Nick returns from the front.

                            NICK
               Audrey? Audrey?

     A flash of lighting and thunder accents Nick's
     confusion.

110  INT. EDITING BAY - LATER - DAWN                            110

     On two monitors we SEE Audrey doing a "stand up."

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               ...which is why in this case "all the
               kings horses and all the kings men"
               may not be able to put the big apple
               together again. Audrey Timmons, WNEW.

     We pull back to reveal Audrey, Animal and an editor,
     ED, watching the piece.

                            ED
               That's it. You owe me a breakfast.

                            AUDREY
                      (turning to Animal)
               So, what do you think?

                            ANIMAL
               It's good. It's a real good piece. But
               how'd you get a hold of this
               material?

     Audrey covers her own mixed emotions.

                            AUDREY
               Like you said, "Good guys finish
               last."

     She snatches the tape and she takes off running.
     Concerned and worried, Animal watches her leave.

111  EXT. WNEW TRUCK - COMMAND TENT AREA - RAIN - DAWN          111

     Rushing out of the WNEW truck and into the rain, Audrey
     spots her Station Manager, Murray. In the b.g. we SEE
     Caiman getting make up, about to do a live spot with
     another cameraman.

                            AUDREY
               Murray, I need you to look at this
               tape.

                            MURRAY
               Not now, Audrey, we've about to go
               live with the morning report.

                            AUDREY
               You're going to want to include this.
               I've got exclusive footage of other
               places this thing has attacked.

                            MURRAY
                      (suddenly interested)
               You do? Who's story is this?

                            AUDREY
               Mine!


     ANGLE - CAIMAN

     About to go on, Caiman waves off his make up artist as
     he watches Audrey hand Murray the tape. His field
     producer counts down to going live.


     P.O.V. THROUGH BINOCULARS - NICK - RAIN - MORNING

     Through the lenses we SEE exiting his tent and moving on
     towards the large center command tent. We REVERSE to
     reveal...


112  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - RAIN - MORNING          112

     One of Raymond's men observes with binoculars from the
     window. Tucking his napkin into his lapel, Raymond eats
     breakfast with his men. Another man, JEAN-CLAUDE,
     listens at the monitoring equipment. He turns to
     Raymond.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               Taisez-Vous.

     He turns on the room speaker.

               ...Major Hicks, what makes you believe
               another attempt to gun that creature
               down will work?


113  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - RAIN - SAME - MORNING       113

     Nick is moving to take his seat next to Elise at this
     very crowded conference. The big wigs are here and the
     room is packed. Major Hicks walks to a large map of
     Manhattan.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               General Anderson, the problem was the
               terrain. If we lure him out into a
               more open area such as this portion of
               Central Park...
                      (points to the map)
               We should be able to take him down.

                            MAYOR
               Last time you didn't even scratch it!

                            MAJOR HICKS
               That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I
               mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.

     All eyes turn towards Nick who's still arranging his
     papers. Nervously Nick addresses the crowd.

                            NICK
               Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was
               injured and bled.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You see, all we need to do is get a
               better shot at it with weapons that
               don't rely on heat seeking...

                            NICK
               Um, excuse me, sir, but the
               situation's more complicated than
               that. The blood I recovered revealed
               that the creature is either about to
               lay eggs or already has.

                            GOVERNOR
               Are you trying to tell us there's
               another one of those things out
               there?

                            NICK
               I don't believe so.

                            MAYOR
               Then how can it be pregnant? What is
               this, the "virgin lizard?"

     There's a smattering of laughter in the room.

                            NICK
               No, it reproduces asexually. That's
               why we must find the nest. If we
               don't, dozens will be born, each one
               capable of laying eggs of its own.
               Very quickly we could be looking at an
               enormous population.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               So after we kill the creature we'll
               begin a search for the nest.

                            NICK
               It may be too late by then. These eggs
               will hatch very quickly.

                            CLIVE
               How could you possible know that?

                            NICK
               The fish. The fish we found down in
               the subway. He's not gathering all
               that food for himself. He's preparing
               to feed his young.


114  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - RAIN - SAME - MORNING               114

     Raymond listens intently. He grabs a folder off the desk
     and opens it. We SEE photos and documents of every
     member of the team. He finds the photo of Nick and
     examines it.

               They just promo-ed your spot. It's
               coming on right after this.


116  INT. COMMAND TENT - RAIN - SAME - MORNING                  116

     An AIDE comes in and whispers something into the
     Governor's ear, who nods approval.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we must
               act quickly before this problem
               escalates.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               You want to divide our efforts based
               solely on a wild theory?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               He's come through for us before and if
               he feels strongly...

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               Come through for you!? Major, your
               campaign's a disaster. You weren't
               even able to to prevent this thing
               from coming to Manhattan.

                            GOVERNOR
               Excuse me Gentlemen, but I think we
               should see this.

     The Aide moves over to a television and turns it on.
     Just as the t.v. comes to life we SEE the old Japanese
     Cook.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               How the hell did this get out?

     The image of the Cook saying, "Gojira" FREEZES and cuts
     back to reveal Caiman doing his "stand-up."

                      (filtered)
               From an old Japanese sailor's song
               called GODZILLA, a mythological sea
               dragon who attacked sailors, to our
               own modern day terror. Today in my
               special report, who is this Godzilla,
               where did he come from and why is he
               here?


117  EXT. DINER - SAME - MORNING                                117

     Audrey is furious, on her feet.

                            AUDREY
               You're special report! I'm the one
               that found that stupid song! That's my
               special report, you bastard!

     Animal tries to calm her down as the story continues.

                            AUDREY
               And it's "Gojira" not Godzilla you
               moron!


118  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - SAME - MORNING                      118

     Fiddling with the motel t.v., Raymond's men attempt to
     clear the fuzzy picture.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               Merde!

                            RAYMOND

119  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   119

     Everyone stares at the television. Major Hicks burns

               You went to the press with this?

               No, I didn't...I didn't talk with
               anyone.

     The military men are furious at the breach of security.
     All eyes turn toward Nick.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               They mentioned you by name!

                            NICK
               Yes...but I...

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You gave them the tape?

                            NICK
               No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh
               my God, she took it.

     Pissed, GENERAL ANDERSON walks up to Nick.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               Pack your stuff. You're officially off
               this project as of now.

               He stole my report! That's my report!

     Audrey wads up her napkin and heaves it at the t.v.

               Caiman you suck!


121  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - MORNING                 121

     The television is snapped OFF and Raymond walks over to
     the window looking out, thinking. Finally...

                            RAYMOND
               We're leaving.

                                             CUT TO:

     Nick is finishing packing as some soldiers carry his
     things away. Elsie enters.

                            ELSIE
               I'm sorry about all this.

                            NICK
               Me too.

     Nick hoists his bag and moves to leave.

                            NICK
               Make sure they find that nest before
               it's too late.

                            ELSIE
               I'll try.

     Reluctantly Nick nods acceptance and exits out into the
     rain. We SEE the torn photographs of Nick and Audrey
     laying on the floor.

                            ELSIE
               Bye worm guy.

               What do you mean Murray's not there? A
               second ago you told me he was on the
               other line...

     Something catches Audrey's eye.


     AUDREY'S P.O.V. - THROUGH GLASS - NICK

     Lugging his bags out into the rain, Nick moves over to a
     waiting cab.


124  EXT. COMMAND TENT AREA - NICK & CAB - RAIN - DAY           124

     Lifting a heavy case, Nick places it into the cab's
     trunk.

                            CABBY
               Where to?

                            NICK
               Newark airport.

     Audrey moves up behind Nick.

                            AUDREY
               You're leaving? Why?

     Nick ignores her and continues to load the cab.

                            AUDREY
               Is this cause of me? Because of the
               story?

                            NICK
               Well what the hell did you think was
               going to happen?

                            AUDREY
               You never said it was off the record.

                            NICK
               I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're
               supposed to be my friend. I trusted
               you.

                            AUDREY
               I didn't mean for it to turn out like
               this.
                      (confessing)
               Look, I lied to you. I'm not a
               reporter. When we broke up and I came
               out to New York I was so sure I'd make
               it. But I haven't. That's why I needed
               this story so bad. I just couldn't
               tell you I'm a failure.

                            NICK
               So you thought that made it okay to
               steal my tapes?

     The last bag stowed, Nick moves to get into the cab. He
     stops and turns back to her.

                            NICK
               Good luck in your new career. I think
               you really have what it takes.

     He gets in and slams the door. The cab takes off leaving
     a very alone Audrey standing in the rain.

                            AUDREY
                      (sad; to herself)
               I'm sorry.

     Long waiting lines for people trying to leave town.
     People sleeping on the floors. Chaos. One group gathered
     around a television set.


     T.V. NEWS BROADCAST - VIDEO

     We see images from crowed refugee shelters.

               ...every shelter in the tri-state area

               people. Tent cities have begun to
               spring up all over the county...

     As we TRACK away from the t.v. we FIND Nick taking a
     seat at a small bar next to the gate. A WAITER comes
     over.

                            WAITER
               Can I get you something?

     Before Nick can answer...

                            RAYMOND
               Pernot, no ice.

     Taking a seat directly across from Nick, Raymond sits
     down, sizing him up. Nick is confused.

                            NICK
               Do I know you?

                            RAYMOND
               We've met before.

                            NICK
                      (remembering)
               Oh yeah, the insurance guy.

     Raymond pulls out his badge and lays it on the table in
     front of Nick.

                            RAYMOND
               It's the French Secret Service.

                            NICK
               Oh.

                            RAYMOND
               We have learned that your American
               friends have decided not to look for
               the creature's nest.

                            NICK
                      (alarmed)
               Are you sure? How do you know?

                            RAYMOND
               We know.

                            NICK
               Why are you telling this to me?

                            RAYMOND
               I need you to trust me.

                            NICK
               Why do you need that?

                            RAYMOND
               I need your trust if you're to help me
               find the nest.

                            NICK
               Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.

                            RAYMOND
               We, have already taken care of them.

     Nick realizes Raymond is serious. The waiter hands
     Raymond his drink. Raymond toasts Nick.

                            RAYMOND
               Bon Chance!

     A makeshift tent city has been set up in the park.
     Animal video tapes an interview with a displaced
     person.

                            DISPLACED PERSON
               No one tells us a Goddamned thing. My
               family is getting soaked out here. We
               have no place else to go. We just want
               to go back to our home.

     Animal begins to PAN his camera around the tent city
     when he SEES a SEDAN in the distance. He focus in on it
     and SEES...


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - SEDAN - NICK AND RAYMOND

     Coming to stop at a light. Animal quickly lowers his
     camera and hands it off to the Reporter he's working
     with.

                            ANIMAL
               I'll be right back.

     Animal rushes over to the news van and takes off after
     them, following.


127  EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - AFTERNOON                 127

     Pulling up in front of a warehouse, Nick and Raymond
     step out of the sedan. Staying hidden from view, Animal
     pulls over. Intrigued, he watches them enter the
     building.


128  INT. WAREHOUSE - RAYMOND'S MEN - AFTERNOON                 128

     Raymond enters with Nick. The room is filled with
     equipment; radios, guns, explosives and armored
     vehicles. We notice that more of Raymond's support team
     are here.

                            NICK
               How did you get all of this stuff into
               the country?

                            RAYMOND
               This is America. There is nothing you
               can not buy.

     Raymond gives Nick a tour.

                            NICK
               So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you
               guys working with the US military?

                            RAYMOND
               I am not permitted to speak of such
               things.

     Nick stops and confronts Raymond.

                            NICK
               You said you wanted my trust, then I
               need yours.

     Raymond considers this. Finally...

                            RAYMOND
               I am a patriot. I love my country. Can
               you understand that?

                            NICK
               Sure.

                            RAYMOND
               It is my job to protect my country.
               Sometimes I must even protect it from
               itself. From mistakes we have made.
               Mistakes that we do not want the world
               to know about.

                            NICK
               Your talking about the nuclear testing
               in the Pacific.

                            RAYMOND
               Yes. This testing done by my country
               left a terrible mess. We are here to
               clean it up.


129  EXT. WAREHOUSE - ANIMAL - SAME - RAIN - AFTERNOON          129

     Moving down alongside the building, Animal walks down
     the side alley. He climbs up onto a garbage hamper and
     peers into a cracked opened window.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - WAREHOUSE

     Animal sees Nick and Raymond with all the hardware.
     Several of the men are repainting the vehicles to
     resemble those of the US Army.


130  INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME                                      130

     Nick walks past the myriad of warfare tools. Jean-Claude
     turns from the radios.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               They will set the trap at thirty
               minutes to ten.

                            RAYMOND
               That is when we will go in.

     Raymond leads Nick over to a large map.

                            RAYMOND
               We know how to get into the city. We
               just do not know where to start
               looking.

     Nick moves closer to the map, putting his finger on the
     Flat Iron square subway station.

                            NICK
               Here. 23rd street subway station.
               Where we first found the fish. With a
               little luck, this will lead us right
               to it.

                            RAYMOND
               So you're in?

                            NICK
               Are you kidding? I always wanted to
               join the French Foreign Legion.

                                             CUT TO:


131  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER - LATE AFTERNOON    131

     Animal quickly climbs the stairs. People are everywhere.
     He has to step over them to get to his apartment. AS he
     opens the door to his apartment he SEES...


132  INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON               132

     Filled with people, Lucy is serving coffee. She smiles
     at Animal as he enters.

                            ANIMAL
               Who the hell are all these people?

                            LUCY
               What? I just couldn't just let them
               sleep in the street.

                            ANIMAL
               Where's Audrey?

                            LUCY
               In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out
               because of you.

                            ANIMAL
               What?

                            LUCY
               All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff
               you filled her head with.

                            ANIMAL
               Me!? You where the one...

                            LUCY
               Go in there. Talk to her.

     Lucy pushes Animal towards the back bedroom.


133  INT. BEDROOM - SAME - LATE AFTERNOON                       133

     Audrey has been crying. Crumpled Kleenex wads piled up
     all around her. A television plays a news broadcast,
     boasting the headline: THEY CALL HIM GODZILLA! On the
     t.v. we SEE a news conference with General Anderson
     addressing some reporters.

                            REPORTERS
                      (simultaneously)
               Can you comment on the nest? How many
               more of these things will there be?

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
                      (filtered)
               That's why I'm holding this
               conference. To try and avoid a
               needless panic.

     Animal enters and watches from the back of the room.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               Contrary to some frivolous reports, we
               have no information to lead us to
               believe that there are any eggs of the
               creature in the city.

                            AUDREY
               Stupid idiots!

                            ANIMAL
               You okay?

                            AUDREY
               It's all my fault. What have I done,
               Animal? What have I become? Look at
               me. This isn't me. I don't do things
               like this.

                            ANIMAL
               You made a mistake.

     Suddenly someone exits the bathroom and crosses out of
     the room. Animal looks at the stranger as he leaves.

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, I just screwed up with the only
               man who ever really cared about me.

                            ANIMAL
               Didn't you tell me he left for the
               airport?

                            AUDREY
               Yeah. Why are you asking?

                            ANIMAL
               I just saw him. He's with a bunch of
               guys who want to sneak into the city
               tonight.

     Audrey tries to make sense of this. Suddenly she
     realizes.

                            AUDREY
               My God. He's going after the nest.

                            ANIMAL
               Perfect! You wanted a story, well,
               baby, you got one.

     Excitedly Animal goes to the closet and retrieves a big
     overcoat.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, I can't.

                            ANIMAL
               Look, you want to make it up to your
               friend? Well if he's right, this is
               your chance.

     He starts going through his drawers, taking out battery
     packs, tapes, etc, and putting it in his pockets.

                            AUDREY
                      (misgivings)
               I don't know. I've already made such a
               mess of things...

     Animal walks up to the door, ready to exit.

                            ANIMAL
                      (smiling)
               Audrey, I'm going after them. You can
               come with me or not.

     Conflicted, Audrey is not sure what to do. Animal opens
     the bedroom window and begins to climb out.

                            AUDREY
               What are you doing?

                            ANIMAL
               Lucy'd kill me if she knew.

                                             CUT TO:


134  INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - SUNSET                            134

     Nick marches out of a changing room dressed in a
     military uniform. As he moves into the room we SEE all
     of Raymond's men dressed similarly.

     As they climb into their vehicles, Raymond hands each a
     stick of chewing gum. Nick gets in the passenger seat of
     one of the vehicles, Raymond climbs in behind the
     wheel.

                            NICK
               What's with the chewing gum?

                            RAYMOND
               Makes us look more American.

     Nick looks over at the faux Americans. It's a tough
     sell, gum or not.

                            NICK
               Just let me do all the talking.

     With that the vehicles pull out of the warehouse and out
     into the rainy night.


135  EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - ENTRANCE - RAIN - SUNSET             135

     An armed blockage seals the Jersey entrance to the
     Lincoln tunnel. We widen to reveal Audrey and Animal by
     a small side entrance. Animal works the lock.

                            AUDREY
               What are you doing?

                            ANIMAL
               It's the maintenance entrance. Runs
               along the side of the tunnel. When
               they repaired it last year I worked on
               a piece about it.

     Just then the lock TURNS and the door opens. They
     enter.


136  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - JERSEY SIDE - SUNSET       136

     A line of military vehicles approaches and slowly passes
     through a guarded entrance, each vehicle checked. Nick
     and Raymond's Humvee nears.


     ANGLE - GUARDED BLOCKADE - CONTINUOUS

     Raymond's Humvee rolls up and a GUARD walks up to the
     window.

                            GUARD
                      (checking clipboard)
               Who you boys with?

                            NICK
               Oh, we're with the three two.

                            GUARD
               I didn't ask you, soldier.

                            NICK
               Sergeant O'Neal just called down for
               us to join in.

     Now he's suspicious. The guard approaches Raymond, checks
     him out.

                            GUARD
               You got a problem talkin'?

                            RAYMOND
                      (perfect southern accent)
               Why no sir, I'm fine.

     The Guard is suspicious but on a tight schedule. Finally
     he waves him through.

                            GUARD
               All right, keep it moving.

                            RAYMOND
                      (ala Presley)
               Thank you very much.

     They drive off. Nick is stunned by the act.

                            RAYMOND
               Elvis Presley movies.
                      (by way of explanation)
               He was the King!


137  INT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - MAINTENANCE DOOR - SAME - NIGHT      137

     The door creeps open. Animal leans out to find the
     tunnel deserted. He and Audrey step out and into the
     tunnel. We FOLLOW them as they are headed for the exit
     of the tunnel into Manhattan.


138  INT. RAYMOND'S HUMVEE - NIGHT                              138

     Raymond and Nick drive through Central Park. We can SEE
     dozens of military people and vehicles in a large
     meadow.


139  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LARGE MEADOW - NIGHT                   139

     The enormous pile of fish is getting dumped in the
     center of the field as many others are planting land
     mines. Tanks, rockets and soldiers align the area.

     The convoy of vehicles turn onto the meadow but Raymond
     and his men keep going straight. They drive slowly right
     past the trap sight and out of the park.


     TIRES SQUEALING TO A STOP

     Doors slam and immediately boots march past. We WIDEN to
     reveal Raymond's team quickly gathering their gear and
     heading down the subway entrance.

     Raymond grabs a heavy bag and tosses it to Nick who
     nearly topples from the weight.

                            RAYMOND
               Be careful with that.

     Nick looks into the bag and sees a bag marked
     EXPLOSIVES. Shocked he looks back at Raymond, but he's
     gone. Nick regains his breath and follows.


     THE FISH

     Older and nastier, but the same fish we saw in the
     tunnel before. We FOLLOW the beam to its owner and find
     Nick. We WIDEN to reveal that we're....


140  INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT                 140

     The crisscrossing beams from the assault team's
     flashlights nearly blind us as Nick leads the team
     cautiously into the depth of this tunnel. Periodic fish
     are found along the way. Suddenly the faint HUMMING
     sound in the tunnel STOPS.

     Everyone freezes as the wind shifts direction. A
     familiar SMELL passes over them as they sniff the air.

                            NICK
               They've turned off the ventilation
               system. They're calling him to
               dinner.

                            RAYMOND
               Let's hope we are not the hors
               d'oeuvres.

     Nervously they continue onward.


141  EXT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             141

     Animal and Audrey arrive, spotting the assault team's
     vehicles. They head carefully down the stairs.


142  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             142

     Audrey and Animal, camera in hand shooting everything,
     climb down into the station. Animal rushes to the end of
     the platform and searches down into the tunnels.


     VIDEO P.O.V. - DARK TUNNEL - DISTANT LIGHTS

     Through the camera we SEE the lights in the distance of
     the tunnel.

                            ANIMAL
                      (whispering)
               They're down there. Let's go.

     Animal jumps off the platform, down onto what's left of
     the tracks. Audrey squeamishly follows.


143  INT. TUNNELS - NICK & TEAM - SAME - NIGHT                  143

     Nick kneels down to inspect some debris. An old
     SCREECHING SOUND is heard in the distance. Suddenly the
     ground begins to quake. Dust falling. The SCREECHING
     gets louder and louder.

     Raymond moves up to Nick and points ahead. Nick nods in
     nervous agreement. Just as they move towards the sounds
     the ENTIRE WALL OF THE TUNNEL COLLAPSES next to them.

     Bursting through the tunnel wall GODZILLA appears. His
     enormous claws burrowing, he makes his way through and
     into the tunnel. Quickly he moves past the team.

     The team DIVES into a cross tunnel just as the colossal
     beast BLASTS past them, barely missing them.


144  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - TUNNEL ENTRANCE          144

     Audrey and Animal have just gotten into the tunnel
     entrance. The entire place is shaking. Audrey is in a
     panic.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, let's get out of here.

     But Animal hoists his camera and starts filming as
     SOMETHING is moving TOWARDS them. Audrey is tugging at
     him as the shaking gets more violent. With all her
     strength, she finally gets Animal to start moving
     backwards.

     Just as they're out of the tunnel, the CREATURE BLASTS
     outward. Audrey and Animal DIVE into the maintenance
     ducks along side the tracks to avoid collision.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL

     Animal is shielding Audrey with his body. She looks up
     just in time to SEE Godzilla CRAWLING UP and out through
     the ceiling. An amazing site.

                            AUDREY
               Shoot! Shoot it!

     Animal grabs his camera and gets the last moment of it
     disappearing from view. Once gone, they both break into
     enormous sighs of relief and nervous laughter.


145  INT. TUNNEL - SAME                                         145

     Recovering, Raymond and the team walk back into the main
     tunnel. They near the hole Godzilla just created,
     examining it. Nick climbs into the hole.

                            NICK
               I guess we go this way.

     Raymond and his men follow.


146  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                146

     Major Hicks is at the radio as the Generals sit behind
     him.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Sergeant, status?


147  INT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           147

     The park is bathed in light. Armed troops surround the
     area. Tanks and missile launchers are in place. Sergeant
     O'Neal kneels down by a sandbag fortification.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Any sign of it?


148  EXT. ROOFTOP - SPOTTERS - SAME - NIGHT                     148

     From the rooftop of one of the central park south high
     rises, a team of SPOTTERS scan the area.


     SPOTTER P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - GODZILLA

     Moving steadily towards central park, Godzilla makes his
     way up seventh avenue.

                            SPOTTER
               Got him. Section 5, heading north to
               target.


149  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME                 149

     The Sergeant gives the nod and several teams of shooters
     take off running, taking positions. The tanks turn their
     gun turrets towards downtown, expectantly. Missile
     launchers turn, arming devices locked.


150  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                150

     Major Hicks stands near a computerized schematic of
     Manhattan. A large RED FLASHING BLIP nears Central
     Park.


151  EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - GODZILLA - SAME                      151

     Godzilla moves up 7th Ave. He reaches Central Park South
     and STOPS. He glances over to the park where bright
     lights are glaring.

     Something is making Godzilla more cautious this time.
     Unsure he vacillates between moving forward and staying
     within the shelter of the tall buildings.


     ANGLE - O'NEAL - CENTRAL PARK

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Don't fire until he's cleared the
               buildings and has moved into the
               park.


     ANGLE - GODZILLA

     Still unsure, he ROARS out, frustrated with his own
     indecision.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Come on, come on!


152  INT. TUNNELS - SAME - NIGHT                                152

     Nick leads the team through the cross town tunnel
     created by Godzilla. Climbing over the debris, they make
     their way to another opening. We FOLLOW them as they
     clamber through the hole and into...


153  INT. PENN STATION - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                     153

     The largest subway/rail station in New York. Godzilla
     has torn it to shreds. We get the feeling this is where
     Godzilla has spent most of his time. Scattered fish
     abound.

     High above, there is a immense black hole in the tall
     ceiling. Wherever it leads to is very dark. Nick and
     Raymond stare at the hole together.

                            RAYMOND
               What is up there?


154  EXT. 34TH STREET - MOMENTS LATER - SUBWAY ENTRANCE -       154
     NIGHT

     Climbing the stairs out from the subway, Nick et all
     walk up onto the street to SEE...


     MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

     The team cautiously approaches the building.


155  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           155

     Carefully moving out from between the buildings Godzilla
     takes a step into Central Park.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Prepare to fire!

     Guns are cocked, locked on and hoisted. Suddenly
     Godzilla gets cold feet and starts to turn around.


156  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                156

     The RED BLIP suddenly begins to move away from the
     park.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Damn it! Fire! Shoot it before it gets
               away!


157  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           157

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Fire at will! Fire at will!

     All the weapons surround the area FIRE AT ONCE. Several
     more Cobra Helicopters ZOOM DOWN out of nowhere.
     Plunging downward, they FIRE at Godzilla.

     The firepower ripping up everything around him, Godzilla
     ROARS and deftly DIVES out of the park and back between
     the buildings.

     But as he bounds over to 57th street, there is a
     contingency of MOBILE ROCKET LAUNCHERS waiting. They
     FIRE. Godzilla DODGES and the rockets DESTROY PLANET
     HOLLYWOOD as Godzilla races by.

     With the helicopters right on his tail, Godzilla makes a
     westward run across 57th street. Smashing parked
     vehicles and his tail SWIPING buildings as it DASHES.


     WEST SIDE HIGHWAY

     Godzilla is heading straight for it, the helicopters
     SHOOTING from the air. Suddenly Godzilla LEAPS higher
     than we've seen before. He hurls himself OVER the West
     Side Highway and SPLASHES DOWN into the Hudson River,
     vanishing beneath the water's surface.


158  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                158

     Furious, Major Hicks throws his headset against the
     console violently. ADMIRAL JOHNSTON leans down into
     frame.

                            ADMIRAL JOHNSTON
               Don't worry. The Navy has a little
               something there waiting for him.


     THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES

     In the murky waters of the Hudson river.


159  INT. NUCLEAR SUBMARINE - THE ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT        159

     The alarm KLAXONS are RINGING OUT as everyone rushes to
     battle stations. The CAPTAIN moves over to a sonar
     screen; a large MASS nearby blips on the screen.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (into radio)
               We've got him on sonar. Arizona
               closing in.


160  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           160

     Different monitors have put up a three dimensional
     schematic of the Hudson river. We SEE outlines of the
     three nuclear subs approaching their target.

                            RADIO VOICES
                      (filtered)

               Coolidge, closing in...


161  INT. LOBBY - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - SAME - NIGHT          161

     The doors are pried open. It's very dark in here, only
     the assault team's flashlights illuminate. As they enter
     the lobby, the team splits up into different search
     groups.

     Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude move down the large front
     lobby and turn down one of the many hallways surrounding
     the main auditorium.


     ANGLE - HALLWAY - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

     Cautiously they move towards us. In the distance we see
     the rest of the team moving the other direction. Raymond
     and Nick arrive at a door leading to the main
     auditorium. Nick is about to push the door open when
     Raymond stops him.

                            RAYMOND
               Jean-Claude.

     On command, Jean-Claude snaps together his automatic
     rifle as Raymond pulls out his semi-automatic pistol. He
     nods "okay" to Nick who slowly opens the door.

     As the door opens a small pile of FISH tumbles down over
     their feet. They step over the fish and enter.


162  INT. AUDITORIUM - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT         162

     Total darkness. Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude cautiously
     step over the fish inside. Only their flashlight beams
     can be seen.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - TRASHED AUDITORIUM

     His beam cruises over the area nearby. It's been gutted.
     Fish lay strewed on the floor everywhere. Suddenly Nick
     spots a strange cluster of OBJECTS. He moves closer.

     Raymond follows. With their combined light we can
     SEE...


     THREE ENORMOUS EGGS

     A pile of reptile eggs nearly twice as tall as they are.
     Raymond walks behind the egg, illuminating it from the
     other side, making it partially translucent. We can SEE
     THE EMBRYO inside the egg and IT'S MOVING!

                            NICK
               Three eggs. I thought there would be
               more.

                            RAYMOND
               You were right.

     Slowly Nick turns and SEES what Jean-Claude is staring
     at open jawed...


     DOZENS OF EGGS

     Together their beams of light scan across the main
     auditorium floor surrounding the gaping hole to discover
     DOZENS OF EGGS piled in clumps everywhere.

                            NICK
               That can't be. That's got to be over
               twenty eggs.


163  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          163

     Another of Raymond's men (R-MAN #2) has found a
     switchboard, he examines the switches.


164  INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT                           164

     Animal and Audrey are wandering through the debris.

                            AUDREY
               Okay, where'd they go from here?


165  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          165

     R-MAN #2 locates the switch he's looking for and hits
     it.


166  INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME - NIGHT                             166

     Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude are stunned as the work
     lights suddenly TURN ON illuminating the room,
     revealing...


     HUNDREDS OF EGGS

     All over the main auditorium floor. A stunning tableau.
     Nick is speechless. Raymond turns to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Start counting.


167  INT. PENN STATION - SAME                                   167

     The light filters down from the gaping hole in the
     ceiling.

                            ANIMAL
               They must have climbed all the way up
               into there.

     Together they notice some large metal piping that has
     fallen from the auditorium. They move over to it and
     begin to climb.


168  EXT. UNDERWATER - HUDSON RIVER - NUCLEAR SUB - NIGHT       168

     The Arizona races past us.


169  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                169

     We follow a runner who hands a report to the Admiral who
     is conferring with the General and Major Hicks by the
     schematic. The Admiral reads the report.

                            ADMIRAL JOHNSTON
               They've surrounded the target just at
               the mouth of the Hudson river.


170  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  170

     He swims at enormous speed heading directly at the
     Arizona.


171  INT. SUBMARINE - ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT                    171

     The lights dim as they prepare for battle.

                            CAPTAIN
               Are we locked on?

                            ENSIGN
               Locked on, Captain.

                            CAPTAIN
               Fire.


172  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  172

     The torpedo is FIRED and comes darting directly at
     Godzilla who abruptly SWERVES. The torpedo, however,
     FOLLOWS him.


     ANGLE - SUBMARINE - CALVIN COOLIDGE

     From the other direction, closing in. Godzilla DIVES,
     skidding close to the bottom. The TORPEDO begins to
     close the gap.

     Suddenly Godzilla SHOOTS UPWARDS heading directly for
     the underside of the Calvin Coolidge.


173  INT. CALVIN COOLIDGE SUB - BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT           173

     The Calvin's CAPTAIN rushes over to the sonar screens.

                            ENSIGN #2
               He's shifted course. He's heading
               right at us!

                            CALVIN'S CAPTAIN
               Full stern!


174  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME                          174

     Godzilla RAMS the underside of the Calvin Coolidge
     before she can turn. The entire sub SPINS, TWISTING OVER
     its side and colliding directly with...


     THE TORPEDO

     slams into the side of the rolling and dented nuclear
     submarine. With a CONCUSSION the sub EXPLODES.


175  EXT. HUDSON RIVER - SAME                                   175

     An enormous SPRAY OF WATER erupts from the river,
     bubbles and debris float to the surface.


176  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   176

     The computerized representation of the Calvin Coolidge
     VANISHES off the monitor.

                            RADIO OPERATOR
               We've lost the Coolidge, Sir.

     The Admiral burns.


177  INT. ARIZONA SUBMARINE - SONAR CONSOLE - SAME - NIGHT      177

     The BLIP representing Godzilla turns.

                            ENSIGN
               He's shifted course, Sir. He's heading
               back towards Manhattan.

                            CAPTAIN
               Full ahead. Close in and lock on.


178  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  178

     Godzilla attempts to make his way back to the shore. The
     Indiana and Arizona close in on either side.


179  INT. ARIZONA - SAME                                        179

                            ENSIGN
               Locked on, Sir.

                            CAPTAIN
               Fire!


180  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  180

     Boxed in from either side, Godzilla RACES through the
     water. At the same moment both submarines FIRE their
     torpedoes.

     Godzilla reaches the underwater shoreline of Manhattan
     and begins BURROWING FURIOUSLY. As his gigantic claws
     start DIGGING up earth, an enormous TURBULENCE of clouds
     and dirt cloud the waters around him, cloaking him.


181  INT. ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT                                181

     The Captain and his Ensign are at the Sonar. We TRACK
     two torpedoes approaching target (Godzilla).

                            ENSIGN
               Impact in eight seconds, seven,
               six...


182  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                182

     Huddled around the schematic and radio, they hear...

                            ENSIGN (O.S.)
                      (filtered)

183  EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME                                     183

     The torpedoes ENTER into frame and disappear into this
     undersea dust cloud. An enormous EXPLOSION BLASTS from
     its center, waves of concussion reverberate.


184  EXT. BATTERY PARK - MANHATTAN - SAME - NIGHT               184

     With the EXPLOSION and enormous TIDAL WAVE rises and
     CRASHES DOWN over battery park with tremendous impact.
     Parked cars and phone booths are washed away.


185  INT. ARIZONA SUBMARINE - SAME - NIGHT                      185

     The ENSIGN checks the SONAR.

                            ENSIGN

     The crew erupts in cheers.


186  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           186

     They hear the cheering from the sub over the radio.

                            SOLDIER
               They got 'em!

     The Generals congratulate each other and Major Hicks.


187  EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME - NIGHT                             187

     Toppling down out of the murky turbulence, we SEE
     Godzilla falling away from the shoreline, backwards the
     ocean floor, drifting down to the bottom of the Hudson
     river like so many cement shoed gangsters.


188  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - SAME - NIGHT                  188

     Raymond and his men are laying out the plastic
     explosives around the room by the clumps of eggs.
     Jean-Claude walks up to Raymond.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               We do not have enough explosives.

     Raymond turns and sees Nick, across the room studying a
     group of eggs. Raymond goes towards him.


     ANGLE - AUDITORIUM FLOOR - HOLE - SAME

     Crawling out from the hole in the center of the floor,
     Animal and Audrey appear. They're stunned at what they
     see. Quickly Animal hoists his camera and begins to film
     as an amazed Audrey walks through.


     ANGLE - NICK AND EGGS - MID-LEVEL DECK

     Kneeling down along side the eggs, Nick examines them.
     Raymond approaches.

                            RAYMOND
               Nick, we have a problem.

     Nick silences him with a gesture as he moves in to
     listen to the egg. He leans his ear against the shell.
     Suddenly we HEAR a loud CRACK. Nick jumps backwards.

     The shell RUPTURES and an large FISSURE opens up across
     the egg. As we hear other CRACKS O.S., Nick turns and
     SEES more eggs beginning to open all around them.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL

     Hidden in this forest of tall eggs, Animal leans in
     close to one getting video footage of it cracking.
     Audrey nervously watches. What she doesn't see, however,
     is a BABYZILLA, fish hanging from its jaw, as it
     approaches from behind.


     ANGLE - NICK AND RAYMOND

     Stunned, they can only stare as the BABYZILLA BREAKS
     FREE of his shell and gives a mini version of the famous
     WAIL.

                            RAYMOND
               I think we should leave now.

                            NICK
               Good idea.

     The BABYZILLA kneels down and immediately starts
     GOBBLING UP the dead fish laying nearby. Cautiously Nick
     and Raymond slowly back away until they are a far enough
     distance, they they break into a run and head for the
     exit.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL

     The Babyzilla continues to chomp on its fish as it nears
     Audrey. Animal continues to shoot the cracking egg.

                            ANIMAL
                      (whispered)
               One more second. This is fantastic.

     Just then Animal turns to SEE the Babyzilla right behind
     Audrey.

                            AUDREY
               Don't you think we have enough?

                            ANIMAL
               Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.

     Audrey turns to see what Animal is staring at. Her eyes
     go WIDE as she backs up into Animal. Another BABYZILLA
     appear on the other side of them.

                            ANIMAL
               Just be calm. Don't startle them.

     Animal leads Audrey backwards as they make their way
     towards the large "team" entrance at the end of the
     floor. The two Babyzillas swallow their fish and begin
     to SNIFF the air.

     Audrey moves up the isle. An egg CRACKS and an ARM
     breaks out through a shell, GRABBING HER LEG. Audrey
     FREAKS and frantically she KICKS herself free. They both
     suddenly take off running.


189  INT. MID-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                             189

     Nick and Raymond race to the stairwell. Raymond pulls
     out his radio.

                            RAYMOND
                      (into radio)
               Everyone, outside! Now!


     ANGLE - JEAN-CLAUDE - MID-LEVEL DECKS - ACROSS THE ROOM

     Laying down the plastic explosives. Hearing the radio,
     he drops what they're doing just as several eggs near
     them begin to CRACK. Quickly he and his partner take off
     running.


190  INT. FAR BACK WALL - LOWER LEVEL - SAME                    190

     Two other men are still laying cables for the
     explosives. One of them is kneeling in a pile of FISH
     near the eggs.

                            R-MAN #2
               Come on, let's go.

                            R-MAN #3
               One moment. I've almost got this.

     Just then a BABYZILLA pops up behind the eggs, a fish in
     his mouth. He SWALLOWS the fish and begins SNIFFING THE
     AIR. He turns and stares directly at the slowly
     retreating R-MAN #3.

     He smells his own hands and realizes he smells like
     fish, quickly he turns and RUNS.

     But Babyzilla is faster. He runs up from behind and
     LEAPS onto R-MAN #3's back. R-MAN #2 begins to FIRE at
     Babyzilla just as another one TACKLES HIM from the
     side.

     In moments, they are both devoured.


191  INT. TEAM ENTRANCE - FLOOR-LEVEL - SAME                    191

     Audrey and Animal reach the entrance and race inside.
     The main exit doors are locked from the outside. They
     turn back just as...


     THREE BABYZILLAS

     appear in the team entrance doorway SNIFFING THE AIR.
     Audrey SEES something, grabs Animal's wrist and pulls
     him to one of the Locker room doors. It's open.


192  INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              192

     Through the door we SEE the Babyzilla approaching as
     Audrey and Animal leap inside, slamming the door behind
     them. There is a sudden THUD against the door.

     Animal rushes over to a large LOCKER CABINET and, with
     all his strength, PUSHES it over, blocking the door.

                            AUDREY
               Great. Now what do we do?


193  INT. HALLWAYS - MID-LEVEL - SAME                           193

     Nick and Raymond run up to another open doorway and look
     inside.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - AUDITORIUM

     Dozens and dozens of eggs HATCHING. BABYZILLAS
     everywhere begin to awaken and immediately begin to
     devour all the fish. A Babyzilla appears only feet away
     and turns and stares directly at us.

     Quickly Raymond slams the doors shut as they both
     retreat back into the hallway. Raymond SMASHES the glass
     covering of a nearby FIRE HOSE and raps it around the
     door handles, locking it closed.

     Suddenly a loud THUD as something begins to BANG against
     the locked doorway.

                            RAYMOND
               We've got to lock them inside while we
               can.

     Raymond tosses his cellular phone to Nick.

                            RAYMOND
               Contact the military and get them to
               send a bomber to blow up this building
               before these things escape.

                            NICK
               How do I do that?

                            RAYMOND
               555-7600. Tell them it's a code
               dragonfly. They should get you
               through.

     Amazed by Raymond, Nick just stares at him.

                            RAYMOND
               What are you waiting for?

     Nick snaps out of it and dials.

                            OPERATOR

194  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT               194

     A large and ANGRY mob has gathered at the roadblock to
     the bridge. People, their cars packed with belongings,
     are screaming to be let back into Manhattan. Horns honk
     and the blockade guards are getting nervous.


195  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           195

     The Mayor marches over to Major Hicks who is consulting
     with the Generals.

                            MAYOR
               Do you have any idea what's going on
               out there? The phones are ringing off
               the hook with people screaming to be
               let back into the city.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We're sending divers into the river
               now to retrieve the body.

                            MAYOR
               That thing's dead. What the hell are
               we waiting for?

     Just then Elise rushes over to the Major.

                            ELSIE
               Major, if Nick is right, this could be
               our last chance to do something about
               it. We have to search for the nest,
               now.

     Major Hicks is torn. Finally he nods in agreement,
     turning to another officer.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Organize a search party. I want a
               complete sweep of the entire city and
               subway system.

                            MAYOR
               You don't have the authority to do
               that.

     The Major turns and cooly approaches the Mayor.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Try and stop me.

     Major Hicks smiles at the Mayor who exits, petulantly.


196  INT. AUDITORIUM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - DOORWAY -        196
     NIGHT

     We SEE dozens and dozens of Babyzillas fighting with
     each other over the last of the fish. Suddenly this
     image is SLAMMED SHUT as doors are closed and a FIRE
     HOSE is rapped around door handles. We widen to
     reveal...

     Raymond fastening the hose around the door. Secured,
     Raymond takes off running.


197  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - HALLWAY - SAME                197

     Nick is on the pay phone frantically dialing as Raymond
     comes up. We hear a BUSY signal from the phone. Nick
     dials again.

                            RAYMOND
               What'd they say?

                            NICK
               I can't get through. I don't know
               what's wrong.

                            OPERATOR
                      (filtered)
               ...all circuits are busy right now...

     Jean-Clude and his partner arrive.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               We've secured the doors on both
               levels.

                            RAYMOND
               Where's Luc and Pierre?

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               They didn't make it.

                            RAYMOND
                      (quickly recovering)
               Nick, my men and I will hold them
               here. You will have to go and get
               help!

     Nick nods in agreement and takes off down stairs. The
     rest of the team SNAP TOGETHER their automatic rifles
     and prepare for a fight.


198  INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME                                    198

     Animal and Audrey are checking out every corner of the
     room.

                            ANIMAL
               There's got to be another way out of
               here.

     Audrey climbs up onto a table and yanks out a grate
     covering the air vent.

                            AUDREY
               Think we can fit up in there?

                            ANIMAL
               Only one way to find out.

     He rushes over to her and helps her climb up inside.


199  INT. FLOOR-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                           199

     Jean-Claude sends Luc up ahead as they guard the
     doorways. A loud THUMP is heard on the door they are
     guarding. Each turns their weapon towards the doors.
     Suddenly a portion of WALL BETWEEN THEM COLLAPSES.

     A DOZEN BABYZILLAS leaping through the plaster. As they
     spill out into the hall, Jean-Claude attempts to open
     FIRE. One of the Babyzilla's is HIT.

     His brothers ATTACK. Luc from the other side tries to
     lay down cover fire but he's overrun by the herd.


200  INT. HALLWAY - MAIN LOBBY LEVEL - SAME                     200

     Nick comes racing down the stairs and into the hallway.
     Just then, he passes a locked door, BANGING on the other
     side.

     Just up ahead he can SEE the main lobby. But before he
     can get there, a LOUD CRASH is heard as the locked door
     in front of him SMASHES TO BITS as...


     DOZENS OF BABYZILLAS

     Flood into the main lobby only a few yards ahead. Nick
     slams on the breaks and quietly tries to back away. He
     turns to run the other directions when...


     MORE BABYZILLA

     Come BURSTING THROUGH the locked door behind him. Pinned
     down with no way out. Nick SEES the elevator nearby and
     races over, slamming his hand against the button.

                            NICK
               Come on, come on.

     The Babyzillas by the front door spot Nick. A couple of
     them start to SNIFF THE AIR and start to move towards
     him. Behind, the Babyzilla also catch the scent and
     turn.

                            NICK
               This is not good.

     Just then the elevator doors open, Nick LEAPS inside.


201  INT. ELEVATOR - SAME                                       201

     Nick frantically pushes the CLOSE DOOR button but it's
     painfully slow to react.

                            NICK
               I hate these things!

     Just then the Babyzillas appear. They're just about to
     move in when the doors finally CLOSE. Nick breaths a
     sigh of relief just as a loud THUD is heard as one of
     them SLAMS against the door. It's too late, the elevator
     begins to rise.


202  INT. AIR VENT - SAME - NIGHT                               202

     Climbing upward, Animal reaches a plateau and crawls
     into cross vent. He reaches back and grabs his camera.
     Putting it down he turns back and helps Audrey up and
     in.

                            ANIMAL
               You okay?

     Out of breath, she nods. Animal takes the lead again,
     pushing his camera in front of him. He reaches another
     vent that looks down. He's about to pull it free when
     something catches his eye.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - THROUGH VENT - RAYMOND

     Standing guard, automatic rife in hand, Raymond appears
     with his back toward us. Animal lifts his camera to
     shoot.

                            AUDREY
                      (whispered)
               What? What is it?

     Animal doesn't answer, he just shoots.


203  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        203

     The elevator doors open and Raymond SWERVES his gun
     around ready to shoot. Frightened, Nick throws his hands
     in the air.

                            NICK
               Hey, it's me!


204  INT. VENT - SAME                                           204

     Audrey has pushed her way up alongside of Animal to peer
     down through the grating.

                            RAYMOND
               What happened?


205  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        205

     Nick keeps dialing the cell phone, still busy.

                            NICK
               They're loose. They're allover the
               main lobby. I couldn't get out.

     Just then the vents above COLLAPSES and Animal and
     Audrey come tumbling down. In a flash, Raymond has his
     weapon trained on their heads.

                            RAYMOND
               Who the hell are you?

                            NICK
               It's okay. I know her.

     Raymond turns his gun towards the fallen video camera
     and FIRES, ripping the camera apart.

                            ANIMAL
               Hey! What gives?

                            RAYMOND
               No cameras.

     Nick moves to Audrey's side, helping her up.

                            NICK
               What are you doing here?

                            AUDREY
               I thought you said there'd only be a
               dozen eggs.

                            NICK
               I was wrong.

     Just then a LOUD THUMP is heard against the near locked
     door. The THUMPING gets louder and heavier.

                            RAYMOND
               Do you have a radio, a walkie-talkie?
               Anything we can use to contact the
               outside.

                            AUDREY
               What about the phones?

                            NICK
               Circuits are overloaded.

                            AUDREY
                      (gets an idea)
               I know a way. I know how you can get
               a message out of here.

     The door BURSTS OPEN and TWENTY BABYZILLAS stampede into
     the hallway. Audrey is fast on her feet.

                            AUDREY
               This way.

     She takes off running and they follow. The Babyzillas
     give chase. Animal, hangs back and runs over to the
     destroyed video camera and PULLS OUT THE TAPE. Just as
     he does, the Babyzillas are nearly on top of him. He
     dashes off.


     ANGLE - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR

     Audrey gets there first and opens the small doorway that
     leads to a back stairwell, she ushers the rest inside.

     She slams the door behind her as the Babyzillas appear
     and begin to SNIFF the doorway.


206  INT. HALLWAY - LUXURY BOXES - SAME - NIGHT                 206

     They spill out into the hall and rush past all the
     luxury boxes overlooking the auditorium.

                            AUDREY
               Come on, the broadcast booth is right
               over here.

                            NICK
               How do you know?

                            AUDREY
               Our network covers the Ranger games.


207  INT. MID-LEVEL - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR                   207

     The Babyzillas are gathered by the doorway SNIFFING. One
     of the more aggressive ones starts to CLAW at the door,
     RIPPING into it. Another charges it, THUD.


208  INT. LUXURY BOX HALLWAY - SAME                             208

     They rush up to a door marked BROADCAST BOOTH. Audrey
     tries the door, it's locked. Animal charges his shoulder
     into it, but it doesn't give.

     Raymond gently moves Animal out of the way and SHOOTS
     the lock to pieces. He opens the door for everyone to
     enter.


209  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME - NIGHT                        209

     They rush into the empty broadcast booth. Animal turns
     on the lights as Audrey goes over and boots the computer
     terminal. Raymond moves some equipment against the door,
     securing it closed.

                            AUDREY
               The network is on an intranet. It's a
               direct feed into our computer system.

                            NICK
               Your station won't have any easier
               time contacting the military than I
               did.

     That stumps her. Animal gets an idea.

                            ANIMAL
               When you worked with them, did they
               monitor the news broadcasts?

                            NICK
                      (getting the idea)
               Yes, they did.

                            ANIMAL
               We'll go live! We'll broadcast from
               here. Hopefully they'll see it.


210  INT. MID-LEVEL - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR                   210

     More of the creatures have gathered by the door. Two
     more CHARGE and the door collapses. The Babyzillas rush
     up the stairs.


211  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - EDITING BAY - SAME                  211

     Ed is watching the news feed. Caiman is on.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...Yes, the threat is over but the
               pain continues...

     Suddenly Ed's computer begins to BEEP. Ed slides his
     chair over and looks at his monitor. It reads NEW MAIL:
     URGENT! He double clicks it and a letter pops up that
     reads. Ed pick up transponder CFX 1 and watch the feed.

                            ED
                      (to himself)
               There's no Ranger game on tonight.

     Ed makes a couple of adjustments on his controls and
     turns on a blank monitor. He SEES...


     C.U. MONITOR - AUDREY

     Racing in front of the camera we SEE Audrey in the
     control booth.

                            AUDREY
               ...If you're seeing this, Ed, please
               put us on Live! This is urgent! I know
               this sounds crazy Ed but you have to
               do it. Please, trust me.

                            ED
                      (incredulous)
               I'm not putting you on live!


212  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                212

     Nick turns on a small television and we still SEE Caiman
     doing the news. Audrey turns to Animal.

                            AUDREY
               He's not going to do it.

                            ANIMAL
               Oh yes he will.

     Animal turns the camera and points out the window at the
     BABYZILLA'S below.


213  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - SAME                                213

     Ed's eyes nearly pop out of his head.

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               Ed, you see that? They'll be all over
               the city if we don't stop them!

     Ed rushes over to the console and goes to work.


214  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   214

     The mode is festive.  The Generals are preparing to leave
     as is Major Hicks. Sergeant O'Neal and some of his men
     are watching the t.v. news.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...as our fears have been allayed
               thanks to the dedicated work of our
               boys in uniform...

     Everyone in the room begins to cheer. Suddenly Caiman's
     image goes fuzzy. In a moment it's replaced by Audrey.

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               Are we on? Are we live?


215  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                215

     Nick SEES Audrey on the t.v. and gives her the thumbs
     up.

                            AUDREY
               We're live from inside Madison Square
               Garden where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos has
               discovered the beasts lair. Doctor,
               tell us what is happening here.

     Animal swerves the camera over to Nick. Raymond stays
     back behind the camera, watching.

                            NICK
               We've discovered over two hundred eggs
               which began hatching only moments ago.


216  INT. LUXURY BOXES HALLWAY - SAME                           216

     The creatures come bursting out of the stairwell and
     flood into the hall. Sniffing around they pick up the
     scent and take off.


217  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   217

     A Soldier tugs on Major Hicks shoulder, try to get his
     attention.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What is it?

                            SOLDIER
               You better see this.

     The Major turns around just in time to SEE Nick on the
     t.v.

                            NICK
               If the military are listening, they
               must immediately destroy this building
               before they can escape.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               Oh my God! They're coming!

     The camera SWERVES to SEE through the luxury booths
     across from them, the dozens of Babyzillas approaching.


218  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     218

     The bedroom is packed with Lucy's "guests" as they watch
     the t.v., SEEING the Babyzillas.

                            LUCY
               Oh my God!

     On the screen the image turns to Nick.

                            NICK
                      (filtered)
               If those creatures escape and
               multiply, in a very short time a new
               species will emerge. One that could
               replace us as the dominant species of
               this planet.


219  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   219

     Major Hicks is on the phone.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into phone)
               That's correct, I want you to blow up
               Madison Square Garden. No I'm not
               drunk.
                      (to O'Neal)
               Contact the news station. Tell them
               we're on the way.


220  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME - NIGHT                        220

     Raymond spots a large spool of co-axle cable. Quickly he
     ties it to the support beam.

                            AUDREY
               Reporting live from Madison Square
               Garden, this is Audrey Timmonds,
               WNEW.


221  INT. AUDREY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                   221

     Everyone is breathless watching the news. Lucy beams.

                            LUCY
               That's my girl.


222  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                222

     Animal lowers the camera and everyone is silent.

                            NICK
               Thanks, Audrey.

     The computer beeps, Animal reads the message.

                            ANIMAL
               The good news is they got the message.
               The bad news is we've got five and a
               half minutes to get out of the
               building.

     Suddenly the room ROCKS as the Babyzillas begin crashing
     against the blocked door. Raymond jumps to his feet.

                            RAYMOND
               Okay, party's over. Time to leave.

     With that he SPRAYS bullets into the front glass window
     SHATTERING IT. Glass rains down below. Raymond tosses
     the spool of cable out the broken window.

                            RAYMOND
               Anyone care to join me?

     Animal dislodges one of the video cameras, hoists it on
     his shoulder and moves over to join Raymond.


223  EXT. AIR BASE - F-18 SQUADRON - SAME - NIGHT               223

     Several F-18's prepare to take flight. We focus on one,
     an enormous bomb attached under its wing. The F-18 taxis
     away from us.


224  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - AUDITORIUM - SAME             224

     Repelling down from the broken window of the broadcast
     booth, Animal and Raymond land on the upper-level
     balcony. Raymond signals to the others to follow.


225  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                225

     Audrey and Nick are nervous as they stare at the long
     drop down. The door is begging to give way from the
     repeated THUMPING. Suddenly Audrey leans over and kisses
     Nick.

                            AUDREY
               In case I can't later.

     With that she JUMPS out, repelling downward. Nick is
     stunned by the unexpected kiss. Suddenly the door GIVES
     and the Babyzilla FLOOD into the room. Nick jumps.


226  INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS                               226

     Audrey hits the ground followed by Nick. Raymond leads
     as they make their way out.

     On the other end of the room some Babyzilla appear in a
     doorway and watch our friends scurry away. The
     Babyzillas take off in hot pursuit.


227  INT. DARK SKIES - F-18 SQUADRON - NIGHT                    227

     The F-18's fly in formation. Their leader carrying the
     same bomb we saw loaded earlier.


228  INT. FLOOR-LEVEL HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                    228

     Raymond, guns in each hand, comes rushing into the
     hallway. He SEES a small group of Babyzillas down the
     hall and gestures for the group to go the other way.

     Raymond backs away, guns trained on the Babyzillas who
     SNIFF the air and decide to pursue. Raymond turns and
     runs.


     ANGLE - FARTHER DOWN HALLWAY - AROUND THE CORNER - SAME

     As they tear forward they nearly run smack into a heard
     of several dozen Babyzillas who are tearing the
     concession stands to ribbons looking for food.

     Spotted, the Babyzillas LEAP forward after the team.
     Raymond spots the escalators across the hall.

                            RAYMOND
               The escalators, hurry!


229  EXT. SKIES - F-18'S - NIGHT                                229

     We FOLLOW the squadron as they pass us to reveal the
     beautiful MANHATTAN SKYLINE approaching.


230  INT. ESCALATOR CORRIDOR - MADISON SQUARE - SAME            230

     The team races into the corridor. Animal reaches down
     and hits the POWER button near the moving stairs. The
     escalator comes to life.

     The team runs down the "down" escalators as the
     Babyzillas flood into the corridor. Some try to go down
     the "up" escalator and fall all over themselves. Others
     are spooked by the moving down escalator. Finally, the
     brave ones begin to LEAP down the "down" escalator.


231  INT. MAIN LOBBY HALLWAY - SAME                             231

     Racing out of the escalator corridor the team moves into
     the main lobby and FREEZES. They are surrounded on all
     sides by Babyzillas!

     Like the scene in Hitcock's "The Birds" it is eerily
     still as everyone freezes.


232  EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - F-18'S - NIGHT                    232

     Closing over the city, the lead bomber breaks formation,
     flying lower, closer to the rooftops.


233  INT. COCKPIT - HUD DISPLAY - NIGHT                         233

     Through the windshield's Heads-Up-Display (HUD) we SEE a
     target LOCKING ON, flashing.

                            PILOT
               I'm locking on now.


234  INT. MAIN LOBBY - MADISON SQUARE - SAME                    234

     As several SNIFF THE AIR, they begin to CLOSE IN. The
     Babyzillas from the escalator corridor finally get to
     the ground level and rush over from behind.

     Raymond spots the large hanging CHANDELIERS in the front
     lobby. He FIRES a short BURST, SLICING the cable
     supporting the chandelier.

     The chandelier DROPS and SHATTERS in the center of the
     main lobby. The Babyzillas scatter, opening a pathway to
     the front door.

                            RAYMOND
               Go! Now!

     Raymond PUSHES the team forward as he takes the rear
     through the pathway which begins to close up as they
     pass through.

     The Babyzillas recover and begin to charge. As Raymond
     passes some CANDY MACHINES, he grabs one and SMASHES IT
     to the ground.


     THOUSANDS OF GUM BALLS

     Scatter all over the floor. As the Babyzillas run, they
     begin to stumble allover each other, tripping on the
     gum balls.

     Animal is the first to reach the main door, he opens it
     and Audrey and Nick are the first to exit. Raymond,
     FIRING MADLY behind as he rushes for the door.


235  INT. COCKPIT - F-18 - NIGHT                                235

     The locked FLASHES RED.

                            PILOT
               Stallion 15, Fox 6.


236  EXT. SKIES - F-18 - BOMB - NIGHT                           236

     The immense BOMB drops and takes flight on its own. We
     can see it's heading directly for MADISON SQUARE
     GARDEN.


237  EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT                         237

     Raymond exits and Animal shuts the door behind him. The
     Babyzillas SLAM against the doors. It takes all of
     Animal's and Raymond's strength to hold the doors
     closed.

     Raymond slides his rifle barrel between the handles as a
     temporary lock. He pulls Animal away and they take off
     running.


     BOMB'S P.O.V. - MADISON SQUARE - NIGHT

     Rapidly approaching the famous forum.


     ANGLE - RAYMOND, ANIMAL

     Not far behind Nick and Audrey as they race from the
     building. Behind them we SEE...


     BOMB AND BUILDING

     Collide and an ENORMOUS EXPLOSION ERUPTS, engulfing the
     entire building in a mountain of flame.

     Raymond, Animal, Audrey and Nick are THROWN several feet
     forwards, toppling to the ground from the incredible
     impact.

     As the building CRUMBLES in FLAMES we HEAR several of
     the Babyzillas SCREAMING. Soon they are silenced.

     Slowly Nick sits up and turns to Audrey. They're both
     shaken up. Nick touches her cheek gently.

                            NICK
               Are you okay?

                            AUDREY
               Somehow I never thought your life was
               this exciting.

                            NICK
               You'd be surprised.

                            AUDREY
               Really? I'd like to find out.

     She hugs him tightly. Nick smiles. Animal turns to
     Raymond who has cut above his eye.

                            ANIMAL
               Hey Man, you all right?

                            RAYMOND
               I could use a coffee.

     We begins to pull away from this tableau, slowly lifting
     upwards when suddenly...


     THAT FAMOUS WAIL

     Is heard! Then, violently BURSTING up through the ashes,
     a very angry GODZILLA emerges!

     Bleeding from his injuries, Godzilla leans down and
     nuzzles the burned out remains of his young. For the
     first time in the film we can SEE a partial expression
     of Godzilla's face; pain.

     But quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he
     focuses his hatred downwards, staring directly, and
     accusingly, at our heroes.

                            NICK
               Ohhhhhhhh.....shit.

                            ANIMAL
               What do we do?

                            RAYMOND
               Running would be a good idea.

     And they do just as Godzilla POUNCES. Fortunately our
     team DARTS around a corner just in time.


238  EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME                                    238

     As our heroes come rushing around a corner, Godzilla
     BURSTS THROUGH the building in front of them, sealing
     off their exit. Raymond notices a very narrow alley.


     ANGLE - ALLEY WAY

     Raymond leads them through this slim alley between to
     large brick buildings. They run for their lives as
     Godzilla appears behind them.

     His claws are too big to reach into the alley so he
     BULLDOZES his way into it, the building ripping apart as
     he marches forward.

     Bricks go FLYING as debris showers down on our team just
     they make their way to the other side.

     Slowed down by the the position of the alley, Godzilla
     SWINGS his arms violently to clear a path.


239  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      239

     Racing from the alley Raymond races over to a parked
     YELLOW CAB.


240  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS - SAME                               240

     In one deft move, Raymond draws a screwdriver out of his
     belt, pops the ignition device off the steering column
     and hot wires the car in under 15 seconds. It's
     amazing.

     As he does this the others pile into the car. Not even
     completely all in, Raymond takes off as soon as the
     engine turns over. Animal nearly falls out.


241  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      241

     Just as GODZILLA bursts out from between the buildings
     the CAB DARTS away, squealing around the next corner.


242  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                       242

     Power sliding around the wet street corner, the Yellow
     Cab FISHTAILS onto 8th Ave. Whipping around the corner
     behind them Godzilla appears.

     As he's MUCH faster, he nearly overtakes the car in a
     single LEAP but the cab SWERVES AGAIN moving down
     another street.


243  EXT. 27TH STREET - SAME                                    243

     The cab darts onto 27th street. DEBRIS tumbles down in
     their path as GODZILLA SMASHES through another
     building.


244  INT. CAB - SAME                                            244

     The rear window SHATTERS as falling bricks and debris
     HIT THE CAR. Again, the Cab darts down a small side
     street.


245  EXT. LEWELLEN DRIVE - SAME                                 245

     Using this small cut-across, the cab quickly exits out
     onto the next main street (28th). Godzilla rushes down
     the side street, his TAIL shattering buildings as he
     does.


246  INT. CAB - SAME                                            246

     Animal fumbles with his camera trying to get it to power
     up. The light goes ON and Animal quickly holsters it and
     begins filming out the shattered back window.

                            AUDREY
               Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut
               up Broadway.

                            ANIMAL
               You're crazy, go to the east side and
               take the park avenue to the JFK.

                            AUDREY
               The JFK? In the rain!?


247  EXT. STREET - CAB & GODZILLA - NIGHT                       247

     LEAPING forward, Godzilla BITES down, SNAPPING at the cab
     as it SWERVES just out of danger, gunning it.


248  INT. CAB - SAME - NIGHT                                    248

                            ANIMAL
               What are you talking about? The east
               side is always faster.

                            AUDREY
               But we can get to the west side
               faster.

     Through the rear window we SEE Godzilla SNAPPING down
     trying to take a bite. The cab, again, SWERVES wildly,
     darting down a side street.

                            RAYMOND
               Somebody make up your mind!

                            AUDREY & ANIMAL
               Take central park!


249  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - SAME                                     249

     Taking her advice, Raymond swerves up 8th Ave. uptown.
     He GUNS IT and RACES up ahead.


250  EXT. 28TH STREET - SAME                                    250

     The last two turns of the cab have temporarily
     disoriented Godzilla who looks around to find the cab.
     He moves up a block and begins to look around.


     GODZILLA'S P.O.V. - CAB - SAME - NIGHT

     Several blocks ahead, Godzilla spots the cab. He narrows
     his eyes and WAILS ANGRILY. Suddenly he BOLTS after the
     cab.


251  INT. CAB - SAME                                            251

     Animal clears away the broken glass and leans out the
     back window.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. THROUGH WINDOW - GODZILLA

     Gaining on them GODZILLA is in hot pursuit.

                            ANIMAL
               Better step on it Frenchie!


252  EXT. MEADOW - SAME                                         252

     The military is cleaning up the trap from before.
     Sergeant O'Neal SPINS as the cab LEAPS out from behind
     the trees.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               What the hell....?

     The cab POWER SLIDES right past and out of the Meadow
     again just as GODZILLA STOMPS directly into the clean up
     crew. Soldiers DIVE for cover as others scramble out of
     the way.

     Godzilla MARCHES after the cab, his tail SWIPING several
     vehicles which tumble, crashing into the troops.

     In a flash, Godzilla disappears back into the forest on
     the other side. O'Neal grabs his radio.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Command, Command, this Sergeant
               O'Neal. He's back!


253  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           253

     Major Hicks moves over towards the radios.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Captain Rogers, do we still have those
               F-18's in the air?

                            RODGERS
               They're heading back to base now,
               sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Turn 'em around.


254  EXT. BROADWAY - UPTOWN - SAME                              254

     The cab heads up the deserted streets, racing full
     tilt.


255  INT. CAB - SAME                                            255

     Animal pulls himself back into his seat.

                            ANIMAL
               I think we lost him.


256  EXT. BROADWAY - SAME                                       256

     Wrong again! Leaping out several blocks ahead, GODZILLA
     emerges. He KNEELS DOWN and gives a gigantic POWER BLAST
     of his BREATH.

     Cars, street signs, vending machines SAIL BACKWARDS from
     the force.

     A Newspaper vending machine SLAMS into the hood of the
     cab as the cab SQUEALS around a corner, avoiding the
     rest of the onslaught of debris.


257  EXT. SKIES - SAME                                          257

     The F-18's BANK and head back towards Manhattan.


258  EXT. HARLEM - SAME - NIGHT                                 258

     Racing up through the streets of Harlem we SEE the cab.


259  INT. CAB - SAME                                            259

     Everyone is looking around for the creature.

                            RAYMOND
               Anyone see him.

     Suddenly from behind, Animal spots the creature several
     blocks behind. Again, he lifts the camera.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     Running full boar directly at them.


260  EXT. HARLEM STREETS - CONTINUOUS                           260

     Godzilla quickly makes up ground. Running at the cab
     it's only a matter of seconds before he'll reach them.

261  INT. CAB - RAYMOND - SAME                                  261

     Raymond looks up, spots something.


     RAYMOND'S P.O.V. - SIGN

     Up ahead is a sign for the exit for the George
     Washington Bridge. Raymond decides to take it.


262  EXT. HARLEM STREETS - SAME                                 262

     The cab SWERVES heading towards the bridge entrance just
     as Godzilla BITES DOWN, barely missing the cab as it
     turns the corner.

     Godzilla LEAPS OVER THE ENTIRE BLOCK, landing directly
     IN FRONT OF THE CAB.

     The cab SPINS, pulling a full 180 degree turn, and PEELS
     OUT just before Godzilla can SNAP DOWN again, just
     missing the cab.

     The cab PEELS around the creature and UP THE ONRAMP.

     Just then Godzilla LEAPS AFTER THEM. His jaw open, he
     BITES DOWN ON THE CAB.


263  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS                                      263

     Everyone ducks as the enormous JAWS OF THE CREATURE
     CLAMP DOWN OVER THE CAB.


264  EXT. EXIT RAMP - SAME                                      264

     Taking a gigantic BITE out of the highway, some high
     tension wires and the support structure over the bridge,
     Godzilla CHOMPS DOWN on the cab.

     The large cement SIGN SLAMS into the roof of the
     creature's mouth, preventing him from crushing the cab
     with his teeth.


265  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      265

     The sign supports will not hold much longer as it
     crumbles just above the cab. The torn electric cables
     DANGLING dangerous close to the cab.

     Godzilla PUSHES his TONGUE towards the back of the car,
     trying to draw it into his throat!


266  INT. CAB                                                   266

     They're freaking out as the jaws are closing in on
     them.

                            AUDREY
               Gun it! Gun it!

                            RAYMOND
               I'm trying!


     C.U. CAB'S WHEELS

     Spinning in vain against the gigantic tongue that pushes
     against it, LIFTING the REAR of the vehicle.


267  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA - SAME                             267

     Like a dog with a bone, Godzilla SHAKES his head trying
     to rip the rest of the highway free. The portion of
     highway in front of the cab TEARS FREE, lifting.


268  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      268

     From the cab we SEE the horizon LIFT as the road begins
     to give way. The sign above CRUMBLING FURTHER.

     Nick turns and SEES...


     ELECTRIC CABLES - SPARKS

     Sparking as they hit against the supports of the sign,
     Nicks sees the cables dangling close to the cab. He
     takes off his jacket, wraps it around his hand and opens
     the cab door.

     Grabbing the cable with his wrapped hand, he JAMS THE
     CABLE DOWN into Godzilla's TONGUE. SPARKS FLY! Nick
     leans back inside, slamming the door shut.


269  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA                                    265

     He temporarily opens his mouth wider with a scream just
     before he is about to SLAM his jaws shut again...


     C.U. TIRES - SUDDENLY CATCHING

     As the tongue momentarily retreats from the SHOCK, the
     wheels CATCH and the CAB LURCHES FORWARD.


270  EXT. GODZILLA - CONTINUOUS                                 270

     As the sign CRUMBLES and the JAWS CRUSH DOWN, the cab
     SAILS OUT OF HIS MOUTH as the beast SWALLOWS the piece
     of highway.

     Landing, hard, onto the pavement, the cab PEELS OUT,
     burning rubber as it enters the George Washington
     Bridge.

     Godzilla SWALLOWS only to realize he didn't get them.
     Seeing the cab on the bridge Godzilla gives chase.


271  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE                              271

     The cab races towards us when Godzilla STEPS ONTO THE
     BRIDGE. His enormous weight makes the entire bridge
     WOBBLE.

     The Cab goes airborne then bottoms out as it returns to
     the asphalt as the bridge undulates beneath them. It's
     as though they were driving during an earthquake.

     With each stride Godzilla takes, the bridge becomes more
     unstable.


272  EXT. SKIES ABOVE THE HUDSON - F-18'S - SAME                272

     Swooping down the F-18's head directly towards the
     bridge. We see Godzilla about to overtake the Cab.


273  INT. COCKPIT                                               273

     The HUD begins to FLASH, LOCKED ON!

                            PILOT #2
               We are red and free. Stallion 10, Fox
               2.


274  EXT. BRIDGE - CAB AND GODZILLA                             274

     Only a stride away from being overtaken.


275  INT. OTHER COCKPIT - SAME                                  275

                            PILOT #3
               Stallion 12, Fox 2.


     ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON

     All at once they FIRE. Missiles heading right at
     camera.


     GODZILLA

     opens his mighty jaw about to CLAMP DOWN on them.

     The missiles CONNECT, SLAMMING INTO HIS CHEST,
     EXPLODING. His torso, rips apart. He SCREAMS OUT. His
     WAIL a painful death cry.

     His foot STOMPS DOWN as he tries to retain balance. The
     impact of the stomp acts like a shockwave that KNOCKS
     the Cab into a SPIN.

     SLAMMING into the guard rail, the cab bounces back into
     the road and keeps going.

     The injured Godzilla bites the bullet and continues
     pursuing, his gait slowing. The cab is able to make some
     distance.


     ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON

     Again they FIRE. A group of missiles darting out.


     GODZILLA

     The missiles HIT, ripping into him. Again GODZILLA
     SCREAMS out, his forward motion stopped.


276  EXT. OTHER SIDE OF BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                     276

     Where the blockade and angry mob still wait and watch in
     horror. The Cab SLIDES INTO A SPIN as it comes to a stop
     just in front of the crowd.

     Nick jumps out first, staring back at Godzilla. Audrey
     comes up from behind.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     His eyes rolling back into his head as he SCREAMS OUT.
     Slowly he TUMBLES.


     ANGLE - BRIDGE

     Godzilla's enormous head comes CRASHING DOWN in front of
     us. The tremendous impact sends TREMORS across the
     bridge.


277  EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                 277

     The gathered crowd is ROCKED from the impact of the
     toppled Godzilla.


     GODZILLA

     His last breath escaping. Defeated and weary, his eyes
     blink slowly as we watch his life slip away.


     NICK AND AUDREY

     Oddly, Nick stares sympathetically at Godzilla's sad and
     lifeless face.

     The stunned silence melts away as the mob behind them
     begins to applaud nervously, then vigorously. The mob
     breaks through the blockade and rushes over to our
     heroes, surrounding them. Cheering enthusiastically.


278  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     278

     The room is going berserk, everyone slapping hands. Lucy
     turns and gives a "high-five" to everyone around her.


279  EXT. JERSEY SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT              279

     Cameras flash like mad. Several news crews fight their
     way through the crowd.

                            REPORTERS
                      (overlapping)
               How did you discover the nest? Dr.
               Tatopoulis, can you tell us what
               happened back there?

                            NICK
               Sorry, guys, I've promised my story as
               an exclusive to another reporter.

     Nick winks at Audrey. Caiman pushes his way through the
     crowd of reporters over to her.

                            CAIMAN
               We did it! We've got the exclusive!
               Way to go, Audrey!

                            AUDREY
               We? I don't think so.

                            CAIMAN
               I want that story, Audrey. Remember
               you work for me.

                            AUDREY
               Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.

     Audrey waves goodbye as Animal walks over, checking his
     camera and his coat pocket.

                            ANIMAL
               Audrey, did you take the tape out of
               the camera?

                            AUDREY
               No.

                            NICK
               Where's Raymond?

     They look around, but he's gone. Nowhere to be seen.

                            ANIMAL
               I couldn't have just lost it?

     A phone begins to RING. Nick checks his pockets and finds
     Raymond's cellular phone. Nick answers.

                            NICK
               Hello?

                            RAYMOND (O.S.)
               It's Raymond.

                            NICK
               Where are you?


280  EXT. PAY PHONE - DOWN THE BLOCK - SAME - NIGHT             280

     Raymond watches the mob scene from a distance.

                            RAYMOND
               Tell your friends I will send the tape
               after I remove a few items from it.


     NICK AND AUDREY

     Nick nods to Audrey that it's Raymond.

                            NICK
               I understand.

                            RAYMOND
               I just wanted to say, au revoir and
               thank you for your help, my friend.

                            NICK
               Wait.
                      (line goes dead; to
                      himself)
               Au revoir.

                            AUDREY
               Who was that French guy, anyway.

                            NICK
               Oh, just some insurance guy.

     Off Audrey's confused expressions we PULL BACK, farther
     and farther. We see the mob, the military, the command
     tents and finally we pull back far enough to reveal
     Godzilla's mighty head laying on the end of the bridge.

                                             CUT TO:


281  INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT                           281

     We FLOAT through the demolished station almost as though
     we were a moving point of view. We travel thorough the
     debris of the station into one of the tunnels.

     We travel deeper and deeper into the distance. A shaft
     of light up ahead. We move closer to it.

     As we get nearer we realize it's one of Godzilla's
     gigantic EGGS. WE move closer and closer to the solitary
     egg. Just as we are about to collide with it. CRACK. IT
     OPENS.

                                             FADE OUT:


                              THE END
GODZILLA

                               by

                  Dean Devlin & Roland Emmerich










                                               First Draft 2/19/96





     FADE IN:

     An iguana...

     Crawling off its nest, leaving its eggs exposed.


  1  EXT. MORUROA ATOLL ISLANDS, FRENCH POLYNESIA - PACIFIC       1

     Grainy, Kodak color, nineteen sixties documentary
     footage of a beautiful Polynesian island. We SEE quick
     shots of Kimono Dragons, Gila Monsters and Chameleons
     all in their natural tropical environment.

     Super: Moruro Atoll Islands, French Polynesia - June
     1968

     Incongruously over this jungle environment we HEAR a
     static ridden radio filtered VOICE, slowly counting down
     in French. It is almost as through the reptiles of the
     island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously
     move about.

     Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a
     nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky.

     We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the
     over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the
     French government held in this tropical region.

     Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One
     building after the next, accelerating in momentum,
     culminating in one final EXPLOSION.

     The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like
     fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands
     below.

     We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile,
     unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the
     lizard's eggs.

     Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to
     clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the
     eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash. WE
     continue to push in, getting closer...closer...

                                             SMASH CUT TO:


  2  EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - OIL TANKER - RAINSTORM - NIGHT          2

     Smashing through the choppy waters, barely by the storm
     we SEE the CORI AKIDO, a Japanese oil supertanker.

     Super: Pacific Ocean, present day


  3  INT. CORI AKIDO - BRIDGE - NIGHT                             3

     We TRACK across the complicated computerized
     navigational console that is actually steering the
     immense ship. In the b.g. we HEAR a Japanese t.v.
     program playing.

     At the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an
     overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy
     satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match.

     Suddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled,
     the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to
     the console.

     The SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly
     toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a
     KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the
     radio/intercom.

                            SKIPPER
                      (in Japanese)
               Captain. This is the bridge. We have
               an emergency.


  4  INT. SUPERTANKER'S HALLWAYS - SAME - NIGHT                   4

     Alarms BLARING. The crew rushes out of their quarters
     and into the hall. Quickly they race for the upper
     decks.


  5  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - BY KITCHEN                              5

     The ship's elderly COOK pokes his head out of the
     kitchen and yells at some of the crew as they pass by.

                            COOK
                      (in Japanese)
               What's going on? What's happening?

     Before anyone can answer, the ship is ROCKED by an
     enormous THUD as something hits the side of the immense
     ship. The crew TUMBLES as the ship SWAYS VIOLENTLY.

     The old Cook is thrown to the floor. He looks up
     nervously.


  6  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   6

     The CAPTAIN enters quickly, joining the Skipper at the
     console.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (in Japanese)
               What was that!?

                            SKIPPER
                      (in Japanese)
               I can't tell...

     Again, the ship is HIT. An enormous CRASHING SOUND is
     HEARD as the ship ROCKS to one side, tossing the Captain
     and Skipper to the floor.

     Suddenly we HEAR the tell-tale, famous SCREAMING WAIL of
     our creature from somewhere outside. Terror shines in
     the Captain's eyes at the sound.


  7  INT. HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                           7

     The crew, getting back on their feet, reacts to the
     horrible WAILING SOUND.

     Suddenly the ship is HIT AGAIN. This time something
     enormous RIPS THROUGH THE HULL, crushing one of the crew
     members as it TEARS THROUGH THE WALLS.

     Water RUSHES THROUGH the large gaping hole, quickly
     filling the hallway. The Cook and what's left of the
     crew scurry for the stairs, as the water level chases
     them.


  8  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   8

     The ship's computers are WHIRLING with warning lights
     and alarms. As the Skipper tries to adjust the controls
     in vain, the Captain grabs the ship's p.a. system.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (in Japanese)
               Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the
               lifeboats...

     But before he can say anything more, something WHIPS
     across the bridge's enormous windshield, SHATTERING THE
     GLASS. Was it a tail? No way, far too big.


  9  EXT. SHIP'S DECK - SAME - NIGHT                              9

     The doors BURST open as the crew and the Cook rush out
     onto the deck. Again, the ship is HIT, ROCKING it
     violently.


     A TARP

     is ripped away, revealing a life boat. Two more life
     boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately
     tries to hoist them up and over the side.


     ANGLE - WATER BESIDE THE TANKER

     Something ENORMOUS jolts out of the water towards the
     ship. Through the rainstorm it is hard to make out what
     it is, but it SLAMS into the side of the ship, RIPPING
     INTO IT, pulling down the starboard side as it does.
     Could that have been a CLAW?


     THE CREW

     Are thrown backwards. The lifeboats swing WILDLY,
     several of them SMASHING INTO BITS as they slam against
     the ship.


     THE CLAW

     Or whatever it is, RIPS INTO THE SIDE AGAIN. This time
     the entire ship begins to FLIP OVER.


     A LIFEBOAT

     Bounces off the deck and slides off the side. Following
     it is the Cook.

     Desperately, the Cook grabs onto the ship's side railing
     to keep from falling off. He looks back and SEES
     something so horrible that he SCREAMS IN TERROR and lets
     go of the railing.

     The old Cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker
     FLIPS OVER.

     WINDSHIELD WIPERS

     Clearing at their highest speed, we see through the rain
     doused windshield, DR. NIKO "NICK" TATOPOULOS. Music
     blares from the tiny headphones of his Walkman.

                            NICK
                      (singing)
               ...I'm singing in the rain, just
               singing in the rain...

 10  INT. RUSSIAN TOWN - RAIN - DAY                              10

     The utility van races through this small Russian town
     right past a roadblock marked with the international
     signs for "no trespass" and "nuclear radiation."

                            NICK
               ..."What a glorious feeling. I'm happy
               again..."

     As the van disappears down the road, we CRANE UP
     revealing a city sign reading: CHERNOBYL, RUSSIA.


 11  EXT. CHERNOBYL DIRT PARK - RAIN - DAY                       11

     With the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the
     distance, the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this
     field of dirt.

     Nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van.
     He opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic
     cases.

     Walking a few yards away from the van, he dumps the
     cases on the ground, opening them to REVEAL an
     assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment.

     Taped to the inside are several photos of a girl we'll
     meet later. Some of the photos are of her looking young
     and beautiful. Others are of the two of them happily
     together.

     With a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to
     life. Inside one of the cases are several cables
     attached to long SPIKES. He grabs them and dashes away.

                            NICK
               ..."I'm laughing at clouds, so dark up
               above..."

     Nick rushes over to a small patch of land and begins to
     SHOVE the spikes into the muddy earth.

                            NICK
               ..."The sun's in my heart and I'm
               ready for love..."

     Once firmly in the ground, he rushes back over to the
     van and pops the hood.


     CLOSE - VAN'S ENGINE

     We SEE the steaming engine and a large electric car
     BATTERY.

                            NICK
               ..."Let the cloudy skies chase..."

     He attaches the cables to the battery and they SPARK!
     Nick YELPS and jumps back. Shaking off the shock, he
     rushes back over to the mud pit, dropping down to his
     knees.

     Suddenly, raising from the mud we see DOZENS OF
     EARTHWORMS. Excitedly Tatopoulos grabs a big empty glass
     jar and begins filling the jar with worms, happily in
     his element.

                            NICK
               ..."I'm singin' in the mud, just
               scooping up my worms..."

     Unable to hear over his Walkman, he is oblivious as an
     enormous RUSSIAN MILITARY HELICOPTER lands right behind
     him.

     From the intense wind kicked up by the helicopter,
     Tatopoulos finally turns in time to see several RUSSIAN
     OFFICERS coming toward him. Nick scrambles to his feet.

                            NICK
                      (broken Russian)
               Good day. I am here with
               permission...I have a, a...
                      (in English)
               Permit. How do you say permit?

     He goes through his pockets looking for his permits.

                            MALE VOICE (O.S.)
               Dr. Nick Topopolosis?

     Tatopoulos looks up as the Russian soldiers move past
     him and over towards his cases of equipment. A man in a
     long raincoat comes forward.

                            NICK
               It's Tatopoulos.

                            TERRINGTON
               The worm guy, right?
                      (extending his hand as he
                      approaches)
               Kyle Terrington, U.S. State
               Department.

     The Russian soldiers close up his equipment and take it
     off to the Helicopter.

                            NICK
               What are they doing?

                            TERRINGTON
               You've been reassigned.

                            NICK
               You can't shut me down now! My
               research here's not finished!

                            TERRINGTON
               It is now.

 12  EXT. PAPEETE - TAHITI - STREET - DAY                        12

     Coastal town of Papeete, Tahiti. With the ocean in the
     distance, through the heat waves we SEE a row of
     official looking black sedans coming toward us.


 13  EXT. PAPEETE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                    13

     The doors to the sedans open as a group of very official
     looking Government types. Stopping to light his
     cigarette is PHILLIP RAYMOND, 40's, intense, dangerous
     and worst of all...French.


 14  INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                 14

     Raymond leads the official looking group down the hall.
     A BRIEFING OFFICER rushes over. (The following dialog is
     entirely in French with subtitles)

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               The Japanese consulate has been
               calling and we've been getting
               pressure from the Americans.

                            RAYMOND
               What did you tell them?

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               Nothing yet.

                            RAYMOND
               Are there any other survivors?

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               Only one, Sir. He was very lucky.

     The group arrives at a door at the end of the hall. The
     Briefing Officer opens the door.


     RAYMOND'S P.O.V. - THROUGH OPEN DOOR

     In the corner of the large room we see the old Cook from
     the tanker curled up in the fetal position. The doctors
     and a few nurses are attending to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Get them out of there.

     Two of the Officials move in and escort the Doctors and
     Nurses out of the room. Raymond nods to two other
     Officials who begin to unpack some recording equipment,
     including a video camera.


 15  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME                                   15

     Raymond enters and moves close to the old Cook, kneeling
     down in front of him, inspecting his distant glare. The
     old Cook seems to be in a world of his own, rocking back
     and forth. Raymond nods to another Official who comes
     forward.

                            RAYMOND
                      (in French)
               Ask him what happened.

     The Second Official ask him in Japanese, but the old
     Cook does not respond. He asks again but the old Cook
     seems to be in a world of his own.

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
                      (in English)
               It's no use. He's been like this since
               we fished him out of the ocean.
               Whatever happened to that tanker put
               him in a complete state of shock.

     Raymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high.
     The old Cook's eyes slowly come back to life, transfixed
     by the fire. Slowly he brings the flame close to the old
     Cook's face.

                            RAYMOND
                      (in English)
               What did you see, old man?

     Drawn out of himself by the flame...

                            OLD COOK
                      (weakly)
               Gojira...Gojira...

     Raymond shoots a look at the Second Official for an
     explanation.

                            SECOND OFFICIAL
                      (in English)
               I have no idea what he is saying.

                            OLD COOK
                      (stronger)
               ...Gojira!...Gojira!...GOJIRA!!

     A small sea plane flies over this jungle region of
     Panama, darting up the Gulf into the lush greenery of
     the countryside.

     Super: Guilfo de San Miguel, Panama - 45 km outside
     of La Paz

     Slowly the plane begins to descend, landing by a small
     village.


 17  EXT. VILLAGE FISHING DOCK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY             17

     Several soldiers unload Nick's cargo as he steps out of
     the plane onto the dock. As he walks towards shore he
     SEES...


     NICK'S P.O.V. - POLICE BARRICADE

     Dozens of citizens as well as the press are gathered at
     a police barricade; their access to the village denied.
     Panamanian Police and U.S. military working together to
     keep people out.

     Marching up the shore to greet Nick is MAJOR TONY HICKS,
     30's, efficient, who is spearheading this operation.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Dr. Niko Topopolosis?

                            NICK
                      (correcting)
               It's Tatopoulos.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Right. The worm guy.
                      (to guards at blockade)
               Can someone get those people off the
               beach?

                            NICK
               Excuse me, would you mind telling me
               what the hell I'm doing here?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Follow me.

     The Major leads Nick up the beach away from the crowds.

                            NICK
               You didn't answer my question. In
               fact, for the last 18 hours no one has
               answered any of my questions.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We have a situation on our hands that
               requires your particular expertise.


     ANGLE - DESTROYED VILLAGE HUT

     Several soldiers and researchers are investigating the
     site when Nick and the Major walk past.

                            NICK
               Look, I may work for the Nuclear
               Regulatory Commission but accidents
               and spills are not my field.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We know.

     Major Hicks motions to some guards who clear a blockade
     away from a jungle pathway. Major Hicks takes the
     pathway.

                            NICK
               Do you know that you just interrupted
               a three year study of the Chernobyl
               earthworm?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Yeah, you're the worm guy.

                            NICK
               The radioactive contamination in that
               area altered the earthworm's DNA! You
               have any idea what that means?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               No, but I have the feeling I'm about
               to find out.

                            NICK
               It means that due to a man made
               accident the Chernobyl earthworms are
               now over seventeen percent larger than
               they were before. Mutated by seventeen
               percent?

     Major Hicks stops, turns to Nick.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (bemused)
               Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.

                            NICK
               They're enormous! A new species
               created by man's recklessness. That's
               what I've been trying to tell you, I'm
               only a biologist. I take radioactive
               samples and study them.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Then you're perfect.
                      (pointing to the ground)
               Here's your radioactive sample. Study
               it.

     With that Major Hicks walks away.

                            NICK
               What sample?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You're standing on it.

     Nick looks down, sees nothing.

                            NICK
               I don't see it.
                      (no response)
               Where is it?

     We CRANE UP above him, pulling back farther and farther,
     until we SEE he's standing inside of a 15 YARD LONG
     GIGANTIC FOOTPRINT in the sand.

                            NICK (CONT'D)
               I don't see it!

     Two scientists have spread out a tape measure to
     document its length as two others inspect it with Geiger
     counters. Nick sees them and realizes he's standing in a
     remarkable discovery. He looks up ahead and SEES...


     OVERHEAD TITLT SHOT - Foot steps...-

     Five gigantic footsteps in front of him. Other
     researchers examining the prints with all kinds of
     equipment. Geiger counters, CLICK, CLICKING away. Nick
     is stunned.


18   EXT. TATTERED VILLAGE REMAINS - MOMENTS LATER               18

     Nick rushes to catch up with Major Hicks who walks
     towards a command tent in the distance.

                            NICK
                      (flabbergasted)
               That was a footprint. I was standing
               inside a footprint.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               That's right.

                            NICK
               But there's no animal in the world
               that can make prints like that? Is
               there?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We're hoping you're going to help us
               figure that out.

     The Major gestures to the many villagers who are being
     attended to. Some are injured, others are being examined
     for radiation. The village has been decimated.

                            NICK
               Somebody must have seen it.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               It happened so fast no one knew what
               hit them 'til is was over.

     A jeep pulls up and PETERS, a young researcher, comes
     rushing over with a video tape in his hands. As he passes
     Major Hicks...

                            PETERS
                      (on the run)
               Tape's in. The French finally released
               it.

     Peters takes off for the command' tent. Nick and the
     Major follow.


     COMMAND TENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Part military, part scientific command post. Lots of
     activity. Peters waves the tape as he rushes over to a
     television. Major Hicks and Nick follow.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               A tanker was attacked and sunk
               yesterday near the French Polynesians.
               We think there's a connection.

                            WOMAN SCIENTIST (ELSIE)
               Is that the tape of the witness?

     Excitedly, ELSIE CHAPMAN, heavy set, early 30's,
     paleontologist and head of the research team, leads
     several of her colleagues over to the t.v.

                            NICK
               Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...

                            ELSIE
               Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.

     She's clearly attracted to him. This doesn't escape
     Nick, who's not too comfortable with her flirtatious
     glare. She turns to a scientist standing next to her,
     DR. CLIVE CRAVEN.

                            ELSIE (CONT'D)
               Dr. Craven, have you met the worm
               guy?

                            DR. CRAVEN
               Nice to meet you.

     The t.v. turns on and we SEE the old Cook, rocking on
     his bed, repeating over and over the same word...

                            OLD COOK
                      (filtered through t.v.)
               ...Gojira...Gojira...Gojira...

     This is all too overwhelming for him. He turns from the
     t.v. and looks out into the jungle.

     Slowly he walks away, staring at something in the
     distance with total awe. Elsie walks up next to him.

                            ELSIE
               What could have possibly done all
               that?

     We REVERSE ANGLE and SEE what they are staring at.

     A gigantic path cut through the jungle.

     Something of immense size has trampled and cut a deep
     and wide path right through the jungle forest that goes
     on for miles on end. Over the stunned face of Nick we
     HEAR...

                            OLD COOK (O.S.)

 19  INT. WNEW T.V. STATION - DAY                                19

     As we WIDEN we see this is one of several wall mounted
     monitors all showing channel WNEW. Through the glass
     doorway nearby we see CHARLES CAIMAN, 40's, handsome,
     entering the office.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               Murray wants these copied to each
               field producer...


     ANGLE - SECRETARY DESK

     Standing in front of the desk is AUDREY TIMMONDS, early
     thirties, attractive, small town girl who still hasn't
     toughened in the big city and talking with her
     co-worker, LUCY, sitting.

                            AUDREY
               And I'm supposed to remind you to call
               him on all of Caiman's expense
               p.o.'s.

                            LUCY
               Speak of the devil.

     Just then Caiman passes behind them.

                            AUDREY
                      (nervous)
               Think I should ask him? I'm going to
               ask him. You think I should? I will.

     Audrey makes the decision and bolts after Caiman. Lucy
     rolls her eyes.

                            LUCY
               Oh girl...


     ANGLE - CAIMAN

     As he walks towards his office Audrey races up to him.
     Seeing her, he walks faster hoping to avoid her. He
     can't.

                            AUDREY
               Did you talk with Humphries?

                            CAIMAN
               This is not the place...

                            AUDREY
               Just tell me, did you talk with him?

                            CAIMAN
               He said he'd consider it. It's between
               you and Rodriguez.

                            AUDREY
               Are you serious? He's going to
               consider me for he job? What else did
               he say?

     They arrive at his office. An enormous standee of
     himself with the ACTION NEWS CREW is there.

                            CAIMAN
               Why don't I tell you over dinner
               tonight? Your place.

     He stops at his door. Audrey is startled.

                            AUDREY
               Mr. Caiman, you're married.

                            CAIMAN
               And you're beautiful...

                            AUDREY
               Mr. Caiman...

                            CAIMAN
               Call me Charlie.

                            AUDREY
                      (stubbornly)
               Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra
               research for you after hours and
               weekends for nearly a year. And I've
               never asked for anything but this job
               is really important to me. I'm too old
               to be an assistant anymore. I need to
               know this job is going someplace.

                            CAIMAN
               So have dinner with me tonight.

                            AUDREY
               I can't.

                            CAIMAN
               It's your choice.

     Caiman shuts the door on her. She turns and is face to
     face with the standee of Caiman. She takes out her
     chewing gum and plasters it on his nose.

 20  EXT. JAMAICAN HIGHWAY - AERIAL SHOT - DAY                   20

     Over the bumpy Jamaican highway we FOLLOW from above
     several military jeeps racing in convoy.

     Super: Great Pedro Bluff, Jamaica


 21  INT. JEEP - SAME                                            21

     Elsie, Nick and Clive are cramped together along with
     Nick's equipment in the back of the jeep. Nick looks
     very uncomfortable. Elsie looks at Nick...lasciviously.

                            ELSIE
               Three years digging up worms in
               Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos
               handle it?

                            NICK
               Oh, I'm not married.

                            ELSIE
               Really? A girlfriend then?

                            NICK
               No. Perhaps I work too much.

                            ELSIE
                      (filtered)
               You mean to tell me that there is no
               one who holds a special place in your
               heart?

     Nick seems to get lost in thought.

                            NICK
               Not for a long time, now.

                            ELSIE
               Well, I think you're cute.

                            NICK
                      (awkward)
               Oh, thank you.
                      (whispered to Clive)
               Is she always like this?

                            CLIVE
                      (conspiratorially)
               I had to beat her off with a stick.

     helicopter we REVEAL...


     JAMAICAN BEACH WITH A BEACHED CARGO SHIP - DAY

     Taking up nearly the entire beach, an enormous cargo
     ship lays on its side in the sand. Two gigantic holes,
     ripped into its hull.


     MILITARY JEEPS

     Nick hops out and joins Major Hicks et al as they push
     past the gathered crowd of onlookers. The group gives a
     collective gasp as they see the ship for the first
     time.

     Three men (who we'll recognize from the Tahiti hospital)
     take measurements of the holes in the ship.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Who are they? Lieutenant, get those
               people away from there.

                            RAYMOND
                      (French accent)
               They are with me!

     Everyone in the group turns to find Mr. Phillip
     Raymond.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               And who are you?

     Raymond hands him, as well as anyone who wants one, his
     business card.

                            RAYMOND
               CHARGEURES, property and casualty
               insurance. We are preparing a report.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You're fast.

                            RAYMOND
               That is our job.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Well your people are getting in the
               way of my job.

                            RAYMOND
               Major, what do you think could have
               done this?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Get your people out of there or I
               will.

     The Major walks away. Raymond studies him as he does.


     ANGLE - SHIP

     Nick can't take his eyes off the enormous holes in the
     hull. He steps closer and turns to Peters, who's taking
     radiation counts of the ship.

                            NICK
               Mind if I borrow this?

     Peter hands him his Geiger counter and walks into the
     cracked hull of the ship.


 22  INT. CARGO HULL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                          22

     Inside is eerily dark and creepy. The guts of the ship
     are tangled inside. Holding a Geiger counter, he gets
     readings from all over the area. One particular spot,
     above him, seems slightly stronger.

     Nick SEES something there. He opens his knapsack and
     puts on some rubber gloves, removing a glass jar (like
     the ones from Chernobyl)

     Carefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp
     shard of metal. Clinging to it he finds a MEATY CHUNK OF
     REPTILE FLESH.

     He tries remove it but he only gets half. He places it
     into his jar. Just as he reaches for the other half,
     SOMETHING GIVES WAY.

     With a JOLT, the section above him collapses. A rush of
     water falls and a HUMAN BODY swings down, just in front
     of him.

     Nick tumbles backwards, his heart pounding. The body
     swings lifelessly as it hangs from above.

     The others rush to his side, checking to see if he's all
     right.

                            PETERS
               You okay, Nick?

                            NICK
               Yeah, I'm...wait...I lost...

     Nick looks around frantically when the glass sample jar
     is suddenly handed to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Are you looking for this?

                            NICK
               Thanks.

     Raymond studies Nick as he joins the rest outside.

     UNDERWATER - NETS - MOVING P.O.V.

     We are moving very quickly underwater. Ahead of us are
     some large FISHING NETS with a catch of fish carried in
     the bunt. Quickly we are heading for a collision.


 23  EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - OFF NEW ENGLAND COAST - DAY           23

     A great day for fishing. Slicing through the water we
     SEE three New England Fishing TRAWLERS, the HARPO, the
     CHICO, and the GROUCHO.


 24  EXT. THE HARPO - SAME - DAY                                 24

     ARTHUR is at the wheel. Suddenly the engines WHINE as
     the ship begins to slow down. Surprised, Arthur checks
     his throttle.


 25  EXT. THE CHICO - SAME - DAY                                 25

     LEONARD and his 1st MATE are puzzled by the engine WHINE
     of their own ship.

                            LEONARD
               Jerry, why are we slowing down?

                            JERRY (O.S.)
               She's heavy in the bunt.

                            LEONARD
               That was fast.


 26  EXT. THE GROUCHO - SAME - DAY                               26

     The captain, JULES, hasn't noticed a thing as he lays on
     his deck tanning himself, a boom-abox blaring next to
     him. Suddenly THUD. The ship JOLTS for a second. Jules
     slides and BANGS his head into the boom-box. He yelps.

                            DECK HAND
               The nets are full!

                            JULES
               Then bring 'em in!

                            DECK HAND
               We can't. She won't budge!

     Jules gets up to move aft when THUD, again the ship
     ROCKS.


     ALL THREE BOATS SLOW TO A CRAWL

     Arthur tries to GUN his engine but it only WHINES. Soon
     all three boats STOP DEAD. Nothing but quiet for a long
     beat.

                            ARTHUR
               What is going on?

     Then with another JOLT all three boats begin to move
     BACKWARDS, DRAGGED BY THEIR OWN NETS!

                            LEONARD
               She's going sternway!

                            FIRST MATE
               What the hell did we catch?

     The three boats begin to PICK UP SPEED, moving BACKWARDS
     in the water. Water SPLASHES up into the boats, winches
     begin to CRACK under the building pressure.

     The boats begin to move incredibly FAST backwards.
     Things on the boat begin to BREAK and CRASH DOWN onto
     the decks of the ships.

                            JULES
               Cut us free! Cut the nets!

     The same cry is heard on all three boats. Leonard grabs
     an AXE and starts HACKING AWAY at the tow lines.

     Jules and his deck hands do the same. WIRE SHEERS are
     brought out for the larger CABLES connected to the nets.
     Desperately they try and free themselves as their boats
     are dragged helplessly backwards.

                            ARTHUR
                      (screaming at his men)
               Cut the damned cables!


     A CABLE SNAPS!

     Jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either
     cut or snapped from the pressure. Their boat stops.


     ANOTHER CABLE SNAPS!

     Leonard and his crew TUMBLE to the deck as their boat is
     freed.


     THE HARPO

     Is not so fortunate. The lone boat dragged backwards,
     faster now without the weight of the other boats. Then
     suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get PULLED DOWN,
     dipping into the water.

     With an unstoppable force the Harpo gets PULLED UNDER
     WATER. Deck hands LEAP off the boat as the top cabin is
     CRUSHED as the entire ship slowly DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE
     SEA.

     For a moment all is quiet. No one can believe what just
     happened. Hearts pounding, catching their breath.

     Then with a WHOOSH of air pressure, the Harpo BURSTS out
     of the water. With a gigantic SPLASH, the boat FLOPS on
     its side and capsizes. The waters calm, but the nerves
     of Jules and Leonard don't.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


 27  EXT. CLOUDY SKIES - MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - DAY          27

     A storm is brewing ahead as this large Military
     Transport plane glides into view then BANKS away.


     PETRI DISH

     A small piece of Nick's SAMPLE is cut away and placed on
     a glass microscope slide.

 28  INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - SAME - DAY                  28

     Nick sits on the floor surrounded by his sloppily
     unpacked equipment as he places the slide under his
     microscope, examining his specimen.

     Quickly stepping over him a young SOLDIER rushes over to
     Major Hicks, seated with the rest of the team on the
     plane's opposing benches. The Solider interrupts their
     discussion.

                            SOLDIER
               Major, we just got a report of a
               fishing trawler going down. Exact
               position, forty seven degrees
               latitude, 67 longitude.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What makes you think it's related?

                            SOLDIER
               The trawler was pulled under.

     The team exchanges worried glances. Hicks moves over to
     a map where the other incidents have been marked. He
     traces his finger up the 67th longitude until he hits
     the 47th parallel. Just off the East Coast.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Jesus Christ! It's only two hundred
               miles off the American Eastern
               seaboard and we don't even know what
               it is.

                            ELSIE
               Theropoda Allosaurus. Some type of
               enormous reptile the likes of which we
               haven't seen since the age of
               prehistoric dinosaurs.

                            CLIVE
                      (sarcastic)
               So where's been hiding the last sixty
               million years?

                            ELSIE
               The depth and breath of the ocean
               floor has barely been explored. His
               kind could have survived there
               completely undetected.

                            NICK (O.S.)
               What about the traces of radiation?

     Everyone turns to discover Nick has walked over holding
     his loosely scribbled notes in his hand.

                            NICK
               The radiation is not an anomaly, it's
               the clue. This creature is far too
               unique on every level to be some lost
               dinosaur.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Don't tell me why it's not, tell me
               what the hell it is.

                            NICK
               What do we know? It was first sighted
               off the French Polynesian Pacific. An
               area that has been exposed to dozens
               of nuclear tests over the last thirty

                            NICK
               More than that. I believe this is a
               mutated aberration, a hybrid from the
               fall out in that region.

                            CLIVE
                      (sarcastic)
               Like your earthworms?

                            NICK
               Yes! We're looking at a completely
               incipient creature. The dawn of a new
               species. The first of its kind.

                                             CUT TO:


     OCEAN WATER

     Racing close to the ocean waters below, something DARK
     and ENORMOUS moves swiftly below the surface. We TILT UP
     from the raging tides up to REVEAL...


 29  EXT. MANHATTAN ISLAND - SKYLINE - RAIN - DAY                29

     A storm has arrived as rain moistens the city ahead.


 30  INT. DINER - SAME - DAY                                     30

     Dripping wet, Audrey enters from the rain, removing her
     raincoat. She walks to a booth where Lucy and ANIMAL, a
     slovenly, Italian video cameraman is his mid-thirties,
     are taking their lunch break. Animal has two plates of
     food he cobbles down.

                            AUDREY
                      (sitting)
               My life sucks.

                            LUCY
               Oh, please, your life doesn't suck.
               His life sucks.

                            ANIMAL
                      (between chews)
               That's cuz I'm married to you.

                            LUCY
               Shut up. How can you eat like that?

                            ANIMAL
               Big bites.

                            AUDREY
               I can't believe he put the moves on
               me. After everything I've done for
               him.

                            LUCY
               He's scum! As far as he's concerned
               you're just a pair of breasts that
               talk.

                            ANIMAL
               I like that image.

                            AUDREY
               You know how I spent last weekend?
               Walking his damned dog.

                            LUCY
               I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a
               douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap,
               puke chunks...

                            ANIMAL
               Hey, hey! I'm eating here!

                            LUCY
               Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's
               your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in
               this town. You gotta be a killer to
               get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'?
               I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't
               got what it takes.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, you don't think that's true,
               do you?

                            ANIMAL
               Nice guys finish last. First rule of
               the jungle.

                            AUDREY
               Well, I can be tough if I want.

                            ANIMAL & LUCY
               Yeah, sure.

                            AUDREY
                      (seeing something)
               Oh my God!

     Everything turns to see what Audrey is looking at.
     Audrey gets up and rushes over to a television above the
     counter.

                            AUDREY
                      (excitedly)
               Turn that up, turn it up.

     The waitress does. On the t.v. plays the same news story
     we saw from before from Panama. This time we SEE Nick
     and Major Hicks walking on the beach.

                            AUDREY
               It's Nick! I know that guy. I know
               him!

                            LUCY
                      (unimpressed)
               Who is he?

                            AUDREY
               He was my college sweetie! Look at
               him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What
               the hell is he doing in Panama.


 31  EXT. NEW YORK FISH MARKET - BELOW JFK HIGHWAY - DAY         31

     Even in the rain doesn't keep people away. Buyers haggle
     with sellers. A large MARKET, truck loads of fish. No
     one seems to notice the river across from them...


     MOUTH OF THE EAST RIVER

     Enormous turbulence in the water. Slowly something
     begins to LIFT, sheets of water fall. Bursting out, the
     backside TALONS of the enormous reptile pierce through.
     The TAIL slices through the turbulence.

     Two ships anchored at dock begin to LIFT UPWARDS as the
     beast below them begins to rise.


     ANGLE FISH MARKET

     A groaning WAIL ROARS, echoing. The people of the fish
     market turn just in time to see...


     THE ANCHORED SHIPS

     Lifting impossibly into the air above the pier. Suddenly
     a TIDAL WAVE of water comes CRASHING down, flooding the
     fish market.


 32  INT. TRANSIT BUS - P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD - RAIN -       32
     DAY

     Through the swinging windshield wipers of the bus we see
     the JFK highway in front of us. Suddenly we see...


     AN ENORMOUS FOOT

     Comes crashing down atop JFK highway, crushing it. The
     TRANSIT BUS tumbles off the demolished highway.

     The man in the MARKET TRUCK is TOSSED and ENORMOUS TEETH
     puncture the top and bottom of his truck as it's LIFTED
     IN THE AIR. The man LEAPS from the open back of the
     truck.

     He lands, HARD, down in front of one of the fish market
     stores as hundreds of fish RAIN DOWN from above. With a
     loud CRASH, the demolished truck SLAMS to the ground
     nearby.


 33  EXT. POLITICAL RALLY - BUILDING STEPS - RAIN - DAY          33

     With a large RE-ELECT MAYOR FAUSTINO poster behind him,
     the MAYOR is at the podium. Before him is a sea of
     umbrellas.

                            MAYOR
               I'd like to thank you all for coming
               out on this beautiful New York City
               day.

     Some in the crowd laugh as others applaud. Lost in the
     sounds of the crowd we HEAR a soft THUMPING in the
     distance.

                            MAYOR
               When I came into office four years
               ago, people didn't think we could
               reduce crime and I did.


     ANGLE - COP IN BACK OF CROWD

     leaning to the cop next to him.

                            COP
                      (sarcastic)
               Yeah, he did.

                            MAYOR
               People didn't think I could restore
               order...

     This time the THUMPING is HEARD, growing much louder.

                            MAYOR
               ...and I did. The city is a safer
               place today...

     Before he can continue the crowd begins to murmur with
     fear as the THUMPING grows LOUDER and CLOSER. Suddenly
     with a large CRASHING SOUND a building nearby begins to
     CRUMBLE.

                            MAYOR
                      (to his aides)
               What the hell....

     People SCRAMBLE to get out of the way as DEBRIS from the
     falling BUILDING litters the area. The Mayor is pulled
     inside by his security men.

     Bursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we
     SEE the enormous LEG of the reptile as it KICKS debris
     out of its way.


     SIDE ANGLE - WALL STREET - FAST TRAVELING SHOT

     Several cars are SQUASHED quickly as the enormous FEET
     of the beast STOMPS through the street. Cars FLATTEN and
     SCATTER, flipping toward us, from the weight of the
     beast. We try to keep up with it, but it's too fast.

     After it passes, the Mayor sticks his head out of the
     doorway to see the demolished street scene.

                            MAYOR
               What was that?


 34  INT. WNEW - CAIMAN'S OFFICE - SAME - DAY                    34

     Caiman's on the phone as his SECRETARY enters with some
     files. Rain and thunder continue outside.

                            CAIMAN
                      (into phone)
               I don't give a crap about some war in
               a country I can't pronounce. That's
               not a lead story. Find me a damned
               story, will ya!

     Just then his Secretary notices a desk lamp, the shade
     SHAKING and the light FLICKERING. She hears the THUMPING
     approaching. She turns and SEES...


     GIGANTIC TEETH

     The enormous head of GODZILLA growls as it passes by
     Caiman's office window.

                            SECRETARY
               Mr. Caiman. I think your story just
               walked by the window.

     Caiman turns but there's nothing there. He's confused,
     she's dazed.

                            CAIMAN
               What?

     Just then the TAIL WHIRLS past with a THUNDERS whip.


 35  INT. DINER - SAME - DAY                                     35

     Animal, Lucy and Audrey are at the cashier paying.

                            LUCY
               Did Romeo have a name?

                            AUDREY
               Nick Tatopoulos.

                            ANIMAL
               That why you dumped him?

                            AUDREY
               No! I just couldn't see myself with
               some boring egg head who spends his
               summer picking apart cockroaches. I
               wanted to have some adventure, some
               fun...

                            LUCY
               And now you live the glamorous life of
               Caiman's assistant. Life's a bitch,
               ain't it?

     In the distance we can HEAR the THUMPING approaching.

                            ANIMAL
               How long where you and dis guy goin'
               steady?

                            AUDREY
               Nearly four years...

                            LUCY
               Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he
               didn't ask you to marry him.

                            AUDREY
               That's the problem. He did.

     Suddenly the THUMPING gets LOUDER very quickly. Everyone
     in the diner reacts.

                            LUCY
               Tell me that's not another goddamned
               parade.

     The next THUMP RATTLES the entire diner. Things begin to
     fall. Through the window we see people RUNNING in
     PANIC.

                            ANIMAL
               That's ain't no parade...

     Before anyone can speak the entire building is SHAKING.
     Through the front window we SEE...


     GODZILLA'S FOOT

     Smashing down directly outside the window. Cars are
     SMASHED. One car SAILS directly INTO THE WINDOW,
     shattering it.

     Animal uses his size to COVER the girls from the falling
     debris. As the danger passes, Animal charges for the
     door.

                            LUCY
               Victor, wait!


 36  EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS - RAIN - DAY                       36

     Animal comes rushing out. Water sprays from displaced
     fire hydrants, debris still falls, cars burn. Animal
     goes over to his NEWS VAN that has been partially
     crushed.

     He pries open the rear door and takes out his video
     camera and takes off running. Audrey and Lucy arrive too
     late to stop him.

                            LUCY
               Victor, don't!


     ANIMAL RUNNING

     Turning the corner Animal runs full speed through the
     debris, trying to jam a video cassette into his camera.
     It won't fit. He SEES up ahead...


     P.O.V. THE TAIL

     Just as it disappears around the corner a few blocks
     ahead. Thinking quickly, Animal bolts down a small
     alleyway.


 37  EXT. OTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS                              37

     His camera damaged, Animal struggles to get the tape
     inside as he exits the other side of the alley. He darts
     out into the street to get his shot.

     The THUMPING is OVERPOWERINGLY LOUD. He looks up to see,
     CARS FLIPPING, PEOPLE SCATTERING.

     Then, for the first time, we can clearly see the entire
     massive creature that is...


     GODZILLA

     as he comes barreling towards us. The titanic lizard is
     ferocious and agile. Swiftly he moves closer.

     Animal's hands fumble with the tape. He JAMS it in,
     sweating. He fingers the POWER BUTTON, the red light
     goes on. Quickly he shoulders the camera.


     P.O.V. THROUGH CAMERA - GODZILLA

     Nearly on top of him, Godzilla's own image is suddenly
     covered by his own immense foot as it's lifted and about
     to come down directly on us.

                            ANIMAL
               Oh shit!

     Before he can do anything about it...


     GODZILLA'S FOOT

     Towering above him. He has no time to flinch as the
     gargantuan foot SMASHES DOWN.

     In terrifying amazement, Animal remains standing IN
     BETWEEN THE BEAST'S TOES. Abruptly the foot LIFTS
     again. Animal is unscathed and frozen with fear.


     ANGLE - ANIMAL

     Close on Animal as the endless TAIL of the creature
     DRAGS just past him. It seems to go on forever. Finally
     it disappears.


     WIDE ANGLE - TABLEAU OF A DEMOLISHED STREET

     Deserted and demolished. Cars burn, debris falls.
     Animal, the lone figure, just stands there, his chest
     heaving, hyper ventilating.

                                             CUT TO:


 38  EXT. NEW JERSEY STREETS - LOW ANGLE - AFTERNOON             38

     A military CONVOY with Police escort RACES past us.


     ABOVE - HELICOPTER SHOT - CONVOY

     Sirens BLARING, the convoy and escort speed onward.


 39  INT. MILITARY SEDAN - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SAME             39

     Just as they arrive at a military roadblock. Crowds have
     gathered as the military try to keep them at bay.


 40  EXT. NEW JERSEY SHORE - CLIFF SIDE - DAY                    40

     The guards let the convoy pass. The military is putting
     up a number of large tents. A SERGEANT moves over
     quickly to greet the team as they exit their vehicles.

                            SERGEANT
                      (quick salute)
               Sergeant O'Neal, Sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Any word from the Mayor's office?

     Just then dozens of NEWS VANS pull up. Reporters and
     camera crews come rushing toward them. The guards rush
     to intercept. Stepping out of the next car in the
     convoy, Nick and Elise join Major Hicks.

                            SERGEANT
               They've agreed to evacuate the city.
               They've called out the National Guard
               and riot police are on alert.

     As they walk towards the tents the crowd crushes close.
     Nick and Elsie are overwhelmed.

                            ELSIE
                      (aside to Nick)
               Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three
               million people. Has that ever been
               done before?

                            NICK
               I don't think so.

     Several military guards have to clear a path for them as
     they enter the tents.


 41  INT. COMMAND TENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY                        41

     Still in construction. The team enters.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Status report?

                            SERGEANT
               We've lost sight of it, Sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You want to run that by me again?

                            SERGEANT
                      (nervous)
               After the initial attack he
               just...disappeared.

                            OFFICER
                      (interrupting)
               Major, Secretary of Defense Burk on
               the line.

     This takes Major Hicks off guard. The last person he
     wants to talk to. Nick walks over to the Sergeant.

                            NICK
               I don't understand. How can something
               that large just disappear?

                            SERGEANT
               We're not sure. We're scanning the
               area now.

                            ELSIE
               He probably returned to the river.
               Just like everywhere else we've been,
               we're always one step behind.

     Nick turns and notices the back of the tent is open
     revealing a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline.
     Several soldiers enter, setting up telescopes.

                            NICK
               I don't think so.

     Over Manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from
     the destruction. Military helicopters scan the city.
     Staring out at the skyline, Nick is mesmerized.

                            NICK
               I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An
               island, water on all sides. But like
               no other island in the world, this is
               a place where he can easily hide.
                      (beat)
               He's in there someplace.

     A SOLDIER comes rushing in.

                            SOLDIER
               Channel eight caught it on film!

     He rushes over to a bank of monitors, turns one on. On
     the screen we SEE the shaky video Animal took of the
     creature just as it was about to step on him.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...WNEW's exclusive images of the
               creature were taken less than a half
               hour ago.

     Nick and Elsie's jaws nearly hit the floor at the sight
     of the immense creature.

                            CAIMAN
               Cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti
               barely survived this vicious attack to
               provide us with this footage.

     The sounds of applause lead us to...


 42  INT. WNEW BUILDING - SAME - DAY                             42

     Everyone is applauding as Animal, carrying crates of
     equipment, passes the t.v. playing the same news story.
     Embarrassed, Animal smiles awkwardly.

                            CO-WORKERS
               Way to go Animal! That's my man!

     Animal passes Audrey and Lucy who are packing up some
     files.

                            AUDREY
               Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you
               scared?

                            ANIMAL
               Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna
               kill me.

                            LUCY
               Damned right, you crazy Wop!

     We SEE the room is in disarray from packing up cartons
     of boxes and equipment. The workers have taken a break
     from the packing as they watch the t.v. broadcast. The
     station manager, MURRAY enters anxiously.

                            MURRAY
               People! We have to be completely
               relocated to the New Jersey station
               before our 5:30 broadcast.
                      (reading from list)
               Okay, Caiman, Devoe and Animal, you're
               on the helicopter. Everyone else we'll
               see you in Jersey.

                            ANIMAL
               Gotta go, honey. You guys gonna be all
               right?

                            LUCY
               Audrey's going to stay with us
               tonight.

                            ANIMAL
               Great. See ya then.

     Animal hurries out after him. Audrey and Lucy go back to
     packing. Audrey looks up at the t.v. just as they replay
     the footage of Nick and Elsie being led into the command
     tent.

                            FIELD REPORTER
                      (filtered)
               ...military and government health
               officials set up a command post on the
               New Jersey coast this afternoon...

     Surprised at first, Audrey suddenly becomes very
     excited. She SEES Caiman exiting the studio at the end
     of the hall. She rushes over to him.

                            AUDREY
               Caiman, wait. Take me with you.

                            CAIMAN
               What?

                            AUDREY
               I've got something on this. I know a
               guy on the inside with the
               military...

                            CAIMAN
               Not now. You got my bag?

     Audrey holds up his bag as they walk towards the
     elevator.

                            AUDREY
               You don't understand, I can get us
               information...

                            CAIMAN
               Listen, this is the time when the big
               boys have to go to work, okay Honey?

     With that, Caiman walks into the elevator. Pissed,
     Audrey just stares at him.

                            CAIMAN
               The bag?

     Audrey THROWS the bag at him, knocking him backwards as
     the elevator doors close. Lucy walks over.

                            LUCY
               Come on, Girl, we've gotta go!


 43  EXT. WNEW OFFICE BUILDING - MINUTES LATER - DAY             43

     Lucy and Audrey carry their bags outside into the chaos
     that has taken over the city. Hundreds of people trying
     to leave at once. Gridlock.

     As they move into an overcrowded subway entrance,
     Audrey looks up just in time to SEE the WNEW NEWS
     HELICOPTER lifting off from the building behind them.

                                             CUT TO:


 44  EXT. MANHATTAN - HELICOPTER SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON           44

     We SEE the destroyed parts of downtown Manhattan. Police
     barricade the streets as firemen work to contain the
     fires.

                            CAIMAN (O.S.)
               ...in what city officials are calling
               the worst act of destruction since the
               World Trade Tower bombing...


 45  INT. WNEW NEW HELICOPTER - SAME - LATER AFTERNOON           45

     Caiman stares earnestly at his video camera.

                            CAIMAN
               ...Police and the National Guard have
               quarantined off over twenty square
               city blocks...


 46  EXT. OVERHEAD HELICOPTER SHOT OF MANHATTAN - SAME           46

     Below we see the largest traffic jam in the history of
     the city. Police and National Guardsmen guide the
     traffic.

                            CAIMAN
               ...hundreds of thousands have jammed
               the streets in the largest evacuation
               in the history of the city. And many
               people are not happy about it.


 47  EXT. MAN ON THE STREET INTERVIEW - VIDEO FOOTAGE            47

     Quick cuts of people who where interviewed earlier.

                            WOMAN
               I don't understand why we have to
               leave our homes. It's over already,
               isn't it?

                            MAN
               What are we running from? A big
               lizard? I've got cockroaches in my
               building that could kick the crap out
               of it.


 48  EXT. TIMES SQUARE - GRIDLOCK - LATE AFTERNOON               48

     Near chaos as police and National guardsmen attempt to
     bring order to the hundreds of honking, screaming
     motorists.


     RIOT POLICE VAN

     Dozens of armed officers pile out of the van.


     NATIONAL GUARDSMEN

     Maintaining blockades in front of their military
     vehicles.


 49  EXT. SEVENTH AVE E - ROADBLOCK - LATER AFTERNOON            49

     The evacuation effort is made more difficult as traffic
     must be diverted away from the quarantined destruction
     area ahead. Police block the street, smoldering
     buildings behind them. The detour only makes things
     worse.


 50  EXT. CITY BANK BUILDING - WALL STREET - SAME                50

     Several National Guardsmen walk up to the City Bank
     building where they find an ENORMOUS HOLE smashed into
     the side of the building. The Guardsmen peek inside.


     GUARDSMEN'S P.O.V. - INTO BUILDING

     We SEE THROUGH the building to a hold on the other side.
     Godzilla apparently walked RIGHT THROUGH. The Guardsmen
     are visibly shaken.


 51  INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME                                  51

     Way beyond capacity, the flooded subway platform bursts
     with people pushing and shoving to get into the trains.
     Caught in the craziness we find Audrey and Lucy trying
     desperately to get on board.

                            P.A.
               Please don't push. People are getting
               shoved down onto the tracks and the
               trains can't leave...

     The last to fit inside, Lucy and Audrey cram in just as
     the doors shut behind them. People left behind BANG on
     the closed doors as the subway pulls out.


 52  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - SAME      52

     A gigantic traffic back up all the way down the Westside
     Highway. The bridge is a veritable parking lot.

                            MAYOR (O.S.)
               Well this is great!


 53  INT. MAYOR'S HELICOPTER - LATER AFTERNOON                   53

     With his close aides in tow, the Mayor stares at the
     melee below.

                            MAYOR
               If we're wrong on this evacuation
               they'll string me up from the Liberty
               torch.


 54  EXT. COMMAND CENTER - JERSEY CLIFF SIDE - LATE              54
     AFTERNOON

     The Mayor's helicopter sails over the George Washington
     Bridge and over to a small landing pad near the Command
     Center. A large group of people dressed in business
     suits await the helicopter.


 55  INT. MAYOR'S HELICOPTER - LATE AFTERNOON                    55

     Just as the helicopter is landing, the crowd moves
     toward the chopper.

                            MAYOR
               Who the hell are they?

                            AIDE
               It's a contingent of building owners
               and community business
               representatives.

                            MAYOR
               I don't have time for this nonsense.

                            AIDE
               Most of them are campaign
               contributors.

     Well that's a different story.


 56  EXT. LANDING PAD - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON              56

     As the Mayor steps out he's greeted by a nervous crowd
     of people shouting, "How long do we have to shut our
     business down? Will the city cover the damages? Etc."
     Among them, DONALD TRUMP tries to get the Mayor's
     attention.

                            MAYOR
               I share your concerns. I want to get
               the city back in business as soon as
               possible.

     As he pushes through the dense crowd he runs directly
     into...


     RAYMOND

     Who waits for the Mayor. The Mayor is momentarily
     stopped.

                            RAYMOND
                      (handing his card)
               CHARGURES Insurance. We represent
               nearly thirteen percent of the
               buildings in your city.

                            MAYOR
               If you'll excuse me...

                            RAYMOND
               We are very happy that you are in
               control of this situation.

     With that he gently pats the Mayor on the back, leaving
     a small, nearly undetectable DEVICE on the Mayor's
     collar.

                            RAYMOND
               You can count on our emotional and
               financial support.

                            MAYOR
               Oh, well, thank you very much.

     Briskly he shakes his hand as he pushes his way through
     the crowd. Raymond watches him pass, seeing the device
     stuck to the Mayor's collar.


     ANGLE - WNEW NEWS CHOPPER

     Rushing over from the parked news chopper, Animal and
     Caiman race for the Mayor who walks through a mob of
     reporters.

                            CAIMAN
               Hurry, we're going to miss the Mayor.

     But before he can get close, two POLICE OFFICERS stop
     them.

                            POLICE OFFICER
               Sorry, you gotta have a press ID past
               this point.

                            CAIMAN
               Don't you watch t.v.?

                            POLICE OFFICER
               Can we see your press pass, sir?

     Flustered, Caiman searches his pockets for his press
     pass.

                            CAIMAN
               I had one here on my bag. Where the
               hell did I put it?


     CAIMAN'S PRESS PASS - ECU

     We SEE Caiman's plastic smile on his press ID. Suddenly
     AUDREY'S picture is placed on top of Caiman's.

                                             WIDEN TO
                                             REVEAL:


 57  INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME - LATER AFTERNOON                57

     Smashed together like sardines, Audrey plays with
     Caiman's press pass, trying to put her photo over his.

                            LUCY
               What the hell are you doing?

                            AUDREY
               Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?

                            LUCY
               Your old sweetheart?

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, well he just turned up in New
               Jersey at the military command post.
               Somehow all this is related to what
               happened down in Panama. There's a
               story here. I know it. You got any
               tape or glue?

                            LUCY
               I left my forgery kit back at the
               office.

     Audrey looks over at a young ten year old boy holding
     his backpack, a RULER sticking out of the back.

                            AUDREY
               Hey, do you have any glue in your
               bag?

                            KID
               What's it to you?

                            AUDREY
               Can I use some?

                            KID
               What do I get?

                            AUDREY
               The warm feeling of helping your
               fellow man.

                            KID
               Five bucks.

                            AUDREY
               You're kidding, right?

     The Kid simply puts his hand out.


 58  EXT. NEW JERSEY TRAIN STATION - LATER                       58

     People FLOOD off the train out into the station.

                            P.A. ANNOUNCER
               Please exit the station. For those of
               you without accommodations, the city
               has opened up shelters on Monroe and
               60th and at Bergenline and 72nd.
               Please exit the...

     Audrey and Lucy walk through the crowd. Audrey turns and
     gives Lucy a kiss.

                            AUDREY
               Wish me luck!

                            LUCY
               Audrey, I don't think this is a very
               good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll
               have your job.

                            AUDREY
               I'm tired of waiting for someone else
               to give me an opportunity, Luce. If
               there's a story here I'm going to find
               it.

     Lucy nods in acceptance as Audrey disappears into the
     dense crowd. Lucy worries for her friend.

                                             CUT TO:


     "YUM YUM DOUGHNUTS" BAG - PRE-SUNSET

     Carried along with a Styrofoam cup of coffee. We WIDEN
     TO REVEAL a MAN carrying the junk food to a GREY VAN
     parked not too far from the Command Center Tent across
     the way.

     The man knocks on the back of the van. The van opens to
     reveal...


 59  INT. RAYMOND'S VAN - PRE-SUNSET                             59

     Filled with high tech monitoring equipment, Raymond and
     his men are listening in to a conversation. The man with
     junk food hands it to Raymond.

                            RAYMOND
               Merci.

     He opens the bag and takes out a croissant. He bites
     into it and grimaces. To wash away the taste, he drinks
     from the coffee. It's worse than the croissant.

                            RAYMOND
               You call this coffee?

                            MAN
                      (French accent)
               I call this America.

     The man takes a seat near Raymond as Raymond turns up
     the volume on his headset.

                            MAYOR (O.S.)
                      (mid argument)
               You're telling me that in an election
               month I've evacuated the entire city
               for nothing?


 60  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM (TENT) - PRE-SUNSET            60

     From behind the Mayor's head we SEE the monitoring
     device attracted to his collar. As he speaks we WIDEN TO
     REVEAL...

                            MAYOR
               Do you realize what this evacuation
               will cost the people of this city!?

     Representatives of all branches of the military,
     National Guard and the Mayor's office are here. The room
     overflows with people. Nick, Elsie and the scientist
     stand near the back of the tent.

                            ADMIRAL PHELPS
               We're been monitoring the waters
               around the island. As far as we can
               tell it hasn't left the area.

                            MAYOR
               But you don't know for sure.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We think there's a strong reason to
               believe it may be hiding inside one of
               the buildings within the sequestered
               area.

                            MAYOR
               But you don't know for sure!

     Just then Sergeant O'Neal enters hurriedly. He wants to
     speak but waits for the opportunity.

                            MAJOR
                      (controlling his temper)
               Mr. Mayor, if he's not in one of those
               buildings then we give the all clear.
               But not until we've checked each
               building!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Sir, that may be more difficult than
               we originally projected.

                            MAJOR
               More good news?!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               We've run into a problem.

                                             CUT TO:


     A SIGN READING: SUBWAY STATION: 23RD STREET - SUNSET

     We CRANE DOWN to reveal several military sedans pulling
     up into FLAT IRON SQUARE (where Broadway meets 5th).
     Sergeant O'Neal leads the team out of the cars and down
     a subway entrance.


 61  INT. SUBWAY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS - SUNSET                 61

     Marching down the stairs, the team enters into the very
     large subway station. For all we see it seems like a
     normal subway station except for the fact that every one
     of the team members look ASTONISHED.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Lt. Anderson and his men found this
               late this afternoon.

     The camera makes a hundred and eighty degree turn as we
     suddenly SEE what the team is staring at...


     AN ENORMOUS HOLE

     The four normal subway tunnels have been CARVED OUT
     making one GIGANTIC TUNNEL. Debris and crumbled brick
     are everywhere. Several SOLDIERS with flashlights
     approach the hole.

     Lt. Anderson moves over to the astonished group. Some of
     the scientists fan out, examining the area.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               We were checking the office building
               above when we discovered the floor was
               gone.


     LOW ANGLE - REVEALING THE HOLE IN THE CEILING

     We SEE that not only is the ceiling gone but the
     building above is hollowed and torn to shreds. Another
     hole in the building leads to the street.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               When we learned he could burrow his
               way through the tunnels we realized he
               could be out of the quarantined zone.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Christ. How many tunnels lead off the
               island?

                            LT. ANDERSON
               Only five, Sir. We've checked them
               all. He hasn't used any of them.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Have them sealed off.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               And how should we do that, Sir?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Fill them with cement, brick them up,
               put land mines in them, bombs, I don't
               know, just make sure that goddamned
               thing doesn't leave the island!


     ANGLE - INSIDE DARKENED TUNNEL

     As the SOLDIERS slowly move down deeper into the
     tunnels, their flashlight beams scan the area. Could
     they stumble onto something dangerous?


     ANGLE - NICK

     as he approaches Major Hicks and Sergeant O'Neal.

                            NICK
               You know, he's not an enemy trying to
               evade you. He's just an animal.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What are you suggesting?

                            NICK
               When I needed to catch earthworms, I
               knew the best way to catch them was
               not to chase them. I had to draw them
               out.


     ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS

     Still moving deeper into the tunnel we get the feeling
     these soldiers may just waken a sleeping giant.


     BACK TO TEAM

     Nick moves to the edge of the platform, looking off into
     the dark tunnel.

                            NICK
               All we need to do is find out what it
               wants, what it needs, and he'll come
               to us.


     ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS

     The lead Soldier SEES something. Cautiously he moves
     forward thinking he's onto something. We HEAR something
     MOVING in the darkness.

     We FOLLOW his beam as the noise grows clearer. The beam
     falls onto something on the floor...


     A FISH

     Flopping on the ground is a large FISH. As the beam
     moves farther along we see two, no, three fish ahead.

                                             CUT TO:


 62  EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - POST-SUNSET (MAGIC HOUR)        62

     A battalion of armored TANKS roll down this deserted
     city street. A large number of GROUND TROOPS march
     behind.


     COBRA HELICOPTERS - SAME - MAGIC HOUR

     Banking in formation, the helicopters swerve, heading
     towards mid-town Manhattan.


     SAND BAG FORTIFICATION

     Soldiers pile up sand bags, creating a make shift
     fortification. SHARP SHOOTERS and a BAZOOKA BRIGADE
     settle into place.


 63  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                   63

     Major Hicks moves over to a jeep and grabs the radio.


 64  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                       64

     Major Hicks sits by a bank of communications
     technicians.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Where are they now?

                            RADIO TECHNICIAN
               Delta niner, what is convoy position?


 65  EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                    65

     Led by armored military vehicles we SEE a convoy of
     TWENTY YELLOW DUMP TRUCKS passing over the bridge.

                            DRIVER (O.S.)
               Command, we're just entering the
               city.


 66  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME              66

     Sergeant O'Neal listens to the response on the radio.

                            RADIO TECHNICIAN
               Convoy ETA, five minutes.

     The Sergeant signals several military technicians, who
     are mounting several video cameras to hurry.


 67  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                       67

     A buzz of activity. Military Officials and personnel.
     The Mayor enters and joins his aides in the back of the
     room.

                            MAYOR
                      (whispering to Aide)
               They find anything yet?

     The Aide shakes his head. Monitors come to life with a
     live video feed-from several cameras we saw mounted.


     A CABLE REPAIRMAN - MAGIC HOUR

     In blue overalls, the REPAIRMAN walks up to a large
     satellite dish. We WIDEN to REVEAL the dish is parked
     next to the Command Tent. He kneels down next to some
     cables leading away from the dish toward the Command
     Tent.


 68  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAGIC HOUR                              68

     Suddenly all the screens FUZZ OUT. Just as quickly the
     monitors return to normal. No one seems to notice.


 69  EXT. SATELLITE DISH - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                     69

     The Repairman finishes affixing a small DEVICE to the
     cable. He taps his earpiece and speaks into his own
     lapel.

                            REPAIRMAN
                      (French accent)
               It is good.


 70  INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                         70

     We SEE Raymond and his men have turned this dingy Motel
     room into a command central of their own. Raymond is
     putting sugar into his coffee when a bank of monitors
     turn on. They are seeing THE SAME VIDEO FEED as the
     Mayor. Pleased, he takes a sip. It's awful.

                            RAYMOND
               You said this was French Roast!

     His aid turns, holding a package labeled FRENCH ROAST.

                            RAYMOND
                      (defeated)
               More cream.

     His associate hands him some milk. He adds it to the
     coffee. No use, it still sucks. On the monitors we SEE
     the DUMP TRUCKS entering Flat Iron Square.


 71  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                   71

     The DUMP TRUCKS arrive and the soldiers guide the
     trucks, forming a circle, their tails facing each other.
     As the last one passes it REVEALS Nick and Sergeant
     O'Neal.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               I sure hope your plan works.

                            NICK
               I'm kind of hoping the same thing.

     The twenty of them, in concert, begin to dump their
     cargo.


     LOW ANGLE - CENTER OF THE DUMP TRUCK CIRCLE

     Tons and tons of FISH are DUMPED directly on top of us.


 72  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                    72

     On the monitors they watch in astonishment as the fish
     get dumped into a large pile in the center of Flat Iron
     Square.

                            AIDE
               Tres bizarre.

                            RAYMOND
               No.
                      (leaning forward)
               Very clever.


 73  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - FISH PILE - SAME - NIGHT            73

     A MOUNTAIN OF FISH have been piled into the center of
     Flat Iron Square.

                            NICK
               That's a lot of fish.

     A master of the obvious. Sergeant O'Neal shoots him a
     glare and moves over to the men. Together they march
     into a building at the edge of the square.


     SOLDIERS

     Loading up rifles, taking positions. GAS MASKS being
     handed out down a long line for all the soldiers.

     The TANKS move into their final positions. The National
     Guardsmen and Soldiers supporting the Tanks take
     positions.


 74  EXT. TOP OF THE SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                       74

     Entering from the stairs out onto the roof, Sergeant
     O'Neal and his men take positions, observing from
     above.

     Everyone is waiting. The silence is deafening.


     ANGLE - NICK

     As everyone waits, Nick scans the area, thinking.
     Suddenly something catches his eye...


     STEAM VENT

     Through a steam vent in the streets. Nick sees STEAM
     lifting into the air. He notices several other vents
     doing the same thing around the square. Quickly Nick
     rushes over to a YOUNG OFFICER.

                            NICK
               I need your radio.

     The Young Officer leads Nick over to his jeep. Nick
     grabs the receiver.

                            NICK
               Sergeant O'Neal, the subway vents. We
               have to shut them down...


 75  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               75

     O'Neal listens to Nick on his radio.

                            NICK (O.S.)
                      (filtered)
               ...With the air pressure pushing up,
               he'll never smell the bait!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (turning to soldier)
               Get some men down into those air
               vents. Shut 'em down!


 76  INT. SUBTERRANEAN AIR VENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT          76

     With a loud WHINE we HEAR the vents shutting down. The
     large whirling FAN BLADES slow to a stop.


 77  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME                                77

     One by one the steam pillars begin to disappear as the
     vents are turned off. There is a long tense moment of
     waiting. When will it come? Will it come?

     Before the Young Officer can stop him, Nick rushes over
     to a manhole cover in the center of the street. The
     cover is to heavy. He yells back.

                            NICK
               We need to open all the manhole covers
               in the area. Let the scent waft down.

     The Young Officer signals other soldiers. Nick steps
     back and lets the soldiers go to work. As he walks back,
     he spots another manhole cover at the next intersection
     down a side street. He runs over to it.


     ANGLE - SIDE STREET - MANHOLE COVER

     A particularly heavy one in the center of this
     intersection (a block away from Flat Iron Square), Nick,
     alone, wrestles to remove it. With all his might, he
     drags it clear.

     Suddenly, through the hole he HEARS some STRANGE NOISES
     from below. Rattled, he slowly backs away from the hole.
     The NOISES grow increasingly louder.

     Then with a DEAFENING ROAR, the ground behind Nick
     ERUPTS and GODZILLA RISES, ripping up the boulevard as
     he does.

     Nick SPINS only to find himself face to face with the
     gigantic creature. Godzilla's head slopes down,
     apparently looking Nick in the eye.

     All around foot soldiers appear, guns trained, shoulder
     hoisted rocket launchers prepared.

     Out of the corner of his eye, Nick sees all this. He
     gently signals with his hands that they should NOT fire.

     Sensing no danger from Nick, Godzilla simply STEPS OVER
     Nick.


     NICK'S POV - UNDER GODZILLA

     As the gargantuan creature walks over us, making a
     beeline for the fish.

     Nick turns and RUNS, following him.


 78  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                  78

     Godzilla moves into the square. The military hunkers
     down, ready to strike. Cautiously the beast moves over
     to the mountain of fish.


 79  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                    79

     Major Hicks watches the monitors as Godzilla approaches
     the fish.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Commence phase one. Let's gas it!


 80  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               80

     Everyone on the rooftop puts on their GAS MASKS.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Let 'em fly!


     ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - SAME

     All the soldiers PUT ON their GAS MASKS. A team of
     EIGHT, pull out a GAS CANISTERS and yank the releases.
     They DROP them down the long barrels of air cannons,
     preparing to fire.


     SAND BAG FORTIFICATION - SAME

     Nick runs past the fortification, trying to get a closer
     look. The Young Officer yells after him.

                            YOUNG OFFICER
               Where're you going? Nick!

     Nick stops briefly as the Young Officer TOSSES a gas
     mask to Nick who quickly puts it on and dashes for a
     closer spot. Suddenly SAILING OVER HIS HEAD we SEE...


     GAS CANISTERS

     Firing from the air cannons, the GAS CANISTERS streak
     across the sky landing behind Godzilla. The Yellow gas
     forms a wall of smoke that drifts upwards.


     ANOTHER ANGLE - OPPOSITE CORNER

     Across the way eight MORE CANISTERS are FIRED at the
     beast. Quickly Godzilla is surrounded by the gas fumes.


     ANGLE - NICK

     Frustrated at his inability to see through the smoke, he
     DASHES forward over to a large BRONZE STATUE.


     GODZILLA

     The smoke annoying and distracting him, Godzilla spins,
     his tail waving the smoke away. But the smoke returns.
     Godzilla YELLS OUT. Frustrated he rears back and
     BLASTS!

     For the first time we SEE the infamous POWER BREATH of
     Godzilla. With amazing FORCE the smoke, canisters, cars
     and anything that isn't nailed down SAILS BACKWARDS from
     the intense pressure.

     Nick is HIT by the WAVE of air pressure and is sent
     FLYING BACKWARDS, impossibly high in the air.

     An enormous fabric BANNER advertising this season at the
     MET, catches Nick who SLIDES down the banner, hitting
     the ground, HARD. Just as he looks up he SEES...


     A LARGE TRUCK

     Tumbling toward him from the power breath. Nick
     SCRAMBLES to his feet just in time as the rolling Truck
     SMASHES into the building behind where he just sat.


     ANGLE - TROOPS - FORTIFICATION

     The troops have to SCATTER as the tumbling trucks and
     cars are FLUNG AT THEM, disabling their attack forces.
     Trucks and rocket launches are CRUSHED by the tumbling
     debris.

     Godzilla CONTINUES to BLOW at everything around him.
     Cars and trucks ROLLING. Soldiers DIVING for cover. It's
     chaos.

     The glass in all the surrounding buildings SHATTER,
     shards of glass raining down. Windows, street lamps, all
     blown out by the tremendous gale force winds.


 81  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              81

     On the monitors we SEE the melee.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Fire at will!


 82  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               82

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Fire at will. Fire at will.


 83  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                        83

     From all angles, soldiers rush back to their equipment
     and attempt to FIRE. Very few are able to get off
     rounds.


 84  EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME - NIGHT                                 84

     O'Neal tries to steady himself as the soldiers FIRE down
     at the creature below. One HOISTS a MISSILE launcher.


     ANGLE - GODZILLA - NIGHT

     As the FIREPOWER begins around Godzilla, he takes a hit
     in the shoulder and SCREAMS OUT. Suddenly he LEAPS away
     just as several MISSLES HIT the Flat Iron Building
     behind where Godzilla was standing only moments
     earlier.

     Dashing down a side street, Godzilla LEAPS over the
     waiting tanks who cannot adjust their cannons in time.
     WE'VE NEVER SEEM HIM MOVE THIS QUICKLY. Several tanks
     are SQUASHED as the beast bull dozes right through the
     regiment.


 85  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                            85

     We SEE the Flat Iron Building crumbling on one of the
     monitors near Major Hicks. In the rear of the room the
     Mayor looks sick.


 86  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                        86

     Soldiers come out from behind the crashed vehicles and
     debris. Only the smoldering devastation is left behind.


 87  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              87

     The monitors only show static or devastation.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               O'Neal, what the hell is going on
               there!?


 88  EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME                                         88

     Quickly his men are packing up.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               He's gone, Sir. Echo division's in
               pursuit.


 89  EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS (6TH AVE.) - SAME - NIGHT       89

     Four ARMORED MILITARY VEHICLES come SKIDDING around the
     corner in hot pursuit. Each with a team manning enormous
     mounted weaponry.


     REVERSE ANGLE - 6TH AVE. - GODZILLA

     Galloping like a Gisele uptown, Godzilla is SPEEDING up
     the boulevard. The armored vehicles OPEN FIRE. Some
     shots CLIP into Godzilla's back. Ahead he is running
     directly into...


     MOBILE MISSILE LAUNCHERS

     Blocking off the street in front of him. They FIRE.
     Pinned down, the creature SCREAMS and DUCKS away down
     another side street. The missiles can't turn fast enough
     and SLAM into a building, DEMOLISHING it.


 90  EXT. ELECTRONICS STORE - SAME - NIGHT                       90

     The window is SMASHED in. A small group of LOOTERS are
     loading up their mini-van. Finishing up the group is
     about to leave.

                            LOOTER #1
               Jimmy, let's go.

                            LOOTER #2
               Wait. I want this. Help me!

     The group rejoins Jimmy as they try to pull an enormous
     Pin Ball machine from the window. As they carry the
     machine back towards the mini-van...


     SQUASH! - GIGANTIC FOOT

     Godzilla's enormous foot flattens the mini-van like a
     pancake. The Looters go pale. As the Military Armored
     Vehicles RACE by in hot pursuit.


 91  EXT. BROADWAY - SAME - NIGHT                                91

     Godzilla BOUNDS onto Broadway and FREEZES, looking
     around. As he looks downtown he SEES...


     GODZILLA'S P.O.V. - MILITARY ARMORED VEHICLES

     Skidding around the corner a few blocks back, the
     armored vehicles reappear.

     Godzilla turns uptown and BOLTS. As he gets up to full
     speed...


     COBRA HELICOPTERS

     A team of FOUR COBRA HELICOPTERS swoops down heading
     directly for Godzilla.


 92  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - NIGHT                     92

     The Mayor stands over a Radio technician.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT (O.S.)
                      (filtered)
               We have him, locked on.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Then FIRE damn it!


 93  EXT. TIMES SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                            93

     Godzilla runs into the famous lighted square (looking
     remarkably like Tokyo) just as the COBRA'S come SWEEPING
     DOWN out of the sky.

     Godzilla SPOTS them and leaps away just as they FIRE
     missiles, which RIP INTO the famous JUMBO TRON VIDEO
     BILLBOARD, demolishing the building.

     The Cobra's SWERVE quickly, pursuing Godzilla down a
     side street.


 94  EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - SAME - NIGHT                        94

     Godzilla appears, turning the corner and racing down the
     street. From behind, the Cobra helicopters come
     SCREAMING down on him, they FIRE ROCKETS at Godzilla
     who, again, deftly turns a corner.

     The errant rockets BLAST into the CHRYSLER BUILDING, as
     they attempt to follow him but fail. Shards of glass come
     RAINING DOWN as the building crumbles.


     ANGLE - ARMORED VEHICLES

     As they race around the corner they SLAM ON THE BREAKS
     just as the familier CONE of the Chrysler building comes
     CRASHING DOWN just inches in front of the vehicles,
     tumbling into the street.


 95  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                            95

     The static increases over the radio.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT
                      (filtered)
               That is a negative impact.

     The Mayor, in the back of the room stands, furious.

                            MAYOR
               Negative impact!?! It's the goddamned
               Chrysler building, that's what it is!

     His aides try to calm him.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               You said he was locked on!


 96  EXT. SIDE STREET - COBRA HELICOPTER P.O.V. - NIGHT          96

     Moving through the narrow side street.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT (O.S.)
               The heat seekers can't lock. He's
               colder than the buildings around him.


 97  EXT. 5TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                        97

     The four Cobra helicopters ZOOM around the corner and
     into 5th avenue.


     COBRA HELICOPTER P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     Godzilla is ahead of us. The choppers FIRE again, this
     time using their gun turrets, ACCELERATING toward the
     beast.

     Under heavy bullet firepower and the choppers nearly on
     top of him, Godzilla DIVES into an office building.

     The helicopters surround the crumbling building, and
     OPEN FIRE, decimating it. They STOP firing and stare
     into the smoldering mess they've made.

                            PILOT
               I think we got him.

     Just then ERUPTING out of a building behind them...


     GODZILLA

     POUNCES OUT of the building, snapping up two of the
     helicopters in one bite!

     He WHIRLS around and SWIPES another out of the air with
     his ENORMOUS CLAW. The CLAWED helicopter SLAMS into the
     ground just as...


     ARMORED VEHICLES

     come sliding around the corner, directly into the
     CRASHING HELICOPTER which explodes on impact. The entire
     team is taken out with the concussion.


 98  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              98

     Major Hicks is on his feet, steaming mad.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Echo four, where is he!?


 99  EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS - SAME - NIGHT                  99

     As the remaining Cobra helicopter SWERVES around,
     Godzilla is gone.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT #4
               I don't know sir. He just vanished.

     As the helicopter PASSES a dark building we SEE a SHAPE
     MOVE! We realize that like a chameleon, Godzilla had
     TAKEN THE COLOR of the building and hid. With the
     helicopter past him, he CHASES FROM THE REAR.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT #4
                      (realizing)
               Oh Jesus!

     The chopper GUNS IT, full throttle. Godzilla GIVES
     CHASE. Even at its top speed it can't out run the big
     creature.

     The chopper tries to LIFT AWAY but before he can get the
     height, Godzilla SNAPS his gigantic jaws and SWALLOWS
     THE HELICOPTER WHOLE.


     STREET - WIDE ANGLE

     The fires burn and the rubble crumbles. Godzilla gives
     one final SCREAM and DIVES into a building,
     disappearing.


100  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           100

     The Major's aide try to hold him back as the Mayor is
     charging at Major Hicks.

                            MAYOR
               What the hell is the matter with you
               people?! You caused more damage than
               that thing did!


101  EXT. 5TH AVENUE - SAME - NIGHT                             101

     Empty and devastated. Fires continue to burn.


102  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                       102

     Nick, Sergeant O'Neal and several of his men walk
     through the devastated area. Nick kneels down and
     SEES...


     NICK'S P.O.V. - PUDDLE OF BLOOD

     There is a large reddish brown puddle of blood. Nick
     takes out a small glass container and scoops some up.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               I can't believe it. He did all this
               and we did nothing to him.

     Nick walks over to him, consoling.

                            NICK
               That's not true. We fed him.


     REVERSE ANGLE

     Only a few scattered fish remain where the mountain of
     fish once was. Our team stands there amidst the rubble.

     FADE IN:


103  INT. NETWORK NEWS DESK - VIDEO FOOTAGE                     103

     A network news ANCHOR speaks directly at us as a video
     of the Chrysler building getting destroyed plays behind
     him.

                            ANCHOR
               While it may have looked like Beirut,
               it was in fact, Manhattan where man
               and nature have collided with brute
               force.

     The video switches to the White House where we SEE the
     President signing a bill.

                            ANCHOR
               The President today declared a state
               of emergency and has issued disaster
               relief funds to New York City.

                                             REVEAL:


104  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - VIDEO FEEDS - SAME - NIGHT          104

     We SEE that we've been watching the video on one of MANY
     video monitors showing all the news broadcasts. As an
     assistant moves away from the monitors we FOLLOW him out
     of the truck.


105  EXT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - CONTINUOUS - SAME - NIGHT           105

     We continue to FOLLOW the assistant outside, revealing
     the enormous MOB of reporters that have gathered just
     outside the military command tents. As we FOLLOW the
     assistant he passes several reporters doing "stand-up"
     reports.

                            REPORTER #1
               ...rumors continue to mount as to the
               origin of this, perhaps, lost
               dinosaur...

                            REPORTER #2
               ...having shut down the United Nations
               in the evacuation, foreign diplomats
               are demanding an international
               coalition be assembled to track the
               creature...

     The assistant finally arrives at Caiman who is doing a
     live remote. Animal works the camera.

                            CAIMAN
               ...Maintaining a total media blackout,
               officials remain silent this evening
               as to their progress in containing
               this creature...

     Behind him, in the crowd we SEE Audrey pushing her way
     through the reporters, her fake ID pinned on her shirt.
     She turns and sees Caiman. Quickly she ducks down and
     moves deeper into the crowds.

     Suddenly there is movement as the crowd turns their
     collective attention over to a group of cars pulling up
     nearby. Audrey pushes her way to see what's happening.

     The cars are BLOCKED from returning to the command tents
     as the reporters MOB the first car in line.


106  INT. SEDAN - NICK - NIGHT                                  106

     Nick observes the chaos. Through the crowd he SEES a
     Pharmacy, a neon sign reading: Never Closes. He looks
     back down at the blood sample he holds in his lap and
     gets an idea.

                            NICK
                      (to the driver)
               It's okay, I'll get out here.

     He opens the car door and pushes his way through the
     crowds who are less interested in him as they are the
     military officials.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - MEDIA CIRCUS - CROWDS - NIGHT

     Pushing his way through, Nick SEES what a circus this
     has become; t.v. news camera crews, journalists,
     concerned citizens, worried mothers, and of course,
     merchandising...


     STREET STANDS

     Nick passes several vendors selling dinosaur toys,
     copies of Animal's now famous news video clip and, of
     course, tee shirts with still images from that same
     clip.


     ANGLE - AUDREY

     Through the dense crowd, Audrey SEES Nick in the
     distance. Excited she starts to push her way through.


107  INT. PHARMACY - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT                      107

     Ringing the night bell, Nick calls for the PHARMACIST
     who enters, weary eyed.

                            PHARMACIST
               Can I help you, young man?

                            NICK
               Do you have any home pregnancy tests?
               Especially ones that test for
               catastrophic hormones or clomiphene
               citrate.

                            PHARMACIST
               This is all we've got.

     The Pharmacist puts onto the counter six different off
     the shelf home pregnancy tests.

                            NICK
               I'll take them all.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               You must have quite some harem.

     Nick spins to find Audrey standing right behind him.
     Embarrassed, Nick awkwardly pays for the tests.

                            NICK
               Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You
               look, wow, uh, how've you been?

                            AUDREY
               It's good to see you, Nick.

     The Pharmacist puts out Nick's change. He scoops it out
     and we FOLLOW them as they exit together.

                            NICK
               So you made it.

                            AUDREY
               What?

     He points to her fake press ID she's still wearing.

                            NICK
               You're a reporter. That's what you
               always wanted to be, right? I'm happy
               for you. Really, I am.

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, well...


108  EXT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                         108

     Nick opens the door for Audrey and follows her out.

                            AUDREY
               So, you still picking apart
               cockroaches?

                            NICK
               No, I'm into earthworms now. You
               wouldn't be interested. They're real
               "boring" creatures. Very reliable,
               dependable, no surprises...

                            AUDREY
               You're still mad at me, aren't you?

                            NICK
               You just left me without a phone call,
               a letter, nothing. All this time.
               Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.

                            AUDREY
               That was eight years ago. Some people
               change, you know.

                            NICK
               Most people don't.

                            AUDREY
               I'm sorry you feel that way.

     Audrey turns and walks away. Nick regrets his behavior
     and calls after her.

                            NICK
               Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight
               years is a long time. Can I offer you
               a cup of tea?

                            AUDREY
               Sure. I'd like that.

     There's an awkward moment as neither knows what to say.

                            AUDREY
               One, thing, though. Who'd you get
               pregnant?

     Off Nick's awkward reaction...

                                             CUT TO:


109  INT. NICK'S TENT - LATER - NIGHT                           109

     Nick has set up a mini-lab in his private, small, tent.
     The home pregnancy tests have been ripped apart. Nick
     mixes some of the contents together.

                            AUDREY
               I still can't believe it. How does a
               guy go from an anti-nuke activists to
               working for the Nuclear Regulatory
               Commission?

                            NICK
               When you and I use to attend rallies
               in college, we helped to create
               awareness. But from the inside now I
               can actually effect change.
                      (pointedly)
               I never lost my idealism.

                            AUDREY
               And exactly what changes are you
               trying to effect?

                            NICK
               I have this theory that we're
               inadvertently creating new species as
               a direct result of what we've done to
               nature.

                            AUDREY
               And you think this creature is one of
               them?

                            NICK
               Yes. The first of its kind. I found
               this blood sample earlier this
               evening...

                            AUDREY
               Blood sample? How close did you get to
               that thing?

                            NICK
               I got pretty close.

                            AUDREY
               What else do you know about it?

     Nick finishes his concoction, adding the blood sample
     into it He takes the piece of litmus paper from one of
     the home test boxes and dips it in.

                            NICK
               Well, we know he eats fish, he's of
               reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's
               amphibious and...

     Nick points out the litmus paper. It turns RED.

                            NICK
               ...he's pregnant.

                            AUDREY
               Are you sure?

     Nick gets up and starts to gather his materials.

                            NICK
                      (thrilled)
               Well, obviously these tests weren't
               designed for this but fundamentally
               they're looking for the same hormonal
               patterns that would indicate
               pregnancy.

                            AUDREY
               I don't get it. If it's the first of
               its kind, how can it be pregnant?

     Excitedly Nick begins to pace.

                            NICK
               The ultimate expression of evolution,
               it reproduces asexually. Think about
               it, all kinds of creatures have been
               known to travel great distances for
               reproduction. That's why he came to
               New York. Like every species of
               insufficient progenitors, he's
               nesting!

                            AUDREY
               Nesting?

                            NICK
               Yes. Do you realize that a creature
               like this could lay as many as a dozen
               eggs at a time!

     Nick moves to the front exit of the tent.

                            NICK
               Forgive me but I've got to get this
               into the lab, to confirm all this.
               I'll be right back.

     Nick rushes from the tent. Alone, Audrey can't help but
     poke around a bit. She opens one of his CASES. Taped to
     the roof of the case she SEES...


     INSERT PHOTOS - NICK AND AUDREY

     Happy times long ago. They're both young and in love.
     Audrey is surprised Nick still keeps them. She's
     touched.

     Feeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back
     down. As she does she notices a video tape labeled
     FIRST SIGHTING. Unable to resist, she puts it in and
     turns on the t.v. The shot of the Japanese Cook
     appears.

                            COOK
                      (filtered through t.v.)
               ...Gojira...Gojira...

     She hits the fast forward tape and SEES, the enormous
     footprints in Panama. She fast forwards again and sees
     the beached cargo ship in Jamaica.

     Audrey is torn. She makes a decision, pops the tape back
     out, puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the
     tent. Moments later, Nick returns from the front.

                            NICK
               Audrey? Audrey?

     A flash of lighting and thunder accents Nick's
     confusion.

110  INT. EDITING BAY - LATER - DAWN                            110

     On two monitors we SEE Audrey doing a "stand up."

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               ...which is why in this case "all the
               kings horses and all the kings men"
               may not be able to put the big apple
               together again. Audrey Timmons, WNEW.

     We pull back to reveal Audrey, Animal and an editor,
     ED, watching the piece.

                            ED
               That's it. You owe me a breakfast.

                            AUDREY
                      (turning to Animal)
               So, what do you think?

                            ANIMAL
               It's good. It's a real good piece. But
               how'd you get a hold of this
               material?

     Audrey covers her own mixed emotions.

                            AUDREY
               Like you said, "Good guys finish
               last."

     She snatches the tape and she takes off running.
     Concerned and worried, Animal watches her leave.

111  EXT. WNEW TRUCK - COMMAND TENT AREA - RAIN - DAWN          111

     Rushing out of the WNEW truck and into the rain, Audrey
     spots her Station Manager, Murray. In the b.g. we SEE
     Caiman getting make up, about to do a live spot with
     another cameraman.

                            AUDREY
               Murray, I need you to look at this
               tape.

                            MURRAY
               Not now, Audrey, we've about to go
               live with the morning report.

                            AUDREY
               You're going to want to include this.
               I've got exclusive footage of other
               places this thing has attacked.

                            MURRAY
                      (suddenly interested)
               You do? Who's story is this?

                            AUDREY
               Mine!


     ANGLE - CAIMAN

     About to go on, Caiman waves off his make up artist as
     he watches Audrey hand Murray the tape. His field
     producer counts down to going live.


     P.O.V. THROUGH BINOCULARS - NICK - RAIN - MORNING

     Through the lenses we SEE exiting his tent and moving on
     towards the large center command tent. We REVERSE to
     reveal...


112  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - RAIN - MORNING          112

     One of Raymond's men observes with binoculars from the
     window. Tucking his napkin into his lapel, Raymond eats
     breakfast with his men. Another man, JEAN-CLAUDE,
     listens at the monitoring equipment. He turns to
     Raymond.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               Taisez-Vous.

     He turns on the room speaker.

                            MALE VOICE
                      (filtered)
               ...Major Hicks, what makes you believe
               another attempt to gun that creature
               down will work?


113  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - RAIN - SAME - MORNING       113

     Nick is moving to take his seat next to Elise at this
     very crowded conference. The big wigs are here and the
     room is packed. Major Hicks walks to a large map of
     Manhattan.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               General Anderson, the problem was the
               terrain. If we lure him out into a
               more open area such as this portion of
               Central Park...
                      (points to the map)
               We should be able to take him down.

                            MAYOR
               Last time you didn't even scratch it!

                            MAJOR HICKS
               That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I
               mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.

     All eyes turn towards Nick who's still arranging his
     papers. Nervously Nick addresses the crowd.

                            NICK
               Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was
               injured and bled.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You see, all we need to do is get a
               better shot at it with weapons that
               don't rely on heat seeking...

                            NICK
               Um, excuse me, sir, but the
               situation's more complicated than
               that. The blood I recovered revealed
               that the creature is either about to
               lay eggs or already has.

                            GOVERNOR
               Are you trying to tell us there's
               another one of those things out
               there?

                            NICK
               I don't believe so.

                            MAYOR
               Then how can it be pregnant? What is
               this, the "virgin lizard?"

     There's a smattering of laughter in the room.

                            NICK
               No, it reproduces asexually. That's
               why we must find the nest. If we
               don't, dozens will be born, each one
               capable of laying eggs of its own.
               Very quickly we could be looking at an
               enormous population.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               So after we kill the creature we'll
               begin a search for the nest.

                            NICK
               It may be too late by then. These eggs
               will hatch very quickly.

                            CLIVE
               How could you possible know that?

                            NICK
               The fish. The fish we found down in
               the subway. He's not gathering all
               that food for himself. He's preparing
               to feed his young.


114  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - RAIN - SAME - MORNING               114

     Raymond listens intently. He grabs a folder off the desk
     and opens it. We SEE photos and documents of every
     member of the team. He finds the photo of Nick and
     examines it.


115  INT. DINER - RAIN - SAME - MORNING                         115

     Audrey shakes off the rain and moves over to join Ed and
     Animal at a booth.

                            ANIMAL
               They just promo-ed your spot. It's
               coming on right after this.


116  INT. COMMAND TENT - RAIN - SAME - MORNING                  116

     An AIDE comes in and whispers something into the
     Governor's ear, who nods approval.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we must
               act quickly before this problem
               escalates.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               You want to divide our efforts based
               solely on a wild theory?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               He's come through for us before and if
               he feels strongly...

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               Come through for you!? Major, your
               campaign's a disaster. You weren't
               even able to to prevent this thing
               from coming to Manhattan.

                            GOVERNOR
               Excuse me Gentlemen, but I think we
               should see this.

     The Aide moves over to a television and turns it on.
     Just as the t.v. comes to life we SEE the old Japanese
     Cook.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               How the hell did this get out?

     The image of the Cook saying, "Gojira" FREEZES and cuts
     back to reveal Caiman doing his "stand-up."

               dragon who attacked sailors, to our
               own modern day terror. Today in my
               special report, who is this Godzilla,
               where did he come from and why is he
               here?


117  EXT. DINER - SAME - MORNING                                117

     Audrey is furious, on her feet.

               You're special report! I'm the one
               that found that stupid song! That's my
               special report, you bastard!

     Animal tries to calm her down as the story continues.

                            AUDREY
               And it's "Gojira" not Godzilla you
               moron!

     Fiddling with the motel t.v., Raymond's men attempt to

     The military men are furious at the breach of security.
     All eyes turn toward Nick.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON

               Pack your stuff. You're officially off

                            ELSIE
               I'm sorry about all this.

                            NICK
               Me too.

     Nick hoists his bag and moves to leave.

                            NICK
               Make sure they find that nest before
               it's too late.

                            ELSIE
               I'll try.

     Reluctantly Nick nods acceptance and exits out into the
     rain. We SEE the torn photographs of Nick and Audrey
     laying on the floor.

                            ELSIE
               Bye worm guy.

               What do you mean Murray's not there? A
               second ago you told me he was on the
               other line...

     Something catches Audrey's eye.


     AUDREY'S P.O.V. - THROUGH GLASS - NICK

     Lugging his bags out into the rain, Nick moves over to a
     waiting cab.


124  EXT. COMMAND TENT AREA - NICK & CAB - RAIN - DAY           124

     Lifting a heavy case, Nick places it into the cab's
     trunk.

                            CABBY
               Where to?

                            NICK
               Newark airport.

     Audrey moves up behind Nick.

                            AUDREY
               You're leaving? Why?

     Nick ignores her and continues to load the cab.

                            AUDREY
               Is this cause of me? Because of the
               story?

                            NICK
               Well what the hell did you think was
               going to happen?

                            AUDREY
               You never said it was off the record.

                            NICK
               I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're
               supposed to be my friend. I trusted
               you.

                            AUDREY
               I didn't mean for it to turn out like
               this.
                      (confessing)
               Look, I lied to you. I'm not a
               reporter. When we broke up and I came
               out to New York I was so sure I'd make
               it. But I haven't. That's why I needed
               this story so bad. I just couldn't
               tell you I'm a failure.

                            NICK
               So you thought that made it okay to
               steal my tapes?

     The last bag stowed, Nick moves to get into the cab. He
     stops and turns back to her.

                            NICK
               Good luck in your new career. I think
               you really have what it takes.

     He gets in and slams the door. The cab takes off leaving
     a very alone Audrey standing in the rain.

                            AUDREY
                      (sad; to herself)
               I'm sorry.

     Long waiting lines for people trying to leave town.
     People sleeping on the floors. Chaos. One group gathered
     around a television set.


     T.V. NEWS BROADCAST - VIDEO

     We see images from crowed refugee shelters.

               ...every shelter in the tri-state area
               has been overflowing with displaced
               people. Tent cities have begun to
               spring up all over the county...

     As we TRACK away from the t.v. we FIND Nick taking a
     seat at a small bar next to the gate. A WAITER comes
     over.

                            WAITER
               Can I get you something?

     Before Nick can answer...

                            RAYMOND
               Pernot, no ice.

     Taking a seat directly across from Nick, Raymond sits
     down, sizing him up. Nick is confused.

                            NICK
               Do I know you?

                            RAYMOND
               We've met before.

               It's the French Secret Service.

               Oh.

               Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.

                            RAYMOND
               We, have already taken care of them.

     Nick realizes Raymond is serious. The waiter hands
     Raymond his drink. Raymond toasts Nick.

     A makeshift tent city has been set up in the park.
     Animal video tapes an interview with a displaced
     person.

                            DISPLACED PERSON
               No one tells us a Goddamned thing. My
               family is getting soaked out here. We
               have no place else to go. We just want
               to go back to our home.

     Animal begins to PAN his camera around the tent city
     when he SEES a SEDAN in the distance. He focus in on it
     and SEES...


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - SEDAN - NICK AND RAYMOND

     Coming to stop at a light. Animal quickly lowers his
     camera and hands it off to the Reporter he's working
     with.

                            ANIMAL
               I'll be right back.

     Animal rushes over to the news van and takes off after
     them, following.


127  EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - AFTERNOON                 127

     Pulling up in front of a warehouse, Nick and Raymond
     step out of the sedan. Staying hidden from view, Animal
     pulls over. Intrigued, he watches them enter the
     building.


128  INT. WAREHOUSE - RAYMOND'S MEN - AFTERNOON                 128

     Raymond enters with Nick. The room is filled with
     equipment; radios, guns, explosives and armored
     vehicles. We notice that more of Raymond's support team
     are here.

                            NICK
               How did you get all of this stuff into
               the country?

                            RAYMOND
               This is America. There is nothing you
               can not buy.

     Raymond gives Nick a tour.

                            NICK
               So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you
               guys working with the US military?

                            RAYMOND
               I am not permitted to speak of such
               things.

     Nick stops and confronts Raymond.

                            NICK
               You said you wanted my trust, then I
               need yours.

     Raymond considers this. Finally...

                            RAYMOND
               I am a patriot. I love my country. Can
               you understand that?

                            NICK
               Sure.

                            RAYMOND
               It is my job to protect my country.
               Sometimes I must even protect it from
               itself. From mistakes we have made.
               Mistakes that we do not want the world
               to know about.

                            NICK
               Your talking about the nuclear testing
               in the Pacific.

                            RAYMOND
               Yes. This testing done by my country
               left a terrible mess. We are here to
               clean it up.


129  EXT. WAREHOUSE - ANIMAL - SAME - RAIN - AFTERNOON          129

     Moving down alongside the building, Animal walks down
     the side alley. He climbs up onto a garbage hamper and
     peers into a cracked opened window.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - WAREHOUSE

     Animal sees Nick and Raymond with all the hardware.
     Several of the men are repainting the vehicles to
     resemble those of the US Army.


130  INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME                                      130

     Nick walks past the myriad of warfare tools. Jean-Claude
     turns from the radios.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               They will set the trap at thirty
               minutes to ten.

                            RAYMOND
               That is when we will go in.

     Raymond leads Nick over to a large map.

                            RAYMOND
               We know how to get into the city. We
               just do not know where to start
               looking.

     Nick moves closer to the map, putting his finger on the
     Flat Iron square subway station.

                            NICK
               Here. 23rd street subway station.
               Where we first found the fish. With a
               little luck, this will lead us right

               So you're in?

                            NICK

     Audrey has been crying. Crumpled Kleenex wads piled up
     all around her. A television plays a news broadcast,
     boasting the headline: THEY CALL HIM GODZILLA! On the
     t.v. we SEE a news conference with General Anderson
     addressing some reporters.

                      (simultaneously)
               Can you comment on the nest? How many
               more of these things will there be?

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
                      (filtered)
               That's why I'm holding this
               conference. To try and avoid a
               needless panic.

     Animal enters and watches from the back of the room.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               Contrary to some frivolous reports, we
               have no information to lead us to
               believe that there are any eggs of the
               creature in the city.

                            AUDREY
               Stupid idiots!

                            ANIMAL
               You okay?

                            AUDREY
               It's all my fault. What have I done,
               Animal? What have I become? Look at
               me. This isn't me. I don't do things
               like this.

                            ANIMAL
               You made a mistake.

     Suddenly someone exits the bathroom and crosses out of
     the room. Animal looks at the stranger as he leaves.

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, I just screwed up with the only
               man who ever really cared about me.

                            ANIMAL
               Didn't you tell me he left for the
               airport?

                            AUDREY
               Yeah. Why are you asking?

                            ANIMAL
               I just saw him. He's with a bunch of
               guys who want to sneak into the city
               tonight.

     Audrey tries to make sense of this. Suddenly she
     realizes.

                            AUDREY
               My God. He's going after the nest.

                            ANIMAL
               Perfect! You wanted a story, well,
               baby, you got one.

     Excitedly Animal goes to the closet and retrieves a big
     overcoat.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, I can't.

                            ANIMAL
               Look, you want to make it up to your
               friend? Well if he's right, this is
               your chance.

     He starts going through his drawers, taking out battery
     packs, tapes, etc, and putting it in his pockets.

                            AUDREY
                      (misgivings)
               I don't know. I've already made such a
               mess of things...

     Animal walks up to the door, ready to exit.

                            ANIMAL
                      (smiling)
               Audrey, I'm going after them. You can
               come with me or not.

     Conflicted, Audrey is not sure what to do. Animal opens
     the bedroom window and begins to climb out.

                            AUDREY
               What are you doing?

                            ANIMAL
               Lucy'd kill me if she knew.

                                             CUT TO:


134  INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - SUNSET                            134

     Nick marches out of a changing room dressed in a
     military uniform. As he moves into the room we SEE all
     of Raymond's men dressed similarly.

     As they climb into their vehicles, Raymond hands each a
     stick of chewing gum. Nick gets in the passenger seat of
     one of the vehicles, Raymond climbs in behind the
     wheel.

                            NICK
               What's with the chewing gum?

                            RAYMOND
               Makes us look more American.

     Nick looks over at the faux Americans. It's a tough
     sell, gum or not.

                            NICK
               Just let me do all the talking.

     With that the vehicles pull out of the warehouse and out
     into the rainy night.


135  EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - ENTRANCE - RAIN - SUNSET             135

     An armed blockage seals the Jersey entrance to the
     Lincoln tunnel. We widen to reveal Audrey and Animal by
     a small side entrance. Animal works the lock.

                            AUDREY
               What are you doing?

                            ANIMAL
               It's the maintenance entrance. Runs
               along the side of the tunnel. When
               they repaired it last year I worked on
               a piece about it.

     Just then the lock TURNS and the door opens. They
     enter.


136  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - JERSEY SIDE - SUNSET       136

     A line of military vehicles approaches and slowly passes
     through a guarded entrance, each vehicle checked. Nick
     and Raymond's Humvee nears.


     ANGLE - GUARDED BLOCKADE - CONTINUOUS

     Raymond's Humvee rolls up and a GUARD walks up to the
     window.

                            GUARD
                      (checking clipboard)
               Who you boys with?

                            NICK
               Oh, we're with the three two.

                            GUARD
               I didn't ask you, soldier.

                            NICK
               Sergeant O'Neal just called down for
               us to join in.

     Now he's suspicious. The guard approaches Raymond, checks
     him out.

                            GUARD
               You got a problem talkin'?

                            RAYMOND
                      (perfect southern accent)
               Why no sir, I'm fine.

     The Guard is suspicious but on a tight schedule. Finally
     he waves him through.

                            GUARD
               All right, keep it moving.

                            RAYMOND
                      (ala Presley)
               Thank you very much.

     They drive off. Nick is stunned by the act.

                            RAYMOND
               Elvis Presley movies.
                      (by way of explanation)
               He was the King!


137  INT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - MAINTENANCE DOOR - SAME - NIGHT      137

     The door creeps open. Animal leans out to find the
     tunnel deserted. He and Audrey step out and into the
     tunnel. We FOLLOW them as they are headed for the exit
     of the tunnel into Manhattan.


138  INT. RAYMOND'S HUMVEE - NIGHT                              138

     Raymond and Nick drive through Central Park. We can SEE
     dozens of military people and vehicles in a large
     meadow.


139  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LARGE MEADOW - NIGHT                   139

     The enormous pile of fish is getting dumped in the
     center of the field as many others are planting land
     mines. Tanks, rockets and soldiers align the area.

     The convoy of vehicles turn onto the meadow but Raymond
     and his men keep going straight. They drive slowly right
     past the trap sight and out of the park.


     TIRES SQUEALING TO A STOP

     Doors slam and immediately boots march past. We WIDEN to
     reveal Raymond's team quickly gathering their gear and
     heading down the subway entrance.

     Raymond grabs a heavy bag and tosses it to Nick who
     nearly topples from the weight.

                            RAYMOND
               Be careful with that.

     Nick looks into the bag and sees a bag marked
     EXPLOSIVES. Shocked he looks back at Raymond, but he's
     gone. Nick regains his breath and follows.


     THE FISH

     Older and nastier, but the same fish we saw in the
     tunnel before. We FOLLOW the beam to its owner and find
     Nick. We WIDEN to reveal that we're....


140  INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT                 140

     The crisscrossing beams from the assault team's
     flashlights nearly blind us as Nick leads the team
     cautiously into the depth of this tunnel. Periodic fish
     are found along the way. Suddenly the faint HUMMING
     sound in the tunnel STOPS.

     Everyone freezes as the wind shifts direction. A
     familiar SMELL passes over them as they sniff the air.

                            NICK
               They've turned off the ventilation
               system. They're calling him to
               dinner.

                            RAYMOND
               Let's hope we are not the hors
               d'oeuvres.

     Nervously they continue onward.


141  EXT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             141

     Animal and Audrey arrive, spotting the assault team's
     vehicles. They head carefully down the stairs.


142  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             142

     Audrey and Animal, camera in hand shooting everything,
     climb down into the station. Animal rushes to the end of
     the platform and searches down into the tunnels.


     VIDEO P.O.V. - DARK TUNNEL - DISTANT LIGHTS

     Through the camera we SEE the lights in the distance of
     the tunnel.

                            ANIMAL
                      (whispering)
               They're down there. Let's go.

     Animal jumps off the platform, down onto what's left of
     the tracks. Audrey squeamishly follows.


143  INT. TUNNELS - NICK & TEAM - SAME - NIGHT                  143

     Nick kneels down to inspect some debris. An old
     SCREECHING SOUND is heard in the distance. Suddenly the
     ground begins to quake. Dust falling. The SCREECHING
     gets louder and louder.

     Raymond moves up to Nick and points ahead. Nick nods in
     nervous agreement. Just as they move towards the sounds
     the ENTIRE WALL OF THE TUNNEL COLLAPSES next to them.

     Bursting through the tunnel wall GODZILLA appears. His
     enormous claws burrowing, he makes his way through and
     into the tunnel. Quickly he moves past the team.

     The team DIVES into a cross tunnel just as the colossal
     beast BLASTS past them, barely missing them.


144  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - TUNNEL ENTRANCE          144

     Audrey and Animal have just gotten into the tunnel
     entrance. The entire place is shaking. Audrey is in a
     panic.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, let's get out of here.

     But Animal hoists his camera and starts filming as
     SOMETHING is moving TOWARDS them. Audrey is tugging at
     him as the shaking gets more violent. With all her
     strength, she finally gets Animal to start moving
     backwards.

     Just as they're out of the tunnel, the CREATURE BLASTS
     outward. Audrey and Animal DIVE into the maintenance
     ducks along side the tracks to avoid collision.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL

     Animal is shielding Audrey with his body. She looks up
     just in time to SEE Godzilla CRAWLING UP and out through
     the ceiling. An amazing site.

                            AUDREY
               Shoot! Shoot it!

     Animal grabs his camera and gets the last moment of it
     disappearing from view. Once gone, they both break into
     enormous sighs of relief and nervous laughter.


145  INT. TUNNEL - SAME                                         145

     Recovering, Raymond and the team walk back into the main
     tunnel. They near the hole Godzilla just created,
     examining it. Nick climbs into the hole.

                            NICK
               I guess we go this way.

     Raymond and his men follow.


146  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                146

     Major Hicks is at the radio as the Generals sit behind
     him.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Sergeant, status?


147  INT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           147

     The park is bathed in light. Armed troops surround the
     area. Tanks and missile launchers are in place. Sergeant
     O'Neal kneels down by a sandbag fortification.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Any sign of it?


148  EXT. ROOFTOP - SPOTTERS - SAME - NIGHT                     148

     From the rooftop of one of the central park south high
     rises, a team of SPOTTERS scan the area.


     SPOTTER P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - GODZILLA

     Moving steadily towards central park, Godzilla makes his
     way up seventh avenue.

                            SPOTTER
               Got him. Section 5, heading north to
               target.


149  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME                 149

     The Sergeant gives the nod and several teams of shooters
     take off running, taking positions. The tanks turn their
     gun turrets towards downtown, expectantly. Missile
     launchers turn, arming devices locked.


150  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                150

     Major Hicks stands near a computerized schematic of
     Manhattan. A large RED FLASHING BLIP nears Central
     Park.


151  EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - GODZILLA - SAME                      151

     Godzilla moves up 7th Ave. He reaches Central Park South
     and STOPS. He glances over to the park where bright
     lights are glaring.

     Something is making Godzilla more cautious this time.
     Unsure he vacillates between moving forward and staying
     within the shelter of the tall buildings.


     ANGLE - O'NEAL - CENTRAL PARK

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Don't fire until he's cleared the
               buildings and has moved into the
               park.


     ANGLE - GODZILLA

     Still unsure, he ROARS out, frustrated with his own
     indecision.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Come on, come on!


152  INT. TUNNELS - SAME - NIGHT                                152

     Nick leads the team through the cross town tunnel
     created by Godzilla. Climbing over the debris, they make
     their way to another opening. We FOLLOW them as they
     clamber through the hole and into...


153  INT. PENN STATION - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                     153

     The largest subway/rail station in New York. Godzilla
     has torn it to shreds. We get the feeling this is where
     Godzilla has spent most of his time. Scattered fish
     abound.

     High above, there is a immense black hole in the tall
     ceiling. Wherever it leads to is very dark. Nick and
     Raymond stare at the hole together.

                            RAYMOND
               What is up there?


154  EXT. 34TH STREET - MOMENTS LATER - SUBWAY ENTRANCE -       154
     NIGHT

     Climbing the stairs out from the subway, Nick et all
     walk up onto the street to SEE...


     MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

     The team cautiously approaches the building.


155  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           155

     Carefully moving out from between the buildings Godzilla
     takes a step into Central Park.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Prepare to fire!

     Guns are cocked, locked on and hoisted. Suddenly
     Godzilla gets cold feet and starts to turn around.


156  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                156

     The RED BLIP suddenly begins to move away from the
     park.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Damn it! Fire! Shoot it before it gets
               away!


157  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           157

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Fire at will! Fire at will!

     All the weapons surround the area FIRE AT ONCE. Several
     more Cobra Helicopters ZOOM DOWN out of nowhere.
     Plunging downward, they FIRE at Godzilla.

     The firepower ripping up everything around him, Godzilla
     ROARS and deftly DIVES out of the park and back between
     the buildings.

     But as he bounds over to 57th street, there is a
     contingency of MOBILE ROCKET LAUNCHERS waiting. They
     FIRE. Godzilla DODGES and the rockets DESTROY PLANET
     HOLLYWOOD as Godzilla races by.

     With the helicopters right on his tail, Godzilla makes a
     westward run across 57th street. Smashing parked
     vehicles and his tail SWIPING buildings as it DASHES.


     WEST SIDE HIGHWAY

     Godzilla is heading straight for it, the helicopters
     SHOOTING from the air. Suddenly Godzilla LEAPS higher
     than we've seen before. He hurls himself OVER the West
     Side Highway and SPLASHES DOWN into the Hudson River,
     vanishing beneath the water's surface.


158  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                158

     Furious, Major Hicks throws his headset against the
     console violently. ADMIRAL JOHNSTON leans down into
     frame.

                            ADMIRAL JOHNSTON
               Don't worry. The Navy has a little
               something there waiting for him.


     THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES

     In the murky waters of the Hudson river.


159  INT. NUCLEAR SUBMARINE - THE ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT        159

     The alarm KLAXONS are RINGING OUT as everyone rushes to
     battle stations. The CAPTAIN moves over to a sonar
     screen; a large MASS nearby blips on the screen.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (into radio)
               We've got him on sonar. Arizona
               closing in.


160  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           160

     Different monitors have put up a three dimensional
     schematic of the Hudson river. We SEE outlines of the
     three nuclear subs approaching their target.

                            RADIO VOICES
                      (filtered)

161  INT. LOBBY - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - SAME - NIGHT          161

     The doors are pried open. It's very dark in here, only
     the assault team's flashlights illuminate. As they enter
     the lobby, the team splits up into different search
     groups.

     Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude move down the large front
     lobby and turn down one of the many hallways surrounding
     the main auditorium.


     ANGLE - HALLWAY - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

     Cautiously they move towards us. In the distance we see
     the rest of the team moving the other direction. Raymond
     and Nick arrive at a door leading to the main
     auditorium. Nick is about to push the door open when
     Raymond stops him.

                            RAYMOND
               Jean-Claude.

     On command, Jean-Claude snaps together his automatic
     rifle as Raymond pulls out his semi-automatic pistol. He
     nods "okay" to Nick who slowly opens the door.

     As the door opens a small pile of FISH tumbles down over
     their feet. They step over the fish and enter.


162  INT. AUDITORIUM - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT         162

     Total darkness. Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude cautiously
     step over the fish inside. Only their flashlight beams
     can be seen.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - TRASHED AUDITORIUM

     His beam cruises over the area nearby. It's been gutted.
     Fish lay strewed on the floor everywhere. Suddenly Nick
     spots a strange cluster of OBJECTS. He moves closer.

     Raymond follows. With their combined light we can
     SEE...


     THREE ENORMOUS EGGS

     A pile of reptile eggs nearly twice as tall as they are.
     Raymond walks behind the egg, illuminating it from the
     other side, making it partially translucent. We can SEE
     THE EMBRYO inside the egg and IT'S MOVING!

                            NICK
               Three eggs. I thought there would be
               more.

                            RAYMOND
               You were right.

     Slowly Nick turns and SEES what Jean-Claude is staring
     at open jawed...


     DOZENS OF EGGS

     Together their beams of light scan across the main
     auditorium floor surrounding the gaping hole to discover
     DOZENS OF EGGS piled in clumps everywhere.

                            NICK
               That can't be. That's got to be over
               twenty eggs.


163  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          163

     Another of Raymond's men (R-MAN #2) has found a
     switchboard, he examines the switches.


164  INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT                           164

     Animal and Audrey are wandering through the debris.

                            AUDREY
               Okay, where'd they go from here?


165  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          165

     R-MAN #2 locates the switch he's looking for and hits
     it.


166  INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME - NIGHT                             166

     Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude are stunned as the work
     lights suddenly TURN ON illuminating the room,
     revealing...


     HUNDREDS OF EGGS

     All over the main auditorium floor. A stunning tableau.
     Nick is speechless. Raymond turns to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Start counting.


167  INT. PENN STATION - SAME                                   167

     The light filters down from the gaping hole in the
     ceiling.

                            ANIMAL
               They must have climbed all the way up
               into there.

     Together they notice some large metal piping that has
     fallen from the auditorium. They move over to it and
     begin to climb.


168  EXT. UNDERWATER - HUDSON RIVER - NUCLEAR SUB - NIGHT       168

     The Arizona races past us.


169  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                169

     We follow a runner who hands a report to the Admiral who
     is conferring with the General and Major Hicks by the
     schematic. The Admiral reads the report.

                            ADMIRAL JOHNSTON
               They've surrounded the target just at
               the mouth of the Hudson river.

     Arizona.


171  INT. SUBMARINE - ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT                    171

     The lights dim as they prepare for battle.

                            CAPTAIN
               Are we locked on?

                            ENSIGN
               Locked on, Captain.

                            CAPTAIN
               Fire.


172  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  172

     The torpedo is FIRED and comes darting directly at
     Godzilla who abruptly SWERVES. The torpedo, however,
     FOLLOWS him.


     ANGLE - SUBMARINE - CALVIN COOLIDGE

     From the other direction, closing in. Godzilla DIVES,
     skidding close to the bottom. The TORPEDO begins to
     close the gap.

     Suddenly Godzilla SHOOTS UPWARDS heading directly for
     the underside of the Calvin Coolidge.


173  INT. CALVIN COOLIDGE SUB - BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT           173

     The Calvin's CAPTAIN rushes over to the sonar screens.

                            ENSIGN #2
               He's shifted course. He's heading
               right at us!

                            CALVIN'S CAPTAIN
               Full stern!


174  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME                          174

     Godzilla RAMS the underside of the Calvin Coolidge
     before she can turn. The entire sub SPINS, TWISTING OVER
     its side and colliding directly with...


     THE TORPEDO

     slams into the side of the rolling and dented nuclear
     submarine. With a CONCUSSION the sub EXPLODES.


175  EXT. HUDSON RIVER - SAME                                   175

     An enormous SPRAY OF WATER erupts from the river,
     bubbles and debris float to the surface.


176  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   176

     The computerized representation of the Calvin Coolidge
     VANISHES off the monitor.

                            RADIO OPERATOR
               We've lost the Coolidge, Sir.

     The Admiral burns.


177  INT. ARIZONA SUBMARINE - SONAR CONSOLE - SAME - NIGHT      177

     The BLIP representing Godzilla turns.

                            ENSIGN
               He's shifted course, Sir. He's heading
               back towards Manhattan.

                            CAPTAIN
               Full ahead. Close in and lock on.


178  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  178

     Godzilla attempts to make his way back to the shore. The
     Indiana and Arizona close in on either side.


179  INT. ARIZONA - SAME                                        179

                            ENSIGN
               Locked on, Sir.

                            CAPTAIN
               Fire!


180  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  180

     Boxed in from either side, Godzilla RACES through the
     water. At the same moment both submarines FIRE their
     torpedoes.

     Godzilla reaches the underwater shoreline of Manhattan
     and begins BURROWING FURIOUSLY. As his gigantic claws
     start DIGGING up earth, an enormous TURBULENCE of clouds
     and dirt cloud the waters around him, cloaking him.


181  INT. ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT                                181

     The Captain and his Ensign are at the Sonar. We TRACK
     two torpedoes approaching target (Godzilla).

                            ENSIGN
               Impact in eight seconds, seven,
               six...


182  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                182

     Huddled around the schematic and radio, they hear...

                            ENSIGN (O.S.)
                      (filtered)
               ...five, four, three...


183  EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME                                     183

     The torpedoes ENTER into frame and disappear into this
     undersea dust cloud. An enormous EXPLOSION BLASTS from
     its center, waves of concussion reverberate.


184  EXT. BATTERY PARK - MANHATTAN - SAME - NIGHT               184

     With the EXPLOSION and enormous TIDAL WAVE rises and
     CRASHES DOWN over battery park with tremendous impact.
     Parked cars and phone booths are washed away.


185  INT. ARIZONA SUBMARINE - SAME - NIGHT                      185

     The ENSIGN checks the SONAR.

                            ENSIGN
               Direct hit!

     The crew erupts in cheers.


186  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           186

     They hear the cheering from the sub over the radio.

                            SOLDIER
               They got 'em!

     The Generals congratulate each other and Major Hicks.


187  EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME - NIGHT                             187

     Toppling down out of the murky turbulence, we SEE
     Godzilla falling away from the shoreline, backwards the
     ocean floor, drifting down to the bottom of the Hudson
     river like so many cement shoed gangsters.


188  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - SAME - NIGHT                  188

     Raymond and his men are laying out the plastic
     explosives around the room by the clumps of eggs.
     Jean-Claude walks up to Raymond.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               We do not have enough explosives.

     Raymond turns and sees Nick, across the room studying a
     group of eggs. Raymond goes towards him.


     ANGLE - AUDITORIUM FLOOR - HOLE - SAME

     Crawling out from the hole in the center of the floor,
     Animal and Audrey appear. They're stunned at what they
     see. Quickly Animal hoists his camera and begins to film
     as an amazed Audrey walks through.


     ANGLE - NICK AND EGGS - MID-LEVEL DECK

     Kneeling down along side the eggs, Nick examines them.
     Raymond approaches.

                            RAYMOND
               Nick, we have a problem.

     Nick silences him with a gesture as he moves in to
     listen to the egg. He leans his ear against the shell.
     Suddenly we HEAR a loud CRACK. Nick jumps backwards.

     The shell RUPTURES and an large FISSURE opens up across
     the egg. As we hear other CRACKS O.S., Nick turns and
     SEES more eggs beginning to open all around them.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL

     Hidden in this forest of tall eggs, Animal leans in
     close to one getting video footage of it cracking.
     Audrey nervously watches. What she doesn't see, however,
     is a BABYZILLA, fish hanging from its jaw, as it
     approaches from behind.


     ANGLE - NICK AND RAYMOND

     Stunned, they can only stare as the BABYZILLA BREAKS
     FREE of his shell and gives a mini version of the famous
     WAIL.

                            RAYMOND
               I think we should leave now.

                            NICK
               Good idea.

     The BABYZILLA kneels down and immediately starts
     GOBBLING UP the dead fish laying nearby. Cautiously Nick
     and Raymond slowly back away until they are a far enough
     distance, they they break into a run and head for the
     exit.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL

     The Babyzilla continues to chomp on its fish as it nears
     Audrey. Animal continues to shoot the cracking egg.

                            ANIMAL
                      (whispered)
               One more second. This is fantastic.

     Just then Animal turns to SEE the Babyzilla right behind
     Audrey.

                            AUDREY
               Don't you think we have enough?

                            ANIMAL
               Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.

     Audrey turns to see what Animal is staring at. Her eyes
     go WIDE as she backs up into Animal. Another BABYZILLA
     appear on the other side of them.

                            ANIMAL
               Just be calm. Don't startle them.

     Animal leads Audrey backwards as they make their way
     towards the large "team" entrance at the end of the
     floor. The two Babyzillas swallow their fish and begin
     to SNIFF the air.

     Audrey moves up the isle. An egg CRACKS and an ARM
     breaks out through a shell, GRABBING HER LEG. Audrey
     FREAKS and frantically she KICKS herself free. They both
     suddenly take off running.


189  INT. MID-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                             189

     Nick and Raymond race to the stairwell. Raymond pulls
     out his radio.

                            RAYMOND
                      (into radio)
               Everyone, outside! Now!


     ANGLE - JEAN-CLAUDE - MID-LEVEL DECKS - ACROSS THE ROOM

     Laying down the plastic explosives. Hearing the radio,
     he drops what they're doing just as several eggs near
     them begin to CRACK. Quickly he and his partner take off
     running.


190  INT. FAR BACK WALL - LOWER LEVEL - SAME                    190

     Two other men are still laying cables for the
     explosives. One of them is kneeling in a pile of FISH
     near the eggs.

                            R-MAN #2
               Come on, let's go.

                            R-MAN #3
               One moment. I've almost got this.

     Just then a BABYZILLA pops up behind the eggs, a fish in
     his mouth. He SWALLOWS the fish and begins SNIFFING THE
     AIR. He turns and stares directly at the slowly
     retreating R-MAN #3.

     He smells his own hands and realizes he smells like
     fish, quickly he turns and RUNS.

     But Babyzilla is faster. He runs up from behind and
     LEAPS onto R-MAN #3's back. R-MAN #2 begins to FIRE at
     Babyzilla just as another one TACKLES HIM from the
     side.

     In moments, they are both devoured.


191  INT. TEAM ENTRANCE - FLOOR-LEVEL - SAME                    191

     Audrey and Animal reach the entrance and race inside.
     The main exit doors are locked from the outside. They
     turn back just as...


     THREE BABYZILLAS

     appear in the team entrance doorway SNIFFING THE AIR.
     Audrey SEES something, grabs Animal's wrist and pulls
     him to one of the Locker room doors. It's open.


192  INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              192

     Through the door we SEE the Babyzilla approaching as
     Audrey and Animal leap inside, slamming the door behind
     them. There is a sudden THUD against the door.

     Animal rushes over to a large LOCKER CABINET and, with
     all his strength, PUSHES it over, blocking the door.

                            AUDREY
               Great. Now what do we do?


193  INT. HALLWAYS - MID-LEVEL - SAME                           193

     Nick and Raymond run up to another open doorway and look
     inside.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - AUDITORIUM

     Dozens and dozens of eggs HATCHING. BABYZILLAS
     everywhere begin to awaken and immediately begin to
     devour all the fish. A Babyzilla appears only feet away
     and turns and stares directly at us.

     Quickly Raymond slams the doors shut as they both
     retreat back into the hallway. Raymond SMASHES the glass
     covering of a nearby FIRE HOSE and raps it around the
     door handles, locking it closed.

     Suddenly a loud THUD as something begins to BANG against
     the locked doorway.

                            RAYMOND
               We've got to lock them inside while we
               can.

     Raymond tosses his cellular phone to Nick.

                            RAYMOND
               Contact the military and get them to
               send a bomber to blow up this building
               before these things escape.

                            NICK
               How do I do that?

                            RAYMOND
               555-7600. Tell them it's a code
               dragonfly. They should get you
               through.

     Amazed by Raymond, Nick just stares at him.

                            RAYMOND
               What are you waiting for?

     Nick snaps out of it and dials.

                            OPERATOR
                      (filtered)

194  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT               194

     A large and ANGRY mob has gathered at the roadblock to
     the bridge. People, their cars packed with belongings,
     are screaming to be let back into Manhattan. Horns honk
     and the blockade guards are getting nervous.


195  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           195

     The Mayor marches over to Major Hicks who is consulting
     with the Generals.

                            MAYOR
               Do you have any idea what's going on
               out there? The phones are ringing off
               the hook with people screaming to be
               let back into the city.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We're sending divers into the river
               now to retrieve the body.

                            MAYOR
               That thing's dead. What the hell are
               we waiting for?

     Just then Elise rushes over to the Major.

                            ELSIE
               Major, if Nick is right, this could be
               our last chance to do something about
               it. We have to search for the nest,
               now.

     Major Hicks is torn. Finally he nods in agreement,
     turning to another officer.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Organize a search party. I want a
               complete sweep of the entire city and
               subway system.

                            MAYOR
               You don't have the authority to do
               that.

     The Major turns and cooly approaches the Mayor.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Try and stop me.

     Major Hicks smiles at the Mayor who exits, petulantly.


196  INT. AUDITORIUM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - DOORWAY -        196
     NIGHT

     We SEE dozens and dozens of Babyzillas fighting with
     each other over the last of the fish. Suddenly this
     image is SLAMMED SHUT as doors are closed and a FIRE
     HOSE is rapped around door handles. We widen to
     reveal...

     Raymond fastening the hose around the door. Secured,
     Raymond takes off running.


197  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - HALLWAY - SAME                197

     Nick is on the pay phone frantically dialing as Raymond
     comes up. We hear a BUSY signal from the phone. Nick
     dials again.

                            RAYMOND
               What'd they say?

                            NICK
               I can't get through. I don't know
               what's wrong.

                      (filtered)

     Jean-Clude and his partner arrive.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               We've secured the doors on both
               levels.

                            RAYMOND
               Where's Luc and Pierre?

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               They didn't make it.

                            RAYMOND
                      (quickly recovering)
               Nick, my men and I will hold them
               here. You will have to go and get
               help!

     Nick nods in agreement and takes off down stairs. The
     rest of the team SNAP TOGETHER their automatic rifles
     and prepare for a fight.


198  INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME                                    198

     Animal and Audrey are checking out every corner of the
     room.

                            ANIMAL
               There's got to be another way out of
               here.

     Audrey climbs up onto a table and yanks out a grate
     covering the air vent.

                            AUDREY
               Think we can fit up in there?

                            ANIMAL
               Only one way to find out.

     He rushes over to her and helps her climb up inside.


199  INT. FLOOR-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                           199

     Jean-Claude sends Luc up ahead as they guard the
     doorways. A loud THUMP is heard on the door they are
     guarding. Each turns their weapon towards the doors.
     Suddenly a portion of WALL BETWEEN THEM COLLAPSES.

     A DOZEN BABYZILLAS leaping through the plaster. As they
     spill out into the hall, Jean-Claude attempts to open
     FIRE. One of the Babyzilla's is HIT.

     His brothers ATTACK. Luc from the other side tries to
     lay down cover fire but he's overrun by the herd.


200  INT. HALLWAY - MAIN LOBBY LEVEL - SAME                     200

     Nick comes racing down the stairs and into the hallway.
     Just then, he passes a locked door, BANGING on the other
     side.

     Just up ahead he can SEE the main lobby. But before he
     can get there, a LOUD CRASH is heard as the locked door
     in front of him SMASHES TO BITS as...


     DOZENS OF BABYZILLAS

     Flood into the main lobby only a few yards ahead. Nick
     slams on the breaks and quietly tries to back away. He
     turns to run the other directions when...


     MORE BABYZILLA

     Come BURSTING THROUGH the locked door behind him. Pinned
     down with no way out. Nick SEES the elevator nearby and
     races over, slamming his hand against the button.

                            NICK
               Come on, come on.

     The Babyzillas by the front door spot Nick. A couple of
     them start to SNIFF THE AIR and start to move towards
     him. Behind, the Babyzilla also catch the scent and
     turn.

                            NICK
               This is not good.

     Just then the elevator doors open, Nick LEAPS inside.


201  INT. ELEVATOR - SAME                                       201

     Nick frantically pushes the CLOSE DOOR button but it's
     painfully slow to react.

                            NICK
               I hate these things!

     Just then the Babyzillas appear. They're just about to
     move in when the doors finally CLOSE. Nick breaths a
     sigh of relief just as a loud THUD is heard as one of
     them SLAMS against the door. It's too late, the elevator
     begins to rise.


202  INT. AIR VENT - SAME - NIGHT                               202

     Climbing upward, Animal reaches a plateau and crawls
     into cross vent. He reaches back and grabs his camera.
     Putting it down he turns back and helps Audrey up and
     in.

                            ANIMAL
               You okay?

     Out of breath, she nods. Animal takes the lead again,
     pushing his camera in front of him. He reaches another
     vent that looks down. He's about to pull it free when
     something catches his eye.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - THROUGH VENT - RAYMOND

     Standing guard, automatic rife in hand, Raymond appears
     with his back toward us. Animal lifts his camera to
     shoot.

                            AUDREY
                      (whispered)
               What? What is it?

     Animal doesn't answer, he just shoots.


203  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        203

     The elevator doors open and Raymond SWERVES his gun
     around ready to shoot. Frightened, Nick throws his hands
     in the air.

                            NICK
               Hey, it's me!


204  INT. VENT - SAME                                           204

     Audrey has pushed her way up alongside of Animal to peer
     down through the grating.

                            RAYMOND
               What happened?


205  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        205

     Nick keeps dialing the cell phone, still busy.

                            NICK
               They're loose. They're allover the
               main lobby. I couldn't get out.

     Just then the vents above COLLAPSES and Animal and
     Audrey come tumbling down. In a flash, Raymond has his
     weapon trained on their heads.

                            RAYMOND
               Who the hell are you?

                            NICK
               It's okay. I know her.

     Raymond turns his gun towards the fallen video camera
     and FIRES, ripping the camera apart.

                            ANIMAL
               Hey! What gives?

                            RAYMOND
               No cameras.

     Nick moves to Audrey's side, helping her up.

                            NICK
               What are you doing here?

                            AUDREY
               I thought you said there'd only be a
               dozen eggs.

                            NICK
               I was wrong.

     Just then a LOUD THUMP is heard against the near locked
     door. The THUMPING gets louder and heavier.

                            RAYMOND
               Do you have a radio, a walkie-talkie?
               Anything we can use to contact the
               outside.

                            AUDREY
               What about the phones?

                            NICK
               Circuits are overloaded.

                            AUDREY
                      (gets an idea)
               I know a way. I know how you can get
               a message out of here.

     The door BURSTS OPEN and TWENTY BABYZILLAS stampede into
     the hallway. Audrey is fast on her feet.

                            AUDREY
               This way.

     She takes off running and they follow. The Babyzillas
     give chase. Animal, hangs back and runs over to the
     destroyed video camera and PULLS OUT THE TAPE. Just as
     he does, the Babyzillas are nearly on top of him. He
     dashes off.


     ANGLE - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR

     Audrey gets there first and opens the small doorway that
     leads to a back stairwell, she ushers the rest inside.

     She slams the door behind her as the Babyzillas appear
     and begin to SNIFF the doorway.


206  INT. HALLWAY - LUXURY BOXES - SAME - NIGHT                 206

     They spill out into the hall and rush past all the
     luxury boxes overlooking the auditorium.

                            AUDREY
               Come on, the broadcast booth is right
               over here.

                            NICK
               How do you know?

                            AUDREY
               Our network covers the Ranger games.


207  INT. MID-LEVEL - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR                   207

     The Babyzillas are gathered by the doorway SNIFFING. One
     of the more aggressive ones starts to CLAW at the door,
     RIPPING into it. Another charges it, THUD.


208  INT. LUXURY BOX HALLWAY - SAME                             208

     They rush up to a door marked BROADCAST BOOTH. Audrey
     tries the door, it's locked. Animal charges his shoulder
     into it, but it doesn't give.

     Raymond gently moves Animal out of the way and SHOOTS
     the lock to pieces. He opens the door for everyone to
     enter.


209  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME - NIGHT                        209

     They rush into the empty broadcast booth. Animal turns
     on the lights as Audrey goes over and boots the computer
     terminal. Raymond moves some equipment against the door,
     securing it closed.

                            AUDREY
               The network is on an intranet. It's a
               direct feed into our computer system.

                            NICK
               Your station won't have any easier
               time contacting the military than I
               did.

     That stumps her. Animal gets an idea.

                            ANIMAL
               When you worked with them, did they
               monitor the news broadcasts?

                            NICK
                      (getting the idea)
               Yes, they did.

                            ANIMAL
               We'll go live! We'll broadcast from
               here. Hopefully they'll see it.


210  INT. MID-LEVEL - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR                   210

     More of the creatures have gathered by the door. Two
     more CHARGE and the door collapses. The Babyzillas rush
     up the stairs.


211  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - EDITING BAY - SAME                  211

     Ed is watching the news feed. Caiman is on.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...Yes, the threat is over but the
               pain continues...

     Suddenly Ed's computer begins to BEEP. Ed slides his
     chair over and looks at his monitor. It reads NEW MAIL:
     URGENT! He double clicks it and a letter pops up that
     reads. Ed pick up transponder CFX 1 and watch the feed.

                            ED
                      (to himself)
               There's no Ranger game on tonight.

     Ed makes a couple of adjustments on his controls and
     turns on a blank monitor. He SEES...


     C.U. MONITOR - AUDREY

     Racing in front of the camera we SEE Audrey in the
     control booth.

                            AUDREY
               ...If you're seeing this, Ed, please
               put us on Live! This is urgent! I know
               this sounds crazy Ed but you have to
               do it. Please, trust me.

                            ED
                      (incredulous)
               I'm not putting you on live!


212  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                212

     Nick turns on a small television and we still SEE Caiman
     doing the news. Audrey turns to Animal.

                            AUDREY
               He's not going to do it.

                            ANIMAL
               Oh yes he will.

     Animal turns the camera and points out the window at the
     BABYZILLA'S below.


213  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - SAME                                213

     Ed's eyes nearly pop out of his head.

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               Ed, you see that? They'll be all over
               the city if we don't stop them!

     Ed rushes over to the console and goes to work.


214  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   214

     The mode is festive.  The Generals are preparing to leave
     as is Major Hicks. Sergeant O'Neal and some of his men
     are watching the t.v. news.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...as our fears have been allayed
               thanks to the dedicated work of our
               boys in uniform...

     Everyone in the room begins to cheer. Suddenly Caiman's
     image goes fuzzy. In a moment it's replaced by Audrey.

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               Are we on? Are we live?


215  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                215

     Nick SEES Audrey on the t.v. and gives her the thumbs
     up.

                            AUDREY
               We're live from inside Madison Square
               Garden where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos has
               discovered the beasts lair. Doctor,
               tell us what is happening here.

     Animal swerves the camera over to Nick. Raymond stays
     back behind the camera, watching.

                            NICK
               We've discovered over two hundred eggs
               which began hatching only moments ago.


216  INT. LUXURY BOXES HALLWAY - SAME                           216

     The creatures come bursting out of the stairwell and
     flood into the hall. Sniffing around they pick up the
     scent and take off.


217  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   217

     A Soldier tugs on Major Hicks shoulder, try to get his
     attention.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What is it?

                            SOLDIER
               You better see this.

     The Major turns around just in time to SEE Nick on the
     t.v.

                            NICK
               If the military are listening, they
               must immediately destroy this building
               before they can escape.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               Oh my God! They're coming!

     The camera SWERVES to SEE through the luxury booths
     across from them, the dozens of Babyzillas approaching.


218  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     218

     The bedroom is packed with Lucy's "guests" as they watch
     the t.v., SEEING the Babyzillas.

                            LUCY
               Oh my God!

     On the screen the image turns to Nick.

                            NICK
                      (filtered)
               If those creatures escape and
               multiply, in a very short time a new
               species will emerge. One that could
               replace us as the dominant species of
               this planet.


219  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   219

     Major Hicks is on the phone.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into phone)
               That's correct, I want you to blow up
               Madison Square Garden. No I'm not
               drunk.
                      (to O'Neal)
               Contact the news station. Tell them
               we're on the way.


220  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME - NIGHT                        220

     Raymond spots a large spool of co-axle cable. Quickly he
     ties it to the support beam.

                            AUDREY
               Reporting live from Madison Square
               Garden, this is Audrey Timmonds,
               WNEW.


221  INT. AUDREY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                   221

     Everyone is breathless watching the news. Lucy beams.

                            LUCY
               That's my girl.


222  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                222

     Animal lowers the camera and everyone is silent.

                            NICK
               Thanks, Audrey.

     The computer beeps, Animal reads the message.

                            ANIMAL
               The good news is they got the message.
               The bad news is we've got five and a
               half minutes to get out of the
               building.

     Suddenly the room ROCKS as the Babyzillas begin crashing
     against the blocked door. Raymond jumps to his feet.

                            RAYMOND
               Okay, party's over. Time to leave.

     With that he SPRAYS bullets into the front glass window
     SHATTERING IT. Glass rains down below. Raymond tosses
     the spool of cable out the broken window.

                            RAYMOND
               Anyone care to join me?

     Animal dislodges one of the video cameras, hoists it on
     his shoulder and moves over to join Raymond.


223  EXT. AIR BASE - F-18 SQUADRON - SAME - NIGHT               223

     Several F-18's prepare to take flight. We focus on one,
     an enormous bomb attached under its wing. The F-18 taxis
     away from us.


224  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - AUDITORIUM - SAME             224

     Repelling down from the broken window of the broadcast
     booth, Animal and Raymond land on the upper-level
     balcony. Raymond signals to the others to follow.


225  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                225

     Audrey and Nick are nervous as they stare at the long
     drop down. The door is begging to give way from the
     repeated THUMPING. Suddenly Audrey leans over and kisses
     Nick.

                            AUDREY
               In case I can't later.

     With that she JUMPS out, repelling downward. Nick is
     stunned by the unexpected kiss. Suddenly the door GIVES
     and the Babyzilla FLOOD into the room. Nick jumps.


226  INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS                               226

     Audrey hits the ground followed by Nick. Raymond leads
     as they make their way out.

     On the other end of the room some Babyzilla appear in a
     doorway and watch our friends scurry away. The
     Babyzillas take off in hot pursuit.


227  INT. DARK SKIES - F-18 SQUADRON - NIGHT                    227

     The F-18's fly in formation. Their leader carrying the
     same bomb we saw loaded earlier.


228  INT. FLOOR-LEVEL HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                    228

     Raymond, guns in each hand, comes rushing into the
     hallway. He SEES a small group of Babyzillas down the
     hall and gestures for the group to go the other way.

     Raymond backs away, guns trained on the Babyzillas who
     SNIFF the air and decide to pursue. Raymond turns and
     runs.


     ANGLE - FARTHER DOWN HALLWAY - AROUND THE CORNER - SAME

     As they tear forward they nearly run smack into a heard
     of several dozen Babyzillas who are tearing the
     concession stands to ribbons looking for food.

     Spotted, the Babyzillas LEAP forward after the team.
     Raymond spots the escalators across the hall.

                            RAYMOND
               The escalators, hurry!


229  EXT. SKIES - F-18'S - NIGHT                                229

     We FOLLOW the squadron as they pass us to reveal the
     beautiful MANHATTAN SKYLINE approaching.


230  INT. ESCALATOR CORRIDOR - MADISON SQUARE - SAME            230

     The team races into the corridor. Animal reaches down
     and hits the POWER button near the moving stairs. The
     escalator comes to life.

     The team runs down the "down" escalators as the
     Babyzillas flood into the corridor. Some try to go down
     the "up" escalator and fall all over themselves. Others
     are spooked by the moving down escalator. Finally, the
     brave ones begin to LEAP down the "down" escalator.


231  INT. MAIN LOBBY HALLWAY - SAME                             231

     Racing out of the escalator corridor the team moves into
     the main lobby and FREEZES. They are surrounded on all
     sides by Babyzillas!

     Like the scene in Hitcock's "The Birds" it is eerily
     still as everyone freezes.


232  EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - F-18'S - NIGHT                    232

     Closing over the city, the lead bomber breaks formation,
     flying lower, closer to the rooftops.


233  INT. COCKPIT - HUD DISPLAY - NIGHT                         233

     Through the windshield's Heads-Up-Display (HUD) we SEE a
     target LOCKING ON, flashing.

                            PILOT
               I'm locking on now.


234  INT. MAIN LOBBY - MADISON SQUARE - SAME                    234

     As several SNIFF THE AIR, they begin to CLOSE IN. The
     Babyzillas from the escalator corridor finally get to
     the ground level and rush over from behind.

     Raymond spots the large hanging CHANDELIERS in the front
     lobby. He FIRES a short BURST, SLICING the cable
     supporting the chandelier.

     The chandelier DROPS and SHATTERS in the center of the
     main lobby. The Babyzillas scatter, opening a pathway to
     the front door.

                            RAYMOND
               Go! Now!

     Raymond PUSHES the team forward as he takes the rear
     through the pathway which begins to close up as they
     pass through.

     The Babyzillas recover and begin to charge. As Raymond
     passes some CANDY MACHINES, he grabs one and SMASHES IT
     to the ground.


     THOUSANDS OF GUM BALLS

     Scatter all over the floor. As the Babyzillas run, they
     begin to stumble allover each other, tripping on the
     gum balls.

     Animal is the first to reach the main door, he opens it
     and Audrey and Nick are the first to exit. Raymond,
     FIRING MADLY behind as he rushes for the door.


235  INT. COCKPIT - F-18 - NIGHT                                235

     The locked FLASHES RED.

                            PILOT
               Stallion 15, Fox 6.


236  EXT. SKIES - F-18 - BOMB - NIGHT                           236

     The immense BOMB drops and takes flight on its own. We
     can see it's heading directly for MADISON SQUARE
     GARDEN.


237  EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT                         237

     Raymond exits and Animal shuts the door behind him. The
     Babyzillas SLAM against the doors. It takes all of
     Animal's and Raymond's strength to hold the doors
     closed.

     Raymond slides his rifle barrel between the handles as a
     temporary lock. He pulls Animal away and they take off
     running.


     BOMB'S P.O.V. - MADISON SQUARE - NIGHT

     Rapidly approaching the famous forum.


     ANGLE - RAYMOND, ANIMAL

     Not far behind Nick and Audrey as they race from the
     building. Behind them we SEE...


     BOMB AND BUILDING

     Collide and an ENORMOUS EXPLOSION ERUPTS, engulfing the
     entire building in a mountain of flame.

     Raymond, Animal, Audrey and Nick are THROWN several feet
     forwards, toppling to the ground from the incredible
     impact.

     As the building CRUMBLES in FLAMES we HEAR several of
     the Babyzillas SCREAMING. Soon they are silenced.

     Slowly Nick sits up and turns to Audrey. They're both
     shaken up. Nick touches her cheek gently.

                            NICK
               Are you okay?

                            AUDREY
               Somehow I never thought your life was
               this exciting.

                            NICK
               You'd be surprised.

                            AUDREY
               Really? I'd like to find out.

     She hugs him tightly. Nick smiles. Animal turns to
     Raymond who has cut above his eye.

                            ANIMAL
               Hey Man, you all right?

                            RAYMOND
               I could use a coffee.

     We begins to pull away from this tableau, slowly lifting
     upwards when suddenly...


     THAT FAMOUS WAIL

     Is heard! Then, violently BURSTING up through the ashes,
     a very angry GODZILLA emerges!

     Bleeding from his injuries, Godzilla leans down and
     nuzzles the burned out remains of his young. For the
     first time in the film we can SEE a partial expression
     of Godzilla's face; pain.

     But quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he
     focuses his hatred downwards, staring directly, and
     accusingly, at our heroes.

                            NICK
               Ohhhhhhhh.....shit.

                            ANIMAL
               What do we do?

                            RAYMOND
               Running would be a good idea.

     And they do just as Godzilla POUNCES. Fortunately our
     team DARTS around a corner just in time.


238  EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME                                    238

     As our heroes come rushing around a corner, Godzilla
     BURSTS THROUGH the building in front of them, sealing
     off their exit. Raymond notices a very narrow alley.


     ANGLE - ALLEY WAY

     Raymond leads them through this slim alley between to
     large brick buildings. They run for their lives as
     Godzilla appears behind them.

     His claws are too big to reach into the alley so he
     BULLDOZES his way into it, the building ripping apart as
     he marches forward.

     Bricks go FLYING as debris showers down on our team just
     they make their way to the other side.

     Slowed down by the the position of the alley, Godzilla
     SWINGS his arms violently to clear a path.


239  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      239

     Racing from the alley Raymond races over to a parked
     YELLOW CAB.


240  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS - SAME                               240

     In one deft move, Raymond draws a screwdriver out of his
     belt, pops the ignition device off the steering column
     and hot wires the car in under 15 seconds. It's
     amazing.

     As he does this the others pile into the car. Not even
     completely all in, Raymond takes off as soon as the
     engine turns over. Animal nearly falls out.


241  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      241

     Just as GODZILLA bursts out from between the buildings
     the CAB DARTS away, squealing around the next corner.


242  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                       242

     Power sliding around the wet street corner, the Yellow
     Cab FISHTAILS onto 8th Ave. Whipping around the corner
     behind them Godzilla appears.

     As he's MUCH faster, he nearly overtakes the car in a
     single LEAP but the cab SWERVES AGAIN moving down
     another street.


243  EXT. 27TH STREET - SAME                                    243

     The cab darts onto 27th street. DEBRIS tumbles down in
     their path as GODZILLA SMASHES through another
     building.


244  INT. CAB - SAME                                            244

     The rear window SHATTERS as falling bricks and debris
     HIT THE CAR. Again, the Cab darts down a small side
     street.


245  EXT. LEWELLEN DRIVE - SAME                                 245

     Using this small cut-across, the cab quickly exits out
     onto the next main street (28th). Godzilla rushes down
     the side street, his TAIL shattering buildings as he
     does.


246  INT. CAB - SAME                                            246

     Animal fumbles with his camera trying to get it to power
     up. The light goes ON and Animal quickly holsters it and
     begins filming out the shattered back window.

                            AUDREY
               Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut
               up Broadway.

                            ANIMAL
               You're crazy, go to the east side and
               take the park avenue to the JFK.

                            AUDREY
               The JFK? In the rain!?


247  EXT. STREET - CAB & GODZILLA - NIGHT                       247

     LEAPING forward, Godzilla BITES down, SNAPPING at the cab
     as it SWERVES just out of danger, gunning it.


248  INT. CAB - SAME - NIGHT                                    248

                            ANIMAL
               What are you talking about? The east
               side is always faster.

                            AUDREY
               But we can get to the west side
               faster.

     Through the rear window we SEE Godzilla SNAPPING down
     trying to take a bite. The cab, again, SWERVES wildly,
     darting down a side street.

                            RAYMOND
               Somebody make up your mind!

                            AUDREY & ANIMAL
               Take central park!


249  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - SAME                                     249

     Taking her advice, Raymond swerves up 8th Ave. uptown.
     He GUNS IT and RACES up ahead.


250  EXT. 28TH STREET - SAME                                    250

     The last two turns of the cab have temporarily
     disoriented Godzilla who looks around to find the cab.
     He moves up a block and begins to look around.


     GODZILLA'S P.O.V. - CAB - SAME - NIGHT

     Several blocks ahead, Godzilla spots the cab. He narrows
     his eyes and WAILS ANGRILY. Suddenly he BOLTS after the
     cab.


251  INT. CAB - SAME                                            251

     Animal clears away the broken glass and leans out the
     back window.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. THROUGH WINDOW - GODZILLA

     Gaining on them GODZILLA is in hot pursuit.

                            ANIMAL
               Better step on it Frenchie!


252  EXT. MEADOW - SAME                                         252

     The military is cleaning up the trap from before.
     Sergeant O'Neal SPINS as the cab LEAPS out from behind
     the trees.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               What the hell....?

     The cab POWER SLIDES right past and out of the Meadow
     again just as GODZILLA STOMPS directly into the clean up
     crew. Soldiers DIVE for cover as others scramble out of
     the way.

     Godzilla MARCHES after the cab, his tail SWIPING several
     vehicles which tumble, crashing into the troops.

     In a flash, Godzilla disappears back into the forest on
     the other side. O'Neal grabs his radio.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Command, Command, this Sergeant
               O'Neal. He's back!


253  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           253

     Major Hicks moves over towards the radios.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Captain Rogers, do we still have those
               F-18's in the air?

                            RODGERS
               They're heading back to base now,
               sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Turn 'em around.


254  EXT. BROADWAY - UPTOWN - SAME                              254

     The cab heads up the deserted streets, racing full
     tilt.


255  INT. CAB - SAME                                            255

     Animal pulls himself back into his seat.

                            ANIMAL
               I think we lost him.


256  EXT. BROADWAY - SAME                                       256

     Wrong again! Leaping out several blocks ahead, GODZILLA
     emerges. He KNEELS DOWN and gives a gigantic POWER BLAST
     of his BREATH.

     Cars, street signs, vending machines SAIL BACKWARDS from
     the force.

     A Newspaper vending machine SLAMS into the hood of the
     cab as the cab SQUEALS around a corner, avoiding the
     rest of the onslaught of debris.


257  EXT. SKIES - SAME                                          257

     The F-18's BANK and head back towards Manhattan.


258  EXT. HARLEM - SAME - NIGHT                                 258

     Racing up through the streets of Harlem we SEE the cab.


259  INT. CAB - SAME                                            259

     Everyone is looking around for the creature.

                            RAYMOND
               Anyone see him.

     Suddenly from behind, Animal spots the creature several
     blocks behind. Again, he lifts the camera.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     Running full boar directly at them.


260  EXT. HARLEM STREETS - CONTINUOUS                           260

     Godzilla quickly makes up ground. Running at the cab
     it's only a matter of seconds before he'll reach them.

261  INT. CAB - RAYMOND - SAME                                  261

     Raymond looks up, spots something.


     RAYMOND'S P.O.V. - SIGN

     Up ahead is a sign for the exit for the George
     Washington Bridge. Raymond decides to take it.


262  EXT. HARLEM STREETS - SAME                                 262

     The cab SWERVES heading towards the bridge entrance just
     as Godzilla BITES DOWN, barely missing the cab as it
     turns the corner.

     Godzilla LEAPS OVER THE ENTIRE BLOCK, landing directly
     IN FRONT OF THE CAB.

     The cab SPINS, pulling a full 180 degree turn, and PEELS
     OUT just before Godzilla can SNAP DOWN again, just
     missing the cab.

     The cab PEELS around the creature and UP THE ONRAMP.

     Just then Godzilla LEAPS AFTER THEM. His jaw open, he
     BITES DOWN ON THE CAB.


263  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS                                      263

     Everyone ducks as the enormous JAWS OF THE CREATURE
     CLAMP DOWN OVER THE CAB.


264  EXT. EXIT RAMP - SAME                                      264

     Taking a gigantic BITE out of the highway, some high
     tension wires and the support structure over the bridge,
     Godzilla CHOMPS DOWN on the cab.

     The large cement SIGN SLAMS into the roof of the
     creature's mouth, preventing him from crushing the cab
     with his teeth.


265  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      265

     The sign supports will not hold much longer as it
     crumbles just above the cab. The torn electric cables
     DANGLING dangerous close to the cab.

     Godzilla PUSHES his TONGUE towards the back of the car,
     trying to draw it into his throat!


266  INT. CAB                                                   266

     They're freaking out as the jaws are closing in on
     them.

                            AUDREY
               Gun it! Gun it!

                            RAYMOND
               I'm trying!


     C.U. CAB'S WHEELS

     Spinning in vain against the gigantic tongue that pushes
     against it, LIFTING the REAR of the vehicle.


267  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA - SAME                             267

     Like a dog with a bone, Godzilla SHAKES his head trying
     to rip the rest of the highway free. The portion of
     highway in front of the cab TEARS FREE, lifting.


268  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      268

     From the cab we SEE the horizon LIFT as the road begins
     to give way. The sign above CRUMBLING FURTHER.

     Nick turns and SEES...


     ELECTRIC CABLES - SPARKS

     Sparking as they hit against the supports of the sign,
     Nicks sees the cables dangling close to the cab. He
     takes off his jacket, wraps it around his hand and opens
     the cab door.

     Grabbing the cable with his wrapped hand, he JAMS THE
     CABLE DOWN into Godzilla's TONGUE. SPARKS FLY! Nick
     leans back inside, slamming the door shut.


269  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA                                    265

     He temporarily opens his mouth wider with a scream just
     before he is about to SLAM his jaws shut again...


     C.U. TIRES - SUDDENLY CATCHING

     As the tongue momentarily retreats from the SHOCK, the
     wheels CATCH and the CAB LURCHES FORWARD.


270  EXT. GODZILLA - CONTINUOUS                                 270

     As the sign CRUMBLES and the JAWS CRUSH DOWN, the cab
     SAILS OUT OF HIS MOUTH as the beast SWALLOWS the piece
     of highway.

     Landing, hard, onto the pavement, the cab PEELS OUT,
     burning rubber as it enters the George Washington
     Bridge.

     Godzilla SWALLOWS only to realize he didn't get them.
     Seeing the cab on the bridge Godzilla gives chase.


271  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE                              271

     The cab races towards us when Godzilla STEPS ONTO THE
     BRIDGE. His enormous weight makes the entire bridge
     WOBBLE.

     The Cab goes airborne then bottoms out as it returns to
     the asphalt as the bridge undulates beneath them. It's
     as though they were driving during an earthquake.

     With each stride Godzilla takes, the bridge becomes more
     unstable.


272  EXT. SKIES ABOVE THE HUDSON - F-18'S - SAME                272

     Swooping down the F-18's head directly towards the
     bridge. We see Godzilla about to overtake the Cab.


273  INT. COCKPIT                                               273

     The HUD begins to FLASH, LOCKED ON!

                            PILOT #2
               We are red and free. Stallion 10, Fox
               2.


274  EXT. BRIDGE - CAB AND GODZILLA                             274

     Only a stride away from being overtaken.


275  INT. OTHER COCKPIT - SAME                                  275

                            PILOT #3
               Stallion 12, Fox 2.


     ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON

     All at once they FIRE. Missiles heading right at
     camera.


     GODZILLA

     opens his mighty jaw about to CLAMP DOWN on them.

     The missiles CONNECT, SLAMMING INTO HIS CHEST,
     EXPLODING. His torso, rips apart. He SCREAMS OUT. His
     WAIL a painful death cry.

     His foot STOMPS DOWN as he tries to retain balance. The
     impact of the stomp acts like a shockwave that KNOCKS
     the Cab into a SPIN.

     SLAMMING into the guard rail, the cab bounces back into
     the road and keeps going.

     The injured Godzilla bites the bullet and continues
     pursuing, his gait slowing. The cab is able to make some
     distance.


     ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON

     Again they FIRE. A group of missiles darting out.


     GODZILLA

     The missiles HIT, ripping into him. Again GODZILLA
     SCREAMS out, his forward motion stopped.


276  EXT. OTHER SIDE OF BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                     276

     Where the blockade and angry mob still wait and watch in
     horror. The Cab SLIDES INTO A SPIN as it comes to a stop
     just in front of the crowd.

     Nick jumps out first, staring back at Godzilla. Audrey
     comes up from behind.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     His eyes rolling back into his head as he SCREAMS OUT.
     Slowly he TUMBLES.


     ANGLE - BRIDGE

     Godzilla's enormous head comes CRASHING DOWN in front of
     us. The tremendous impact sends TREMORS across the
     bridge.


277  EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                 277

     The gathered crowd is ROCKED from the impact of the
     toppled Godzilla.


     GODZILLA

     His last breath escaping. Defeated and weary, his eyes
     blink slowly as we watch his life slip away.


     NICK AND AUDREY

     Oddly, Nick stares sympathetically at Godzilla's sad and
     lifeless face.

     The stunned silence melts away as the mob behind them
     begins to applaud nervously, then vigorously. The mob
     breaks through the blockade and rushes over to our
     heroes, surrounding them. Cheering enthusiastically.


278  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     278

     The room is going berserk, everyone slapping hands. Lucy
     turns and gives a "high-five" to everyone around her.


279  EXT. JERSEY SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT              279

     Cameras flash like mad. Several news crews fight their
     way through the crowd.

                            REPORTERS
                      (overlapping)
               How did you discover the nest? Dr.
               Tatopoulis, can you tell us what
               happened back there?

                            NICK
               Sorry, guys, I've promised my story as
               an exclusive to another reporter.

     Nick winks at Audrey. Caiman pushes his way through the
     crowd of reporters over to her.

                            CAIMAN
               We did it! We've got the exclusive!
               Way to go, Audrey!

                            AUDREY
               We? I don't think so.

                            CAIMAN
               I want that story, Audrey. Remember
               you work for me.

                            AUDREY
               Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.

     Audrey waves goodbye as Animal walks over, checking his
     camera and his coat pocket.

                            ANIMAL
               Audrey, did you take the tape out of
               the camera?

                            AUDREY
               No.

                            NICK
               Where's Raymond?

     They look around, but he's gone. Nowhere to be seen.

                            ANIMAL
               I couldn't have just lost it?

     A phone begins to RING. Nick checks his pockets and finds
     Raymond's cellular phone. Nick answers.

                            NICK
               Hello?

                            RAYMOND (O.S.)
               It's Raymond.

                            NICK
               Where are you?


280  EXT. PAY PHONE - DOWN THE BLOCK - SAME - NIGHT             280

     Raymond watches the mob scene from a distance.

                            RAYMOND
               Tell your friends I will send the tape
               after I remove a few items from it.


     NICK AND AUDREY

     Nick nods to Audrey that it's Raymond.

                            NICK
               I understand.

                            RAYMOND
               I just wanted to say, au revoir and
               thank you for your help, my friend.

                            NICK
               Wait.
                      (line goes dead; to
                      himself)
               Au revoir.

                            AUDREY
               Who was that French guy, anyway.

                            NICK
               Oh, just some insurance guy.

     Off Audrey's confused expressions we PULL BACK, farther
     and farther. We see the mob, the military, the command
     tents and finally we pull back far enough to reveal
     Godzilla's mighty head laying on the end of the bridge.

281  INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT                           281

     We FLOAT through the demolished station almost as though
     we were a moving point of view. We travel thorough the
     debris of the station into one of the tunnels.

     We travel deeper and deeper into the distance. A shaft
     of light up ahead. We move closer to it.

     As we get nearer we realize it's one of Godzilla's
     gigantic EGGS. WE move closer and closer to the solitary
     egg. Just as we are about to collide with it. CRACK. IT

Gone In 60 Seconds - Scott Rosenberg

 
	GONE IN 60 SECONDS 
	by Scott Rosenberg
	4/6/99


	"I wonder," Toad said to himself presently, "I wonder
	if this sort of car starts easily?"
		Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he
	found that he had hold of the handle and was turning
	it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old
	passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him,
	body and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the
	car devoured the street, he was only conscious
	that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and
	highest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling
	his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what
	might come to him... "

	-- Kenneth Grahame, "THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS"







	"All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty
	hood... "

	-- Bruce Springsteen, "THUNDER ROAD"









	FADE IN:

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT

	The streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew
	of a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal.  The vast Port of Los
	Angeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars
	except -

	A '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500

	Silver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air
	scoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool
	before dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then
	SOMEONE approaches...

	Through the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ...
	He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer
	that refuses to fade ...

	This is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's
	quite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern
	California ...

	Memphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert
	crash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ...
	Admiring it ... Adoring it ...

	But then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver -
	ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for:

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You gonna steal her or kneel down to
		her and pray -- ?

	Memphis looks at him, still enthralled...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ...
		Just take her, slick. - -

	And Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ...
	No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his
	coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the
	door ...

	Watch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another
	pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION

	A RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small
	socket-like device - is pressed into the
	ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles
	like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds.

	He takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the
	deck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials.
	And Memphis floors it... And off they tear...

	The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand
	re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones,
	fixed and fumy ...

	He slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in
	behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ...

	On they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort...

	Except that, from seemingly out of nowhere --

	A POLICE CAR

	appears behind them...

	And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races
	through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And
	Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their
	respective vehicles...

	The UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny.

				DONNY
		Problem, Officer?

				POLICEMAN
		Yes. You're under arrest -- ?

				DONNY
		For running a stop sign?

				POLICEMAN
		For Grand Theft Auto -

	And off of Donny's look --

	We go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding
	toward him, sirens wailing...

	QUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning
	harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music
	... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ...

	Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis
	gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy
	pursuit ...

	And now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson,
	heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of
	cruisers himself ...

	Memphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up
	ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so
	fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ...

	Guns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and
	a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on
	to the roadblock ...

	And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis
	bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake --
	And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And
	Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ...

	And he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower
	Grand... Looking down ...

	He can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being
	chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER,
	the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ...

	Landing with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified.

	EXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER

	Rescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His
	leg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny
	Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ...

	A POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps

	DETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK

	of G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck
	is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility
	fool you - the man's a street viper ...

	Castlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS..

				HAWKINGS
		Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of
		Raines...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Well, then it's all for naught,
		ain't it, Hawkings?

	Castlebeck looks out over the mess ... And then looks up...
	Because, further down Lower Grand, a car is parked. It is the
	Shelby. With Memphis leaning against its hood...

	Castlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed. So he walks
	toward it, hand on hip...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you --

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back -

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You want to come along quiet?

				MEMPHIS
		How's Atley -- ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Leg's all banged-up. He made a
		stupid play ... He'll limp around
		the yard up at Folsom. But
		Astricky will be there to take
		care of him. With their priors,
		they're looking at a serious bounce --

				MEMPHIS
		Let them go --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		How's that?

				MEMPHIS
		Let them go. And I'll leave ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You'll leave -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		You don't have anything on me. A
		misdee auto-theft. I got no record.
		I'll be out in three days, and back at 
		it. Or you let them go, and I give
		you my word. I'm gone. And without the
		ringleader ... Your tee-times have
		just grown exponentially...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I don't golf...

	And they stare at each other, as Castlebeck considers.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		I do this. And I see you again. I'll
		come after you with everything I got.
		you won't be able to steal a glance
		at a blind man without me by your side ...

				MEMPHIS
		You have my word...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Get out of here, then. Now.

	And Memphis makes to get into the Shelby...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Leave the car, Randall ...

	Memphis nods ... Takes one last look at the Shelby... Sorry to 
	leave it behind ... And he runs off into the mists of Lower
	Grand ...

	Castlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Arright, let lim go. Cite him for
		rolling the stop ... And cite old
		Atley for driving to endanger ...

				HAWKINGS
		What are you talking about, Rollie? We're
		springing 'em? Just like that?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Just like that. Quit your bellyaching,
		Hawkings ... And let's wrap this up ...

	And off of Donny's surprised look, as Springsteen wails to
	crescendo and we

									CUT TO:

	EXT. INDEPENDENCE, CALIFORNIA - DAY - 6 YEARS LATER

	Some 400 miles North of Los Angeles, Independence is a one
	horse town, and the horse has died... Single stop light,
	single-engine firehouse, single everything. Norman Rockwell
	would find this burg a snooze.. - We settle on a small,
	GARAGE ... The peeling sign reads:

	"L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE"

	owned and operated by Memphis Raines ... In blue coveralls,
	Memphis has a Plymouth Duster up on the lift ... With him is a kid
	- TOM, 19... Lightnin' Hopkins' "Automobile Blues" plays through --

				MEMPHIS
		You know what you got here?

				TOM
		Not really -

				MEMPHIS
		There's excessive resistance in the cranking
		circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?

				TOM
		Not really --

				MEMPHIS
		You have any other answers besides
		"not really"?

				TOM
		Not --

				MEMPHIS
		Right. You want to test the voltage drop ...
		Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary
		lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ...
		See what you got ... You understand -- ?

	Tom starts to say "not really". Instead, he nods. Memphis takes a
	root beer from an old-style machine. He goes out ... front ... To
	where an old Denver Pyle-coot - BUDGY - sits on a bench, smoking
	an unfiltered Lucky ... Memphis sits beside him, pets the 
	200-year-old DOG that lounges nearby...

				BUDGY
		Just can't find good help these days --

				MEMPHIS
			(re: cigarette)
		Those things'll kill ya, Budgy --

				BUDGY
		They won't have a chance. The bourbon and
		bacon'll get me first...

	Budgy cackles ... Memphis looks out at the dusty little hamlet ...
	Budgy points at a passing car ...

				BUDGY (cont'd)
		That one -

				MEMPHIS
		1980 Mercury Cougar. 255 cubic inch V8 ...
		Based on the Ford Thunderbird bodyshell;
		they modified the chassis, but didn't
		improve its performance...

	Budgy points at another car ... And we get the sense they play
	this game every day...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		The 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. Proof
		positive of a single all-powerful Deity.
		The first bargain-priced muscle car
		ever. They even tuned the horn to
		resemble the "beep beep" sound of the
		cartoon Road Runner ...

	And Budgy looks impressed... As always ...

				BUDGY
		Damn, you're good

	Memphis nods ... Sips his root beer ...

				BUDGY (cont'd)
		You got to bingo last night?

	Memphis looks at him ... Can't believe it himself ...

				MEMPHIS
		That I did, Budgy. That I did --

	And, from inside the garage, there's the most horrific GRIND of
	metal on metal, as Tom has started the Plymouth -

				TOM (O.S.)
		Uh ... Randall -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Excuse me --

	Memphis goes back into the garage, Budgy cackles.

	A FORD ESCORT - driving through the upscale streets of Palos
	Verdes. Three KIDS, 20, inside ... The driver is FREB, a little
	dim; in the back is MIRROR MAN, black, always wears those mirrored
	shades ... In the passenger seat is

	KIP - Memphis' younger brother ... The car pulls to a stop.

	Fancy stores - all of them closed - line this affluent business
	district ... Freb consults a piece of paper ...

				FREB
		The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia.
		Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus
		would be at the corner of Hawthorne
		and Granvia --

				KIP
		He didn't mess up. There it is ...

	And he points ... To a CORNER BUILDING - EXOTIC MOTORS LTD. Twenty
	foot high glass - windows surround a SHOWROOM of EXOTIC DREAM
	CARS: Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bertones ... And-
	there it is, a 1996 LOTUS ESPRIT V8, gleaming in the all-night
	showroom lights...

	Freb and Mirror Man are startled

				FREB
		That -- ?

				MIRROR MAN
		You're shittin', right? Kip?

	He grins at them... He ain't shittin'...

				FREB
		How are we supposed to--

				KIP
		Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...

	Freb scowls ... Pops the trunk ... Kip gets out ... Goes to the
	back ... Freb and Mirror Man share a spook --

				MIRROR MAN
		What tool -- ?

	Kip reaches into the trunk.... Comes around to them... He's
	carrying A BRICK --

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		Oh, no --

	And Kip walks toward "Exotic Motors"... Calm and cool ...
	Ten feet from it ... He winds up ... And HURLS THE BRICK AT
	THE WINDOW Which EXPLODES ON IMPACT, a SHOWER OF GLASS
	raining down ...

	ALARMS SQUEAL

	As Kip walks into the showroom, glass crunching underfoot. Freb
	and Mirror Man can't believe it --

	INT. EXOTIC MOTORS

	Kip goes to the Lotus... With nary a glance around, he's got her
	open ... The Lotus' ALARM adds its song to the choir ... Kip,
	unmindful, gets behind the wheel ... Screwdriver to the
	mechanism... The alarm raging in here...

	In moments, the V8's massive 349bhp is bellowing... And Mirror Man
	climbs in beside him... And off they go ... Laying several inches
	of English rubber. Over the broken glass and out of the
	showroom...

	EXT. CITY STREETS - PALOS VERDES - NIGHT

	The Lotus races through these streets ... At high speeds ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a

	Kip smiles over the ascending speedometer --

				KIP
		Yeah. Ain't it great -- ?

	And he pins her ... VROOOOOM -- !

	Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

	INT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	A dozen purloined AUTOS are parked here ... And a number of
	SHIPPING CONTAINERS ... A thuggish MAN reads the paper ... The
	tennis ball bouncer is TUMBLER, 20 ... And he's sitting on a
	tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the
	piss out of

	ATLEY JACKSON

	whom we remember from the drop-car at our opening ... Atley walks
	with a LIMP now... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Can you stop that, for Chrissake?

				TUMBLER
		What's your problem, bro ?

	Thunk! Thunk!

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Where are they -- ?

				TUMBLER
		They'll be here. You nervous, bro? You? Back

	Heading for Long Beach... Stopped at a light ... A CAMARO pulls up
	next to them... A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him...

	Kip eyeballs them... Engines are revved... Challenges are
	implied... Mirror Man panics ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car,
		stolen car ...

				KIP
		Stolen fast car...

	And the light turns green ... And he pops the clutch ... And
	they are off ... It's a good old fashioned drag race ... Kip
	smiles at the blonde ... Mirror Man is freaking out ... Kip's
	eyes are on fire ... He clocks the speedometer ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		It's calibrated for 140 ... Let's see
		if these British boys are full of shit
		or not --

				MIRROR MAN
		No way, man --

	Yes, way. Kip floors it. They bury the Camaro in its wake... The
	gauge rising ... 90, 100, 110 ... Mirror Man is having an
	embolism...

	They warp-speed by a POLICE CRUISER... Both kids totally unaware
	of the POLICE CHOPPER up on high... With them in its sights ...
	And they drive ... At last, ending up at --

	THE WATERFRONT - A dark latticework of docks and wharves,
	warehouses and shipping crates... The freighters are somehow
	graceful against the moonlit water ...

	INT. WAREHOUSE

	Tumbler studies his watch... Now he's a little concerned ... He
	looks up ... Atley is glaring at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Something wrong, Tumbler -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Yeah. I'm missing Springer --

	And then the Lotus pulls into the warehouse... Tumbler flashes
	Atley a "told-you-so" smile... Kip and Mirror Man get out of the
	car...

	Kip walks over to a CLIPBOARD with a magic marker tethered to it
	... It is a list of cars ... He draws a black line through "13)
	1996 Lotus Esprit V8"... The others are clocking the car...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		She'll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds --

				MIRROR MAN
		I can vouch for that.

	Tumbler passes out 40 oz.s ... The vibe is celebratory...

				TUMBLER
		Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...

				KIP
		No problem -

	Bottles are clinked... Beer is sipped ... Only, a HOT WHITE
	SPOTLIGHT bores through the skylight ... And the whup-whup of the
	chopper's ROTORS... And now the sounds of SIRENS ... And the 
	thuggish man gets to his feet ...

				THUGGISH MAN
		Let's get outta here -- !

	Memphis goes through invoices in the cluttered back office. When a
	brand new purple MERCEDES SLK, windows tinted, pulls in out front.
	It looks oddly anachronistic here in Independence. Memphis senses
	danger. He goes out. Budgy and his dog are here... Budgy looks
	spooked... Tom, too ...

				MEMPHIS
		What's going on -- ?

	And standing there, by the Mercedes, like a wraith, is ATLEY
	JACKSON, in long leather coat, smoking a cigarette ... As out of
	place here as a maggot on a muffin...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Well, well, well ...

	And he begins to sing...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
			(ANDY GRIFFITH theme)
		Da-doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo-doo, etc.
			(laughs)
		Are you kidding me, man -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Hello, Atley ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (re: sign)
		L.N. ORR. I get it. Clever ...

	Memphis studies him...

				MEMPHIS
		How's the leg?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit
		you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt
		Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's
		Opie at?

	He laughs some more ... Chain-lights his cig ...

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Is there someplace we can talk?

	Memphis looks at him...

				MEMPHIS
		What about?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		About your brother. And the deeeep
		shit he's in --

	INT. TEDDY'S TAVERN - NIGHT

	A BARMAID sets down a pitcher of beer and two mugs...

				WAITRESS
		There you go --

				MEMPHIS
		Thanks, Donna --

	She leaves... Atley is staring at him... Memphis shrugs...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		It's been a long time, Memphis --

				MEMPHIS
		Six years ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it?
		Six years ago we were fartin' through
		Armani and pissin' Cristal.
		Now look at us ...

		MEMPHIS
		Tell me about Kip -

	Atley takes a sip of his beer,...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		He took a job. And he fumbled it.
		Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...

				MEMPHIS
		What kind of job... ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		A boost. A big boost ...

				MEMPHIS
		A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?

	Atley frowns ... Looks at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You're shittin', right?

	Clearly Memphis is not ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Kip's become quite the little
		crewrunner since you left. He's been
		working a low-rent ring for
		two years now. You don't talk to
		your Ma?

				MEMPHIS
		It seems she neglected to mention it

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Maybe she don't know. Although I don't
		see how that could be. Maybe she didn't
		want to upset you -

				MEMPHIS
		Don't feel the need to explore my family
		dynamics, Atley...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		The point is: Kip's been living the
		life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy.
		Makes our old behavior seem like
		altar boy time. But he fungold this
		one so bad, folks around L.B.
		are already speakin' about him in
		the past tense.

	Memphis takes a beat ... Sips at his brew ... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		Who was the job for?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Who do you think?

	Memphis waits ... In no mood for guessing games ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Calitri, man. Raymond "The Carpenter"
		Calitri ... Your favorite and mine ...

	Which means nothing to us ... Though the look on Memphis, face
	speaks volumes ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		I just thought you should know,
		man. I kind of had a feeling you
		didn't. But I should tell you:
		I'm working for him now - The
		Carpenter - so if you see him, you
		won't mention me coming to get
		you... Like I said: I just thought
		... I owed you ... And that it was
		the right thing to do ...

	Memphis nods ... His face clenched in despair. We FADE TO BLACK,
	As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART 1: STOLEN MOMENTS

	We PRE-LAP J. Geils Band's "Hard-Drivin' Man" and CUT TO:

	THREE PLATES OF BACON, EGGS AND HASH BROWNS

	placed on the service deck by a short-order COOK...

	INT. RUBY'S ALL-NITE - LONG BEACH - NIGHT

	A 24-hour diner in the heart of Long Beach... The three plates are
	picked-up with an impressive dexterity by

	HELEN RAINES

	early 60s, clear-eyed... In pink Ruby's uniform and chunky
	shoes... Black currant hair striated with wisps of gray... Helen
	delivers the plates to a booth of college kids ...

				KID
		Can I get some more coffee -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Sure, hon ...

	And she goes to the coffee station... When

				MEMPHIS (O.S.)
		Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna
		melt in this joint -- ?

	And she turns around to see Memphis standing there. Her expression
	displays many things ... Most of them joy ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Hello, Ma --

	And she goes to Memphis ... Wraps her arms around him ... Squeezes
	tight ...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		Oh, Randall ...

	She takes his head in her hands ... Kisses his cheek ... Then the
	other... Hugs on ... Unmindful of the customers ... The cook
	smiles from behind the order wheel ...

				COOK
		What's the word, Memphis -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		How ya doing, Ruby -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Come, come, come ...

	And she leads him over to a booth ... Barking to the cook - RUBY -
	on the way...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone,
		extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate
		milk... Lots of syrup...
			(to Memphis)
		Right?

				MEMPHIS
		Right ...

	And they settle in ... Across the booth from each other ... She
	takes his hands...

				HELEN RAINES
		You look good...

				MEMPHIS
		You, too, Ma...

				HELEN RAINES
		What are you doing back?

				MEMPHIS
		How's Kip?

	And Helen flushes, a bit ashamed maybe ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Have you seen him?

				MEMPHIS
		No.

				HELEN RAINES
		oh.

				MEMPHIS
		Atley Jackson came to see me ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Atley Jackson. How is that one?
		How's the leg... ?

	He looks at her ... Beat ...

				MEMPHIS
		Why didn't you tell me?

				HELEN RAINES
		I couldn't. I didn't want you to
		worry. I thought held sort himself
		out. I hardly see him. He comes and
		goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?

				MEMPHIS
		He's in some trouble ...

				HELEN RAINES
		I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a
		different boy. He's lost that... That
		sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't
		know what to do ...

				MEMPHIS
		You getting my checks ... ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Of course ...

	ANGLE - RUBY. He's on the PHONE in the kitchen...One eye
	on Memphis and Helen --

				RUBY
		Detective Castlebeck... It's me ...
		Yeah... You ain't never gonna guess
		who just come in to visit his Ma --

	BACK TO - MEMPHIS AND HELEN RAINES ...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		You haven't spoken to him in a
		while, I guess...

				MEMPHIS
		He doesn't return my calls. or my
		letters ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby.
		I don't know what you remember of him.
		But you should brace yourself

	And, on her sad smile, we PRE-LAP Sammy Hagar's "I Can't Drive 55"
	and SLAM CUT TO:

	INT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - POOL HALL - NIGHT

	A dozen tables... Smells of blue chalk and whiskey... The juke box
	cranked... We take it to the back of the joint ... Where Kip, and
	Tumbler and Mirror Man are knocking a rack... Freb sits nearby,
	with a few badly made-up GIRLS...

				TUMBLER
		... so ... It's my new move ... It's called
		"The Stranger." What I do is, I sit on
		my hand for 10 minutes.  Till it falls
		asleep. Till it's good and numb. No feeling.
		And then I jerk off.

				GIRL
		That's disgusting -

				FREB
		What's the point, man -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Cos it's like you're bein' done by a stranger
		... It rocks ... It's the power move of the
		New Millennium...

	He sinks another ball. A kid, 15, TOBY - comes up to them.

				TOBY
		Hey, Kip, what's up?

				KIP
		What do you say, Toby?,

				TOBY
		I'm cool -

				TUMBLER
		What do you want, shithead?

				TOBY
		Why you gotta front me like that? I'm
		talking to Kip --

				TUMBLER
		Why don't you leave him alone?

				TOBY
		I known Kip longing than you, man ...

				TUMBLER
		Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --

				FREB
		Any word, Kip -- ?

				KIP
		No ... And they won't take my calls ...

				FREB
		What does that mean -- ?

				KIP
		It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"

	He groks their fear...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Look - we managed to get 13 in a week.
		We just gotta step it up ...

				FREB
		But we only got till Friday. That's
		four days. And we lost the 13. So's
		we gotta start over ...

	Kip looks at him...

				KIP
		That, too ...
			(off of Freb's look of fright)
		Don't sweat it, Freb. We're cool.

	ANGLE THE FRONT DOOR. For Memphis has entered. He
	clocks the room. Sees them at the rear ... Walks back

				KIP
		It can be done, man. We just gotta
		step it up... It's a challenge ...

				MIRROR MAN
		The challenge is not to get our nuts
		cut-off and shoved down our throats ...

				TUMBLER
		Can I help you, pal -- ?

	And Kip looks up ... To see Memphis there ...

				MEMPHIS
		Hey, Kip ...

				KIP
		Hello, Memphis --

				TUMBLER
		"Memphis?" You're Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		That's right...

				TUMBLER
		Damn. Damn, damn, damn ...

				FREB
		Memphis. Holy shit. It's an honor,
		man --

	And he pumps his hand... Memphis continues to stare at Kip

				KIP
		It's good to see ya, man. You changed
		your look -

				MEMPHIS
		You, too

	Hold the stare... The others are excited...

				FREB
		What are you doing back, Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		Little visit. Check on the family.

				KIP
		It's nice to see ya, man -

	He smiles ... Memphis eyeballs him... Toby is there ...

				TOBY
		Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby
		Walker. I live next door ...

				MEMPHIS
		Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up

				TOBY
		Yeah, I'm cool ...

	And Memphis turns back to Kip, who's picked up a pool cue.

				KIP
		Who's got next game -- ?

	And he makes to rack 'em up ... Then:

				MIRROR MAN
		I get it. You ain't gotta be a genius:
		Memphis come back to save our bacon!

				TUMBLER
		Shut-up, Mirror Man --

				FREB
		Izzat true? You come back to save our
		bacon?

				MIRROR MAN
		Of course it's true. He come to save
		his brother's dangling ass --

				KIP
		That can't be it. Cos we don't need
		saving

				FREB
		We don't -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		He give you an advance -- ?

				MIRROR MAN
		Hell, yeah. Ten larger man

	Kip shoots him a look... As if he's spoken out of turn ...

				MEMPHIS
		You just give 'im back the money.
		All's well...

	The others look glum... Kip laughs ... Long and hard...

				KIP
		"Give lim back the money." "Give 'im
		back the money..." Be nice. If only
		we didn't drink the money. And smoke
		the money. And buy Nikes with the
		money. And Sony Play Stations with the
		money. And dirty girls with the
		money...

	And Kip sinks a ball ... Memphis looks at the others ... They
	nod... It's true ... The money's gone ...

				KIP
		But don't worry, man. Things are all
		sweetness and light here...

				TUMBLER
		Things are all leafy and suburban ...

				MIRROR MAN
		The hell they are --

				KIP
		Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the
		gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled...
		And it was nice to see you -- -

	Memphis nods ... Looks at all of them... Smiles ... And then
	REACHES OUT, GRABBING Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet
	and in close, nose to nose ...

				MEMPHIS
		You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy
		yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum,
		well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a
		poundcake. But I remember the days when you
		used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em...
		So you can't stop me from saving your
		"dangling ass' if that's what I feel like
		doing...

	And with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the
	table, bottles and glasses crashing... And barrels away from them,
	the crowd parting like a wound...

	Kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed...

				TUMBLER
		Damn... Homeboy's on the dazzle ...

	And, off of Kip's furious look, we CUT TO:

	EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	A chill in the air. Memphis walks toward a range of lowslung
	buildings ...

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

	A virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up
	high for as far as the eye can see ... A huge FORK LIFT scoops up
	a wreck and hauls it over to the CRUSHER... Watch as the car is
	FLATTENED, for easy shelving ...

	Midnight auto nonpareil ... To one side of the yard is a GARAGE:
	Watch as a HONDA ACCORD, with a BLOODY WINDSHIELD, enters the
	garage. A young Mexican KID driving.

	A SIGN: "LOCK YOUR CAR OR IT MAY BE GONE IN 60 SECONDS!"

	INT. GARAGE - CHOP SHOP

	A CAR is CHOPPED ... Pulled apart ... Fenders, doors, panels,
	interiors, air bags ...

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - FRONT ENTRANCE

	Memphis knocks on the door ... A dog-faced MAN opens it ...

				DOG-FACE
		Yeah -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri ...

	INT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL

	Memphis follows Dog-face to the back of this building. Follows him
	into another room. Which is

	A WORKSHOP

	An enormous WOODWORKING SHOP, fully tricked-out with state-of-the-
	art table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes.

	An antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of
	expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked
	against the rear wall ...

	Jars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches
	cram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is
	RAYMOND CALITRI, 59 ...

	He wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A
	Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a
	cobra. The liegelord of downtown...

	And now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a
	wide panel of maple ... Atley Jackson is here as well ... As noisy
	as it is out in the yard, in here, once the door is closed, it's
	as SILENT-as a tomb...

	A BANK OF MONITORS on one wall show the cars being crushed and
	disassembled in the yard. Memphis is led into the room.

	Calitri nods and Dog-face leaves the room... Calitri smiles ...
	Examines his fresh cut...

				CALITRI
		Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...
			(looks at his clothes;)
			frowns)
		'though I do I recall you as a man
		with style. You remember your old
		friend, Atley -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		How ya doing?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Good to see you, Memphis --

				CALITRI
		So. What do we owe the honor -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		It's about my brother ... Kip...

				CALITRI
		Yes ... Kip ...

	He says the name like other men say "cancer." The phone on
	his desk BLINKS. Calitri picks it up. Listens. Looks at
	one of the monitors. Where the Mexican man is talking to
	several Calitri EMPLOYEES. Calitri hangs up...

				CALITRI
		Excuse me one moment, Randall ...

	And he picks up a MORTISE CHISEL on his way out. Palming it ...

	INT. GARAGE - THE MEXICAN MAN

	is sobbing. As Raymond Calitri marches toward him, glancing at the
	bloodied windshield.

				CALITRI
		You bring this to me in this
		condition? Blood and guts all
		over it? You make me complicit?
		On my property? Who taught you
		how to think? And worst of all:
		weren't there supposed to be two
		Hondas?

				THIEF
		Please ...

	And Calitri, rapid-fire, PUNCTURES the man's belly and chest and
	legs with the chisel, old-school prison-shiv style ... Until the
	man is on the floor, howling ...

				CALITRI
		Stupid sonuvabitch...

	INT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP

	Memphis can-see this from one of the monitors. He looks at
	Atley...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after
		himself ...

				MEMPHIS
		Jesus ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		The business has changed...

	Calitri is back, wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag.

				CALITRI
		Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.

				MEMPHIS
		I don't want him hurt...

	Calitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop...

				CALITRI
		I'm proud of this work. The bird
		feeder. The wagon wheel planter.
		The dollhouse. The drop-leaf movable
		server...

	He gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork. Then
	gestures to the yard...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Metal. Steel. It's cold. Ugly. Wood
		is warm. Clean. Provided by nature.
		To see a piece of furniture take shape.
		It's like watching a child grow ...

	Memphis glances to Atley... Atley shrugs ...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm sure you're working your way to
		the point.  I'll wait right here ...

	Calitri blinks. Smiles. Nods...

				CALITRI
		My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require
		the best. I insist on the best. I only
		engage the best.  Your brother. His
		friends. They came to me. They wanted my
		paper. He was your brother. You were the
		best. Now. They've brought so much
		goddamn heat down, I may not be able to
		fill this order. Which would be very bad
		for me. Which in turn, is very bad for
		them...

				MEMPHIS
		I could kill you. That occurred to me.
		When I first heard about this. That I
		would kill you ...

				CALITRI
		Grow up. You don't kill people like me.
		People like me die in their sleep at
		87 ... Do you know why? Because if
		you did kill me, and everyone knew it
		was you - for the next ten years they'd
		be finding pieces of those you love
		scattered all over California ...

	Memphis nods, notes a PISTOL, resting on a shelf nearby.

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		No, no. You don't kill me, because
		you can't. You don't take your brother
		and run, because we'd find him. You
		don't go to the-police, because we have
		friends there, too. You do nothing:
		except deal with me.

	Memphis eyes him...

				MEMPHIS
		I can come up with the front money.
		Pay you back...

				CALITRI
		Were it only that easy. I have
		obligations. The order needs to be
		filled...

	Calitri takes a manila ENVELOPE from his desk... Hands it to
	Memphis, who takes out the SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER inside.

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		On that list, you'll find fifty cars.
		Fifty. Five-zero. They range in
		age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird
		to the 1999 Toyota Camry; and in
		expense from the 1993 Volkswagen
		Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini
		Countach. Fifty cars. Five-zero.

	Memphis scans the list ... Looks up at Calitri ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		There is a container ship in Long
		Beach Harbor. Pier 14. Ready to be
		loaded with 4-car-per shipping
		containers, false-walled and
		customsprofiled as motor oil
		designated. The ship leaves in four
		days for South America and the
		men who've tendered me this contract ...

				MEMPHIS
		They gave you only four days?

				CALITRI
		They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it
		with your brother and his crew, who not
		only lost what pitiful few they managed
		to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our
		endeavor, making this even more difficult
		to achieve ...

	Memphis scans the list ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Four days. 50 cars. I'm paying 200
		thousand dollars ...

	Now Memphis looks up...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm not interested --

				CALITRI
		I knew you'd say that.

				MEMPHIS
		I'm just here about my brother.

				CALITRI
		I knew you'd say that, too --

	Calitri smiles ... Memphis 'looks at him... At Atley Realizing
	the trap ...

				MEMPHIS
		Sound it out for me.

				CALITRI
		Your brother has four days. Fifty
		cars. Five-zero. For that he gets
		200 large ...

				MEMPHIS
		And if he doesn't make it -- ?

	Calitri goes to one corner of the shop... Takes a tarp off
	of a full couch MAHOGANY CASKET...

				CALITRI
		I made this, too. My first one.
		Brass extension handles, not plated.
		The coverings are silk, not rayon.
		Expensive hardwood. And lined with
		spray green Lorraine crepe ...

	Memphis waits, knowing where this is going --

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In
		case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning,
		if that ship sets off without my
		fifty ... Kip will take up permanent
		residence in this box ...

	Calitri WALL SWITCH and the a corrugated steel SLIDING DOOR is
	RAISED, revealing a LOADING DOCK facing the back of the yard... Two
	MEN are working out there... DIGGER AND BUTZ scuzzy dudes, mid-30s
	and dressed in dirty coveralls ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Come here for a second, boys --

	And they come over --

				DIGGER
		Evenin', Mr. C. --

				CALITRI
		Digger, Butz: let me introduce
		you to Randall Raines. Used to
		head up the dandiest ring in
		Southern Cal. Left us
		for parts unknown. Randall, this
		is Digger. And that's Butz -

				DIGGER
		Hi, Randall --

	Memphis says nothing. Calitri grins ... Nods to Digger an Butz,
	who go back to work...

				CALITRI
		Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial.
		They're good boys ...

	Memphis' look is cold and furious ... Plaintive:

				MEMPHIS
		I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...

				CALITRI
		"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or
		the summer to end. But we
		don't get to choose these things...

	Atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. Calitri
	turns to Memphis...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		"Nothing that's forced can ever be
		right." Old woodworking expression.
		I really don't care how the 50
		get onto my ship ... I just care
		that they do. You decide.

	With that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up
	an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and
	beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer.

	EXT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

	A small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill
	overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ...

	INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE

	Helen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We
	see a CRIME SCENE ...

				REPORTER
		... the car-jacking, which left Ramona
		Sullivan, the 44-year-old mother of
		three, dead, occurred last night at ...

	Memphis glances to the TV... Grimaces ... He looks out the window
	... At the SEDAN parked below...

	EXT. RAINES' HOUSE - NIGHT

	Memphis comes out ... Moves to the sedan parked across the street
	... it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

	They get out of the car... The view of San Pedro from up here is a
	spectacular bedspread of lights ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		When'd you get to town, Raines?

				MEMPHIS
		The other day....

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		What for?

				MEMPHIS
		No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I
		heard we got Shaquille ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		Where you been, anyway?

				MEMPHIS
		Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my
		collection of refrigerator magnets ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		You seem a little hinked-up ...

				MEMPHIS
		Not at all ...

	He and Castlebeck lock eyes ... Castlebeck takes a pear from his
	coat pocket ... Sets to polishing it ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I remember us having made some
		kind of deal, Randall. I don't
		remember this deal having some kind
		of time-limit. I look at you -
		here - in my town - and I'm
		confused...

				MEMPHIS
		A little family emergency --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I hope it's not your dear sweet
		mother...

				MEMPHIS
		No...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Or your baby brother. What was his
		name?

				MEMPHIS
		Kip.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling.
		Named for the English writer
		of stories about India ...
		He bites into his pear ...
		Memphis says nothing, waits ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		I got a rash of thefts.  A new crew is
		making noise. We recovered a big take -
		last week...

				MEMPHIS
		And this has what to do with me?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I don't know. But you shouldn't
		be here. Take care of your business.
		I'll give you 24 hours. And
		then I don't want to see your face.
		Ever again. Make a fool of me
		once, that's my bad. Make a fool of
		me twice. That's really my
		bad, and I'll kick your ass from
		here to India ...

	Castlebeck gives him a long look... As they walk back to the car...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Good. Cos you know how it plays.
		Six years ago, I let you go free. But
		the next time ... The next time sends
		you away for'a long, long while ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		By the time you get out, asshole, there
		won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin'
		around in space ships ...

	He laughs... And they drive off ... Memphis watching them go ...
	once they're gone... He walks ...

	EXT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - BACK ALLEY EXIT - NIGHT

	Kip comes out of the club... Toby follows ...

				TOBY
		You goin' home?

				KIP
		Yeah... You want a ride...

				TOBY
		Sure -

				KIP
		How'd you get here? Your Moms give you
		ride -- ?

				TOBY
		Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.

				KIP
		You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?

				TOBY
		I dunno. It was right here. Someone
		musta' boosted it back...

				KIP
		Damn crooks is everywhere --

	They smile...And go to Kip's TRANS AM...

				TOBY (cont'd)
		Memphis seemed weird, huh? What's with
		them clothes? He a farmer now or
		something?

	And this seems funny to Kip... He smiles..

				KIP 
		Yeah. Except the only thing he's growing
		is old...

	And they are fronted by TWO GOONS ... Who toss them up against the
	wall...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What do you want -- ?

	One of the goons SOCKS Toby in the gut. Toby doubles over. Kip
	strains to intervene, but his goon holds him back --

				KIP
		Don't you do that! You leave him alone!

				GOON
		Shaddup, Raines

				KIP
		He's got nothing to do with this --

	And the goon punches him in the face. And Kip goes down. And out.

				GOON
		Get him in the car

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

	Kip comes to. In his car. Hot white lights blind him. The Trans
	Am is in the crusher. FIGURES above him. Calitri. The goons ...

				CALITRI
		Hello, Kip --

	Kip tries to get out. The doors are pinned by the forklift.

				KIP
		Lemme out of this --

				CALITRI
		Were it only that easy --

				KIP
		We can still do it --

	Calitri nods ... And the crusher presses ... The roof caves a bit
	... Kip is close to scrunch ...

				CALITRI
		No you can't. Flies on sherbert is what you
		remind me of. Because just being attracted
		to something, doesn't mean you belong...

	INT. CALITRI'S WOODSHOP

	Atley is here, watching Calitri and Kip. one of the monitors. He's
	miserable. But there is nothing he can do.

	EXT. SCRAPYARD - NIGHT

	Kip continues to struggle free...

				KIP
		Listen, Calitri --

				CALITRI
		Call me "Ray." Better yet: call me
		"asshole." Cos that's how you've
		treated me --

				KIP
		I get out of this I'm gonna fuck
		you up --

	Calitri does have to admire the stones on the kid. But. Another
	nod. Another crusher-press. Another scrunch...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Calitri -- !

	Nothing. Silence. Kip peers through the slit that the
	side window has become ... Only they are gone ... And there
	is another awful NOISE ... Kip strains to discern its
	origin ... Only he can't get the angle ...

	We can. It's a huge CRANE, tipped with a GRIPPING CLAW... It is
	maneuvered over the Trans Am... Grasps it. . . And LIFTS IT 
	INTO THE AIR ... Kip, terrified, inside ...

	And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of
	the harbor, we CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - KITCHEN

	Memphis is at the kitchen table. The list of cars before him. He's
	making notations. He gets to his feet ... He goes to check on his
	mother ... She's asleep in her room... He closes the door ...

	And goes back to the kitchen. He goes to a framed PHOTOGRAPH - of
	he and Kip. Earlier times. Happier times.

	When there is an enormous THUD! From outside. Memphis goes to a
	window. Sees a RAMP TRUCK unloading a gnarled blob of metal.
	Memphis runs outside. Just as the ramp truck drives off ...

	Memphis goes to the mangled Trans Am... Leans down ... And there's
	Kip ... Seriously smooshed in the flattened car.

				MEMPHIS
		Kip -- ?

				KIP
		Yeah ...

				MEMPHIS
		You all right -- ?

				KIP
		I think so. There's things I can't
		feel right now. Like my feet. But ...
		You think you can get me outta this,
		Memphis? I'd appreciate it -

				MEMPHIS
		Just hold-on there --

	Memphis goes to the garage ... Finds a crowbar, an acetylene
	TORCH, tin-snips ... He goes back to the wrecked car... And sets
	to work... He looks at Kip ... Shakes his head...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		So you want to run that part by me
		again about things being "all
		sweetness and light..."

				KIP
		This has nothing to do with any
		of that --

				MEMPHIS
		Oh. You maybe have more than one
		enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?

				KIP
		All my enemies own car crushers. 
		It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...

				MEMPHIS
		Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost
		there...

	Indeed... Memphis has freed him ... Kip crawls from the wreckage
	... His clothes in tatters... Blood seeps from a variety of
	contusions ... He limps ... Memphis helps him to the guest house
	...

	INT. KIP'S GUEST HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	Small, cluttered... Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant,
	Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering
	Lamborghini Espada, etc. There's a fish tank... And a big-screen
	TV, on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed
	Boston Celtic fast-break...

	Memphis sits on a ratty couch before the TV... Kip comes out of
	the bedroom... He's changed clothes ... He wears clunky fur-lined
	MOON BOOTS, leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt ... He looks
	slightly ridiculous...

	Throughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's
	seeing him for the very first time ... And waiting for the
	inevitable crack...

				MEMPHIS
		You okay -- ?

				KIP
		Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer,
		man -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Sure --

	And Kip limps toward the refrigerator ... He comes back with two
	beers ... Hands one to Memphis ... Glances at the TV --

				KIP
		you like Kobe's game? I do. You
		think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do.
		He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's
		got that going for him --

	And a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed ... Kip grabs a towel
	... Presses it to his head --

				MEMPHIS
		You sure you're okay -- ?

				KIP
		Yeah, man. Where is your beer?

	Memphis holds it up ... Kip nods ... There are a pile of IGNITIONS
	on the table ... Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip
	it...

				KIP
		Cool. So you're living up North?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah -

				KIP
		I heard you were pumping gas -

				MEMPHIS
		Something like that -

				KIP
		You're kind of cultivating a new look.

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah --

	Beat ... They watch the game ... Kip replaces the soaked towel
	with another ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Maybe you need a stitch --

				KIP
		Nah. It's a scratch.

				MEMPHIS
		Okay --

	Beat ...

				KIP
		Hey, you want something to eat ?

				MEMPHIS
		What do you got ... ?

	And Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... Limps over to the
	'fridge ... Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at
	cool ... Kip peers into the 'fridge ...

				KIP
		Not much. I got olives. You like
		olives?
		Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes
		the Calabrese. It's more mellow

	And he brings over a bowl of olives.

				MEMPHIS
		There's certainly a time and a place
		for a mellow olive -

				KIP
		Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --

	And they nibble on them. Kip bites into one ... And the juice
	stings his cracked lip ... But he disguises his grimace as an
	appreciative nod...

	And for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an
	ashtray... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		So what are you gonna do?

				KIP
		About what?

				MEMPHIS
		"About what?"

				KIP
		About Calitri? No worries, man.
		I'll call him. He's a reasonable
		dude ...

				MEMPHIS
		I can see that -

	And Memphis glances out the window. To the crushed car. Kip
	catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		You have everything ... under
		control?

				KIP
		Yeah. He just wants to know I'm
		still on it. He needs reassurance.
		All these big swinging dicks do.
		No worries. I won't let him get
		into our Kool-Aid...

	Kip shrugs ... Picks up another olive... Remembers the pain' of
	the last one... Drops it back in the bowl ... Memphis is staring
	at him, disgusted... Kip feels it ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		What happened to you?

				KIP
		What?

	And now Memphis gets to his feet ... Paces the place...

				MEMPHIS
		You just got crushed in a car. You're
		bleeding all over your self. And you
		sit there - eating olives and talking
		basketball, as if, at this very
		moment, people weren't plotting
		your demise ...

				KIP
		C'mon, man... My "demise..."
			(chuckles)
		Overreaction

				MEMPHIS
		"Over--"  You know - I can maybe
		understand, since I been gone, you
		taking up this dumb-ass life of
		crime, and for that I can partly
		blame myself. But what is baffling
		to me, is how, since I been gone,
		you've become a complete and total
		moron--

				KIP
		Hey, now -

				MEMPHIS
		He's gonna kill you -- !

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You can handle it?

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You can handle it?

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You?

				KIP
		Me.

				MEMPHIS
		You?

				KIP
		Me...

	Beat ... Hold the look ... Kip shifts in his chair ... Even this
	hurts... He tries to hide the wince ... Memphis goes to the 
	window, looks out at the harbor below... Beat ... Then:

				KIP (cont'd)
		Why? You think you can help me?

	And he turns back to Kip ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What can you do? You haven't done
		anything in six years but pump gas 
		and go overall shopping. And 
		the cars, they've changed ...
		There's new shit. Computer chip
		keys and sophisticated alarms and
		I don't think, an old guy, could much
		bypass 'em...

				MEMPHIS
		You don't think so, huh?

				KIP
		Not really ... But you know... Maybe
		I'm wrong ...

	And the brothers look at each other ... In the pale glow of the
	TV... For a long beat ... And then we'll CUT TO:

	EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - CANNERY / FISH AUCTION - DAY

	A rack of eel and OCTOPUS hung out to dry in the salty sun ...

	Memphis walks with Atley Jackson past the bustling commercial
	fishing hubbub: Portuguese FISHERMEN unloading albacore and
	bluefin from their ship's hold; Greek FISHERMEN emptying mackerel
	and halibut from their nylon trawl nets; their WOMEN gut, clean
	and fillet ...

	As they walk, Atley is selecting FISH from the various MARINERS
	... Who wrap it up for him... He places it in a leather satchel
	... Everyone seems to know him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Nicolo, how's the yellowtail today?

	An old FISHERMAN, who speaks broken English, wraps up several
	steaks...

				FISHERMAN
		Very nice, Atley. Very nice ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You can't get it any fresher than this,
		Memphis ... From the sea to my
		skillet ... Nothing in between...

				MEMPHIS
		What's with the fish thing -- ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		We can learn something from our Asian
		friends. They smoke a thousand
		cigarettes a day; they're completely
		stressed and overworked; they drink
		like, well ...

				MEMPHIS
		Fish.

				ATLEY JACKSON
		And they still have the lowest rate of
		cancer of anywhere in the world. You
		know why? All they eat is seafood.

				MEMPHIS
		Also, never underestimate the restorative
		powers of "Karaoke."

				ATLEY JACKSON
		I do a poaching number. Six-ounce
		fillets in a saucepan of brine. In
		8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn
		wedding. Plain but flavorful. And
		it's a good way to show off my
		Hollandaise sauce ...

				MEMPHIS
		You have a Hollandaise sauce ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		I do ...
			(laughs)
		Christ, what happened to us ?

				MEMPHIS
		Speak for yourself, boss I don't
		have a Hollandaise sauce

				ATLEY JACKSON
		No, but you dress like an asshole ...

	They walk...

				MEMPHIS
		I think about that night a lot...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Me, too. Every time I walk...

				MEMPHIS
		How they were just there ... Waiting on
		us ... The fix was definitely in ...

	Nothing from Atley... They walk ... Memphis looks at him.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Yeah, you know: I just. I just
		never really thanked-you. I meant
		to. I just want you to
		know...

	Memphis nods. Atley shrugs, and selects some halibut
	filets.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Tell him it's on ...

	Atley looks at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Yeah -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and
		them Tell him it's on

	Atley nods...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Any idea how you're gonna go at it?

	Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head... FADE TO BLACK.

	As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART II - BACK TO WRONG

	EXT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

	The hustle and bustle of a full-service auto restoration
	operation ...

	Dig the 157 Chevy, as an orange diamond tuck and roll with
	orange fur interior is installed... Dig the 153 Corvette
	as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils
	and airshocks ... Dig the 150 Merc, as its chrome is
	stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes
	brazed...

	All under the watchful eye of...

	OTTO HALLIWELL

	Late 60s. A feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the
	question: how the hell did they manage to rock together
	Yoda and the ghost of Walter Huston... ?

	But he remains the Zen master of cars and all that cars are, were
	and can be ...

	His mixed-breed MUTT - Hemi - licks his balls in one corner

	Otto is currently AIRBRUSHING a candy-colored, variegated DESIGN
	on the deck lid of a Camaro ... It is painstaking work ... But he
	is an artist ...

	His woman - JUNIE - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand
	dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse ...

	Memphis wanders in...

	Otto sees Memphis ... Drops his brush... He walks over to Memphis
	... Takes him in his arms ... Hugs him close... Actually waltzes
	him a few steps ...

	Memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone
	through ...

				OTTO
		Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life
		returning to bid a final farewell?
			(holds him at arm's length)
		And have my angels completely lost
		their fashion sense -- ?
			
				MEMPHIS
		Hello, Otto ...

				OTTO
		You remember Junie?

				MEMPHIS
		Of course. Hi, Junie --

				JUNIE
		Hello, Memphis -

				MEMPHIS
		What happened here -- ?

				OTTO
		Whatever do you mean?

				MEMPHIS
		The chop-shop... Where are the stripped
		cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The
		part bins?

				OTTO
		What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of
		killing them. I woke up one morning and thought
		I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of
		resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive.
		There are so few things in this life, we can
		prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't
		have to...

	He calls over to the MEXICAN MAN working on the pick-up ...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black
		acrylic lacquer before laying out the
		flames ... And fill the cab top with mylar
		flakes ... They'll sparkle like stars ...
			(turns to Memphis)
		Randall, Randall, Randall ... You look
		splendid ...

				MEMPHIS
		You, too, Otto

	And Otto goes back to the Camaro ... To finish his work...

				OTTO
		I heard rumors you were back. About
		Kip ...

				MEMPHIS
		He's gotten involved --

	Otto looks up frustrated... To Junie

				OTTO (O.S.)
		I can't concentrate. Play something, my
		sweetness; my reason to rise ...

	And Junie hits PLAY on a cassette deck ... And, instantly, ENGINE
	SOUNDS rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... Otto listens, as
	if it were a Mahler symphony...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le
		Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear
		how they got the engine up?
		Hear those exhaust notes? That's a
		very wide rev range... Here, it
		peaks at 5500 RPM...

	Memphis smiles ... These eccentricities are old hat...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		Raymond Calitri. He's amplified much
		sorrow on these streets ...

				MEMPHIS
		You think it can be done?

				OTTO
		Are you considering a comeback tour?

				MEMPHIS
		Tell me...

				OTTO
		It can be done. Take two days to shop;
		one to prep. I'll offer up my bible
		for a small fee. You also have to
		hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo
		Castlebeck's linkage so much so
		that he's setting up surveillance
		teams on every city block. And
		then get yourself a crew...

				MEMPHIS
		The hard part ...

				OTTO
		"A people is a detour of nature to
		get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then
		to get around them..." Nietzsche said
		that.

				MEMPHIS
		Is he still working here ?

				OTTO
		The old crew. Go find them. I can't
		help you with that. Since I've cleaned
		up the act a bit, they no longer come
		around... A pity how legitimacy makes
		you unpopular -

				MEMPHIS
		I Just don't know how happy they'll be
		to see me

	Otto has finished the Camaro ... He looks at Memphis --

				OTTO
		I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal.
		worst car ever built. Value job.
		Everything broke and I-fixed it.
		A coma car - built to German specs.
		Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head.
		On a quiet night, you could hear it
		rusting in the garage. But when that
		car was gone, I missed it. If it came
		driving back in here right now,
		there'd be tears and laughter ...

				MEMPHIS
		And the moral of that story is -- ?

				OTTO
		Go to them. They'll be happy to see
		you ... Ahhh...

	And he closes his eyes ... To listen to the Ferrari tape ...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		... 8.8:1 compression...

	We PRE-LAP Simon And Garfunkel's "Baby Driver" and CUT TO:

	CLOSE ON: A SIGN READING: "PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL"

	atop a moving DODGE ARIES K. Which is nearly SIDE-SWIPED by an
	oncoming PICK-UP. A MAN HOWLS IN TERROR...

	INT. DODGE - MOVING - CITY STREETS - DAY

	A timid CHINESE GIRL - JENNY, 23 - negotiates the vehicle at
	10 & 2. Riding shotgun, her howling instructor is DONNY ASTRICKY - 41,
	whom we remember from six years ago. Now he's paunchy, with Ernie
	Borgnine tough-guy-warmth. At one time, he kicked out the 
	jams. Now he teaches driver's ed...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Pull over! Pull her the hell over!

	Jenny pulls the car over in a lopsided lurch...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Put it in PARK. Remember how
		to do that? It's the big "Pff.

	She parks it. He stabs at the side-view mirror ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		"Objects May Appear Closer
		Than They Seem." Can you say
		that for me?

				JENNY
		I'm sorry.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You ain't sorry. You're a horrible
		driver... You can't strap into
		your seat belt, without almost
		getting creamed by a bus ...

	She starts to cry... Donny softens ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Aw, c'mon. It's no big deal.
		You can't drive. You can't.
		Time to acknowledge it and move on. I
		can't swim. I know I can't. So you
		know what I do? I stay the fuck outta
		the pool ...

	EXT. PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL - DAY

	Memphis waits outside ... The Aries K comes crawling toward him.
	Donny gets out of the car ... Sees Memphis ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...

				MEMPHIS
		How you doing, man?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		All I get are the Orientals. They can
		build 'em, but they can't drive
		'em So? What are you doing here?
		What's with the outfit -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		You know where the others are?

	Donny frowns... Looks close at Memphis ... Then:

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Most of 'em are gone. The Dyar Boys are
		doing a nickel at Chino; Henry Santoro
		and Frankie Fish are moving
		weight in Florida; Bill Doolin was
		killed in Denver... Atley
		Jackson's on the gimp and runnin'
		errands for Calitri; The Sphinx
		is still around, I guess ... Then
		of course, there's ...

	His pause is meaningful ...

				MEMPHIS
		Forget that ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this
		about anyways -- ?

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

	In a wood-panelled back room, around a conference table: Memphis
	and Donny sit... With the list before them...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Most of 'em are late-model...

				MEMPHIS
		That's right. Only 10 exotics ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		We'll have to start beating the
		bushes, find out where they live...

	Otto enters. Giggles...

				OTTO
		Some crew you got ...

				MEMPHIS
		If we put out the word. That we're
		crewing-up, for a one-time-only job...
		What do you think that'll yield?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick-
		up men. This ain't like the old days,
		Memphis. The profession has lost its..

				OTTO
		Dignity...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Yeah...

				MEMPHIS
		Well, the three of us don't'exactly
		inspire confidence...

	Beat ... Donny examines the list ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		I know. Weird, huh -- ?

	The door opens ... One of Otto's WORKERS is there...

				WORKER
		Otto, there's someone here to --

	But they walk past: Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, Toby, Freb

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Lookit Kip. All grown up...

				KIP
		Hey, Donny --

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				KIP
		Otto called -

	Memphis looks to Otto ... Otto shrugs ...

				OTTO
		You need him...

				MEMPHIS
		No we don't -

				OTTO
		I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis.
		But how are two washed-up thieves
		and an old man supposed to boost
		50 cars in three days...

				MEMPHIS
		His criminal career has officially come
		to a close ...

				OTTO
		The conundrum still applies, of course. The
		purpose of the endeavor is to rescue
		baby brother from imminent
		death and/or a life of crime. However.
		This cannot be successfully
		carried out without baby brother's
		considerable resources, shabby
		though they may be.

	Memphis considers ... He has little choice ...

				MEMPHIS
		We do this. Then. You're finished.
		Then. You're clean

				KIP
		I like how you wallop back in here -
		after four years - and can still get all
		Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...

				MEMPHIS
		You hear me?

				KIP
		I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll
		move to the country. Open a fruit
		stand...

	Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You guys have any skills at all?

				KIP
		Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is
		our electronics expert. He's got
		some gadgets you old farts maybe
		never -heard of; Tumbler can drive
		anything with wheels, and some
		things without; Toby's a hacker,
		can do things with a computer, that
		are pretty amazing ...

				MEMPHIS
		How old are you now, Toby?

				TOBY
		Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven
		months ...

	Memphis shakes his head... Sighs ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY 
			(re: Freb)
		What about him?

				KIP
		Freb can order pizzas like nobody's
		business

	Freb starts to Protest ... Shrugs ...

				FREB
		People gotta eat ...

	Memphis looks at all of them ... Sighs...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay, then... Otto?

				OTTO
		In order to succeed, you're going
		to have to go old-school. one night
		boost. Put all your nuts in one basket.
		And...

				TUMBLER
		One night? Are you nuts?

				MEMPHIS
		You got maybe a better plan?

	Tumbler looks to Kip...

				KIP
		You spread it out ... you move around...
		So's they can't touch you... so's they
		don't know... Shadow games and shit
		...

				MEMPHIS
		"Shadow games?"

				KIP
		Shadow games ...

				MEMPHIS
		You spread it out, by the 2nd night,
		the heat are onto you. Know
		something's up. With a one-night boost,
		by the time all the cars are reported
		stolen, your ship's set sail.

	Kip and the others nod... Makes sense ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Go on, Otto -

				OTTO
		We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to
		shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still
		going to need to expand the crew...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		There's no one left ...

				OTTO
		We've got several Italian cars on the list.
		Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So
		we're gonna need a specialist ...

	Memphis looks at him. Because that's what he was afraid of.

				MIRROR MAN 
			(to Otto)
		You know of one -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah. He's knows of one all right.

	So we'll PRE-LAP The Beach Boys' "409" and CUT TO:

	INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" SALOON - NIGHT

	A SHOT GLASS, slammed down on a bar by a surly DRUNK... In a
	mariner saloon. Drunken SAILORS and FISHERMAN and NAVY TYPES.
	Sawdust on the floor. Broken beer mirrors. A rough joint...

				DRUNK
		One more, girl -

	The BARTENDER comes over.. . She is a dark-haired, heavily 
	tattooed GIRL, 26, with the faded blue world-weariness of Roy Orbison
	song... Her name is Sara Wayland... And she goes by SWAY. She
	collects the Drunk's empty glass...

				SWAY
		I think you've had enough, Billy...

				DRUNK
		Enough? I haven't even started, girl.
		Gimme another --

				SWAY
		If you leave now, Billy, you can get
		a head-start on waking up in a pool
		of your own vomit...

				DRUNK
		Listen, you little cooze--

	And the Drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle And
	Sway grabs his hand, twists it ... The Drunk groans in agony ...
	And Sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... And
	drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... Cries of
	"Attagirl, Sway!" pepper the air ...

	EXT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" - NIGHT

	Sway tosses him... The Drunk hitting the pavement ...

				SWAY
		Come back when you've learned how to
		drink, Billy --

	And she freezes ... Because standing there, is Memphis ... She
	looks at him ... Shocked is a good place to start ...

				MEMPHIS
		See you're still stealing the sailors from
		the sea --

				SWAY
		What are you doing here?

	And she heads back inside ... And he follows her...

	INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE"

	They head toward the bar...

				SWAY
			(re: his clothes)
		What's with the look?

				MEMPHIS
		The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting
		old...

				SWAY
		You look like you lost your sheep ...

	And she hops back behind the bar ...

				MEMPHIS
		You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?

				SWAY
		Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in
		here ...

				MEMPHIS
		Buy you a drink?

				SWAY
		Nope. I got a coffee. And a
		boyfriend.

	She waves to a 30-year-old CAT drinking with his buddies. He waves
	back. Memphis frowns.

				SWAY (cont'd)
		Mitch.

				MEMPHIS
		"Mitch?"

				SWAY
		Mitch.

				MEMPHIS
		So I was replaced by Mitch?

				SWAY
		No. You were replaced by Alex.
		Who was replaced by Kevin. Who
		was replaced by Vince. Who was
		replaced by Mitch...

	She smiles sourly at him...

				MEMPHIS
		Wow. And to think all I
		accomplished these past six
		years was the "LORD OF THE
		RINGS" trilogy...

	She stares at him... Shakes her head... Busies herself with her
	glassware ... Beat ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		You look great --

				SWAY
		Yeah, well, you always were a sucker
		for flawed existences ...

	ANGLE - MITCH. Watching them talk ...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		You should leave --

				MEMPHIS
		On account of Mitch?

				SWAY
		On account of me.

	He studies her... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		I've taken the spear for a lot of
		people, Sway. Including you. Can't
		we improvise a little here ... ?

				SWAY
		No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ...
		You left me, remember?

				MEMPHIS
		I left town. I didn't leave you.

				SWAY
		A distinction worth noting ...

				MEMPHIS
		And here I am...

				SWAY
		Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on
		account of any longing-for-my-touch
		on your part -

				MEMPHIS
		Kip's in trouble

	And now she looks concerned

				SWAY
		What kind of trouble -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks.
		Only the two weeks have turned into four
		days. And not a single lady has been
		snared.

				SWAY
		And you got some Italians -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Six or seven...

				SWAY
		I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't
		for a while. I've carved out something
		for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...

				MEMPHIS
		I understand -

	And the cat - MITCH - comes over with two empty pitchers

				MITCH
		Another round, Sara -

				SWAY
		Sure, Mitch -

	And she goes to the tap ... Leaving Memphis and Mitch ...

				MITCH
		How you doing, pal?

	Memphis nods ... Beat. They sit there. Regard Sway...

				MITCH (cont'd)
		She's hot, right?

				MEMPHIS
		I'd go so far as to say "lovely."

	And Mitch leans over to him, conspiratorially ...

				MITCH
		You should her face when she's having
		sex --

	And Memphis turns to him...

				MEMPHIS
		Really?

				MITCH
		Really...

				MEMPHIS
		What's it look like?

	And Memphis reaches out, and GRABS Mitch's nipple, PINCHING.
	Mitch's face curls ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted
		face? Agonized and writhing and ugly?
		Oh, now I see it, yes, yes!

	And Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ... And Sway
	comes over ...

				SWAY
		What the hell are you doing -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		If you change your mind. We're at
		Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours.
		For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's
		life on the felt. So long now ...

	And he's out of there, before Mitch's PALS can get to him.

				MITCH
		Who was that guy, Sara?

	She looks at the door ... Shrugs ...

				SWAY
		Good question ...

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - LATER - NIGHT

	Memphis, Kip, Donny, Mirror Man and Otto sit around the garage ...
	Going through the list ... Tumbler calls from the next room:

				TUMBLER
		Freb's here. Open the gate.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
			(to Otto)
		We sent him out on a solo boost. See
		what he could do ...

	Freb pulls in an '89 Cadillac Coupe De Ville ...

				FREB
		How do I look in this one?

				MIRROR MAN
		Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		How'd it go?

				FREB
		Keys were in it ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Well, that defies the point, don't it?

				MIRROR MAN
		You should ask him how he got the name
		"Freb."

				FREB
		Shaddup, man ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Get the damn thing in there and get it
		cleaned up -

	Freb pulls in. Pops the trunk. The gate is closed.

				KIP
		This is loaded with crap - get a duffel.

	He pulls out a set of golf clubs ... Freb brings over a duffel ...
	Mirror Man plucks something from the trunk ...

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		Holy shit ...

	It's a plasticine BAG - full of a WHITE POWDER...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Lemme see that -

	He pierces the skin.. Tastes ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Heroin.

				KIP
		No shit?

	And they pull back the trunk tarp ... And there are perhaps TWO
	DOZEN similar smack-filled BAGS ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		There's gotta be a million bucks worth
		here -

				TUMBLER
		We're rich. Goddamn, we're rich!

				MEMPHIS
		Where'd you pick her up?

				FREB
		In front of one of them poker parlors in
		Chinatown ...

				MEMPHIS
		Well, take it back --

				KIP
		Take it back? What do you mean take
		it back? Are you crazy, man?


				MEMPHIS
		Take it back, Freb --

				MIRROR MAN
		Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -

	Donny makes to grab the bag from Mirror Man ... But Mirror Man
	holds on ... They tug back and forth ... The bag DROPS ...
	Splitting on the ground, behind the car. Spilling heroin.

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		Now, see what you--

	But a BANG! BANG! on the front gate, gives them all pause.

				OTTO
		Who is it -- ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (O.S.)
		Castlebeck.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.

				OTTO
		one minute -- !

	And the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and
	devices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto.

	Memphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ...
	Puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only
	there's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of
	the Caddy ... But there's no time...

	For the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What are you still doing here,
		Randall?

				MEMPHIS
		Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.

	Castlebeck looks at Otto... Otto grins... Castlebeck walks around
	the garage... Taking it all in...

	Castlebeck notes the Caddy ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What's this -- ?

				OTTO
		Cadillac.

	ANGLE - the mound of heroin on the floor ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What's wrong with it -- ?

				OTTO
		Needs brightening ...

	Castlebeck takes out a WALKIE ... Barks into it ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Run me down a tag - 329 HRO. Cadillac.

	He clicks off ... Otto and Memphis share one ... A glance to the
	smack ... Castlebeck is a mere inches from it ...

				OTTO
		No faith in our new-found goodness,
		Detective ...?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Sure. But sometimes we got to
		create some numbers. The task force
		is run by statistics, you know ...

	Before they can respond, the radio crackles ...

				RADIO (O.S.)
		329 HRO. There's no want on the license at
		this time...

	Castlebeck looks disappointed... Otto grins ... Castlebeck stares
	at the Caddy, still unconvinced...

				MEMPHIS
		You're thinking: okay, there's no want ...
		But they probably stripped its guts and
		crated 'em up, right ... ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Something like that -

	Memphis opens the driver's side door ... Gestures Castlebeck in
	... Castlebeck gets behind the wheel ...

				MEMPHIS
		Let her rip ...

	And Castlebeck starts the car...

	ANGLE - TAILPIPE ... WHOOSH! All of the heroin on the flo is blown
	away by the exhaust ... Memphis winks to Otto ... Castlebeck seems
	satisfied ... Gets out.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Okay, then. I'll catch you later,
		Randall ...

				OTTO
		Double-meaning intended, right?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Right ...

	Castlebeck stops at the gate... Turns back to them...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		It's funny. There's probably been
		five more cars stolen in the time
		I've been here ...

				MEMPHIS
		I don't think so, Detective ...

	And Castlebeck is gone. Memphis and Otto exhale big time.. The
	others come out from the back... To find Memphis and Otto dumping
	the heroin into the sink, running the tap ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Take her back to where you found her,
		Freb --

	INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Kip is in front of the TV, playing a video game. Helen Raines is
	at the kitchen table, going through a PHOTO ALBUM... Memphis comes
	home ... Hangs up his coat ...

				MEMPHIS
		Hey -

	He kisses her head ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Kip -

	Kip nods ... Plays on ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		What do you got there?

				HELEN RAINES
		The photo album. I get nostalgic around
		this time of year ...

				MEMPHIS
		What time of year?

				HELEN RAINES
		Tuesdays ...

	He smiles ... Sits down next to her ... They go through the

	PHOTOS: - childhood shots of Memphis and Kip, a younger Helen;
	Memphis at 17, in his "Ike's Garage" coveralls; 14year-old
	Memphis, an infant Kip, and their father (ROBERT RAINES) a MAN
	with bright eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old Cutlass
	442; Robert Raines ... Outside a car dealership. We can almost
	feel his strong, sure presence ...

	Memphis looks at his mother ... As she looks at the picture.

				MEMPHIS
		You ever wonder what things'd be like
		if he hadn't died?

				HELEN RAINES
		Every day. I wonder about that every day...

				MEMPHIS
		Kip and I'd probably be working at the
		dealership...
			(to Kip)
		Imagine us selling cars?

	Nothing from Kip ... Eyes glued to the TV... Memphis glances to
	his Mother ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Imagine that -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
			(salesman voice)
		And just in case you lose your keys, good
		sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim,
		free of charge ...

				MEMPHIS
		Mother -- !

	They laugh ... Look at the album ... At Robert Raines ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		I remember, every day, he'd come home
		in a different car.
		That was the greatest thing ... And
		we'd climb all over it ... Examine
		every inch of every different
		car ...

				HELEN RAINES
		I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you
		two are out there heads under hoods ...

				MEMPHIS
		You remember that, Kip?

				KIP
		I was six ...

	Memphis and Helen look at him... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		After he died ... I think that's
		what I missed most of all ... That
		there was no different cars every night ...
		When I started hanging around Otto's ...
		And he started showing me the things ...
		It was a way to kill two birds ...
		Put food on the table for you and Kip ...
		And ... Ride in different cars every
		night ... Just like when Dad was here.

	Tears stand in Helen's eyes ... Kip gets to his feet ...

				KIP
		Ancient history's two things.
		"Ancient." And "history!"

	And he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. Memphis
	turns to his mother ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma.

				HELEN RAINES 
		I know...

				MEMPHIS
		We do it. He'll get clear Once and
		for all 

	And she nods ...

	ANGLE - A PHOTO. Robert Raines. Smiling beside an Olds 98.

	EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS HIGH RISE CONDOS - DAY

	The garage door opens as a resident drives out ... And Memphis and
	Donny and Kip and Toby enter the garage ... They walk along the 
	rows of parked cars ... Searching ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost.
		No skill. No finesse. Can only take
		the car if the key is in it. That's
		not thieving. That's parking ...
		Thugs ... With the decency of dirt ...

				TOBY
		They're just cars, man ...

	To prevent Donny from biting the kid's head off, Memphis chimes in
	with:

				MEMPHIS
		This Eleanor's been living at the
		International Towers for 3 years now.

				TOBY
		Who's "Eleanor?"

				MEMPHIS
		The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.

				TOBY
		Why do you call it "Eleanor?"

				MEMPHIS
		All the vehicles get code names.
		Female names. You say "Eleanor lives
		at such and such... " and no one
		listening on the waves is the wiser ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."

				MEMPHIS
		And there she is --

	Indeed, slotted nearby is a '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 Silver with
	black top ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Hello, Eleanor --

	And he looks at her. An old friend he hasn't seen in years.

				TOBY
		It looks just like a regular Mustang --

				KIP
		Don't go there, Toby --

				MEMPHIS
		She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the
		Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine
		and got it legally rated for the street
		at 450 horsepower ... But its actual
		output is closer to 600 ...

				TOBY
		So she flies -

				MEMPHIS
		She soars -

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Grade-A unicorn ...

				TOBY
		What's a "unicorn?"

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Fabled creature. You know - the horse
		with the horn? Impossible to capture?

	Toby looks blank ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		We all got one. The single car
		that, no matter how many times
		you try to boost, something happens...
		Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner
		comes back. It's voodoo...

				TOBY
		You guys and the car thing, man --

	They head off ... Memphis turns back to the Shelby

				MEMPHIS
		See you in a few days, Eleanor --

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - BACK ROOM - DAY

	To Queen's "I'm In Love With My Car." The crew is at work, a MAZDA
	and a CADDY are parked here for practice: Tumbler is modifying a
	series of slim jims, based on the type of cars they'll be after

	Donny and Freb are in the Caddy, Freb behind the wheel Tumbler
	puts together BRIEFCASES, containing the requisite TOOLS: slim-
	jim, gizmo, screwdriver, ratchet, dent-puller, a mini-battery with
	pointy leads ...

	- Mirror Man is showing off one of his GADGETS - beepersized
	DEVICE - to Otto... They stand before a locked MAZDA.

				MIRROR MAN
		And you just stick it in the lock.
		Hit this little button ... And ...

	He does ... The door UNLOCKS ... The car's ALARM gives a weak
	chirp and dies... Otto looks at Donny ...

				OTTO
		We're dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit ...
			(to Mirror Man)
		Can I try -- ?

				MIRROR MAN
		Knock yourself out --

	Kip and Memphis are with Toby, who has his laptop out ...

				TOBY
		I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site,
		right? Then I monitored their
		incoming outside data requests,
		right? Then I got these ISDN numbers,
		right? Then I tracked them back,
		right? Then I took the one I could
		jack-up the easiest, right? Then I
		called back see, they think I'm an
		insurance company - that's where it
		looks like I'm coming from -- and
		they're sharing stats with this
		insurance company, right? So now
		they're sharing it with me, right?
		They think I'm looking for stats for
		an actuarial conference on auto-theft.
		So they let me in, right? Give me all
		these numbers. But then I don't leave,
		right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I
		just go anywhere I want.

				MEMPHIS
		So what's in there -- ?

				TOBY
		I can tell you who's gonna be on duty
		tonight. I can tell you how much gas
		they're using monthly. I can tell you
		how they used to spend that annoying
		half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...

	Memphis nods ... Fairly impressed...

				KIP
		Good work, Toby --

	Donny and Freb are inside the Caddy ... Freb's attempts to start
	it fail...

				FREB
		It just ain't happening --

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You'll get the hang of it, kid. You
		just need to remember one thing -

				FREB
		What's that?

	Donny smiles ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		On boost night? Always take along a
		good mix tape ...

	Donny smiles ... Freb frowns ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		You bring a woman back to your
		crib for some lovemaking, the
		song you put on, depends on the
		woman, the type of lovemaking you
		intend to do, right?

				FREB
		I guess ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You got a school teacher or Nancy from
		accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone
		or James Brown. You put on
		Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got
		some wild one you just picked
		up at the track, you wouldn't put on
		Cat Stevens or James Taylor.
		You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes.
		Or, if you really wanted to
		get after it: Miles.

				FREB
		okay ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		It's the same way with cars. Different
		cars. Different tunes. You can't steal
		a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You
		gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny
		Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that
		shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman
		Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could
		lead to disaster. Got it... ?

				FREB
			(absolutely hasn't got it)
		Got it ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Good.

	And then Sway enters ... Donny gets out of the Caddy ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Whoa, whoa, whoa. Memphis went out
		and got some big game ... Hello, Sway.
		I was just telling the lads about mix
		tapes --

				SWAY
			(to Freb)
		Janis Joplin. Billie Holliday. Ella
		Fitzgerald...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Gender bias ...

	Otto is before her ... Bowing from the waist ...

				OTTO
		I've missed you, Sara Wayland --

				SWAY
		Good to see ya, Otto --

	They embrace. Memphis and Kip enter from the other room...

				KIP
		How ya doing, Sway -- ?

				SWAY
		Kip...

	She looks at Memphis ... Small nod... Small smile ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		What do you think about all this?

				SWAY
		Stick it in the drawer marked "Fool's
		Errand", right -- ?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		That's my girl --

				MEMPHIS
		That's Mirror Man ... And that's
		Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ...
		Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They
		call her "Sway."

				SWAY
		Hey -

	But the kids look high near thunderstruck ... The others laugh ...
	Go back to their work ... Memphis and Sway

				SWAY (cont'd)
		No questions. I'm here. I need the
		dough.

				MEMPHIS
		Of course ...

	She studies him... Nods ...

				SWAY
		Good. Just so we understand...

	And then she sees something at the entrance ...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		Oh, shit. You didn't --

	He follows her gaze ... To where -- A MAN, early 40s, has walked
	in. Tall, gaunt, ice-eyed. This man never speaks. And his nose is
	a gnarled blob of scar tissue ... Which is why they call him

	THE SPHINX

	And the others really don't dig his scene ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Well, well, well. The original crash
		test dummy...

	The Sphinx nods to all. Smiles warmly, but it comes out creepy.
	Freb whispers to Otto ...

				FREB
		Who's that -- ?

				OTTO
		That's The Sphinx.

				FREB 
		The Sphinx?

				OTTO
		He never says a word. And he's got
		a messed-up nose. Hence. The Sphinx.
		He's boo-koo koo-koo. But he steals like
		time ...
			(to The Sphinx)
		Hello, Sphinxy, old rum -- !

	And Otto embraces the taller man ... And the others stand
	around, offering uneasy glances to The Sphinx ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday.
		D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us
		two days to prep ... We're going to find
		the ladies on our list, find out where
		they live, when they're home; that
		they're properly insured ... Let's get
		into the vans --

				MIRROR MAN
		Where we going -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		We're going shopping -- !

	We PRE-LAP Gary Numan's new-wave rave classic "Cars".

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREETS - DAY

	A MONTAGE of the hard-core old-school preparations...

	THREE MINI-VANS drive off from Otto's Auto - Mirror Man at the
	wheel of one of them - The Sphinx and Donny with him... - Freb
	drives the 2nd van: Memphis, Sway, and Kip with him... Tumbler
	drives the 3rd van: Otto and Toby with him.

	They carry pens and NOTEBOOKS ... And, as they drive around,
	they're searching out cars ... When they see an auto that
	corresponds to the list, they take down its license plate.

	Memphis dials the cell ... Mirror Man answers on the speaker in
	his van ... Tumbler in his ... We'll CROSS-CUT the scene as
	necessary from van to van ...

				MEMPHIS
		How's it going -- ?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		It's arright ...

	They drive on ... Till --

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Check it out: 173 Firebird. Know
		who drove one of those ... ?

				OTTO
		Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in
		McO...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		That's being obscurest ... Who else?
		Better known. Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.

				MIRROR MAN
		For real?

	As the scenes in the vans play out - we should be INTERCUTTING

	with SHOTS of CARS ON THE STREET. LICENSE PLATES. Their NOTEBOOKS.
	As license #s are written down.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...

				KIP
		Peugot convertible ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		What color?

				KIP
		Gray.

				FREB
		How you know that?

				KIP
		Remember who my brother is?

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - BACK ROOM

	Sway has drawn an intricate CHART on a vinyl DRAWING BOARD: 1-50,
	each car is annotated, ie: 1) '56 Ford T-Bird; 2) 188 Lamborghini
	Countach, etc. She begins ascribing names to them, Female names.
	With Magic Marker. Easy to erase.

	INT. REGISTRY OF MOTOR VEHICLES - DAY

	Donny enters with a sheaf of PAPERS ... He waits in line ...

	EXT. JIMMY'S HARBORSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Mirror Man has hired on as a VALET ... DINERS pull up in their
	cars ... Mirror Man offers the DRIVER of a Porsche Boxster a
	ticket ... And climbs in, to park the car ...

	INT. OTTO'S BACK ROOM

	Sway writes #2-4) Porsche Boxster and next to it PATRICIA 1

	INT. THE VANS

	As they drive around... Still searching and quizzing...

				OTTO
		DUKES OF HAZARD?

				MIRROR MAN
		Fuck that cracker shit --

				TUMBLER
		I know that one. General Lee, I
		believe, was a ... Dodge Charger ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You ever notice how it had a different
		interior every week? That bugged me.

	INT. REGISTRY - DAY

	Donny offers the REGISTRY WOMAN a LIST of several cars from the

		It'll take me about 15 minutes.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		I can wait.

	He smiles kindly at her. And takes a seat. It's that easy.

	Sway at the board... A grouping of three Mercedes Benz S320 are

	Otto shows Freb how to disarm an alarm system by groundingout a
	tail-light with a wire to a mini-battery...

	This dead-shorts the lights, shorts-out the alarm system, which

	locks pop open ... Otto grins...

	EXT. JIMMY'S HARBORSIDE - NIGHT

	Mirror Man in the Boxster... Parked, . He takes the KEY from
	the ignition ... And then takes, from under his jacket - a KEY

	INT. THE VANS - MOVING

	Shop and talk, part III ...

				FREB
		Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?

				KIP
		Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a
		gimme ...

				OTTO
		Yes, but what was on the license
		plate?

				MIRROR MAN
		The license plate?

				TUMBLER
		I know. "ROBIN 1."

				OTTO
		Very good. But what was the
		significance of "ROBIN 1"?

				FREB
		Was that his first name?

				OTTO
		His first name was Thomas. Thomas
		Magnum...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Thomas Sullivan Magnum, to be exact.

	They look at Donny, impressed...

				TUMBLER
		Robin 1 ...

				MIRROR MAN
		I know! Robin was the name of that
		faggy guy who hung with him...

				KIP
		No. That was Higgins ....

				DONNY ASTRICKY

	INT. THE VANS - MOVING

	One more time ...

				OTTO
		Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on
		Magnum's license plate? Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the
		estate they lived on ...

				OTTO
		Ten points for our fearless leader ...
		Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of
		the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?

				SWAY
		I don't know that

				KIP
		Stumped -- !

				FREB
		Thank-God, Sway, you ain't all freaky-
		deaky, too

	But Sway grins

				SWAY
		How about: a Corvette in
		MAGICIAN; a Ford pick-up truck in
		INCREDIZLE HULK, and...

				OTTO
		Here's where it gets tricky ...

				SWAY
		... he walked in THE COURTSHIP OF
		EDDIE'S FATHER.

	Kip high-fives her... Freb looks disappointed...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Walked like a bastard... Skippin'
		stones and shit..

				OTTO
		That's a good one, Donny...

				DONNY ASTRICKY

	Biggy. Puff Daddy ... Making a mix tape... END MONTAGE.

	INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

	A garage dealing exclusively in imports. Memphis enters...

				MEMPHIS
		Hello -- ?

	Sway slides out from beneath a Testarosa ... In her greasy
	coveralls, hair tied back, a motorhead's dream girl ...

				SWAY
		Hey.

				MEMPHIS
		What's wrong with her -- ?

				SWAY
		The right side of the engine is
		running richer than the left. And the
		scope isn't showing shit... I dunno... 

	And she goes to the sink...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		You know Annie's trouble

				MEMPHIS
		Annie -- ?



				SWAY
		You haven't been studying --

	She gestures to where the LIST of 50 is on the counter.

				SWAY (cont'd)
		137 Roadster. Custom. Lives at 1443
		Locklin in Rancho Palos Verdes ...

				MEMPHIS
		Right. Great car. One of a kind. I
		was looking forward to that boost
		myself 

				SWAY
		She was the only "Annie" you could find?

				MEMPHIS
		They only made a handful. We're lucky
		there's even one living in the area...

				SWAY
		Yeah, well ... She lives with District
		Court Judge Seymour Croft ...

	As she speaks we CUT TO:

	EXT. 1443 LOCKLIN - RANCHO PALOS VERDES - DAY

	A massive house of glass and steel in a fancy
	neighborhood. We MOVE FOR THE HOUSE. Over the fine-trimmed
	lawn.

				SWAY (O.S.)
		... and he keeps "Annie' in his
		living room... Like a work of art ...

	INTO THE SPARTAN LIVING ROOM...

	Massive framed Lichtenstein and Haring pieces on the wall
	... Surround the yellow ROADSTER, which sits up on a
	platform ... Check out JUDGE CROFT, a nasty fat man in his
	late 50s ... He sits in the nearly empty room... A complex
	system of directional lighting illuminates the Roadster
	...

				SWAY (O.S.)
		She's got 27 miles on her o-dom.
		Which is exactly how far away the
		custom shop was in 1979 when he
		bought her... He drove her home,
		never drove her again ...

	The judge gazes at the car, admiring its jet-pod
	taillamps... A MAID comes in with a tray of tea service
	... The maid crosses the Judge's line of sight... Watch
	as he curses her out, his face going beet red with fury...

				SWAY (O.S.)
		The man's a freak...

	INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS

	Sway looks at Memphis ...

				SWAY
		She's trouble --

				MEMPHIS
		I put the boys on it. They're clever
		that way...

	She nods ... Long look ...

				SWAY
		I go with you --

				MEMPHIS
		That what you want?

				SWAY
		That's what I want ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay.

	She hits the Lava soap and starts washing the grease from her
	hands ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		I missed you, you know -

				SWAY
		You mentioned that in your letters 

				MEMPHIS
		I always thought you'd follow me up.

	She shuts off the taps ... Towels her hands...

				SWAY
		We were good when you bailed, weren't we?

				MEMPHIS
		Very good...

				SWAY
		Cos there were those dark days, when
		I figured - my God, how easy it was
		for him to just give it up; to make the
		deal; take the rot for the whole crew ...
		And give me up in the process.

				MEMPHIS
		No way ...

				SWAY
		No ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		No ...

	And he holds out a hand to her ... And she puts her greasesmeared
	towel into it ...

				SWAY
		Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me,
		Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and
		you're the jim that did the leaving. So
		save the sanctimonious shit for someone
		who believes. The only reason I ride with
		you, is cause I don't want to spend the
		whole night with any of them other creeps!

				MEMPHIS
		Oh. Okay. Right.

	EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

	Memphis walks out... Going over to the PARKED CAR across the
	street ... Castlebeck...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm on the move -

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Your girl works in there ...

				MEMPHIS 
		Not my girl anymore

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Yet your still here ... I gave
		you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...

				MEMPHIS
		What do you want from me?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Honestly? I want to - once every
		few months - get into my car. Pack
		a lunch. And drive on up to Chino.
		On visiting day. Bring you some
		magazines. Maybe some almond clusters.
		And see you all bright and shiny in
		your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...

	And with that, he starts his car ... Drives off... Memphis gazing
	after him...

	INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

	Memphis drives. Kip beside him. They drive in silence. At last
	coming to:

	EXT. TEN-TON TRANSFER COMPANY - FRONT GATES

	A huge trucking company warehouse. Kip gets out. Bolt-cuts the
	chain-fence out front.

	And Memphis drives on in, passing the long rows of gargantuan
	CAR CARRIERS here. He picks one ...

				MEMPHIS
		This one ...

	He slim-jims the door ... But the ALARM goes off ... A wild
	whooping alarm ... Deafening... Try as he might, he can't get it
	off. He pops the trunk. Looks for wires ... Nothing.

	Then, at once, it goes off. Memphis turns. Kip is there. He holds
	a little DEVICE.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		What's that thing -- ?

				KIP
		Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little
		something the R & D department came up with ...

				MEMPHIS
		How long were you gonna let me try and
		stop it...?

				KIP
		After a while, it became a little pathetic ...
		Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...

				MEMPHIS
		Thank-you ...

				KIP
		De nada ...

	He gets behind the wheel. Pops the ignition. The truck's flipping
	stack belches. Memphis climbs in next to him.

				MEMPHIS
		Ain't we good-timing here ... ?

				KIP
		The family that steals together, deals
		together...

				MEMPHIS
		Dad'd be proud --

				KIP
		Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...

				MEMPHIS
		What era was that -- ?

				KIP
		The era when crime didn't pay --

				MEMPHIS
		As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?

				KIP
		Price of doing business...

				MEMPHIS
		What about just getting a job, 9 to 5,
		five days a week, that whole mystery
		achievement -- ?

				KIP
		It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows,
		Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we
		make mad bank, my boys are down, the
		girlies come around and the boosts are
		a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get
		jacked-up every now and then - but ain't
		that a small price to pay for never,
		never-ever, having to say "paper or
		plastic?"

	And he grins and puts the truck into gear. And off they go

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - GARAGE - NIGHT

	The Replacements chime in with "Someone Take The Wheel." Memphis
	and the crew ... All but Sway are present.

	Tumbler and Mirror Man follow Memphis to one side of the shop ...
	To a window ... He gestures outside to where we see and UNMARKED
	CAR and the orange glow of two cigarettes ... Staking them out ...

				MEMPHIS
		We've got to shake them tomorrow
		night. I'm making that your problem.
		That's called delegation of duties.
		You like it -- ?

	Mirror Man and Tumbler regard the cops ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Sure, man --

	And they follow him back into the garage ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each
		team has been assigned their ladies.
		The teams are: me and Sway. Donny
		and Freb. Kip and Tumbler. Mirror
		Man, you and The Sphinx ... 

	Mirror Man looks horrified ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Aw, c'mon, man ...

	The Sphinx grins at him...

				TOBY
		What about me?

				MEMPHIS
		You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto
		abreast of our progress ...

				TOBY 
		How come ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		Because you should be home with
		Nintendo, listening to The Spice
		Girls, little man ...

				TOBY
		Come on. Kip, talk to the guy

				KIP
		There's no talkin' to him --

	And Otto and Junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some
	paper cups ...

				OTTO
			(cup raised)
		To a safe and successful session of bumping
		fenders and trading paint.

	Everyone toasts ... Drinks ... Donny goes to the tape deck... Hits
	PLAY ... And "Little Deuce Coupe" by The Beach Boys BLASTS.
	("Little Deuce Coupe/You don't know what I got...")

	And all of our guys dance to it ... Singing along ... Otto dances 
	with Junie; Tumbler with Toby; even The Sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto
	parts ...

				BEACH BOYS 
		"Well, I'm not braggin,' babe So don't put
		me down But I got the fastest set of wheels
		in town, etc."

	Yes, it's the requisite rock-to-an-oldie bit ... But God, it's
	fun. As they exorcise some pre-boost jitters.  Only Kip stands
	aside from the frolic ... We watch them dance and laugh and sing
	for a bit ...

	And then Atley Jackson is there. And behind him, another Calitri
	GOON... And, finally, Calitri himself stands there.
	Someone kills the music. They all look at him... Donny and The
	Sphinx nod to Atley ...

				CALITRI
		This is how you're spending my time?
		Having a sock hop?

				MEMPHIS
		Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the
		community ...

				CALITRI
		Look at this. A multi-generational gathering
		of scumbags ...

				OTTO
		So saith the God of Scumbags --

				CALITRI
		Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no
		cars have yet to be delivered. And there's
		only one more night ...

				OTTO
		Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I
		wonder, if delivery isn't made?

	Calitri ignores him... Looks at Kip ...

				CALITRI
		With all the free time I've had not
		counting cars as they're loaded onto
		my ship, I've managed to sand the
		cedar inside your box, Kip. This 
		will protect you from the anaerobic
		bacteria, that normally thrives in
		an airless; environment. Thus
		prolonging decay ...

	He smiles ... And Kip actually makes a run for him... Only to be
	held back by Tumbler and Donny ...

				MEMPHIS
		Get out of here, Ray --

				CALITRI
		One more night --

				MEMPHIS
		Get out --

				CALITRI
		I hope you know what you're doing. God help
		you if you don't ...

	And with that, he leaves, his goons following. Leaving our

	crew to stare after him ... And then we FADE TO BLACK...

	As a SUPER on-screen reads PART III: SWITCHIN'-TO-GLIDE

		What are you doing?

				TUMBLER
		Watch and learn, old-timer --

	As Mirror Man points the antennae out the window ... A TOY CAR - a
	1970 HEMI 'CUDA replica ... Radio-operated, the car speeds along
	the curb outside, using parked cars as cover... She really cooks...

				DONNY
		The hell are you doing?

				MIRROR MAN
		Delivering ordnance. Y2K-style.

	ANGLE - THE 'CUDA. As it cruises along. Is stopped by a discarded
	40 oz. empty... But Mirror Man maneuvers and its back on track ...
	At last, parking jammed up to the front, right tire of DRYCOFF AND
	HAWKINGS' UNMARKED.

				TUMBLER
		The Hemi Has Landed --

				DONNY
		Big deal. Now what?

				MIRROR MAN
		What we call: fun and shit.

	And he hits a button on his radio control ... ANGLE - the model
	'Cuda. Wedged in front of the tire. As a quartet of thin steel,
	razor-tipped SPIKES thrust out from the Shaker hood ... A fraction
	away from the tire's skin ... Mirror Man and Tumbler appear
	satisfied ...

				TUMBLER
		We can go now --

	INT. JUDGE CROFT'S GLASS HOUSE - DAY

				TOBY (cont'd)
		Where should we put him?

				KIP
		He's a Judge. He'll only bite for

		I got a message. I live at 1443

	They all wait, anxious ... Dressed for their night ... And then

	Memphis Raines returns...

		Yeah.

	Moves for Diane 1 ...

	INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Helen Raines is rooting through a crowded closet. At last she
	finds what she's looking for ... A small black boxy DEVICE. She
	goes to the living room. Plugs in the box ...

	It is a POLICE SCANNER... And it immediately starts to pop and caw
	... Helen sits down ... And listens... Her face clenched with
	worry ...

	EXT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Mirror Man works the thick steel door ... He's got a sledge and
	center punch... He knocks the knob off with the sledge and then
	goes to work with an ELECTRIC DRILL ...

				MIRROR MAN
		This is some state-of-the-art shit,
		kid. The drill breaks the sockets,
		which force back the spindle and release
		the lock ...only it doesn't seem to be
		working... And The Sphinx is getting
		impatient ...

	INT. MEMPHIS' VAN - MOVING

	Memphis and Sway... They ride in silence ... She busies herself by
	looking through the consul. Comes up with a tube of LIPSTICK. Uses
	the visor mirror to apply it.

				MEMPHIS
		Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush,
		floral-print dresses?

				SWAY
		Deodorant.

	And she looks at him... She's really laid the lipstick on
	thick ... But it's oddly effective ...

				MEMPHIS
		Wow. Bozo, the very sexy clown --

	Beat. She looks out the window, throws the following away.

				SWAY
		So, you seeing anybody?

				MEMPHIS
		No. I had a girl. She was great. The
		problem is: great girls come along once
		every ten years. So I gotta wait
		another three years before I can even
		bother to look...

				SWAY
		She was so great, why'd you leave her?

				MEMPHIS
		Her parole officer strongly recommended 
		it ...

	She looks at him... But he's stopped the car... For Kip and
	Tumbler are waiting at the side of the street. They get in.

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - NIGHT

	Freb dead-shorts the alarm system, grounding it out on the car's
	own metal surface, just like they taught him... He's in the
	Porsche ... It's just that he can't figure out how to get her
	started ... The passenger door opens ... Donny...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		What's the matter?

				FREB
		It's all microchips and shit ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Yeah?

	He holds up a screwdriver. Jams it in the steering column.

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		I don't care what kind of car
		it is. How fancy; how expensive;
		how new. You pop the collar -
		it's 1966 all over again ... !

	He pops the collar - exposing an ordinary ignition system.

		Cool ...

	INT. MEMPHIS' VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

	Memphis drives ... Sway, Kip, Tumbler with him...

	Memphis looks at him in the rear-view ...

				MEMPHIS
		Having fun, Kip?

				KIP
		Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...
			(realizes his gaffe)
		I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary,
		it sucks ...

	Memphis looks at Sway, shakes his head... Kills the lights ... And
	they pull in to

	EXT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Where Mirror Man is still struggling with the lock, his drills
	and punches, scattered about ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Just give me another --

	only The Sphinx shoves him aside ... Pulls the GUN from his 
	holster and BLANG! blasts open the lock...

	Mirror Man stares at the opened door ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Oh, I get it: old school.

	And Memphis and the others drive up ...

				MEMPHIS
		How's it going?

				MIRROR MAN
		It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are
		swapping trade secrets ...

	And in they go --

	INT. WAREHOUSE

	Dark as pitch. Flashlights come on. To reveal

	ROW UPON ROW OF GLEAMING FERRARIS

	Old and new models. Daytonas and Boxers and Dinos and
	Testarossas. There must be at least fifty of them here.

	Flashlight beams dance over car after car. It's a treasure chest
	of automotive jewels ... All of our heroes are in awe. And then a
	soft whimpering. They turn. To see Sway, overcome with emotion.

				SWAY
		It's just... so... beautiful ...

	And it is Kip that puts an arm around her ... She sobs into his
	chest ... Never taking her eyes from the array of Italian grace
	... Indeed, they are all in something of trance. Memphis is the
	first one out --

				MEMPHIS
		C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can
		you prep 'em -- ?

				SWAY
		I think so... They're just... So ...

				MEMPHIS
		I know. But let's prep 'em. We could
		stay here all night... That wouldn't

	The others are still gazing ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Let's go, people --

	And they set to work...

	EXT. NIGHT CLUB PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Donny Astricky and Freb have accessed a '61 Jag... Watch as Donny
	takes out 3 screws in the Jag's ignition and removes the whole
	thing ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		So? Tell me: how come they call you
		"Freb" anyways -- ?

				FREB
		C'mon, man ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		We're partners here --

	Freb considers ... Then, reluctantly --

				FREB
		My names "Fred." You know: Frederick?
		One drunk night, I decided to give
		myself a tattoo. Hot needle it. I
		used a mirror to guide me ...

	And he pulls up his sleeve - to show the blue "FREB" tattooed
	there ...

				FREB (cont'd)
		The mirror messed me up with the "b" and
		the "d"... Everything's reversed, you
		know? Now, I'm "Freb."

	Donny chooses from a selection of IGNITIONS he's brought along.
	Finds the right one ... Installs it ... Tightens the 3 screws ...
	Starts the car with his own key ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Glad to know you, "Freberick." Let's
		roll -

	And off they go ...

	INT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE

	Sway sets to prepping the cars ... The others wait nearby. Memphis
	walks over to where Kip sits ...

		You okay -- ?

				KIP
		I'm cool.

	Memphis looks at his watch...

				KIP (cont'd)
		We gonna make it?

				MEMPHIS
		Too early to tell. Nervous?

				KIP
		Nah.

				MEMPHIS
		That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous.
		Everyone's nervous. But not you...

				KIP
		I dunno. Whatever will be will be...

				MEMPHIS
		That's a good attitude, Kip. For
		everything but stealing cars ...

	Before Kip can respond, the signature throaty ROAR of Ferrari
	fills the room, as Sway's got one started --

		Hello, Tracy...

	Except that a MAN comes out of the house ... Mid-20s, silk shirt,

		Oooh. "Snake." Tough guy. "Snake."
		Homeboy wants you to call him: Snaake-!

	They crack up ... Size her ...

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		No whistles ... That's weird...

	He shrugs ... They slim-jim her "beetle-wing" articulated door ...
	Climb in ... The Sphinx starts her up ... Mirror Ma gets in beside
	him... The seats are sooo low ...

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		This shit's on point. Check it: 200.

	He gestures to the speedometer ... Calibrated to 200 MPH..

		Halfway there, we switch. I drive.

		Say goodbye to your ride, Snake...

	After a beat, a WOMAN comes out ... She gets into the car.

				SWAY
		It's 1:30 on a Tuesday. Is that any

	The Sphinx drives ... Mirror Man pops in his tape ... Albert
	King's "Drivin' Wheel."

				MIRROR MAN
		That's what I'm talkin' about -- !

	He boogies down. The Sphinx is bewitched, awed by the car's
	magnificent power. But then Mirror Man SCREAMS -- ! With pure
	terror. For, at his feet, wrapped around his legs, is

	A BOA CONSTRICTOR - some 8-feet long... A mass of heavilykeeled
	scales shimmering on coiled muscle ... Mirror Man screams on and 
	on...

	The Sphinx swerves wildly... Racing through a red light. Barely
	missing an on-coming BUS ... Passing a pair of COPS coming out of
	a 7-11. They hop into their unit. Give chase.

	EXT. NEWPORT BEACH - THE MASERATI

	The Persian man and his date ... Mackin' hard... Behind them
	Memphis and Sway wait in the Mazda. Memphis is on the cell

		Man, they're going at it

	Long beat ... He looks at her ...

				MEMPHIS
		What about you?

	She looks at him... Shrugs...

				SWAY
		You remember my Gramma? Yeah. I was
		thinking. If she were alive. And she
		asked me. If she came down, right now.
		Asked me. "What do you do, Sara?
		What's your life?" Innocently.
		Nonjudgemental. I think it would break
		her heart if I said I was a thief. I
		steal cars, Gramma. And even though,
		hey, I learned it all from her son.
		My Uncle Eddie. Who taught me the basics. 
		Which you refined. (You remember Randall,
		Gramma? You thought he was neat. Well,
		he refined the basics ... ). I don't
		think that's what she hoped for me...

	She looks at him ...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		But ... That said... Car thieves are my
		weakness ... It's all so terribly Loretta
		Lynn or something, I know... But ... I
		don't wanna be a thief anymore ... I don't
		wanna love a thief anymore ... I want to
		wear a dress maybe once in a while... Maybe
		have a kid... Watch a lot of Audrey Hepburn
		movies.. And think about my Gramma without
		also thinking "shame on me. Shame on
		me. Shame on me... "

	at first ... Then... With urgency...

		Stop. What about Maserati Boy?

				MEMPHIS

		Oh, God...

	And yes, this is patently absurd. But it's also oddly sexy.

		Let me worry about The Club ...

		Know not to get on it ... Momentum
		shift ... Don't get on those brakes

		Up.

	Back arched... A small moan escapes her ... Prince wails ... And
	Sway has achieved whatever kind of silly climax they aspired to
	here... She flops back down... Looks at him...

				SWAY
		You're still quite the boost, Randall
		Raines ...
			(he shrugs)
		Except now I've been chopped, and my

		to church in South America by some
		Bolivian consulate's wife ...

	Indeed, the girl has gotten out of the Maserati... And the car has

	PATROL CAR glides by them...

				TUMBLER
		Gettin' fancy... Got their own palace
		guard -

	When, from the back of the Jeep:

				TOBY
		I never been to the suburbs ...

	Toby is there ... Having stowed-away...

				TUMBLER
		What are you doing here, assface?

				TOBY
		Checkin' it out

	He smiles at Kip ... Kip looks at Tumbler ... Drives ... At last,
	pulling up to one HOUSE where the '98 Benz - "'Carol" lives. Kip
	parks, a half block down ... They get out ... Head for the
	house...

	And there she is. "Carol." Obsidian black. In the
	garage. The garage is open. And THREE KIDS, two boys and a
	girl. Late teens. They are standing around "Carol"...
	Drinking beer... Listening to the new Beck album on the
	car's CD player ... The folks clearly out of town ...

	Well-scrubbed, white suburban children of plenty ... The only crew
	they've ever run in is J. Crew... From the hedge, Kip, Tumbler and
	Toby watch the kids ... With equal parts fascination, loathing,
	envy... And then, the kids go inside... Leaving "Carol" exposed...

				TOBY
		I got this one...

	And before the others can respond, he moves for her. And she's
	open... Toby's in ... Butterfly popped - Gizmo in. The others start
	to get in when ONE OF THE KIDS comes out from the house. He stares
	at Toby, who freezes mid-boost ...

				KIP (cont'd)
			(whispered hiss)
		Get her started, man -- !

	And Toby does... And slams her in reverse.  And they're off

	INT. WAREHOUSE -LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	The group - - Memphis, Sway, Freb, Mirror Man, and The Sphinx
	- has returned... The final cars loaded onto the ship ...
	Memphis looks out into the night --

				MEMPHIS
		C'mon, Kip -

	EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREETS - "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT

	Toby drives them out, Kip shotgun, Tumbler in the back. But the
	suburbs are confusing. They can't find their way out.

				TOBY
		Which way's out, man -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Shit all looks the same here --

	They drive. Only up ahead, blocking the street, LIGHTS blinding...
	Are TWO SECURITY PATROL CARS - SECURITY COPS on the strong ...
	Guns drawn...

				KIP
		Shit ...

				TUMBLER
		Run it...

	Toby looks to Kip...

				KIP
		No...

				TOBY
		What am I supposed to do?

	Toby pins the gas. Straight at the block... The security cops dive
	out of the way. Except for one standing tall and FIRING into the
	windshield... Into Toby... The car swerves. Going off the road.
	Into a bank of mailboxes.

	The security guards run for her... Kip, forehead bloodied,
	switches places with Toby, getting behind the wheel ... Punches
	the gas ... Getting them out of there ...

	INT. "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT

	Kip drives like a wild man ... Toby is bleeding something fierce...
	Shot in the chest...

				TOBY
		Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...

				KIP
		Just hold on... Hold on ...

				TUMBLER
		What are we gonna do -- ?

				KIP
		Hospital.

				TUMBLER
		We can't do that, dude --

	Kip looks at Tumbler ... They both look at Toby...

	EXT. WAREHOUSE -LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	As the 'Vette comes screaming into the warehouse ... Kip exploding
	out of it ... Getting into the back. Memphis goes to the car, sees
	Toby ... Front of his shirt covered in blood ... The others gather
	around...

				MIRROR MAN
		Jesus ...

	Memphis climbs into the car ... Kip is holding Toby...

				KIP
		I didn't know... Should we take him to
		a hospital? I didn't know. I didn't.

	Toby is clearly dying in Kip's arms...

				TOBY
		Kip. Kip. Kip. Tell me: what's
		gonna happen? What's gonna happen?

	But Kip is lost ... Doesn't know what to say --

				MEMPHIS
		You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ...
		We'll getcha fixed up...

				TOBY
		No ... No... No ... Tell me what's
		gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's
		gonna happen?

	The brothers stare at the boy... Kip wipes his sweatstreaked face...

				TOBY (cont'd)
		What's gonna happen? I don't feel ...
		like ... this ... should.... happen ...
		right ... now. I...haven't... done ...
		shit... Tears running down his eyes...

				KIP
		Shhhhhh, shhhhh ...

	Kip looks to his brother for help ...

				MEMPHIS
		Call 911 -

				MIRROR MAN
		Call 'em here -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		DO IT! NOW -- !

	And Mirror Man scurries for the phone... Toby's breathing comes
	out in short staccato bursts ...

				TOBY
		Kip... Kip... Kip... It doesn't
		feel... It doesn't feel... It doesn't
		feel... good

	He looks up at Kip. All of the light goes out of his eyes. And
	Toby is dead... Kip holds him for a beat ... Then passes him to a
	surprisingly emotional Tumbler ... Kip gets out of the car, runs
	for the opposite end of the warehouse ...

	The others are stunned... Mirror Man hangs up the phone ...
	Memphis gets out of the car ... He goes after Kip ... Finds him in
	one of the containers ... Grabs him by the collars ...

				MEMPHIS
		What did I tell you? What? What did
		I tell you?

				KIP
		I don't know. What -- ?

	And Kip looks at him... Tears fall from the younger boy's eyes ...
	And Kip looks so lost ... So like a little kid...

				MEMPHIS
		Come here --

				KIP
		What?

				MEMPHIS
		Come here -

				KIP
		What?

				MEMPHIS
		Come here -

	And Kip does ... He walks to Memphis ... And Memphis puts his arms
	around him... And that's it. The floodgates open. Kip begins to
	sob. Deep, painful, racking sobs. And then:

				KIP
		I've missed you, man ...

				MEMPHIS
		I know. I've missed you, too 

	And they hold each other ...

				KIP
		Toby...

				MEMPHIS
		I know ...

				KIP
		Toby...

	And they stay in the embrace... And then Memphis unwraps Kip's
	arms from around him...

				MEMPHIS
		Stay here. Stay here a while. I'll
		be back ...

	Kip nods, sniffles ... Memphis walks out of the container ... He
	strides up to the others ... Glances at Toby's clipboard, with all
	the cars crossed-out ... He goes to Sway...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Give me a ride -- ?

				SWAY
		Where to -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Kip's not clear yet. We got one more
		to go --

	And she nods ... And climbs into one of the Escorts... And off
	they go ... The others standing around the 'Vette and Toby's
	body...

	ANGLE - THE CLIPBOARD. One car left. Eleanor.

	As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART IV: DREAMS OF YOU

	EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS - DAWN

	The sun just starting to take all the purple from the night ...

	Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff are parked across from the
	towers in their unmarked...

	Sway pulls up a few blocks away ... Memphis has put on a fake
	moustache, wig, necktie ...

				SWAY
		You okay -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah ... You -- ?

	She nods ... He looks at her ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		You should know: walking away from my
		mother, my brother, this town. Was
		hard. Walking away from you. Nearly 
		killed me...

	And she smiles sadly ...

				SWAY
		I know ...

	She takes his hand ... Squeezes it ...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		Good luck...

	Memphis, now in gray flannel suit, wig and moustache, steps out. 
	As he heads for the Tower garage...

	IN THE UNMARKED

	He points ... The '67 Mustang appears at the top of the garage
	ramp ... Brakes ... Waiting for the light ... Castlebeck squints...
	Raises the binocs ... Tough to tell.. Memphis drifts into the stream
	of traffic ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF (cont'd)
		What do you think -- ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Let's see what he's about --

	Drycoff hits the lights and sirens ... Memphis sees the car behind
	him...

				MEMPHIS
		Shit ...

	And kicks it into gear...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		Hey, now -- !

	He pins it ... And THE RACE IS ON... In the biggest way possible.
	This is the grand-daddy of chase scenes here, so we won't take the
	easy way out. We'll actually script it ... Memphis races out onto
	the busy street, Drycoff on his ass.

	Drycoff pulls up alongside him... So they can see him. But the wig
	and moustache prevent them from recognizing Memphis ... Other cars
	suffer from the pursuit ... They go careening into parked cars,
	storefronts, Harvard Square ...

	Memphis side-swipes Drycoff's car ... Memphis drives down the
	Memorial Drive OFF-RAMP, against traffic

	CITY HALL PLAZA

	is 10 ACRES OF BRICK in the heart of downtown ... And now it's 
	like a demolition derby... As Drycoff/Castlebeck and some 4 SQUAD CARS
	are chasing Memphis around the Plaza ...

	A POLICE CHOPPER has arrived on the scene... Camera out. Memphis
	takes one more spin around the plaza, then sees a

	SHALLOW FLIGHT OF STAIRS by the back entrance to City.Hall. And he
	takes them... CLUMP-KUMP-KA-DUMP-DUMP-DUMP

	And now he's on some of the narrowest streets in Long Beach. He
	flies through them... A mad mouse in a maze ... INT. KISS-108 -

	Across the grounds ... Past the dew-drenched flora and the paddle
	boats lolling on the lagoon ...

	Only there are SQUAD CARS coming from this side too... And he's
	pinned. Police on the perimeters, He slows to a stop.

	Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- And yanks the parking

	Memphis comes to a stop 100 feet before the accident ... There is
	no way past it, onto the bridge ... All the cops behind him come
	to a screeching halt. He is truly trapped.

	DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

	is thrilled ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		Gotcha now, dickhead --

	But Castlebeck's not so sure ... He sees a possible play... So
	does

	MEMPHIS

	Heavy sigh... He shuts off the radio ... And there's a strange
	SILENCE... As everyone waits ... Watches ...

	QUICK CUTS TO --

	-- Matty In The Morning -- The gang at Otto's -- The Carpenter in
	his wood shop -- Helen Raines, in front of her TV -- The chopper
	cops -- Paramedics, cops, injured motorists, fire men --

	MEMPHIS RAINES AND ELEANOR...

	Another few beats of silence ... Everyone watching ... He punches
	the gas... Ripping down to the accident site... Heading straight
	for it ... And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further
	injure the accident victims -

	Not our Memphis ... He's heading straight for

	THE RAMP TRUCK

	parked ass-end toward Long Beach ... Ramp down ... Memphis rockets
	Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ... And the ramp
	LAUNCHES ELEANOR in glorious super-sexy-bloodpumping SLO-MO OVER
	THE ACCIDENT SITE some thirty feet in the air ... Evel-style ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		You gotta be fucking kidding me --

	Where she lands in a crippling thud... Onto the EMPTY side of the
	Long Beach Bridge... Cheers from the gang at Otto's ... The gang
	at KISS-108 ... Memphis pulls her to a stop... Looks back at the
	scene ...

	Castlebeck squints ... Trying to see if it's his boy... Memphis
	switches the radio back on ... Matty has obliged... Wilson
	Pickett's "Mustang Sallyo ... And Memphis drives over the bridge,
	the only car going northbound... Memphis rides, daddy, rides ...

	INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - FRONT OFFICES - DAY

	A half-dozen Calitri SOLDIERS are here, answering phones, playing
	cards.

	INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - WORKSHOP

	The sliding door is open. The CASKET for Kip rests to the side ...
	Calitri uses a router to make a rabbet along the bottom frame of a
	plywood gossip bench. He senses something and turns to

	THE LOADING DOCK - MEMPHIS

	has driven up in the smashed-to-shit Eleanor ... He climbs up,
	entering the workshop... Calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55
	AM...

				CALITRI
		Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...

				MEMPHIS
		This is number 50. We did it. It's
		over Where's the money ?

				CALITRI
		Right there -

	He gestures to a Haliburton case ... Memphis opens it ... There's
	a lot of cash inside...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		200 K. Just like we said ...

				MEMPHIS
		You should never have gotten my brother and
		his friends involved ...

				CALITRI
		But I had to. It was the only way to
		get to you --

	Memphis looks at him... Calitri smiles ...

				MEMPHIS 
		Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away
		from him...

				CALITRI
		I don't know about that, Randall.
		He did such a good job on this paper.
		And another one just came in ...

	Calitri goes to the FAX machine... Tears off the sheet..

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		It's an easier take. 30 cars. Two
		weeks. Most of them SUVs. Going to
		Russia. Think Kip'll be interested?

				MEMPHIS
		You don't want to even sniff at that --

	Calitri grins. But then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the
	first time -- ELEANOR -- parked out on the loading dock. And she
	is smashed-to-shit.

				CALITRI
		Well, that certainly won't do.

				MEMPHIS
		What do you mean -- ?

				CALITRI
		Look at it. I can't very well make
		delivery of that thing ...

				MEMPHIS
		You got no choice. It's over.

				CALITRI
		Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM
		Friday. Or Kip goes in that box.
		That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ...
		That was the deal ...

	Memphis is by a TABLE SAW... He flicks it on. The electric MOTOR
	rumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		What are you doing -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not
		gonna let you get into my Kool Aid...

	And Memphis is on him... They go rolling about in grunts and
	groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the NOISE of the table saw
	drowning out the sounds of combat ...

	Calitri is on top, grabbing an AWL from the floor, bringing the
	lethal point down to Memphis' face... Memphis holds Calitri's
	wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye

	ANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last
	gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a
	small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl
	akimbo ...

	Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself
	out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...

	He crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on
	the younger man's chest ... But then Memphis grabs him by the hair
	and tosses Calitri off him ... Memphis POUNDS Calitri's head into
	the floor ...

	Once, twice. Three times. Calitri is out ... Memphis gets to his
	feet, nose bloody. He catches his breath. Only the door opens ...
	And Atley is there ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Jesus, man ... What'd you do?

				MEMPHIS
		My version of "take this job and shove
		it..."

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Are you crazy? You throw down with The
		Carpenter? You got a grudge against
		your life?

	But before Memphis can respond, there are APPROACHING ENGINE
	SOUNDS from up the alleyway -- as A PANEL VAN arrives. Memphis and
	Atley look at the wall-clock. 8:05. A glance to the unconscious
	Calitri ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Now you done it. And with you
		gone - who'll save Kip the next
		time ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		This is all about there not being
		a next time, Atley --

	And the two men hold the look... And the van doors slam, as Digger
	and Butz, Calitri's grave-diggers, get out ... Atley goes to the
	unconscious Calitri ... And he picks him up, straining under the
	dead weight ... Dragging the don over to

	THE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops
	Calitri into the casket... Slamming the swell top lid of the
	coffin. He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger and
	Butz are there -

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Hello, boys -- !

				DIGGER
		Hey! What happened? Did they make it

				ATLEY JACKSON
		They did not. A tragedy.

				DIGGER
		Mr. C. around?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		He's napping. He said to take it away...

	Atley gestures to the coffin. And they pick it up, move it to the
	van...

				DIGGER
		That'll do ya. Tell Mr. C. we was by.

				MEMPHIS
		Absolutely.

	And they are gone ... And Atley turns to Memphis

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?

				MEMPHIS
		Point-five ...

	And he holds out his hand ... And they shake ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Get outta here, Memphis --

	And Memphis does ... Nods to Atley...

				MEMPHIS
		Thank you...

	Atley nods ... Memphis walks out to the loading dock... Atley
	watches him go ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Hoo-boy.

	EXT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP - LOADING DOCK

	Memphis walks to the battered Eleanor ... As Pearl Jam's
	"Rearviewmirror' crunches and a CAR comes motoring up to him. It's
	ANOTHER 167 SHELBY. ANOTHER ELEANOR, a "For Sale" sign pasted on
	the back window. It's being driven by Kip...

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				KIP
		I saw her get smashed-up on the TV.
		Knew there was no way he was gonna
		accept her ...

				MEMPHIS
		Where'd you find this one?

				KIP
		Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors",
		Memphis. Cos you never know when
		you're gonna need one --

				MEMPHIS
		You boost her -- ?

				KIP
		Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.

				MEMPHIS
		Move over ...

	Kip does. Memphis gets behind the wheel. Drives...

	EXT. LONG BEACH BOULEVARD - DAY

	Memphis drives... Kip beside him...

				MEMPHIS
		You okay -- ?

				KIP
		I dunno ... I keep thinking about
		him.

	Memphis nods. But then FLASHING LIGHTS behind them ... An UNMARKED
	with Code 3 capabilities - lights & sirens ... Memphis considers
	... He could make another run ... But the looks at Kip... Enough
	is enough ... He pulls over ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What are you doing? You can outrun
		him...

				MEMPHIS
		It's over. The dumb shit is over ...

	The unmarked pulls up behind him... The cop comes over ... It is,
	of course, Detective Castlebeck.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

	Castlebeck opens his coat... Showing stuffed holster ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		It's finished, Randall. Get out of
		the car... You, too, kid...

	Memphis starts to get out. When Castleback's RADIO crackles.

				RADIO (O.S.)
		We have suspect vehicle matching description
		at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal ... Repeat:
		the suspect vehicle has just been
		apprehended at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal,
		190 Street and Campanza ...

	Castlebeck frowns, goes to his radio. Memphis looks at Kip.

				KIP
		I reported it ...

	Memphis is impressed...

				MEMPHIS
		Not bad

	ANGLE - CASTLEBECK at his car, on the radio ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Dispatch, what's the license on
		the suspect vehicle... ?

				RADIO (O.S.)
		License is California 6-1-4 HSO. Repeat:
		California. 6-1-4 Henry Sam Ocean.

	And Castlebeck looks at the license on this Eleanor... A vanity
	plate that says - MY 67 ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		10-4.

	And he goes back over to Memphis ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		Looks like we live to fight another
		round. You're free to go ...

	Memphis can barely believe it. Castlebeck leans down, to Kip:

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		Your brother's a clever man and a
		talented thief, Kipling. But as role
		models go, you should observe the man,
		not the thief ...

				KIP
		Yes, sir ...

	Castlebeck sighs...

				MEMPHIS
		Don't look so glum, Detective. It's a
		beautiful day, the birds are singing,
		and there's a container ship on
		Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ...

	Castlebeck nods ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I want you gone, Randall. Settle your
		affairs. Make it right with those you
		love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I
		want you out of here. Out of here for
		good this time ...

				MEMPHIS
		Consider me gone, Detective --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I'll catch you later, Randall --

				MEMPHIS
		Double-meaning intended --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You betcha --

	And Memphis races off ...

	EXT. OTTO'S SALVAGE - DAY

	Otto, The Sphinx, Tumbler, Freb and Mirror Man are sipping coffee
	and eating donuts ... They are exhausted... Memphis and Kip pull
	up in Eleanor... He hands Otto the briefcase. Otto opens it... All
	that cash...

				MEMPHIS
		Split it up. Any word on Donny?

				OTTO
		He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.

				MEMPHIS
		What happened to Sway?

				OTTO
		She left...

	He nods ... The boys are huddled together...

				MIRROR MAN
		Poor Toby, man...

	A few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly:

				THE SPHINX 
		If his premature demise has, in some way,
		enlightened the rest of you as to the
		grim finish below the glossy veneer of
		criminal life, and inspired you to change
		your ways, then his death carries with it
		an inherent nobility. And a supreme
		glory. We should all be so fortunate.
		You can say 'Poor Toby." I say: "Poor us.."

	They all stare at him, stunned...

				FREB
		You spoke

	The Sphinx shrugs...

				TUMBLER
		Say something else, man

	But The Sphinx lapses back into his silence ... Nibbles a donut
	... Sips coffee ... Memphis smiles ... He takes a stack of bills
	from the briefcase... To Kip:

				MEMPHIS
		You remember where you got this
		Eleanor -- ?

				KIP
		Sure, man --

				MEMPHIS
		She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand.
		Give 'em sixty ...

	And he hands Kip the cash ...

				KIP
		You want me to buy her?

				MEMPHIS
		Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done.
		I've never actually paid for a car. I want
		to see what it feels like

	Kip nods ... Memphis looks at a grinning Otto ...

				OTTO
		Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is
		now...

				MEMPHIS
		I'll see you soon --

				KIP
		Where you off to -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Thought I'd go for a ride -

	He smiles. The others do, too. Memphis heads for Eleanor.

				KIP
		Hey, Memphis -- ?

	Memphis turns back...

				KIP (cont'd)
		I'll see you, right?

	Memphis nods ...

				MEMPHIS
		You'll see me ...

	And we PRE-LAP Sammy John's "Chevy Van" and CUT TO:

	INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

	Sway, underneath a Daytona... We only see her from the waist down
	... Hands on her waist ... Pulls her gently out. Memphis. He
	brings her to her feet ...

				SWAY
		What are you doing... ?

				MEMPHIS
		Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?

	And he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from
	her cheek...

				SWAY
		I can't. I got a back load of repairs
		and one of the mechanics called in
		sick and I haven't slept and--
			(stops short; sees the new Eleanor
			outside)
		Where to -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		I dunno. I know a place.

	She looks at him... Long and hard...

				SWAY
		This time it's for real?

				MEMPHIS
		Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.

	EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S - DAY

	And Memphis opens the passenger door for her ... And she gets
	in... And she smiles ... And Memphis climbs behind the wheel. He
	neutral-drops Eleanor, chirping off ...

	EXT. CONTAINER SHIP - LONG BEACH HARBOR - DAY

	As two TUGS guide the giant freighter away from the docks ... All
	those containers ... Filled with cars ... But here comes a COAST
	GUARD CUTTER ... Churning for the ship ...

	Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff on the deck ... Stopping this
	one cold...

	EXT. LANDFILL - RHODE ISLAND - DAY

	A vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth. Deserted,
	except for THE PANEL VAN parked dead center. Digger and Butz slide
	the casket from the van, parked before an ALREADY DUG GRAVE.

	As they move the casket, a KNOCKING from inside. A POUNDING. And
	muffled CRIES. Digger and Butz exchange a horrified glance... They
	stare at the casket, spooked.

				BUTZ
		Do you believe this?

				DIGGER
		What should we do?

				BUTZ
		We gotta do what we gotta do --

				DIGGER
		Shit. I hate the screamers, man. Why
		can't he finish the freakin' job?

				BUTZ
		Forget about it. Occupational hazard,
		Digger. C'mon...

	And just as we think they're sure to open it -- they DROP THE
	CASKET INTO THE HOLE -- !

	And begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it; its unseen occupant
	thumping and pounding and yelling -- And soon the casket is
	covered in dirt. Gone.

	And we PRE-LAP The Turtles' pop gem "Eleanor" ("You got a thing
	about you/I just can't live without you/I really want
	you/ Eleanor near me...")  CUT TO:

	EXT. THE 405 FREEWAY NORTH - ELEANOR - MOVING - DAY

	Memphis driving. Sway riding shotgun. Long Beach at their backs
	... Memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel... He loves
	driving this car. Sway watches him. He feels it --

				MEMPHIS
		What -- ?

				SWAY
		Nothing. Just that if I was less
		secure, I might think you were more
		into Eleanor than you are me...

				MEMPHIS
		She does have one thing you don't.

				SWAY
		What's that?

				MEMPHIS
		Bench seats.

	And he grins ... Pats the seat beside him... And Sway slides
	close... He throws his arm around her ...

	And off they go ... As The Turtles' ("Eleanor/Gee, I think you're
	swell/And you really do me well/You're my pride and joy, etc.")
	SING ON... And we hear:

				MEMPHIS (O.S.)
		You like bingo -- ?

	And Eleanor drives away from us ... Into the searing horizon line
	... Becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist
	pattern that is the American road.

	THE END
GONE IN 60 SECONDS

	4/6/99


	"I wonder," Toad said to himself presently, "I wonder
	if this sort of car starts easily?"
		Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he
	found that he had hold of the handle and was turning
	it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old
	passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him,
	body and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the
	car devoured the street, he was only conscious
	that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and
	highest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling
	his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what
	might come to him... "

	-- Kenneth Grahame, "THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS"







	"All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty
	hood... "

	-- Bruce Springsteen, "THUNDER ROAD"









	FADE IN:

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT

	The streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew
	of a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal.  The vast Port of Los
	Angeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars
	except -

	A '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500

	Silver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air
	scoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool
	before dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then
	SOMEONE approaches...

	Through the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ...
	He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer
	that refuses to fade ...

	This is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's
	quite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern
	California ...

	Memphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert
	crash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ...
	Admiring it ... Adoring it ...

	But then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver -
	ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for:

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You gonna steal her or kneel down to
		her and pray -- ?

	Memphis looks at him, still enthralled...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ...
		Just take her, slick. - -

	And Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ...
	No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his
	coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the
	door ...

	Watch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another
	pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION

	A RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small
	socket-like device - is pressed into the
	ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles
	like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds.

	He takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the
	deck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials.
	And Memphis floors it... And off they tear...

	The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand
	re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones,
	fixed and fumy ...

	He slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in
	behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ...

	On they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort...

	Except that, from seemingly out of nowhere --

	A POLICE CAR

	appears behind them...

	And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races
	through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And
	Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their
	respective vehicles...

	The UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny.

				DONNY
		Problem, Officer?

				POLICEMAN
		Yes. You're under arrest -- ?

				DONNY
		For running a stop sign?

				POLICEMAN
		For Grand Theft Auto -

	And off of Donny's look --

	We go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding
	toward him, sirens wailing...

	QUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning
	harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music
	... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ...

	Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis
	gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy
	pursuit ...

	And now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson,
	heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of
	cruisers himself ...

	Memphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up
	ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so
	fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ...

	Guns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and
	a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on
	to the roadblock ...

	And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis
	bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake --
	And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And
	Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ...

	And he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower
	Grand... Looking down ...

	He can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being
	chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER,
	the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ...

	Landing with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified.

	EXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER

	Rescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His
	leg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny
	Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ...

	A POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps

	DETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK

	of G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck
	is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility
	fool you - the man's a street viper ...

	Castlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS..

				HAWKINGS
		Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of
		Raines...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Well, then it's all for naught,
		ain't it, Hawkings?

	Castlebeck looks out over the mess ... And then looks up...
	Because, further down Lower Grand, a car is parked. It is the
	Shelby. With Memphis leaning against its hood...

	Castlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed. So he walks
	toward it, hand on hip...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you --

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back -

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You want to come along quiet?

				MEMPHIS
		How's Atley -- ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Leg's all banged-up. He made a
		stupid play ... He'll limp around
		the yard up at Folsom. But
		Astricky will be there to take
		care of him. With their priors,
		they're looking at a serious bounce --

				MEMPHIS
		Let them go --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		How's that?

				MEMPHIS
		Let them go. And I'll leave ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You'll leave -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		You don't have anything on me. A
		misdee auto-theft. I got no record.
		I'll be out in three days, and back at 
		it. Or you let them go, and I give
		you my word. I'm gone. And without the
		ringleader ... Your tee-times have
		just grown exponentially...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I don't golf...

	And they stare at each other, as Castlebeck considers.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		I do this. And I see you again. I'll
		come after you with everything I got.
		you won't be able to steal a glance
		at a blind man without me by your side ...

				MEMPHIS
		You have my word...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Get out of here, then. Now.

	And Memphis makes to get into the Shelby...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Leave the car, Randall ...

	Memphis nods ... Takes one last look at the Shelby... Sorry to 
	leave it behind ... And he runs off into the mists of Lower
	Grand ...

	Castlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Arright, let lim go. Cite him for
		rolling the stop ... And cite old
		Atley for driving to endanger ...

				HAWKINGS
		What are you talking about, Rollie? We're
		springing 'em? Just like that?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Just like that. Quit your bellyaching,
		Hawkings ... And let's wrap this up ...

	And off of Donny's surprised look, as Springsteen wails to
	crescendo and we

									CUT TO:

	EXT. INDEPENDENCE, CALIFORNIA - DAY - 6 YEARS LATER

	Some 400 miles North of Los Angeles, Independence is a one
	horse town, and the horse has died... Single stop light,
	single-engine firehouse, single everything. Norman Rockwell
	would find this burg a snooze.. - We settle on a small,
	GARAGE ... The peeling sign reads:

	"L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE"

	owned and operated by Memphis Raines ... In blue coveralls,
	Memphis has a Plymouth Duster up on the lift ... With him is a kid
	- TOM, 19... Lightnin' Hopkins' "Automobile Blues" plays through --

				MEMPHIS
		You know what you got here?

				TOM
		Not really -

				MEMPHIS
		There's excessive resistance in the cranking
		circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?

				TOM
		Not really --

				MEMPHIS
		You have any other answers besides
		"not really"?

				TOM
		Not --

				MEMPHIS
		Right. You want to test the voltage drop ...
		Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary
		lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ...
		See what you got ... You understand -- ?

	Tom starts to say "not really". Instead, he nods. Memphis takes a
	root beer from an old-style machine. He goes out ... front ... To
	where an old Denver Pyle-coot - BUDGY - sits on a bench, smoking
	an unfiltered Lucky ... Memphis sits beside him, pets the 
	200-year-old DOG that lounges nearby...

				BUDGY
		Just can't find good help these days --

				MEMPHIS
			(re: cigarette)
		Those things'll kill ya, Budgy --

				BUDGY
		They won't have a chance. The bourbon and
		bacon'll get me first...

	Budgy cackles ... Memphis looks out at the dusty little hamlet ...
	Budgy points at a passing car ...

				BUDGY (cont'd)
		That one -

				MEMPHIS
		1980 Mercury Cougar. 255 cubic inch V8 ...
		Based on the Ford Thunderbird bodyshell;
		they modified the chassis, but didn't
		improve its performance...

	Budgy points at another car ... And we get the sense they play
	this game every day...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		The 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. Proof
		positive of a single all-powerful Deity.
		The first bargain-priced muscle car
		ever. They even tuned the horn to
		resemble the "beep beep" sound of the
		cartoon Road Runner ...

	And Budgy looks impressed... As always ...

				BUDGY
		Damn, you're good

	Memphis nods ... Sips his root beer ...

				BUDGY (cont'd)
		You got to bingo last night?

	Memphis looks at him ... Can't believe it himself ...

				MEMPHIS
		That I did, Budgy. That I did --

	And, from inside the garage, there's the most horrific GRIND of
	metal on metal, as Tom has started the Plymouth -

				TOM (O.S.)
		Uh ... Randall -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Excuse me --

	Memphis goes back into the garage, Budgy cackles.

	EXT. RANCHO PALOS VERDES - BUSINESS DISTRICT

	A FORD ESCORT - driving through the upscale streets of Palos
	Verdes. Three KIDS, 20, inside ... The driver is FREB, a little
	dim; in the back is MIRROR MAN, black, always wears those mirrored
	shades ... In the passenger seat is

	KIP - Memphis' younger brother ... The car pulls to a stop.

	Fancy stores - all of them closed - line this affluent business
	district ... Freb consults a piece of paper ...

				FREB
		The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia.
		Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus
		would be at the corner of Hawthorne
		and Granvia --

				KIP
		He didn't mess up. There it is ...

	And he points ... To a CORNER BUILDING - EXOTIC MOTORS LTD. Twenty
	foot high glass - windows surround a SHOWROOM of EXOTIC DREAM
	CARS: Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bertones ... And-
	there it is, a 1996 LOTUS ESPRIT V8, gleaming in the all-night
	showroom lights...

	Freb and Mirror Man are startled

				FREB
		That -- ?

				MIRROR MAN
		You're shittin', right? Kip?

	He grins at them... He ain't shittin'...

				FREB
		How are we supposed to--

				KIP
		Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...

	Freb scowls ... Pops the trunk ... Kip gets out ... Goes to the
	back ... Freb and Mirror Man share a spook --

				MIRROR MAN
		What tool -- ?

	Kip reaches into the trunk.... Comes around to them... He's
	carrying A BRICK --

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		Oh, no --

	And Kip walks toward "Exotic Motors"... Calm and cool ...
	Ten feet from it ... He winds up ... And HURLS THE BRICK AT
	THE WINDOW Which EXPLODES ON IMPACT, a SHOWER OF GLASS
	raining down ...

	ALARMS SQUEAL

	As Kip walks into the showroom, glass crunching underfoot. Freb
	and Mirror Man can't believe it --

	INT. EXOTIC MOTORS

	Kip goes to the Lotus... With nary a glance around, he's got her
	open ... The Lotus' ALARM adds its song to the choir ... Kip,
	unmindful, gets behind the wheel ... Screwdriver to the
	mechanism... The alarm raging in here...

	In moments, the V8's massive 349bhp is bellowing... And Mirror Man
	climbs in beside him... And off they go ... Laying several inches
	of English rubber. Over the broken glass and out of the
	showroom...

	EXT. CITY STREETS - PALOS VERDES - NIGHT

	The Lotus races through these streets ... At high speeds ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a
		stolen car

	Kip smiles over the ascending speedometer --

				KIP
		Yeah. Ain't it great -- ?

	And he pins her ... VROOOOOM -- !

									CUT TO:

	A TENNIS BALL

	being bounced against the wall ... Caught ... Bounced again ...
	Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

	INT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	A dozen purloined AUTOS are parked here ... And a number of
	SHIPPING CONTAINERS ... A thuggish MAN reads the paper ... The
	tennis ball bouncer is TUMBLER, 20 ... And he's sitting on a
	tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the
	piss out of

	ATLEY JACKSON

	whom we remember from the drop-car at our opening ... Atley walks
	with a LIMP now... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Can you stop that, for Chrissake?

				TUMBLER
		What's your problem, bro ?

	Thunk! Thunk!

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Where are they -- ?

				TUMBLER
		They'll be here. You nervous, bro? You? Back
		in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in
		them veins ... What happened -- ?

	And Atley intercepts the tennis ball ... And hurls it over to the
	far side of the warehouse ... Tumbler merely grins ...

				TUMBLER (cont'd)
		Relax and enjoy --

	EXT. SAN PEDRO STREETS - THE LOTUS

	Heading for Long Beach... Stopped at a light ... A CAMARO pulls up
	next to them... A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him...

	Kip eyeballs them... Engines are revved... Challenges are
	implied... Mirror Man panics ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car,
		stolen car ...

				KIP
		Stolen fast car...

	And the light turns green ... And he pops the clutch ... And
	they are off ... It's a good old fashioned drag race ... Kip
	smiles at the blonde ... Mirror Man is freaking out ... Kip's
	eyes are on fire ... He clocks the speedometer ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		It's calibrated for 140 ... Let's see
		if these British boys are full of shit
		or not --

				MIRROR MAN
		No way, man --

	Yes, way. Kip floors it. They bury the Camaro in its wake... The
	gauge rising ... 90, 100, 110 ... Mirror Man is having an
	embolism...

	They warp-speed by a POLICE CRUISER... Both kids totally unaware
	of the POLICE CHOPPER up on high... With them in its sights ...
	And they drive ... At last, ending up at --

	THE WATERFRONT - A dark latticework of docks and wharves,
	warehouses and shipping crates... The freighters are somehow
	graceful against the moonlit water ...

	INT. WAREHOUSE

	Tumbler studies his watch... Now he's a little concerned ... He
	looks up ... Atley is glaring at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Something wrong, Tumbler -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Yeah. I'm missing Springer --

	And then the Lotus pulls into the warehouse... Tumbler flashes
	Atley a "told-you-so" smile... Kip and Mirror Man get out of the
	car...

	Kip walks over to a CLIPBOARD with a magic marker tethered to it
	... It is a list of cars ... He draws a black line through "13)
	1996 Lotus Esprit V8"... The others are clocking the car...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		She'll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds --

				MIRROR MAN
		I can vouch for that.

	Tumbler passes out 40 oz.s ... The vibe is celebratory...

				TUMBLER
		Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...

				KIP
		No problem -

	Bottles are clinked... Beer is sipped ... Only, a HOT WHITE
	SPOTLIGHT bores through the skylight ... And the whup-whup of the
	chopper's ROTORS... And now the sounds of SIRENS ... And the 
	thuggish man gets to his feet ...

				THUGGISH MAN
		Let's get outta here -- !

	And they do... Heading out the back ... It's tough for Atley with
	his limp ... On the way out:

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Now you gone and done it, Raines
		And they flee ...

	INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	A HALF-DOZEN POLICE CARS. The CHOPPER does the usual
	spotlight-trailing... It's turned into a total pig
	circus ... A car pulls to a stop ... And out steps Detective
	Roland Castlebeck, whom we remember from our opening...

	INT. WAREHOUSE

	Castlebeck surmises the take ... The cars ... His partner
	DETECTIVE DRYCOFF - a sneering Irish boy with zero patience -
	comes out from the back ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		They're gone...

	Castlebeck nods ... Looks at the cars ...

	INT. "L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE" - INDEPENDENCE - DUSK

	Memphis goes through invoices in the cluttered back office. When a
	brand new purple MERCEDES SLK, windows tinted, pulls in out front.
	It looks oddly anachronistic here in Independence. Memphis senses
	danger. He goes out. Budgy and his dog are here... Budgy looks
	spooked... Tom, too ...

				MEMPHIS
		What's going on -- ?

	And standing there, by the Mercedes, like a wraith, is ATLEY
	JACKSON, in long leather coat, smoking a cigarette ... As out of
	place here as a maggot on a muffin...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Well, well, well ...

	And he begins to sing...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
			(ANDY GRIFFITH theme)
		Da-doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo-doo, etc.
			(laughs)
		Are you kidding me, man -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Hello, Atley ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (re: sign)
		L.N. ORR. I get it. Clever ...

	Memphis studies him...

				MEMPHIS
		How's the leg?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit
		you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt
		Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's
		Opie at?

	He laughs some more ... Chain-lights his cig ...

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Is there someplace we can talk?

	Memphis looks at him...

				MEMPHIS
		What about?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		About your brother. And the deeeep
		shit he's in --

	INT. TEDDY'S TAVERN - NIGHT

	A BARMAID sets down a pitcher of beer and two mugs...

				WAITRESS
		There you go --

				MEMPHIS
		Thanks, Donna --

	She leaves... Atley is staring at him... Memphis shrugs...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		It's been a long time, Memphis --

				MEMPHIS
		Six years ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it?
		Six years ago we were fartin' through
		Armani and pissin' Cristal.
		Now look at us ...

		MEMPHIS
		Tell me about Kip -

	Atley takes a sip of his beer,...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		He took a job. And he fumbled it.
		Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...

				MEMPHIS
		What kind of job... ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		A boost. A big boost ...

				MEMPHIS
		A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?

	Atley frowns ... Looks at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You're shittin', right?

	Clearly Memphis is not ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Kip's become quite the little
		crewrunner since you left. He's been
		working a low-rent ring for
		two years now. You don't talk to
		your Ma?

				MEMPHIS
		It seems she neglected to mention it

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Maybe she don't know. Although I don't
		see how that could be. Maybe she didn't
		want to upset you -

				MEMPHIS
		Don't feel the need to explore my family
		dynamics, Atley...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		The point is: Kip's been living the
		life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy.
		Makes our old behavior seem like
		altar boy time. But he fungold this
		one so bad, folks around L.B.
		are already speakin' about him in
		the past tense.

	Memphis takes a beat ... Sips at his brew ... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		Who was the job for?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Who do you think?

	Memphis waits ... In no mood for guessing games ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Calitri, man. Raymond "The Carpenter"
		Calitri ... Your favorite and mine ...

	Which means nothing to us ... Though the look on Memphis, face
	speaks volumes ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		I just thought you should know,
		man. I kind of had a feeling you
		didn't. But I should tell you:
		I'm working for him now - The
		Carpenter - so if you see him, you
		won't mention me coming to get
		you... Like I said: I just thought
		... I owed you ... And that it was
		the right thing to do ...

	Memphis nods ... His face clenched in despair. We FADE TO BLACK,
	As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART 1: STOLEN MOMENTS

	We PRE-LAP J. Geils Band's "Hard-Drivin' Man" and CUT TO:

	THREE PLATES OF BACON, EGGS AND HASH BROWNS

	placed on the service deck by a short-order COOK...

	INT. RUBY'S ALL-NITE - LONG BEACH - NIGHT

	A 24-hour diner in the heart of Long Beach... The three plates are
	picked-up with an impressive dexterity by

	HELEN RAINES

	early 60s, clear-eyed... In pink Ruby's uniform and chunky
	shoes... Black currant hair striated with wisps of gray... Helen
	delivers the plates to a booth of college kids ...

				KID
		Can I get some more coffee -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Sure, hon ...

	And she goes to the coffee station... When

				MEMPHIS (O.S.)
		Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna
		melt in this joint -- ?

	And she turns around to see Memphis standing there. Her expression
	displays many things ... Most of them joy ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Hello, Ma --

	And she goes to Memphis ... Wraps her arms around him ... Squeezes
	tight ...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		Oh, Randall ...

	She takes his head in her hands ... Kisses his cheek ... Then the
	other... Hugs on ... Unmindful of the customers ... The cook
	smiles from behind the order wheel ...

				COOK
		What's the word, Memphis -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		How ya doing, Ruby -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Come, come, come ...

	And she leads him over to a booth ... Barking to the cook - RUBY -
	on the way...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone,
		extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate
		milk... Lots of syrup...
			(to Memphis)
		Right?

				MEMPHIS
		Right ...

	And they settle in ... Across the booth from each other ... She
	takes his hands...

				HELEN RAINES
		You look good...

				MEMPHIS
		You, too, Ma...

				HELEN RAINES
		What are you doing back?

				MEMPHIS
		How's Kip?

	And Helen flushes, a bit ashamed maybe ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Have you seen him?

				MEMPHIS
		No.

				HELEN RAINES
		oh.

				MEMPHIS
		Atley Jackson came to see me ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Atley Jackson. How is that one?
		How's the leg... ?

	He looks at her ... Beat ...

				MEMPHIS
		Why didn't you tell me?

				HELEN RAINES
		I couldn't. I didn't want you to
		worry. I thought held sort himself
		out. I hardly see him. He comes and
		goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?

				MEMPHIS
		He's in some trouble ...

				HELEN RAINES
		I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a
		different boy. He's lost that... That
		sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't
		know what to do ...

				MEMPHIS
		You getting my checks ... ?

				HELEN RAINES
		Of course ...

	ANGLE - RUBY. He's on the PHONE in the kitchen...One eye
	on Memphis and Helen --

				RUBY
		Detective Castlebeck... It's me ...
		Yeah... You ain't never gonna guess
		who just come in to visit his Ma --

	BACK TO - MEMPHIS AND HELEN RAINES ...

				HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
		You haven't spoken to him in a
		while, I guess...

				MEMPHIS
		He doesn't return my calls. or my
		letters ...

				HELEN RAINES
		Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby.
		I don't know what you remember of him.
		But you should brace yourself

	And, on her sad smile, we PRE-LAP Sammy Hagar's "I Can't Drive 55"
	and SLAM CUT TO:

	INT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - POOL HALL - NIGHT

	A dozen tables... Smells of blue chalk and whiskey... The juke box
	cranked... We take it to the back of the joint ... Where Kip, and
	Tumbler and Mirror Man are knocking a rack... Freb sits nearby,
	with a few badly made-up GIRLS...

				TUMBLER
		... so ... It's my new move ... It's called
		"The Stranger." What I do is, I sit on
		my hand for 10 minutes.  Till it falls
		asleep. Till it's good and numb. No feeling.
		And then I jerk off.

				GIRL
		That's disgusting -

				FREB
		What's the point, man -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Cos it's like you're bein' done by a stranger
		... It rocks ... It's the power move of the
		New Millennium...

	He sinks another ball. A kid, 15, TOBY - comes up to them.

				TOBY
		Hey, Kip, what's up?

				KIP
		What do you say, Toby?,

				TOBY
		I'm cool -

				TUMBLER
		What do you want, shithead?

				TOBY
		Why you gotta front me like that? I'm
		talking to Kip --

				TUMBLER
		Why don't you leave him alone?

				TOBY
		I known Kip longing than you, man ...

				TUMBLER
		Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --

				FREB
		Any word, Kip -- ?

				KIP
		No ... And they won't take my calls ...

				FREB
		What does that mean -- ?

				KIP
		It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"

	He groks their fear...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Look - we managed to get 13 in a week.
		We just gotta step it up ...

				FREB
		But we only got till Friday. That's
		four days. And we lost the 13. So's
		we gotta start over ...

	Kip looks at him...

				KIP
		That, too ...
			(off of Freb's look of fright)
		Don't sweat it, Freb. We're cool.

	ANGLE THE FRONT DOOR. For Memphis has entered. He
	clocks the room. Sees them at the rear ... Walks back

				KIP
		It can be done, man. We just gotta
		step it up... It's a challenge ...

				MIRROR MAN
		The challenge is not to get our nuts
		cut-off and shoved down our throats ...

				TUMBLER
		Can I help you, pal -- ?

	And Kip looks up ... To see Memphis there ...

				MEMPHIS
		Hey, Kip ...

				KIP
		Hello, Memphis --

				TUMBLER
		"Memphis?" You're Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		That's right...

				TUMBLER
		Damn. Damn, damn, damn ...

				FREB
		Memphis. Holy shit. It's an honor,
		man --

	And he pumps his hand... Memphis continues to stare at Kip

				KIP
		It's good to see ya, man. You changed
		your look -

				MEMPHIS
		You, too

	Hold the stare... The others are excited...

				FREB
		What are you doing back, Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		Little visit. Check on the family.

				KIP
		It's nice to see ya, man -

	He smiles ... Memphis eyeballs him... Toby is there ...

				TOBY
		Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby
		Walker. I live next door ...

				MEMPHIS
		Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up

				TOBY
		Yeah, I'm cool ...

	And Memphis turns back to Kip, who's picked up a pool cue.

				KIP
		Who's got next game -- ?

	And he makes to rack 'em up ... Then:

				MIRROR MAN
		I get it. You ain't gotta be a genius:
		Memphis come back to save our bacon!

				TUMBLER
		Shut-up, Mirror Man --

				FREB
		Izzat true? You come back to save our
		bacon?

				MIRROR MAN
		Of course it's true. He come to save
		his brother's dangling ass --

				KIP
		That can't be it. Cos we don't need
		saving

				FREB
		We don't -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		He give you an advance -- ?

				MIRROR MAN
		Hell, yeah. Ten larger man

	Kip shoots him a look... As if he's spoken out of turn ...

				MEMPHIS
		You just give 'im back the money.
		All's well...

	The others look glum... Kip laughs ... Long and hard...

				KIP
		"Give lim back the money." "Give 'im
		back the money..." Be nice. If only
		we didn't drink the money. And smoke
		the money. And buy Nikes with the
		money. And Sony Play Stations with the
		money. And dirty girls with the
		money...

	And Kip sinks a ball ... Memphis looks at the others ... They
	nod... It's true ... The money's gone ...

				KIP
		But don't worry, man. Things are all
		sweetness and light here...

				TUMBLER
		Things are all leafy and suburban ...

				MIRROR MAN
		The hell they are --

				KIP
		Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the
		gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled...
		And it was nice to see you -- -

	Memphis nods ... Looks at all of them... Smiles ... And then
	REACHES OUT, GRABBING Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet
	and in close, nose to nose ...

				MEMPHIS
		You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy
		yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum,
		well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a
		poundcake. But I remember the days when you
		used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em...
		So you can't stop me from saving your
		"dangling ass' if that's what I feel like
		doing...

	And with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the
	table, bottles and glasses crashing... And barrels away from them,
	the crowd parting like a wound...

	Kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed...

				TUMBLER
		Damn... Homeboy's on the dazzle ...

	And, off of Kip's furious look, we CUT TO:

	EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	A chill in the air. Memphis walks toward a range of lowslung
	buildings ...

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

	A virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up
	high for as far as the eye can see ... A huge FORK LIFT scoops up
	a wreck and hauls it over to the CRUSHER... Watch as the car is
	FLATTENED, for easy shelving ...

	Midnight auto nonpareil ... To one side of the yard is a GARAGE:
	Watch as a HONDA ACCORD, with a BLOODY WINDSHIELD, enters the
	garage. A young Mexican KID driving.

	A SIGN: "LOCK YOUR CAR OR IT MAY BE GONE IN 60 SECONDS!"

	INT. GARAGE - CHOP SHOP

	A CAR is CHOPPED ... Pulled apart ... Fenders, doors, panels,
	interiors, air bags ...

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - FRONT ENTRANCE

	Memphis knocks on the door ... A dog-faced MAN opens it ...

				DOG-FACE
		Yeah -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri ...

	INT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL

	Memphis follows Dog-face to the back of this building. Follows him
	into another room. Which is

	A WORKSHOP

	An enormous WOODWORKING SHOP, fully tricked-out with state-of-the-
	art table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes.

	An antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of
	expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked
	against the rear wall ...

	Jars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches
	cram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is
	RAYMOND CALITRI, 59 ...

	He wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A
	Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a
	cobra. The liegelord of downtown...

	And now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a
	wide panel of maple ... Atley Jackson is here as well ... As noisy
	as it is out in the yard, in here, once the door is closed, it's
	as SILENT-as a tomb...

	A BANK OF MONITORS on one wall show the cars being crushed and
	disassembled in the yard. Memphis is led into the room.

	Calitri nods and Dog-face leaves the room... Calitri smiles ...
	Examines his fresh cut...

				CALITRI
		Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...
			(looks at his clothes;)
			frowns)
		'though I do I recall you as a man
		with style. You remember your old
		friend, Atley -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		How ya doing?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Good to see you, Memphis --

				CALITRI
		So. What do we owe the honor -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		It's about my brother ... Kip...

				CALITRI
		Yes ... Kip ...

	He says the name like other men say "cancer." The phone on
	his desk BLINKS. Calitri picks it up. Listens. Looks at
	one of the monitors. Where the Mexican man is talking to
	several Calitri EMPLOYEES. Calitri hangs up...

				CALITRI
		Excuse me one moment, Randall ...

	And he picks up a MORTISE CHISEL on his way out. Palming it ...

	INT. GARAGE - THE MEXICAN MAN

	is sobbing. As Raymond Calitri marches toward him, glancing at the
	bloodied windshield.

				CALITRI
		You bring this to me in this
		condition? Blood and guts all
		over it? You make me complicit?
		On my property? Who taught you
		how to think? And worst of all:
		weren't there supposed to be two
		Hondas?

				THIEF
		Please ...

	And Calitri, rapid-fire, PUNCTURES the man's belly and chest and
	legs with the chisel, old-school prison-shiv style ... Until the
	man is on the floor, howling ...

				CALITRI
		Stupid sonuvabitch...

	INT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP

	Memphis can-see this from one of the monitors. He looks at
	Atley...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after
		himself ...

				MEMPHIS
		Jesus ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		The business has changed...

	Calitri is back, wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag.

				CALITRI
		Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.

				MEMPHIS
		I don't want him hurt...

	Calitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop...

				CALITRI
		I'm proud of this work. The bird
		feeder. The wagon wheel planter.
		The dollhouse. The drop-leaf movable
		server...

	He gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork. Then
	gestures to the yard...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Metal. Steel. It's cold. Ugly. Wood
		is warm. Clean. Provided by nature.
		To see a piece of furniture take shape.
		It's like watching a child grow ...

	Memphis glances to Atley... Atley shrugs ...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm sure you're working your way to
		the point.  I'll wait right here ...

	Calitri blinks. Smiles. Nods...

				CALITRI
		My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require
		the best. I insist on the best. I only
		engage the best.  Your brother. His
		friends. They came to me. They wanted my
		paper. He was your brother. You were the
		best. Now. They've brought so much
		goddamn heat down, I may not be able to
		fill this order. Which would be very bad
		for me. Which in turn, is very bad for
		them...

				MEMPHIS
		I could kill you. That occurred to me.
		When I first heard about this. That I
		would kill you ...

				CALITRI
		Grow up. You don't kill people like me.
		People like me die in their sleep at
		87 ... Do you know why? Because if
		you did kill me, and everyone knew it
		was you - for the next ten years they'd
		be finding pieces of those you love
		scattered all over California ...

	Memphis nods, notes a PISTOL, resting on a shelf nearby.

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		No, no. You don't kill me, because
		you can't. You don't take your brother
		and run, because we'd find him. You
		don't go to the-police, because we have
		friends there, too. You do nothing:
		except deal with me.

	Memphis eyes him...

				MEMPHIS
		I can come up with the front money.
		Pay you back...

				CALITRI
		Were it only that easy. I have
		obligations. The order needs to be
		filled...

	Calitri takes a manila ENVELOPE from his desk... Hands it to
	Memphis, who takes out the SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER inside.

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		On that list, you'll find fifty cars.
		Fifty. Five-zero. They range in
		age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird
		to the 1999 Toyota Camry; and in
		expense from the 1993 Volkswagen
		Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini
		Countach. Fifty cars. Five-zero.

	Memphis scans the list ... Looks up at Calitri ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		There is a container ship in Long
		Beach Harbor. Pier 14. Ready to be
		loaded with 4-car-per shipping
		containers, false-walled and
		customsprofiled as motor oil
		designated. The ship leaves in four
		days for South America and the
		men who've tendered me this contract ...

				MEMPHIS
		They gave you only four days?

				CALITRI
		They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it
		with your brother and his crew, who not
		only lost what pitiful few they managed
		to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our
		endeavor, making this even more difficult
		to achieve ...

	Memphis scans the list ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Four days. 50 cars. I'm paying 200
		thousand dollars ...

	Now Memphis looks up...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm not interested --

				CALITRI
		I knew you'd say that.

				MEMPHIS
		I'm just here about my brother.

				CALITRI
		I knew you'd say that, too --

	Calitri smiles ... Memphis 'looks at him... At Atley Realizing
	the trap ...

				MEMPHIS
		Sound it out for me.

				CALITRI
		Your brother has four days. Fifty
		cars. Five-zero. For that he gets
		200 large ...

				MEMPHIS
		And if he doesn't make it -- ?

	Calitri goes to one corner of the shop... Takes a tarp off
	of a full couch MAHOGANY CASKET...

				CALITRI
		I made this, too. My first one.
		Brass extension handles, not plated.
		The coverings are silk, not rayon.
		Expensive hardwood. And lined with
		spray green Lorraine crepe ...

	Memphis waits, knowing where this is going --

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In
		case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning,
		if that ship sets off without my
		fifty ... Kip will take up permanent
		residence in this box ...

	Calitri WALL SWITCH and the a corrugated steel SLIDING DOOR is
	RAISED, revealing a LOADING DOCK facing the back of the yard... Two
	MEN are working out there... DIGGER AND BUTZ scuzzy dudes, mid-30s
	and dressed in dirty coveralls ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		Come here for a second, boys --

	And they come over --

				DIGGER
		Evenin', Mr. C. --

				CALITRI
		Digger, Butz: let me introduce
		you to Randall Raines. Used to
		head up the dandiest ring in
		Southern Cal. Left us
		for parts unknown. Randall, this
		is Digger. And that's Butz -

				DIGGER
		Hi, Randall --

	Memphis says nothing. Calitri grins ... Nods to Digger an Butz,
	who go back to work...

				CALITRI
		Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial.
		They're good boys ...

	Memphis' look is cold and furious ... Plaintive:

				MEMPHIS
		I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...

				CALITRI
		"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or
		the summer to end. But we
		don't get to choose these things...

	Atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. Calitri
	turns to Memphis...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		"Nothing that's forced can ever be
		right." Old woodworking expression.
		I really don't care how the 50
		get onto my ship ... I just care
		that they do. You decide.

	With that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up
	an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and
	beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer.

	EXT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

	A small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill
	overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ...

	INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE

	Helen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We
	see a CRIME SCENE ...

				REPORTER
		... the car-jacking, which left Ramona
		Sullivan, the 44-year-old mother of
		three, dead, occurred last night at ...

	Memphis glances to the TV... Grimaces ... He looks out the window
	... At the SEDAN parked below...

	EXT. RAINES' HOUSE - NIGHT

	Memphis comes out ... Moves to the sedan parked across the street
	... it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

	They get out of the car... The view of San Pedro from up here is a
	spectacular bedspread of lights ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		When'd you get to town, Raines?

				MEMPHIS
		The other day....

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		What for?

				MEMPHIS
		No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I
		heard we got Shaquille ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		Where you been, anyway?

				MEMPHIS
		Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my
		collection of refrigerator magnets ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		You seem a little hinked-up ...

				MEMPHIS
		Not at all ...

	He and Castlebeck lock eyes ... Castlebeck takes a pear from his
	coat pocket ... Sets to polishing it ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I remember us having made some
		kind of deal, Randall. I don't
		remember this deal having some kind
		of time-limit. I look at you -
		here - in my town - and I'm
		confused...

				MEMPHIS
		A little family emergency --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I hope it's not your dear sweet
		mother...

				MEMPHIS
		No...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Or your baby brother. What was his
		name?

				MEMPHIS
		Kip.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling.
		Named for the English writer
		of stories about India ...
		He bites into his pear ...
		Memphis says nothing, waits ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		I got a rash of thefts.  A new crew is
		making noise. We recovered a big take -
		last week...

				MEMPHIS
		And this has what to do with me?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I don't know. But you shouldn't
		be here. Take care of your business.
		I'll give you 24 hours. And
		then I don't want to see your face.
		Ever again. Make a fool of me
		once, that's my bad. Make a fool of
		me twice. That's really my
		bad, and I'll kick your ass from
		here to India ...

	Castlebeck gives him a long look... As they walk back to the car...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Good. Cos you know how it plays.
		Six years ago, I let you go free. But
		the next time ... The next time sends
		you away for'a long, long while ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		By the time you get out, asshole, there
		won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin'
		around in space ships ...

	He laughs... And they drive off ... Memphis watching them go ...
	once they're gone... He walks ...

	EXT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - BACK ALLEY EXIT - NIGHT

	Kip comes out of the club... Toby follows ...

				TOBY
		You goin' home?

				KIP
		Yeah... You want a ride...

				TOBY
		Sure -

				KIP
		How'd you get here? Your Moms give you
		ride -- ?

				TOBY
		Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.

				KIP
		You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?

				TOBY
		I dunno. It was right here. Someone
		musta' boosted it back...

				KIP
		Damn crooks is everywhere --

	They smile...And go to Kip's TRANS AM...

				TOBY (cont'd)
		Memphis seemed weird, huh? What's with
		them clothes? He a farmer now or
		something?

	And this seems funny to Kip... He smiles..

				KIP 
		Yeah. Except the only thing he's growing
		is old...

	And they are fronted by TWO GOONS ... Who toss them up against the
	wall...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What do you want -- ?

	One of the goons SOCKS Toby in the gut. Toby doubles over. Kip
	strains to intervene, but his goon holds him back --

				KIP
		Don't you do that! You leave him alone!

				GOON
		Shaddup, Raines

				KIP
		He's got nothing to do with this --

	And the goon punches him in the face. And Kip goes down. And out.

				GOON
		Get him in the car

	EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

	Kip comes to. In his car. Hot white lights blind him. The Trans
	Am is in the crusher. FIGURES above him. Calitri. The goons ...

				CALITRI
		Hello, Kip --

	Kip tries to get out. The doors are pinned by the forklift.

				KIP
		Lemme out of this --

				CALITRI
		Were it only that easy --

				KIP
		We can still do it --

	Calitri nods ... And the crusher presses ... The roof caves a bit
	... Kip is close to scrunch ...

				CALITRI
		No you can't. Flies on sherbert is what you
		remind me of. Because just being attracted
		to something, doesn't mean you belong...

	INT. CALITRI'S WOODSHOP

	Atley is here, watching Calitri and Kip. one of the monitors. He's
	miserable. But there is nothing he can do.

	EXT. SCRAPYARD - NIGHT

	Kip continues to struggle free...

				KIP
		Listen, Calitri --

				CALITRI
		Call me "Ray." Better yet: call me
		"asshole." Cos that's how you've
		treated me --

				KIP
		I get out of this I'm gonna fuck
		you up --

	Calitri does have to admire the stones on the kid. But. Another
	nod. Another crusher-press. Another scrunch...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Calitri -- !

	Nothing. Silence. Kip peers through the slit that the
	side window has become ... Only they are gone ... And there
	is another awful NOISE ... Kip strains to discern its
	origin ... Only he can't get the angle ...

	We can. It's a huge CRANE, tipped with a GRIPPING CLAW... It is
	maneuvered over the Trans Am... Grasps it. . . And LIFTS IT 
	INTO THE AIR ... Kip, terrified, inside ...

	And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of
	the harbor, we CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - KITCHEN

	Memphis is at the kitchen table. The list of cars before him. He's
	making notations. He gets to his feet ... He goes to check on his
	mother ... She's asleep in her room... He closes the door ...

	And goes back to the kitchen. He goes to a framed PHOTOGRAPH - of
	he and Kip. Earlier times. Happier times.

	When there is an enormous THUD! From outside. Memphis goes to a
	window. Sees a RAMP TRUCK unloading a gnarled blob of metal.
	Memphis runs outside. Just as the ramp truck drives off ...

	Memphis goes to the mangled Trans Am... Leans down ... And there's
	Kip ... Seriously smooshed in the flattened car.

				MEMPHIS
		Kip -- ?

				KIP
		Yeah ...

				MEMPHIS
		You all right -- ?

				KIP
		I think so. There's things I can't
		feel right now. Like my feet. But ...
		You think you can get me outta this,
		Memphis? I'd appreciate it -

				MEMPHIS
		Just hold-on there --

	Memphis goes to the garage ... Finds a crowbar, an acetylene
	TORCH, tin-snips ... He goes back to the wrecked car... And sets
	to work... He looks at Kip ... Shakes his head...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		So you want to run that part by me
		again about things being "all
		sweetness and light..."

				KIP
		This has nothing to do with any
		of that --

				MEMPHIS
		Oh. You maybe have more than one
		enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?

				KIP
		All my enemies own car crushers. 
		It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...

				MEMPHIS
		Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost
		there...

	Indeed... Memphis has freed him ... Kip crawls from the wreckage
	... His clothes in tatters... Blood seeps from a variety of
	contusions ... He limps ... Memphis helps him to the guest house
	...

	INT. KIP'S GUEST HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	Small, cluttered... Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant,
	Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering
	Lamborghini Espada, etc. There's a fish tank... And a big-screen
	TV, on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed
	Boston Celtic fast-break...

	Memphis sits on a ratty couch before the TV... Kip comes out of
	the bedroom... He's changed clothes ... He wears clunky fur-lined
	MOON BOOTS, leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt ... He looks
	slightly ridiculous...

	Throughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's
	seeing him for the very first time ... And waiting for the
	inevitable crack...

				MEMPHIS
		You okay -- ?

				KIP
		Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer,
		man -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Sure --

	And Kip limps toward the refrigerator ... He comes back with two
	beers ... Hands one to Memphis ... Glances at the TV --

				KIP
		you like Kobe's game? I do. You
		think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do.
		He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's
		got that going for him --

	And a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed ... Kip grabs a towel
	... Presses it to his head --

				MEMPHIS
		You sure you're okay -- ?

				KIP
		Yeah, man. Where is your beer?

	Memphis holds it up ... Kip nods ... There are a pile of IGNITIONS
	on the table ... Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip
	it...

				KIP
		Cool. So you're living up North?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah -

				KIP
		I heard you were pumping gas -

				MEMPHIS
		Something like that -

				KIP
		You're kind of cultivating a new look.

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah --

	Beat ... They watch the game ... Kip replaces the soaked towel
	with another ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Maybe you need a stitch --

				KIP
		Nah. It's a scratch.

				MEMPHIS
		Okay --

	Beat ...

				KIP
		Hey, you want something to eat ?

				MEMPHIS
		What do you got ... ?

	And Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... Limps over to the
	'fridge ... Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at
	cool ... Kip peers into the 'fridge ...

				KIP
		Not much. I got olives. You like
		olives?
		Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes
		the Calabrese. It's more mellow

	And he brings over a bowl of olives.

				MEMPHIS
		There's certainly a time and a place
		for a mellow olive -

				KIP
		Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --

	And they nibble on them. Kip bites into one ... And the juice
	stings his cracked lip ... But he disguises his grimace as an
	appreciative nod...

	And for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an
	ashtray... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		So what are you gonna do?

				KIP
		About what?

				MEMPHIS
		"About what?"

				KIP
		About Calitri? No worries, man.
		I'll call him. He's a reasonable
		dude ...

				MEMPHIS
		I can see that -

	And Memphis glances out the window. To the crushed car. Kip
	catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		You have everything ... under
		control?

				KIP
		Yeah. He just wants to know I'm
		still on it. He needs reassurance.
		All these big swinging dicks do.
		No worries. I won't let him get
		into our Kool-Aid...

	Kip shrugs ... Picks up another olive... Remembers the pain' of
	the last one... Drops it back in the bowl ... Memphis is staring
	at him, disgusted... Kip feels it ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		What happened to you?

				KIP
		What?

	And now Memphis gets to his feet ... Paces the place...

				MEMPHIS
		You just got crushed in a car. You're
		bleeding all over your self. And you
		sit there - eating olives and talking
		basketball, as if, at this very
		moment, people weren't plotting
		your demise ...

				KIP
		C'mon, man... My "demise..."
			(chuckles)
		Overreaction

				MEMPHIS
		"Over--"  You know - I can maybe
		understand, since I been gone, you
		taking up this dumb-ass life of
		crime, and for that I can partly
		blame myself. But what is baffling
		to me, is how, since I been gone,
		you've become a complete and total
		moron--

				KIP
		Hey, now -

				MEMPHIS
		He's gonna kill you -- !

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You can handle it?

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You can handle it?

				KIP
		I can handle it --

				MEMPHIS
		You?

				KIP
		Me.

				MEMPHIS
		You?

				KIP
		Me...

	Beat ... Hold the look ... Kip shifts in his chair ... Even this
	hurts... He tries to hide the wince ... Memphis goes to the 
	window, looks out at the harbor below... Beat ... Then:

				KIP (cont'd)
		Why? You think you can help me?

	And he turns back to Kip ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What can you do? You haven't done
		anything in six years but pump gas 
		and go overall shopping. And 
		the cars, they've changed ...
		There's new shit. Computer chip
		keys and sophisticated alarms and
		I don't think, an old guy, could much
		bypass 'em...

				MEMPHIS
		You don't think so, huh?

				KIP
		Not really ... But you know... Maybe
		I'm wrong ...

	And the brothers look at each other ... In the pale glow of the
	TV... For a long beat ... And then we'll CUT TO:

	EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - CANNERY / FISH AUCTION - DAY

	A rack of eel and OCTOPUS hung out to dry in the salty sun ...

	Memphis walks with Atley Jackson past the bustling commercial
	fishing hubbub: Portuguese FISHERMEN unloading albacore and
	bluefin from their ship's hold; Greek FISHERMEN emptying mackerel
	and halibut from their nylon trawl nets; their WOMEN gut, clean
	and fillet ...

	As they walk, Atley is selecting FISH from the various MARINERS
	... Who wrap it up for him... He places it in a leather satchel
	... Everyone seems to know him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Nicolo, how's the yellowtail today?

	An old FISHERMAN, who speaks broken English, wraps up several
	steaks...

				FISHERMAN
		Very nice, Atley. Very nice ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		You can't get it any fresher than this,
		Memphis ... From the sea to my
		skillet ... Nothing in between...

				MEMPHIS
		What's with the fish thing -- ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		We can learn something from our Asian
		friends. They smoke a thousand
		cigarettes a day; they're completely
		stressed and overworked; they drink
		like, well ...

				MEMPHIS
		Fish.

				ATLEY JACKSON
		And they still have the lowest rate of
		cancer of anywhere in the world. You
		know why? All they eat is seafood.

				MEMPHIS
		Also, never underestimate the restorative
		powers of "Karaoke."

				ATLEY JACKSON
		I do a poaching number. Six-ounce
		fillets in a saucepan of brine. In
		8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn
		wedding. Plain but flavorful. And
		it's a good way to show off my
		Hollandaise sauce ...

				MEMPHIS
		You have a Hollandaise sauce ?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		I do ...
			(laughs)
		Christ, what happened to us ?

				MEMPHIS
		Speak for yourself, boss I don't
		have a Hollandaise sauce

				ATLEY JACKSON
		No, but you dress like an asshole ...

	They walk...

				MEMPHIS
		I think about that night a lot...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Me, too. Every time I walk...

				MEMPHIS
		How they were just there ... Waiting on
		us ... The fix was definitely in ...

	Nothing from Atley... They walk ... Memphis looks at him.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Yeah, you know: I just. I just
		never really thanked-you. I meant
		to. I just want you to
		know...

	Memphis nods. Atley shrugs, and selects some halibut
	filets.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Tell him it's on ...

	Atley looks at him...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Yeah -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and
		them Tell him it's on

	Atley nods...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Any idea how you're gonna go at it?

	Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head... FADE TO BLACK.

	As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART II - BACK TO WRONG

	EXT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

	The hustle and bustle of a full-service auto restoration
	operation ...

	Dig the 157 Chevy, as an orange diamond tuck and roll with
	orange fur interior is installed... Dig the 153 Corvette
	as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils
	and airshocks ... Dig the 150 Merc, as its chrome is
	stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes
	brazed...

	All under the watchful eye of...

	OTTO HALLIWELL

	Late 60s. A feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the
	question: how the hell did they manage to rock together
	Yoda and the ghost of Walter Huston... ?

	But he remains the Zen master of cars and all that cars are, were
	and can be ...

	His mixed-breed MUTT - Hemi - licks his balls in one corner

	Otto is currently AIRBRUSHING a candy-colored, variegated DESIGN
	on the deck lid of a Camaro ... It is painstaking work ... But he
	is an artist ...

	His woman - JUNIE - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand
	dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse ...

	Memphis wanders in...

	Otto sees Memphis ... Drops his brush... He walks over to Memphis
	... Takes him in his arms ... Hugs him close... Actually waltzes
	him a few steps ...

	Memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone
	through ...

				OTTO
		Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life
		returning to bid a final farewell?
			(holds him at arm's length)
		And have my angels completely lost
		their fashion sense -- ?
			
				MEMPHIS
		Hello, Otto ...

				OTTO
		You remember Junie?

				MEMPHIS
		Of course. Hi, Junie --

				JUNIE
		Hello, Memphis -

				MEMPHIS
		What happened here -- ?

				OTTO
		Whatever do you mean?

				MEMPHIS
		The chop-shop... Where are the stripped
		cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The
		part bins?

				OTTO
		What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of
		killing them. I woke up one morning and thought
		I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of
		resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive.
		There are so few things in this life, we can
		prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't
		have to...

	He calls over to the MEXICAN MAN working on the pick-up ...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black
		acrylic lacquer before laying out the
		flames ... And fill the cab top with mylar
		flakes ... They'll sparkle like stars ...
			(turns to Memphis)
		Randall, Randall, Randall ... You look
		splendid ...

				MEMPHIS
		You, too, Otto

	And Otto goes back to the Camaro ... To finish his work...

				OTTO
		I heard rumors you were back. About
		Kip ...

				MEMPHIS
		He's gotten involved --

	Otto looks up frustrated... To Junie

				OTTO (O.S.)
		I can't concentrate. Play something, my
		sweetness; my reason to rise ...

	And Junie hits PLAY on a cassette deck ... And, instantly, ENGINE
	SOUNDS rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... Otto listens, as
	if it were a Mahler symphony...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le
		Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear
		how they got the engine up?
		Hear those exhaust notes? That's a
		very wide rev range... Here, it
		peaks at 5500 RPM...

	Memphis smiles ... These eccentricities are old hat...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		Raymond Calitri. He's amplified much
		sorrow on these streets ...

				MEMPHIS
		You think it can be done?

				OTTO
		Are you considering a comeback tour?

				MEMPHIS
		Tell me...

				OTTO
		It can be done. Take two days to shop;
		one to prep. I'll offer up my bible
		for a small fee. You also have to
		hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo
		Castlebeck's linkage so much so
		that he's setting up surveillance
		teams on every city block. And
		then get yourself a crew...

				MEMPHIS
		The hard part ...

				OTTO
		"A people is a detour of nature to
		get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then
		to get around them..." Nietzsche said
		that.

				MEMPHIS
		Is he still working here ?

				OTTO
		The old crew. Go find them. I can't
		help you with that. Since I've cleaned
		up the act a bit, they no longer come
		around... A pity how legitimacy makes
		you unpopular -

				MEMPHIS
		I Just don't know how happy they'll be
		to see me

	Otto has finished the Camaro ... He looks at Memphis --

				OTTO
		I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal.
		worst car ever built. Value job.
		Everything broke and I-fixed it.
		A coma car - built to German specs.
		Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head.
		On a quiet night, you could hear it
		rusting in the garage. But when that
		car was gone, I missed it. If it came
		driving back in here right now,
		there'd be tears and laughter ...

				MEMPHIS
		And the moral of that story is -- ?

				OTTO
		Go to them. They'll be happy to see
		you ... Ahhh...

	And he closes his eyes ... To listen to the Ferrari tape ...

				OTTO (cont'd)
		... 8.8:1 compression...

	We PRE-LAP Simon And Garfunkel's "Baby Driver" and CUT TO:

	CLOSE ON: A SIGN READING: "PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL"

	atop a moving DODGE ARIES K. Which is nearly SIDE-SWIPED by an
	oncoming PICK-UP. A MAN HOWLS IN TERROR...

	INT. DODGE - MOVING - CITY STREETS - DAY

	A timid CHINESE GIRL - JENNY, 23 - negotiates the vehicle at
	10 & 2. Riding shotgun, her howling instructor is DONNY ASTRICKY - 41,
	whom we remember from six years ago. Now he's paunchy, with Ernie
	Borgnine tough-guy-warmth. At one time, he kicked out the 
	jams. Now he teaches driver's ed...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Pull over! Pull her the hell over!

	Jenny pulls the car over in a lopsided lurch...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Put it in PARK. Remember how
		to do that? It's the big "Pff.

	She parks it. He stabs at the side-view mirror ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		"Objects May Appear Closer
		Than They Seem." Can you say
		that for me?

				JENNY
		I'm sorry.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You ain't sorry. You're a horrible
		driver... You can't strap into
		your seat belt, without almost
		getting creamed by a bus ...

	She starts to cry... Donny softens ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Aw, c'mon. It's no big deal.
		You can't drive. You can't.
		Time to acknowledge it and move on. I
		can't swim. I know I can't. So you
		know what I do? I stay the fuck outta
		the pool ...

	EXT. PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL - DAY

	Memphis waits outside ... The Aries K comes crawling toward him.
	Donny gets out of the car ... Sees Memphis ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...

				MEMPHIS
		How you doing, man?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		All I get are the Orientals. They can
		build 'em, but they can't drive
		'em So? What are you doing here?
		What's with the outfit -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		You know where the others are?

	Donny frowns... Looks close at Memphis ... Then:

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Most of 'em are gone. The Dyar Boys are
		doing a nickel at Chino; Henry Santoro
		and Frankie Fish are moving
		weight in Florida; Bill Doolin was
		killed in Denver... Atley
		Jackson's on the gimp and runnin'
		errands for Calitri; The Sphinx
		is still around, I guess ... Then
		of course, there's ...

	His pause is meaningful ...

				MEMPHIS
		Forget that ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this
		about anyways -- ?

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

	In a wood-panelled back room, around a conference table: Memphis
	and Donny sit... With the list before them...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Most of 'em are late-model...

				MEMPHIS
		That's right. Only 10 exotics ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		We'll have to start beating the
		bushes, find out where they live...

	Otto enters. Giggles...

				OTTO
		Some crew you got ...

				MEMPHIS
		If we put out the word. That we're
		crewing-up, for a one-time-only job...
		What do you think that'll yield?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick-
		up men. This ain't like the old days,
		Memphis. The profession has lost its..

				OTTO
		Dignity...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Yeah...

				MEMPHIS
		Well, the three of us don't'exactly
		inspire confidence...

	Beat ... Donny examines the list ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		I know. Weird, huh -- ?

	The door opens ... One of Otto's WORKERS is there...

				WORKER
		Otto, there's someone here to --

	But they walk past: Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, Toby, Freb

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Lookit Kip. All grown up...

				KIP
		Hey, Donny --

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				KIP
		Otto called -

	Memphis looks to Otto ... Otto shrugs ...

				OTTO
		You need him...

				MEMPHIS
		No we don't -

				OTTO
		I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis.
		But how are two washed-up thieves
		and an old man supposed to boost
		50 cars in three days...

				MEMPHIS
		His criminal career has officially come
		to a close ...

				OTTO
		The conundrum still applies, of course. The
		purpose of the endeavor is to rescue
		baby brother from imminent
		death and/or a life of crime. However.
		This cannot be successfully
		carried out without baby brother's
		considerable resources, shabby
		though they may be.

	Memphis considers ... He has little choice ...

				MEMPHIS
		We do this. Then. You're finished.
		Then. You're clean

				KIP
		I like how you wallop back in here -
		after four years - and can still get all
		Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...

				MEMPHIS
		You hear me?

				KIP
		I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll
		move to the country. Open a fruit
		stand...

	Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You guys have any skills at all?

				KIP
		Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is
		our electronics expert. He's got
		some gadgets you old farts maybe
		never -heard of; Tumbler can drive
		anything with wheels, and some
		things without; Toby's a hacker,
		can do things with a computer, that
		are pretty amazing ...

				MEMPHIS
		How old are you now, Toby?

				TOBY
		Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven
		months ...

	Memphis shakes his head... Sighs ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY 
			(re: Freb)
		What about him?

				KIP
		Freb can order pizzas like nobody's
		business

	Freb starts to Protest ... Shrugs ...

				FREB
		People gotta eat ...

	Memphis looks at all of them ... Sighs...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay, then... Otto?

				OTTO
		In order to succeed, you're going
		to have to go old-school. one night
		boost. Put all your nuts in one basket.
		And...

				TUMBLER
		One night? Are you nuts?

				MEMPHIS
		You got maybe a better plan?

	Tumbler looks to Kip...

				KIP
		You spread it out ... you move around...
		So's they can't touch you... so's they
		don't know... Shadow games and shit
		...

				MEMPHIS
		"Shadow games?"

				KIP
		Shadow games ...

				MEMPHIS
		You spread it out, by the 2nd night,
		the heat are onto you. Know
		something's up. With a one-night boost,
		by the time all the cars are reported
		stolen, your ship's set sail.

	Kip and the others nod... Makes sense ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Go on, Otto -

				OTTO
		We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to
		shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still
		going to need to expand the crew...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		There's no one left ...

				OTTO
		We've got several Italian cars on the list.
		Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So
		we're gonna need a specialist ...

	Memphis looks at him. Because that's what he was afraid of.

				MIRROR MAN 
			(to Otto)
		You know of one -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah. He's knows of one all right.

	So we'll PRE-LAP The Beach Boys' "409" and CUT TO:

	INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" SALOON - NIGHT

	A SHOT GLASS, slammed down on a bar by a surly DRUNK... In a
	mariner saloon. Drunken SAILORS and FISHERMAN and NAVY TYPES.
	Sawdust on the floor. Broken beer mirrors. A rough joint...

				DRUNK
		One more, girl -

	The BARTENDER comes over.. . She is a dark-haired, heavily 
	tattooed GIRL, 26, with the faded blue world-weariness of Roy Orbison
	song... Her name is Sara Wayland... And she goes by SWAY. She
	collects the Drunk's empty glass...

				SWAY
		I think you've had enough, Billy...

				DRUNK
		Enough? I haven't even started, girl.
		Gimme another --

				SWAY
		If you leave now, Billy, you can get
		a head-start on waking up in a pool
		of your own vomit...

				DRUNK
		Listen, you little cooze--

	And the Drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle And
	Sway grabs his hand, twists it ... The Drunk groans in agony ...
	And Sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... And
	drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... Cries of
	"Attagirl, Sway!" pepper the air ...

	EXT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" - NIGHT

	Sway tosses him... The Drunk hitting the pavement ...

				SWAY
		Come back when you've learned how to
		drink, Billy --

	And she freezes ... Because standing there, is Memphis ... She
	looks at him ... Shocked is a good place to start ...

				MEMPHIS
		See you're still stealing the sailors from
		the sea --

				SWAY
		What are you doing here?

	And she heads back inside ... And he follows her...

	INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE"

	They head toward the bar...

				SWAY
			(re: his clothes)
		What's with the look?

				MEMPHIS
		The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting
		old...

				SWAY
		You look like you lost your sheep ...

	And she hops back behind the bar ...

				MEMPHIS
		You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?

				SWAY
		Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in
		here ...

				MEMPHIS
		Buy you a drink?

				SWAY
		Nope. I got a coffee. And a
		boyfriend.

	She waves to a 30-year-old CAT drinking with his buddies. He waves
	back. Memphis frowns.

				SWAY (cont'd)
		Mitch.

				MEMPHIS
		"Mitch?"

				SWAY
		Mitch.

				MEMPHIS
		So I was replaced by Mitch?

				SWAY
		No. You were replaced by Alex.
		Who was replaced by Kevin. Who
		was replaced by Vince. Who was
		replaced by Mitch...

	She smiles sourly at him...

				MEMPHIS
		Wow. And to think all I
		accomplished these past six
		years was the "LORD OF THE
		RINGS" trilogy...

	She stares at him... Shakes her head... Busies herself with her
	glassware ... Beat ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		You look great --

				SWAY
		Yeah, well, you always were a sucker
		for flawed existences ...

	ANGLE - MITCH. Watching them talk ...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		You should leave --

				MEMPHIS
		On account of Mitch?

				SWAY
		On account of me.

	He studies her... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		I've taken the spear for a lot of
		people, Sway. Including you. Can't
		we improvise a little here ... ?

				SWAY
		No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ...
		You left me, remember?

				MEMPHIS
		I left town. I didn't leave you.

				SWAY
		A distinction worth noting ...

				MEMPHIS
		And here I am...

				SWAY
		Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on
		account of any longing-for-my-touch
		on your part -

				MEMPHIS
		Kip's in trouble

	And now she looks concerned

				SWAY
		What kind of trouble -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks.
		Only the two weeks have turned into four
		days. And not a single lady has been
		snared.

				SWAY
		And you got some Italians -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Six or seven...

				SWAY
		I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't
		for a while. I've carved out something
		for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...

				MEMPHIS
		I understand -

	And the cat - MITCH - comes over with two empty pitchers

				MITCH
		Another round, Sara -

				SWAY
		Sure, Mitch -

	And she goes to the tap ... Leaving Memphis and Mitch ...

				MITCH
		How you doing, pal?

	Memphis nods ... Beat. They sit there. Regard Sway...

				MITCH (cont'd)
		She's hot, right?

				MEMPHIS
		I'd go so far as to say "lovely."

	And Mitch leans over to him, conspiratorially ...

				MITCH
		You should her face when she's having
		sex --

	And Memphis turns to him...

				MEMPHIS
		Really?

				MITCH
		Really...

				MEMPHIS
		What's it look like?

	And Memphis reaches out, and GRABS Mitch's nipple, PINCHING.
	Mitch's face curls ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted
		face? Agonized and writhing and ugly?
		Oh, now I see it, yes, yes!

	And Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ... And Sway
	comes over ...

				SWAY
		What the hell are you doing -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		If you change your mind. We're at
		Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours.
		For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's
		life on the felt. So long now ...

	And he's out of there, before Mitch's PALS can get to him.

				MITCH
		Who was that guy, Sara?

	She looks at the door ... Shrugs ...

				SWAY
		Good question ...

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - LATER - NIGHT

	Memphis, Kip, Donny, Mirror Man and Otto sit around the garage ...
	Going through the list ... Tumbler calls from the next room:

				TUMBLER
		Freb's here. Open the gate.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
			(to Otto)
		We sent him out on a solo boost. See
		what he could do ...

	Freb pulls in an '89 Cadillac Coupe De Ville ...

				FREB
		How do I look in this one?

				MIRROR MAN
		Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		How'd it go?

				FREB
		Keys were in it ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Well, that defies the point, don't it?

				MIRROR MAN
		You should ask him how he got the name
		"Freb."

				FREB
		Shaddup, man ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Get the damn thing in there and get it
		cleaned up -

	Freb pulls in. Pops the trunk. The gate is closed.

				KIP
		This is loaded with crap - get a duffel.

	He pulls out a set of golf clubs ... Freb brings over a duffel ...
	Mirror Man plucks something from the trunk ...

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		Holy shit ...

	It's a plasticine BAG - full of a WHITE POWDER...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Lemme see that -

	He pierces the skin.. Tastes ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Heroin.

				KIP
		No shit?

	And they pull back the trunk tarp ... And there are perhaps TWO
	DOZEN similar smack-filled BAGS ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		There's gotta be a million bucks worth
		here -

				TUMBLER
		We're rich. Goddamn, we're rich!

				MEMPHIS
		Where'd you pick her up?

				FREB
		In front of one of them poker parlors in
		Chinatown ...

				MEMPHIS
		Well, take it back --

				KIP
		Take it back? What do you mean take
		it back? Are you crazy, man?


				MEMPHIS
		Take it back, Freb --

				MIRROR MAN
		Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -

	Donny makes to grab the bag from Mirror Man ... But Mirror Man
	holds on ... They tug back and forth ... The bag DROPS ...
	Splitting on the ground, behind the car. Spilling heroin.

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		Now, see what you--

	But a BANG! BANG! on the front gate, gives them all pause.

				OTTO
		Who is it -- ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (O.S.)
		Castlebeck.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.

				OTTO
		one minute -- !

	And the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and
	devices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto.

	Memphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ...
	Puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only
	there's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of
	the Caddy ... But there's no time...

	For the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What are you still doing here,
		Randall?

				MEMPHIS
		Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.

	Castlebeck looks at Otto... Otto grins... Castlebeck walks around
	the garage... Taking it all in...

	Castlebeck notes the Caddy ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What's this -- ?

				OTTO
		Cadillac.

	ANGLE - the mound of heroin on the floor ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		What's wrong with it -- ?

				OTTO
		Needs brightening ...

	Castlebeck takes out a WALKIE ... Barks into it ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Run me down a tag - 329 HRO. Cadillac.

	He clicks off ... Otto and Memphis share one ... A glance to the
	smack ... Castlebeck is a mere inches from it ...

				OTTO
		No faith in our new-found goodness,
		Detective ...?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Sure. But sometimes we got to
		create some numbers. The task force
		is run by statistics, you know ...

	Before they can respond, the radio crackles ...

				RADIO (O.S.)
		329 HRO. There's no want on the license at
		this time...

	Castlebeck looks disappointed... Otto grins ... Castlebeck stares
	at the Caddy, still unconvinced...

				MEMPHIS
		You're thinking: okay, there's no want ...
		But they probably stripped its guts and
		crated 'em up, right ... ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Something like that -

	Memphis opens the driver's side door ... Gestures Castlebeck in
	... Castlebeck gets behind the wheel ...

				MEMPHIS
		Let her rip ...

	And Castlebeck starts the car...

	ANGLE - TAILPIPE ... WHOOSH! All of the heroin on the flo is blown
	away by the exhaust ... Memphis winks to Otto ... Castlebeck seems
	satisfied ... Gets out.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Okay, then. I'll catch you later,
		Randall ...

				OTTO
		Double-meaning intended, right?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Right ...

	Castlebeck stops at the gate... Turns back to them...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		It's funny. There's probably been
		five more cars stolen in the time
		I've been here ...

				MEMPHIS
		I don't think so, Detective ...

	And Castlebeck is gone. Memphis and Otto exhale big time.. The
	others come out from the back... To find Memphis and Otto dumping
	the heroin into the sink, running the tap ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Take her back to where you found her,
		Freb --

	INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Kip is in front of the TV, playing a video game. Helen Raines is
	at the kitchen table, going through a PHOTO ALBUM... Memphis comes
	home ... Hangs up his coat ...

				MEMPHIS
		Hey -

	He kisses her head ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Kip -

	Kip nods ... Plays on ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		What do you got there?

				HELEN RAINES
		The photo album. I get nostalgic around
		this time of year ...

				MEMPHIS
		What time of year?

				HELEN RAINES
		Tuesdays ...

	He smiles ... Sits down next to her ... They go through the

	PHOTOS: - childhood shots of Memphis and Kip, a younger Helen;
	Memphis at 17, in his "Ike's Garage" coveralls; 14year-old
	Memphis, an infant Kip, and their father (ROBERT RAINES) a MAN
	with bright eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old Cutlass
	442; Robert Raines ... Outside a car dealership. We can almost
	feel his strong, sure presence ...

	Memphis looks at his mother ... As she looks at the picture.

				MEMPHIS
		You ever wonder what things'd be like
		if he hadn't died?

				HELEN RAINES
		Every day. I wonder about that every day...

				MEMPHIS
		Kip and I'd probably be working at the
		dealership...
			(to Kip)
		Imagine us selling cars?

	Nothing from Kip ... Eyes glued to the TV... Memphis glances to
	his Mother ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Imagine that -- ?

				HELEN RAINES
			(salesman voice)
		And just in case you lose your keys, good
		sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim,
		free of charge ...

				MEMPHIS
		Mother -- !

	They laugh ... Look at the album ... At Robert Raines ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		I remember, every day, he'd come home
		in a different car.
		That was the greatest thing ... And
		we'd climb all over it ... Examine
		every inch of every different
		car ...

				HELEN RAINES
		I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you
		two are out there heads under hoods ...

				MEMPHIS
		You remember that, Kip?

				KIP
		I was six ...

	Memphis and Helen look at him... Then:

				MEMPHIS
		After he died ... I think that's
		what I missed most of all ... That
		there was no different cars every night ...
		When I started hanging around Otto's ...
		And he started showing me the things ...
		It was a way to kill two birds ...
		Put food on the table for you and Kip ...
		And ... Ride in different cars every
		night ... Just like when Dad was here.

	Tears stand in Helen's eyes ... Kip gets to his feet ...

				KIP
		Ancient history's two things.
		"Ancient." And "history!"

	And he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. Memphis
	turns to his mother ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma.

				HELEN RAINES 
		I know...

				MEMPHIS
		We do it. He'll get clear Once and
		for all 

	And she nods ...

	ANGLE - A PHOTO. Robert Raines. Smiling beside an Olds 98.

	EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS HIGH RISE CONDOS - DAY

	The garage door opens as a resident drives out ... And Memphis and
	Donny and Kip and Toby enter the garage ... They walk along the 
	rows of parked cars ... Searching ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost.
		No skill. No finesse. Can only take
		the car if the key is in it. That's
		not thieving. That's parking ...
		Thugs ... With the decency of dirt ...

				TOBY
		They're just cars, man ...

	To prevent Donny from biting the kid's head off, Memphis chimes in
	with:

				MEMPHIS
		This Eleanor's been living at the
		International Towers for 3 years now.

				TOBY
		Who's "Eleanor?"

				MEMPHIS
		The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.

				TOBY
		Why do you call it "Eleanor?"

				MEMPHIS
		All the vehicles get code names.
		Female names. You say "Eleanor lives
		at such and such... " and no one
		listening on the waves is the wiser ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."

				MEMPHIS
		And there she is --

	Indeed, slotted nearby is a '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 Silver with
	black top ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Hello, Eleanor --

	And he looks at her. An old friend he hasn't seen in years.

				TOBY
		It looks just like a regular Mustang --

				KIP
		Don't go there, Toby --

				MEMPHIS
		She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the
		Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine
		and got it legally rated for the street
		at 450 horsepower ... But its actual
		output is closer to 600 ...

				TOBY
		So she flies -

				MEMPHIS
		She soars -

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Grade-A unicorn ...

				TOBY
		What's a "unicorn?"

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Fabled creature. You know - the horse
		with the horn? Impossible to capture?

	Toby looks blank ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		We all got one. The single car
		that, no matter how many times
		you try to boost, something happens...
		Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner
		comes back. It's voodoo...

				TOBY
		You guys and the car thing, man --

	They head off ... Memphis turns back to the Shelby

				MEMPHIS
		See you in a few days, Eleanor --

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - BACK ROOM - DAY

	To Queen's "I'm In Love With My Car." The crew is at work, a MAZDA
	and a CADDY are parked here for practice: Tumbler is modifying a
	series of slim jims, based on the type of cars they'll be after

	Donny and Freb are in the Caddy, Freb behind the wheel Tumbler
	puts together BRIEFCASES, containing the requisite TOOLS: slim-
	jim, gizmo, screwdriver, ratchet, dent-puller, a mini-battery with
	pointy leads ...

	- Mirror Man is showing off one of his GADGETS - beepersized
	DEVICE - to Otto... They stand before a locked MAZDA.

				MIRROR MAN
		And you just stick it in the lock.
		Hit this little button ... And ...

	He does ... The door UNLOCKS ... The car's ALARM gives a weak
	chirp and dies... Otto looks at Donny ...

				OTTO
		We're dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit ...
			(to Mirror Man)
		Can I try -- ?

				MIRROR MAN
		Knock yourself out --

	Kip and Memphis are with Toby, who has his laptop out ...

				TOBY
		I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site,
		right? Then I monitored their
		incoming outside data requests,
		right? Then I got these ISDN numbers,
		right? Then I tracked them back,
		right? Then I took the one I could
		jack-up the easiest, right? Then I
		called back see, they think I'm an
		insurance company - that's where it
		looks like I'm coming from -- and
		they're sharing stats with this
		insurance company, right? So now
		they're sharing it with me, right?
		They think I'm looking for stats for
		an actuarial conference on auto-theft.
		So they let me in, right? Give me all
		these numbers. But then I don't leave,
		right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I
		just go anywhere I want.

				MEMPHIS
		So what's in there -- ?

				TOBY
		I can tell you who's gonna be on duty
		tonight. I can tell you how much gas
		they're using monthly. I can tell you
		how they used to spend that annoying
		half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...

	Memphis nods ... Fairly impressed...

				KIP
		Good work, Toby --

	Donny and Freb are inside the Caddy ... Freb's attempts to start
	it fail...

				FREB
		It just ain't happening --

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You'll get the hang of it, kid. You
		just need to remember one thing -

				FREB
		What's that?

	Donny smiles ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		On boost night? Always take along a
		good mix tape ...

	Donny smiles ... Freb frowns ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		You bring a woman back to your
		crib for some lovemaking, the
		song you put on, depends on the
		woman, the type of lovemaking you
		intend to do, right?

				FREB
		I guess ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		You got a school teacher or Nancy from
		accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone
		or James Brown. You put on
		Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got
		some wild one you just picked
		up at the track, you wouldn't put on
		Cat Stevens or James Taylor.
		You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes.
		Or, if you really wanted to
		get after it: Miles.

				FREB
		okay ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		It's the same way with cars. Different
		cars. Different tunes. You can't steal
		a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You
		gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny
		Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that
		shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman
		Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could
		lead to disaster. Got it... ?

				FREB
			(absolutely hasn't got it)
		Got it ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Good.

	And then Sway enters ... Donny gets out of the Caddy ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Whoa, whoa, whoa. Memphis went out
		and got some big game ... Hello, Sway.
		I was just telling the lads about mix
		tapes --

				SWAY
			(to Freb)
		Janis Joplin. Billie Holliday. Ella
		Fitzgerald...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Gender bias ...

	Otto is before her ... Bowing from the waist ...

				OTTO
		I've missed you, Sara Wayland --

				SWAY
		Good to see ya, Otto --

	They embrace. Memphis and Kip enter from the other room...

				KIP
		How ya doing, Sway -- ?

				SWAY
		Kip...

	She looks at Memphis ... Small nod... Small smile ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		What do you think about all this?

				SWAY
		Stick it in the drawer marked "Fool's
		Errand", right -- ?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		That's my girl --

				MEMPHIS
		That's Mirror Man ... And that's
		Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ...
		Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They
		call her "Sway."

				SWAY
		Hey -

	But the kids look high near thunderstruck ... The others laugh ...
	Go back to their work ... Memphis and Sway

				SWAY (cont'd)
		No questions. I'm here. I need the
		dough.

				MEMPHIS
		Of course ...

	She studies him... Nods ...

				SWAY
		Good. Just so we understand...

	And then she sees something at the entrance ...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		Oh, shit. You didn't --

	He follows her gaze ... To where -- A MAN, early 40s, has walked
	in. Tall, gaunt, ice-eyed. This man never speaks. And his nose is
	a gnarled blob of scar tissue ... Which is why they call him

	THE SPHINX

	And the others really don't dig his scene ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Well, well, well. The original crash
		test dummy...

	The Sphinx nods to all. Smiles warmly, but it comes out creepy.
	Freb whispers to Otto ...

				FREB
		Who's that -- ?

				OTTO
		That's The Sphinx.

				FREB 
		The Sphinx?

				OTTO
		He never says a word. And he's got
		a messed-up nose. Hence. The Sphinx.
		He's boo-koo koo-koo. But he steals like
		time ...
			(to The Sphinx)
		Hello, Sphinxy, old rum -- !

	And Otto embraces the taller man ... And the others stand
	around, offering uneasy glances to The Sphinx ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday.
		D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us
		two days to prep ... We're going to find
		the ladies on our list, find out where
		they live, when they're home; that
		they're properly insured ... Let's get
		into the vans --

				MIRROR MAN
		Where we going -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		We're going shopping -- !

	We PRE-LAP Gary Numan's new-wave rave classic "Cars".

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREETS - DAY

	A MONTAGE of the hard-core old-school preparations...

	THREE MINI-VANS drive off from Otto's Auto - Mirror Man at the
	wheel of one of them - The Sphinx and Donny with him... - Freb
	drives the 2nd van: Memphis, Sway, and Kip with him... Tumbler
	drives the 3rd van: Otto and Toby with him.

	They carry pens and NOTEBOOKS ... And, as they drive around,
	they're searching out cars ... When they see an auto that
	corresponds to the list, they take down its license plate.

	Memphis dials the cell ... Mirror Man answers on the speaker in
	his van ... Tumbler in his ... We'll CROSS-CUT the scene as
	necessary from van to van ...

				MEMPHIS
		How's it going -- ?

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		It's arright ...

	They drive on ... Till --

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		Check it out: 173 Firebird. Know
		who drove one of those ... ?

				OTTO
		Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in
		McO...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		That's being obscurest ... Who else?
		Better known. Memphis?

				MEMPHIS
		Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.

	INT. OTTO'S GARAGE - DAY

	Otto shows Freb how to disarm an alarm system by groundingout a

	Mirror Man in the Boxster... Parked, . He takes the KEY from

				MIRROR MAN
		The license plate?

				TUMBLER
		I know. "ROBIN 1."

				OTTO
		Very good. But what was the

				FREB
		Was that his first name?

				OTTO
		His first name was Thomas. Thomas
		Magnum...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Thomas Sullivan Magnum, to be exact.

	They look at Donny, impressed...

				TUMBLER
		Robin 1 ...

		Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the

				OTTO
		Ten points for our fearless leader ...
		Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of
		the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?

				SWAY
		I don't know that

				KIP
		Stumped -- !

				FREB
		Thank-God, Sway, you ain't all freaky-

	But Sway grins

				SWAY
		How about: a Corvette in

		Here's where it gets tricky ...

	A garage dealing exclusively in imports. Memphis enters...

				MEMPHIS
		Hello -- ?

	Sway slides out from beneath a Testarosa ... In her greasy
	coveralls, hair tied back, a motorhead's dream girl ...

				SWAY
		Hey.

				MEMPHIS
		What's wrong with her -- ?

				SWAY
		The right side of the engine is
		running richer than the left. And the
		scope isn't showing shit... I dunno... 

	And she goes to the sink...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		You know Annie's trouble

				MEMPHIS
		Annie -- ?



				SWAY
		You haven't been studying --

	She gestures to where the LIST of 50 is on the counter.

				SWAY (cont'd)
		137 Roadster. Custom. Lives at 1443
		Locklin in Rancho Palos Verdes ...

				MEMPHIS
		Right. Great car. One of a kind. I
		was looking forward to that boost
		myself 

				SWAY
		She was the only "Annie" you could find?

				MEMPHIS
		They only made a handful. We're lucky
		there's even one living in the area...

				SWAY
		Yeah, well ... She lives with District
		Court Judge Seymour Croft ...

	As she speaks we CUT TO:

	EXT. 1443 LOCKLIN - RANCHO PALOS VERDES - DAY

	A massive house of glass and steel in a fancy
	neighborhood. We MOVE FOR THE HOUSE. Over the fine-trimmed
	lawn.

				SWAY (O.S.)
		... and he keeps "Annie' in his
		living room... Like a work of art ...

	INTO THE SPARTAN LIVING ROOM...

	Massive framed Lichtenstein and Haring pieces on the wall
	... Surround the yellow ROADSTER, which sits up on a
	platform ... Check out JUDGE CROFT, a nasty fat man in his
	late 50s ... He sits in the nearly empty room... A complex
	system of directional lighting illuminates the Roadster
	...

				SWAY (O.S.)
		She's got 27 miles on her o-dom.
		Which is exactly how far away the
		custom shop was in 1979 when he
		bought her... He drove her home,
		never drove her again ...

	The judge gazes at the car, admiring its jet-pod
	taillamps... A MAID comes in with a tray of tea service
	... The maid crosses the Judge's line of sight... Watch
	as he curses her out, his face going beet red with fury...

				SWAY (O.S.)
		The man's a freak...

	INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS

	Sway looks at Memphis ...

				SWAY
		She's trouble --

				MEMPHIS
		I put the boys on it. They're clever
		that way...

	She nods ... Long look ...

				SWAY
		I go with you --

				MEMPHIS
		That what you want?

				SWAY
		That's what I want ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay.

	She hits the Lava soap and starts washing the grease from her
	hands ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		I missed you, you know -

				SWAY
		You mentioned that in your letters 

				MEMPHIS
		I always thought you'd follow me up.

	She shuts off the taps ... Towels her hands...

				SWAY
		We were good when you bailed, weren't we?

				MEMPHIS
		Very good...

				SWAY
		Cos there were those dark days, when
		I figured - my God, how easy it was
		for him to just give it up; to make the
		deal; take the rot for the whole crew ...
		And give me up in the process.

				MEMPHIS
		No way ...

				SWAY
		No ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		No ...

	And he holds out a hand to her ... And she puts her greasesmeared
	towel into it ...

				SWAY
		Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me,
		Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and
		you're the jim that did the leaving. So
		save the sanctimonious shit for someone
		who believes. The only reason I ride with
		you, is cause I don't want to spend the
		whole night with any of them other creeps!

				MEMPHIS
		Oh. Okay. Right.

	EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

	Memphis walks out... Going over to the PARKED CAR across the
	street ... Castlebeck...

				MEMPHIS
		I'm on the move -

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Your girl works in there ...

				MEMPHIS 
		Not my girl anymore

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Yet your still here ... I gave
		you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...

				MEMPHIS
		What do you want from me?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Honestly? I want to - once every
		few months - get into my car. Pack
		a lunch. And drive on up to Chino.
		On visiting day. Bring you some
		magazines. Maybe some almond clusters.
		And see you all bright and shiny in
		your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...

	And with that, he starts his car ... Drives off... Memphis gazing
	after him...

	INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

	Memphis drives. Kip beside him. They drive in silence. At last
	coming to:

	EXT. TEN-TON TRANSFER COMPANY - FRONT GATES

	A huge trucking company warehouse. Kip gets out. Bolt-cuts the
	chain-fence out front.

	And Memphis drives on in, passing the long rows of gargantuan
	CAR CARRIERS here. He picks one ...

				MEMPHIS
		This one ...

	He slim-jims the door ... But the ALARM goes off ... A wild
	whooping alarm ... Deafening... Try as he might, he can't get it
	off. He pops the trunk. Looks for wires ... Nothing.

	Then, at once, it goes off. Memphis turns. Kip is there. He holds
	a little DEVICE.

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		What's that thing -- ?

				KIP
		Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little
		something the R & D department came up with ...

				MEMPHIS
		How long were you gonna let me try and
		stop it...?

				KIP
		After a while, it became a little pathetic ...
		Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...

				MEMPHIS
		Thank-you ...

				KIP
		De nada ...

	He gets behind the wheel. Pops the ignition. The truck's flipping
	stack belches. Memphis climbs in next to him.

				MEMPHIS
		Ain't we good-timing here ... ?

				KIP
		The family that steals together, deals
		together...

				MEMPHIS
		Dad'd be proud --

				KIP
		Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...

				MEMPHIS
		What era was that -- ?

				KIP
		The era when crime didn't pay --

				MEMPHIS
		As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?

				KIP
		Price of doing business...

				MEMPHIS
		What about just getting a job, 9 to 5,
		five days a week, that whole mystery
		achievement -- ?

				KIP
		It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows,
		Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we
		make mad bank, my boys are down, the
		girlies come around and the boosts are
		a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get
		jacked-up every now and then - but ain't
		that a small price to pay for never,
		never-ever, having to say "paper or
		plastic?"

	And he grins and puts the truck into gear. And off they go

	INT. OTTO'S AUTO - GARAGE - NIGHT

	The Replacements chime in with "Someone Take The Wheel." Memphis
	and the crew ... All but Sway are present.

	Tumbler and Mirror Man follow Memphis to one side of the shop ...
	To a window ... He gestures outside to where we see and UNMARKED
	CAR and the orange glow of two cigarettes ... Staking them out ...

				MEMPHIS
		We've got to shake them tomorrow
		night. I'm making that your problem.
		That's called delegation of duties.
		You like it -- ?

	Mirror Man and Tumbler regard the cops ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Sure, man --

	And they follow him back into the garage ...

				MEMPHIS
		Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each
		team has been assigned their ladies.
		The teams are: me and Sway. Donny
		and Freb. Kip and Tumbler. Mirror
		Man, you and The Sphinx ... 

	Mirror Man looks horrified ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Aw, c'mon, man ...

	The Sphinx grins at him...

				TOBY
		What about me?

				MEMPHIS
		You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto
		abreast of our progress ...

				TOBY 
		How come ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		Because you should be home with
		Nintendo, listening to The Spice
		Girls, little man ...

				TOBY
		Come on. Kip, talk to the guy

				KIP
		There's no talkin' to him --

	And Otto and Junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some
	paper cups ...

				OTTO
			(cup raised)
		To a safe and successful session of bumping
		fenders and trading paint.

	Everyone toasts ... Drinks ... Donny goes to the tape deck... Hits
	PLAY ... And "Little Deuce Coupe" by The Beach Boys BLASTS.
	("Little Deuce Coupe/You don't know what I got...")

	And all of our guys dance to it ... Singing along ... Otto dances 
	with Junie; Tumbler with Toby; even The Sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto
	parts ...

				BEACH BOYS 
		"Well, I'm not braggin,' babe So don't put
		me down But I got the fastest set of wheels
		in town, etc."

	Yes, it's the requisite rock-to-an-oldie bit ... But God, it's
	fun. As they exorcise some pre-boost jitters.  Only Kip stands
	aside from the frolic ... We watch them dance and laugh and sing
	for a bit ...

	And then Atley Jackson is there. And behind him, another Calitri
	GOON... And, finally, Calitri himself stands there.
	Someone kills the music. They all look at him... Donny and The
	Sphinx nod to Atley ...

				CALITRI
		This is how you're spending my time?
		Having a sock hop?

				MEMPHIS
		Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the
		community ...

				CALITRI
		Look at this. A multi-generational gathering
		of scumbags ...

				OTTO
		So saith the God of Scumbags --

				CALITRI
		Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no
		cars have yet to be delivered. And there's
		only one more night ...

				OTTO
		Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I
		wonder, if delivery isn't made?

	Calitri ignores him... Looks at Kip ...

				CALITRI
		With all the free time I've had not
		counting cars as they're loaded onto
		my ship, I've managed to sand the
		cedar inside your box, Kip. This 
		will protect you from the anaerobic
		bacteria, that normally thrives in
		an airless; environment. Thus
		prolonging decay ...

	He smiles ... And Kip actually makes a run for him... Only to be
	held back by Tumbler and Donny ...

				MEMPHIS
		Get out of here, Ray --

				CALITRI
		One more night --

				MEMPHIS
		Get out --

				CALITRI
		I hope you know what you're doing. God help
		you if you don't ...

	And with that, he leaves, his goons following. Leaving our

	crew to stare after him ... And then we FADE TO BLACK...

		Watch and learn, old-timer --

	As Mirror Man points the antennae out the window ... A TOY CAR - a
	1970 HEMI 'CUDA replica ... Radio-operated, the car speeds along
	the curb outside, using parked cars as cover... She really cooks...

				DONNY
		The hell are you doing?

				MIRROR MAN
		Delivering ordnance. Y2K-style.

	ANGLE - THE 'CUDA. As it cruises along. Is stopped by a discarded
	40 oz. empty... But Mirror Man maneuvers and its back on track ...
	At last, parking jammed up to the front, right tire of DRYCOFF AND
	HAWKINGS' UNMARKED.

				TUMBLER
		The Hemi Has Landed --

				DONNY
		Big deal. Now what?

				MIRROR MAN
		What we call: fun and shit.

	And he hits a button on his radio control ... ANGLE - the model
	'Cuda. Wedged in front of the tire. As a quartet of thin steel,
	razor-tipped SPIKES thrust out from the Shaker hood ... A fraction
	away from the tire's skin ... Mirror Man and Tumbler appear
	satisfied ...

	IS REMOVED, Club still on it. Memphis pops in the steering wheel
	he brought, jerry-bangs the rivets ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Let's cruise --

	And they do ... Sway rolls down her window ... Tosses something as
	they drive off -

	ANGLE - THE OLD STEERING WHEEL. "Club" firmly affixed to it. On
	the ground, in the Mazda's old parking place...

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREETS - TUMBLER AND KIP

	as they systematize the cars they're responsible for... Tumbler
	drops Kip off by a Porsche ... We recognize it as one of the cars
	Mirror Man cut a key for in the valet scam. Kip selects the key
	from a series of them hooked into his briefcase. He gets out. Keys
	the car. He's in. He's off ...

	TUMBLER - meanwhile, has driven to a Volvo C70... He, too, has the
	key ... He's in ... He's off ...

	EXT. THE CAR CARRIER - PARKING LOT

	Kip drives the Porsche onto it, Tumbler enters the lot in the
	Volvo. QUICK DISSOLVES as they fill it up... Two Honda Accords,
	another Volvo, a Toyota 4-runner, etc.

	EXT. COMMERCIAL WAREHOUSE - SAN PEDRO - NIGHT

	All is silent. Chainlink fence topped with swirls of lethal-looking
	barbed wire. Mirror Man and The Sphinx are here.

	Mirror Man goes to the main entry fence doors ... He boltcuts the

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - NIGHT

	A Porsche 911 Cabriolet is parked...

	Donny and Freb look at it ...

				FREB
		Diane 1.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Very good. Think you can get in without
		waking her up -- ?

				FREB
		Yeah.

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		That's an after-market alarm. Can't
		just cut her wires ...

	He pops his briefcase ... Takes out some gear ... Gets out ...
	Moves for Diane 1 ...

	INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Helen Raines is rooting through a crowded closet. At last she
	finds what she's looking for ... A small black boxy DEVICE. She
	goes to the living room. Plugs in the box ...

	It is a POLICE SCANNER... And it immediately starts to pop and caw
	... Helen sits down ... And listens... Her face clenched with
	worry ...

	EXT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Mirror Man works the thick steel door ... He's got a sledge and
	center punch... He knocks the knob off with the sledge and then
	goes to work with an ELECTRIC DRILL ...

				MIRROR MAN
		This is some state-of-the-art shit,
		kid. The drill breaks the sockets,
		which force back the spindle and release
		the lock ...only it doesn't seem to be
		working... And The Sphinx is getting
		impatient ...

	EXT. HARBOR WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Tumbler and Kip pull in with their car carrier ... Full... They

	INT. OTTO'S

	As Otto SWIPES NAMES FROM THE BOARD...

	INT. MEMPHIS' VAN - MOVING

	Memphis and Sway... They ride in silence ... She busies herself by
	looking through the consul. Comes up with a tube of LIPSTICK. Uses
	the visor mirror to apply it.

				MEMPHIS
		Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush,
		floral-print dresses?

				SWAY
		Deodorant.

	And she looks at him... She's really laid the lipstick on
	thick ... But it's oddly effective ...

				MEMPHIS
		Wow. Bozo, the very sexy clown --

	Beat. She looks out the window, throws the following away.

				SWAY
		So, you seeing anybody?

				MEMPHIS
		No. I had a girl. She was great. The
		problem is: great girls come along once
		every ten years. So I gotta wait
		another three years before I can even
		bother to look...

				SWAY
		She was so great, why'd you leave her?

				MEMPHIS
		Her parole officer strongly recommended 
		it ...

	She looks at him... But he's stopped the car... For Kip and
	Tumbler are waiting at the side of the street. They get in.

	EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - NIGHT

	Freb dead-shorts the alarm system, grounding it out on the car's
	own metal surface, just like they taught him... He's in the
	Porsche ... It's just that he can't figure out how to get her
	started ... The passenger door opens ... Donny...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		What's the matter?

				FREB
		It's all microchips and shit ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Yeah?

	He holds up a screwdriver. Jams it in the steering column.

				DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
		I don't care what kind of car
		it is. How fancy; how expensive;
		how new. You pop the collar -
		it's 1966 all over again ... !

	He pops the collar - exposing an ordinary ignition system.

				FREB
		Cool ...

	INT. MEMPHIS' VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

	Memphis drives ... Sway, Kip, Tumbler with him...

				KIP
		So we loaded all of the keyed cars up and
		dropped 'em ... It was cake ... 8 cars,

	Memphis looks at him in the rear-view ...

				MEMPHIS
		Having fun, Kip?

				KIP
		Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...
			(realizes his gaffe)
		I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary,
		it sucks ...

	Memphis looks at Sway, shakes his head... Kills the lights ... And
	they pull in to

	EXT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Where Mirror Man is still struggling with the lock, his drills
	and punches, scattered about ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Just give me another --

	only The Sphinx shoves him aside ... Pulls the GUN from his 
	holster and BLANG! blasts open the lock...

	Mirror Man stares at the opened door ...

				MIRROR MAN
		Oh, I get it: old school.

	And Memphis and the others drive up ...

				MEMPHIS
		How's it going?

				MIRROR MAN
		It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are
		swapping trade secrets ...

	And in they go --

	INT. WAREHOUSE

	Dark as pitch. Flashlights come on. To reveal

	ROW UPON ROW OF GLEAMING FERRARIS

	Old and new models. Daytonas and Boxers and Dinos and
	Testarossas. There must be at least fifty of them here.

	Flashlight beams dance over car after car. It's a treasure chest
	of automotive jewels ... All of our heroes are in awe. And then a
	soft whimpering. They turn. To see Sway, overcome with emotion.

				SWAY
		It's just... so... beautiful ...

	And it is Kip that puts an arm around her ... She sobs into his
	chest ... Never taking her eyes from the array of Italian grace
	... Indeed, they are all in something of trance. Memphis is the
	first one out --

				MEMPHIS
		C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can
		you prep 'em -- ?

				SWAY
		I think so... They're just... So ...

				MEMPHIS
		I know. But let's prep 'em. We could
		stay here all night... That wouldn't
		be good --

	The others are still gazing ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Let's go, people --

	And they set to work...

	EXT. NIGHT CLUB PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Donny Astricky and Freb have accessed a '61 Jag... Watch as Donny
	takes out 3 screws in the Jag's ignition and removes the whole
	thing ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		So? Tell me: how come they call you
		"Freb" anyways -- ?

				FREB
		C'mon, man ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		We're partners here --

	Freb considers ... Then, reluctantly --

				FREB
		My names "Fred." You know: Frederick?
		One drunk night, I decided to give
		myself a tattoo. Hot needle it. I
		used a mirror to guide me ...

	And he pulls up his sleeve - to show the blue "FREB" tattooed
	there ...

				FREB (cont'd)
		The mirror messed me up with the "b" and
		the "d"... Everything's reversed, you
		know? Now, I'm "Freb."

	Donny chooses from a selection of IGNITIONS he's brought along.
	Finds the right one ... Installs it ... Tightens the 3 screws ...
	Starts the car with his own key ...

				DONNY ASTRICKY
		Glad to know you, "Freberick." Let's
		roll -

	And off they go ...

	INT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE

	Sway sets to prepping the cars ... The others wait nearby. Memphis
	walks over to where Kip sits ...

		You okay -- ?

				KIP
		I'm cool.

	Memphis looks at his watch...

				KIP (cont'd)
		We gonna make it?

				MEMPHIS
		Too early to tell. Nervous?

				KIP
		Nah.

				MEMPHIS
		That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous.
		Everyone's nervous. But not you...

				KIP
		I dunno. Whatever will be will be...

				MEMPHIS
		That's a good attitude, Kip. For
		everything but stealing cars ...

	Before Kip can respond, the signature throaty ROAR of Ferrari
	fills the room, as Sway's got one started --

		Showtime --

		Hello, Tracy...

	Except that a MAN comes out of the house ... Mid-20s, silk shirt,

		Oooh. "Snake." Tough guy. "Snake."
		Homeboy wants you to call him: Snaake-!

	They crack up ... Size her ...

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		No whistles ... That's weird...

	He shrugs ... They slim-jim her "beetle-wing" articulated door ...
	Climb in ... The Sphinx starts her up ... Mirror Ma gets in beside
	him... The seats are sooo low ...

				MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
		This shit's on point. Check it: 200.

	He gestures to the speedometer ... Calibrated to 200 MPH..

		Halfway there, we switch. I drive.

	The Sphinx shrugs ... And they head out ...

		Say goodbye to your ride, Snake...

				MEMPHIS
		What's this guy up to -- ?

	After a beat, a WOMAN comes out ... She gets into the car.

				SWAY
		It's 1:30 on a Tuesday. Is that any

	The Maserati's lights go off... He's parked...

		What, are they gonna mack -- ?

	Yeah. The couple start kissing. Memphis checks his watch

	The Sphinx drives ... Mirror Man pops in his tape ... Albert
	King's "Drivin' Wheel."

				MIRROR MAN
		That's what I'm talkin' about -- !

	He boogies down. The Sphinx is bewitched, awed by the car's
	magnificent power. But then Mirror Man SCREAMS -- ! With pure
	terror. For, at his feet, wrapped around his legs, is

	A BOA CONSTRICTOR - some 8-feet long... A mass of heavilykeeled
	scales shimmering on coiled muscle ... Mirror Man screams on and 
	on...

	The Sphinx swerves wildly... Racing through a red light. Barely
	missing an on-coming BUS ... Passing a pair of COPS coming out of
	a 7-11. They hop into their unit. Give chase.

	EXT. NEWPORT BEACH - THE MASERATI

	The Persian man and his date ... Mackin' hard... Behind them
	Memphis and Sway wait in the Mazda. Memphis is on the cell

				MEMPHIS

	Sway nods ... The Maserati's windows are fully-steamed...

		Man, they're going at it

				SWAY
		They're in love ...

	Long beat ... He looks at her ...

				MEMPHIS
		What about you?

	She looks at him... Shrugs...

				SWAY
		You remember my Gramma? Yeah. I was
		thinking. If she were alive. And she
		asked me. If she came down, right now.
		Asked me. "What do you do, Sara?
		What's your life?" Innocently.
		Nonjudgemental. I think it would break
		her heart if I said I was a thief. I
		steal cars, Gramma. And even though,
		hey, I learned it all from her son.
		My Uncle Eddie. Who taught me the basics. 
		Which you refined. (You remember Randall,
		Gramma? You thought he was neat. Well,
		he refined the basics ... ). I don't
		think that's what she hoped for me...

	She looks at him ...

				SWAY (cont'd)
		But ... That said... Car thieves are my
		weakness ... It's all so terribly Loretta
		Lynn or something, I know... But ... I
		don't wanna be a thief anymore ... I don't
		wanna love a thief anymore ... I want to
		wear a dress maybe once in a while... Maybe
		have a kid... Watch a lot of Audrey Hepburn
		movies.. And think about my Gramma without
		also thinking "shame on me. Shame on
		me. Shame on me... "

	at first ... Then... With urgency...

				SWAY
		Stop. What about Maserati Boy?

				MEMPHIS

		Oh, God...

	And yes, this is patently absurd. But it's also oddly sexy.

		Know not to get on it ... Momentum

		Up.

	Back arched... A small moan escapes her ... Prince wails ... And
	Sway has achieved whatever kind of silly climax they aspired to
	here... She flops back down... Looks at him...

				SWAY
		You're still quite the boost, Randall
		Raines ...
			(he shrugs)
		Except now I've been chopped, and my

		to church in South America by some

	The Sphinx leans over... And PINCHES THE SNAKE BEHIND THE BACK OF

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		He'll live. But it means your boy's

		They just faxed it to us...

	He hands Castlebeck the list. Calitri's 50. Castlebeck notes the
	last entry...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Let's get out there. And have them

		Any more, O -- ?

				OTTO (O.S.)
		You guys are through...

		in the suburbs ...

				KIP
		We'll take it...

				OTTO (O.S.)
		It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The
		Sphinx...

				KIP
		We'll take it.

	And they climb in behind a waiting Jeep Cherokee ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Later, Toby --

	But Toby's not around...

				KIP (cont'd)
		Toby?

	No answer... Kip shrugs... And off they go ...

	EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - CHESTNUT HILL - NIGHT

	A nice neighborhood... Upper middle class ... So damn suburban you
	can practically smell the gas grills ... A NEIGHBORHOOD SECURITY
	PATROL CAR glides by them...

				TUMBLER
		Gettin' fancy... Got their own palace
		guard -

	When, from the back of the Jeep:

				TOBY
		I never been to the suburbs ...

	Toby is there ... Having stowed-away...

				TUMBLER
		What are you doing here, assface?

				TOBY
		Checkin' it out

	He smiles at Kip ... Kip looks at Tumbler ... Drives ... At last,
	pulling up to one HOUSE where the '98 Benz - "'Carol" lives. Kip
	parks, a half block down ... They get out ... Head for the
	house...

	And there she is. "Carol." Obsidian black. In the
	garage. The garage is open. And THREE KIDS, two boys and a
	girl. Late teens. They are standing around "Carol"...
	Drinking beer... Listening to the new Beck album on the
	car's CD player ... The folks clearly out of town ...

	Well-scrubbed, white suburban children of plenty ... The only crew
	they've ever run in is J. Crew... From the hedge, Kip, Tumbler and
	Toby watch the kids ... With equal parts fascination, loathing,
	envy... And then, the kids go inside... Leaving "Carol" exposed...

				TOBY
		I got this one...

	And before the others can respond, he moves for her. And she's
	open... Toby's in ... Butterfly popped - Gizmo in. The others start
	to get in when ONE OF THE KIDS comes out from the house. He stares
	at Toby, who freezes mid-boost ...

				KIP (cont'd)
			(whispered hiss)
		Get her started, man -- !

	And Toby does... And slams her in reverse.  And they're off

	INT. WAREHOUSE -LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	The group - - Memphis, Sway, Freb, Mirror Man, and The Sphinx

	Memphis looks out into the night --

		C'mon, Kip -

	EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREETS - "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT

	Toby drives them out, Kip shotgun, Tumbler in the back. But the
	suburbs are confusing. They can't find their way out.

				TOBY
		Which way's out, man -- ?

				TUMBLER
		Shit all looks the same here --

	They drive. Only up ahead, blocking the street, LIGHTS blinding...
	Are TWO SECURITY PATROL CARS - SECURITY COPS on the strong ...
	Guns drawn...

				KIP
		Shit ...

				TUMBLER
		Run it...

	Toby looks to Kip...

				KIP
		No...

				TOBY
		What am I supposed to do?

	Toby pins the gas. Straight at the block... The security cops dive
	out of the way. Except for one standing tall and FIRING into the
	windshield... Into Toby... The car swerves. Going off the road.
	Into a bank of mailboxes.

	The security guards run for her... Kip, forehead bloodied,
	switches places with Toby, getting behind the wheel ... Punches
	the gas ... Getting them out of there ...

	INT. "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT

	Kip drives like a wild man ... Toby is bleeding something fierce...
	Shot in the chest...

				TOBY
		Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...

				KIP
		Just hold on... Hold on ...

				TUMBLER
		What are we gonna do -- ?

				KIP
		Hospital.

				TUMBLER
		We can't do that, dude --

	Kip looks at Tumbler ... They both look at Toby...

	EXT. WAREHOUSE -LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

	As the 'Vette comes screaming into the warehouse ... Kip exploding
	out of it ... Getting into the back. Memphis goes to the car, sees
	Toby ... Front of his shirt covered in blood ... The others gather
	around...

				MIRROR MAN
		Jesus ...

	Memphis climbs into the car ... Kip is holding Toby...

				KIP
		I didn't know... Should we take him to
		a hospital? I didn't know. I didn't.

	Toby is clearly dying in Kip's arms...

				TOBY
		Kip. Kip. Kip. Tell me: what's
		gonna happen? What's gonna happen?

	But Kip is lost ... Doesn't know what to say --

				MEMPHIS
		You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ...
		We'll getcha fixed up...

				TOBY
		No ... No... No ... Tell me what's
		gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's
		gonna happen?

	The brothers stare at the boy... Kip wipes his sweatstreaked face...

				TOBY (cont'd)
		What's gonna happen? I don't feel ...
		like ... this ... should.... happen ...
		right ... now. I...haven't... done ...
		shit... Tears running down his eyes...

				KIP
		Shhhhhh, shhhhh ...

	Kip looks to his brother for help ...

				MEMPHIS
		Call 911 -

				MIRROR MAN
		Call 'em here -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		DO IT! NOW -- !

	And Mirror Man scurries for the phone... Toby's breathing comes
	out in short staccato bursts ...

				TOBY
		Kip... Kip... Kip... It doesn't
		feel... It doesn't feel... It doesn't
		feel... good

	He looks up at Kip. All of the light goes out of his eyes. And
	Toby is dead... Kip holds him for a beat ... Then passes him to a
	surprisingly emotional Tumbler ... Kip gets out of the car, runs
	for the opposite end of the warehouse ...

	The others are stunned... Mirror Man hangs up the phone ...
	Memphis gets out of the car ... He goes after Kip ... Finds him in
	one of the containers ... Grabs him by the collars ...

				MEMPHIS
		What did I tell you? What? What did
		I tell you?

				KIP
		I don't know. What -- ?

	And Kip looks at him... Tears fall from the younger boy's eyes ...
	And Kip looks so lost ... So like a little kid...

				MEMPHIS
		Come here --

				KIP
		What?

				MEMPHIS
		Come here -

				KIP
		What?

				MEMPHIS
		Come here -

	And Kip does ... He walks to Memphis ... And Memphis puts his arms
	around him... And that's it. The floodgates open. Kip begins to
	sob. Deep, painful, racking sobs. And then:

				KIP
		I've missed you, man ...

				MEMPHIS
		I know. I've missed you, too 

	And they hold each other ...

				KIP
		Toby...

				MEMPHIS
		I know ...

				KIP
		Toby...

	And they stay in the embrace... And then Memphis unwraps Kip's
	arms from around him...

				MEMPHIS
		Stay here. Stay here a while. I'll
		be back ...

	Kip nods, sniffles ... Memphis walks out of the container ... He
	strides up to the others ... Glances at Toby's clipboard, with all
	the cars crossed-out ... He goes to Sway...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		Give me a ride -- ?

				SWAY
		Where to -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Kip's not clear yet. We got one more
		to go --

	And she nods ... And climbs into one of the Escorts... And off
	they go ... The others standing around the 'Vette and Toby's
	body...

	ANGLE - THE CLIPBOARD. One car left. Eleanor.

	As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART IV: DREAMS OF YOU

	EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS - DAWN

	The sun just starting to take all the purple from the night ...

	Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff are parked across from the
	towers in their unmarked...

	Sway pulls up a few blocks away ... Memphis has put on a fake
	moustache, wig, necktie ...

				SWAY
		You okay -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Yeah ... You -- ?

	She nods ... He looks at her ...

				MEMPHIS (cont'd)
		You should know: walking away from my
		mother, my brother, this town. Was

		killed me...

	And she smiles sadly ...

		I know ...

	She takes his hand ... Squeezes it ...

		Good luck...

	Memphis, now in gray flannel suit, wig and moustache, steps out.

	Raises the binocs ... Tough to tell.. Memphis drifts into the stream
	of traffic ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF (cont'd)
		What do you think -- ?

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Let's see what he's about --

	Drycoff hits the lights and sirens ... Memphis sees the car behind
	him...

				MEMPHIS
		Shit ...

	And kicks it into gear...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		Hey, now -- !

	He pins it ... And THE RACE IS ON... In the biggest way possible.
	This is the grand-daddy of chase scenes here, so we won't take the
	easy way out. We'll actually script it ... Memphis races out onto
	the busy street, Drycoff on his ass.

	Drycoff pulls up alongside him... So they can see him. But the wig
	and moustache prevent them from recognizing Memphis ... Other cars
	suffer from the pursuit ... They go careening into parked cars,
	storefronts, Harvard Square ...

	Memphis side-swipes Drycoff's car ... Memphis drives down the
	Memorial Drive OFF-RAMP, against traffic

	takes one more spin around the plaza, then sees a

	SHALLOW FLIGHT OF STAIRS by the back entrance to City.Hall. And he
	takes them... CLUMP-KUMP-KA-DUMP-DUMP-DUMP

	And now he's on some of the narrowest streets in Long Beach. He

	is thrilled ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		Gotcha now, dickhead --

	But Castlebeck's not so sure ... He sees a possible play... So

	QUICK CUTS TO --

	Another few beats of silence ... Everyone watching ... He punches
	the gas... Ripping down to the accident site... Heading straight
	for it ... And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further
	injure the accident victims -

	Not our Memphis ... He's heading straight for

	THE RAMP TRUCK

	parked ass-end toward Long Beach ... Ramp down ... Memphis rockets
	Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ... And the ramp
	LAUNCHES ELEANOR in glorious super-sexy-bloodpumping SLO-MO OVER
	THE ACCIDENT SITE some thirty feet in the air ... Evel-style ...

				DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
		You gotta be fucking kidding me --

	Where she lands in a crippling thud... Onto the EMPTY side of the
	Long Beach Bridge... Cheers from the gang at Otto's ... The gang
	at KISS-108 ... Memphis pulls her to a stop... Looks back at the
	scene ...

	Castlebeck squints ... Trying to see if it's his boy... Memphis
	switches the radio back on ... Matty has obliged... Wilson
	Pickett's "Mustang Sallyo ... And Memphis drives over the bridge,
	the only car going northbound... Memphis rides, daddy, rides ...

	INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - FRONT OFFICES - DAY

	A half-dozen Calitri SOLDIERS are here, answering phones, playing
	cards.

	INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - WORKSHOP

	The sliding door is open. The CASKET for Kip rests to the side ...
	Calitri uses a router to make a rabbet along the bottom frame of a
	plywood gossip bench. He senses something and turns to

	THE LOADING DOCK - MEMPHIS

	has driven up in the smashed-to-shit Eleanor ... He climbs up,
	entering the workshop... Calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55
	AM...

				CALITRI
		Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...

				MEMPHIS
		This is number 50. We did it. It's
		over Where's the money ?

				CALITRI
		Right there -

	He gestures to a Haliburton case ... Memphis opens it ... There's
	a lot of cash inside...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		200 K. Just like we said ...

				MEMPHIS
		You should never have gotten my brother and
		his friends involved ...

				CALITRI
		But I had to. It was the only way to
		get to you --

	Memphis looks at him... Calitri smiles ...

				MEMPHIS 
		Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away
		from him...

				CALITRI
		I don't know about that, Randall.
		He did such a good job on this paper.
		And another one just came in ...

	Calitri goes to the FAX machine... Tears off the sheet..

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		It's an easier take. 30 cars. Two
		weeks. Most of them SUVs. Going to
		Russia. Think Kip'll be interested?

				MEMPHIS
		You don't want to even sniff at that --

	Calitri grins. But then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the
	first time -- ELEANOR -- parked out on the loading dock. And she
	is smashed-to-shit.

				CALITRI
		Well, that certainly won't do.

				MEMPHIS
		What do you mean -- ?

				CALITRI
		Look at it. I can't very well make
		delivery of that thing ...

				MEMPHIS
		You got no choice. It's over.

				CALITRI
		Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM
		Friday. Or Kip goes in that box.
		That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ...
		That was the deal ...

	Memphis is by a TABLE SAW... He flicks it on. The electric MOTOR
	rumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here ...

				CALITRI (cont'd)
		What are you doing -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not
		gonna let you get into my Kool Aid...

	And Memphis is on him... They go rolling about in grunts and
	groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the NOISE of the table saw
	drowning out the sounds of combat ...

	Calitri is on top, grabbing an AWL from the floor, bringing the
	lethal point down to Memphis' face... Memphis holds Calitri's
	wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye

	ANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last
	gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a
	small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl
	akimbo ...

	Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself
	out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...

	He crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on
	the younger man's chest ... But then Memphis grabs him by the hair
	and tosses Calitri off him ... Memphis POUNDS Calitri's head into
	the floor ...

	Once, twice. Three times. Calitri is out ... Memphis gets to his
	feet, nose bloody. He catches his breath. Only the door opens ...
	And Atley is there ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Jesus, man ... What'd you do?

				MEMPHIS
		My version of "take this job and shove
		it..."

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Are you crazy? You throw down with The
		Carpenter? You got a grudge against
		your life?

	But before Memphis can respond, there are APPROACHING ENGINE
	SOUNDS from up the alleyway -- as A PANEL VAN arrives. Memphis and
	Atley look at the wall-clock. 8:05. A glance to the unconscious
	Calitri ...

				ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
		Now you done it. And with you
		gone - who'll save Kip the next
		time ... ?

				MEMPHIS
		This is all about there not being
		a next time, Atley --

	And the two men hold the look... And the van doors slam, as Digger
	and Butz, Calitri's grave-diggers, get out ... Atley goes to the
	unconscious Calitri ... And he picks him up, straining under the
	dead weight ... Dragging the don over to

	THE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops
	Calitri into the casket... Slamming the swell top lid of the
	coffin. He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger and
	Butz are there -

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Hello, boys -- !

				DIGGER
		Hey! What happened? Did they make it

				ATLEY JACKSON
		They did not. A tragedy.

				DIGGER
		Mr. C. around?

				ATLEY JACKSON
		He's napping. He said to take it away...

	Atley gestures to the coffin. And they pick it up, move it to the
	van...

				DIGGER
		That'll do ya. Tell Mr. C. we was by.

				MEMPHIS
		Absolutely.

	And they are gone ... And Atley turns to Memphis

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?

				MEMPHIS
		Point-five ...

	And he holds out his hand ... And they shake ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Get outta here, Memphis --

	And Memphis does ... Nods to Atley...

				MEMPHIS
		Thank you...

	Atley nods ... Memphis walks out to the loading dock... Atley
	watches him go ...

				ATLEY JACKSON
		Hoo-boy.

	EXT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP - LOADING DOCK

	Memphis walks to the battered Eleanor ... As Pearl Jam's
	"Rearviewmirror' crunches and a CAR comes motoring up to him. It's
	ANOTHER 167 SHELBY. ANOTHER ELEANOR, a "For Sale" sign pasted on
	the back window. It's being driven by Kip...

				MEMPHIS
		What are you doing here?

				KIP
		I saw her get smashed-up on the TV.
		Knew there was no way he was gonna
		accept her ...

				MEMPHIS
		Where'd you find this one?

				KIP
		Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors",
		Memphis. Cos you never know when
		you're gonna need one --

				MEMPHIS
		You boost her -- ?

				KIP
		Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.

				MEMPHIS
		Move over ...

	Kip does. Memphis gets behind the wheel. Drives...

	EXT. LONG BEACH BOULEVARD - DAY

	Memphis drives... Kip beside him...

				MEMPHIS
		You okay -- ?

				KIP
		I dunno ... I keep thinking about
		him.

	Memphis nods. But then FLASHING LIGHTS behind them ... An UNMARKED
	with Code 3 capabilities - lights & sirens ... Memphis considers
	... He could make another run ... But the looks at Kip... Enough
	is enough ... He pulls over ...

				KIP (cont'd)
		What are you doing? You can outrun
		him...

				MEMPHIS
		It's over. The dumb shit is over ...

	The unmarked pulls up behind him... The cop comes over ... It is,
	of course, Detective Castlebeck.

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I know you.

				MEMPHIS
		You know my back.

	Castlebeck opens his coat... Showing stuffed holster ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		It's finished, Randall. Get out of
		the car... You, too, kid...

	Memphis starts to get out. When Castleback's RADIO crackles.

				RADIO (O.S.)
		We have suspect vehicle matching description
		at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal ... Repeat:
		the suspect vehicle has just been
		apprehended at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal,
		190 Street and Campanza ...

	Castlebeck frowns, goes to his radio. Memphis looks at Kip.

				KIP
		I reported it ...

	Memphis is impressed...

				MEMPHIS
		Not bad

	ANGLE - CASTLEBECK at his car, on the radio ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		Dispatch, what's the license on
		the suspect vehicle... ?

				RADIO (O.S.)
		License is California 6-1-4 HSO. Repeat:
		California. 6-1-4 Henry Sam Ocean.

	And Castlebeck looks at the license on this Eleanor... A vanity
	plate that says - MY 67 ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		10-4.

	And he goes back over to Memphis ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		Looks like we live to fight another
		round. You're free to go ...

	Memphis can barely believe it. Castlebeck leans down, to Kip:

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
		Your brother's a clever man and a
		talented thief, Kipling. But as role
		models go, you should observe the man,
		not the thief ...

				KIP
		Yes, sir ...

	Castlebeck sighs...

				MEMPHIS
		Don't look so glum, Detective. It's a
		beautiful day, the birds are singing,
		and there's a container ship on
		Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ...

	Castlebeck nods ...

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I want you gone, Randall. Settle your
		affairs. Make it right with those you
		love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I
		want you out of here. Out of here for
		good this time ...

				MEMPHIS
		Consider me gone, Detective --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		I'll catch you later, Randall --

				MEMPHIS
		Double-meaning intended --

				DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
		You betcha --

	And Memphis races off ...

	EXT. OTTO'S SALVAGE - DAY

	Otto, The Sphinx, Tumbler, Freb and Mirror Man are sipping coffee
	and eating donuts ... They are exhausted... Memphis and Kip pull
	up in Eleanor... He hands Otto the briefcase. Otto opens it... All
	that cash...

				MEMPHIS
		Split it up. Any word on Donny?

				OTTO
		He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.

				MEMPHIS
		What happened to Sway?

				OTTO
		She left...

	He nods ... The boys are huddled together...

				MIRROR MAN
		Poor Toby, man...

	A few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly:

				THE SPHINX 
		If his premature demise has, in some way,
		enlightened the rest of you as to the
		grim finish below the glossy veneer of
		criminal life, and inspired you to change
		your ways, then his death carries with it
		an inherent nobility. And a supreme
		glory. We should all be so fortunate.
		You can say 'Poor Toby." I say: "Poor us.."

	They all stare at him, stunned...

				FREB
		You spoke

	The Sphinx shrugs...

				TUMBLER
		Say something else, man

	But The Sphinx lapses back into his silence ... Nibbles a donut
	... Sips coffee ... Memphis smiles ... He takes a stack of bills
	from the briefcase... To Kip:

				MEMPHIS
		You remember where you got this
		Eleanor -- ?

				KIP
		Sure, man --

				MEMPHIS
		She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand.
		Give 'em sixty ...

	And he hands Kip the cash ...

				KIP
		You want me to buy her?

				MEMPHIS
		Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done.
		I've never actually paid for a car. I want
		to see what it feels like

	Kip nods ... Memphis looks at a grinning Otto ...

				OTTO
		Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is
		now...

				MEMPHIS
		I'll see you soon --

				KIP
		Where you off to -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		Thought I'd go for a ride -

	He smiles. The others do, too. Memphis heads for Eleanor.

				KIP
		Hey, Memphis -- ?

	Memphis turns back...

				KIP (cont'd)
		I'll see you, right?

	Memphis nods ...

				MEMPHIS
		You'll see me ...

	And we PRE-LAP Sammy John's "Chevy Van" and CUT TO:

	INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

	Sway, underneath a Daytona... We only see her from the waist down
	... Hands on her waist ... Pulls her gently out. Memphis. He
	brings her to her feet ...

				SWAY
		What are you doing... ?

				MEMPHIS
		Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?

	And he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from
	her cheek...

				SWAY
		I can't. I got a back load of repairs
		and one of the mechanics called in
		sick and I haven't slept and--
			(stops short; sees the new Eleanor
			outside)
		Where to -- ?

				MEMPHIS
		I dunno. I know a place.

	She looks at him... Long and hard...

				SWAY
		This time it's for real?

				MEMPHIS
		Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.

	EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S - DAY

	And Memphis opens the passenger door for her ... And she gets
	in... And she smiles ... And Memphis climbs behind the wheel. He
	neutral-drops Eleanor, chirping off ...

	EXT. CONTAINER SHIP - LONG BEACH HARBOR - DAY

	As two TUGS guide the giant freighter away from the docks ... All
	those containers ... Filled with cars ... But here comes a COAST
	GUARD CUTTER ... Churning for the ship ...

	Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff on the deck ... Stopping this
	one cold...

	EXT. LANDFILL - RHODE ISLAND - DAY

	A vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth. Deserted,
	except for THE PANEL VAN parked dead center. Digger and Butz slide
	the casket from the van, parked before an ALREADY DUG GRAVE.

	As they move the casket, a KNOCKING from inside. A POUNDING. And
	muffled CRIES. Digger and Butz exchange a horrified glance... They
	stare at the casket, spooked.

				BUTZ
		Do you believe this?

				DIGGER
		What should we do?

				BUTZ
		We gotta do what we gotta do --

				DIGGER
		Shit. I hate the screamers, man. Why
		can't he finish the freakin' job?

				BUTZ
		Forget about it. Occupational hazard,
		Digger. C'mon...

	And just as we think they're sure to open it -- they DROP THE
	CASKET INTO THE HOLE -- !

	And begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it; its unseen occupant
	thumping and pounding and yelling -- And soon the casket is
	covered in dirt. Gone.

	And we PRE-LAP The Turtles' pop gem "Eleanor" ("You got a thing
	about you/I just can't live without you/I really want
	you/ Eleanor near me...")  CUT TO:

	EXT. THE 405 FREEWAY NORTH - ELEANOR - MOVING - DAY

	Memphis driving. Sway riding shotgun. Long Beach at their backs
	... Memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel... He loves
	driving this car. Sway watches him. He feels it --

				MEMPHIS
		What -- ?

				SWAY
		Nothing. Just that if I was less
		secure, I might think you were more
		into Eleanor than you are me...

				MEMPHIS
		She does have one thing you don't.

				SWAY
		What's that?

				MEMPHIS
		Bench seats.

	And he grins ... Pats the seat beside him... And Sway slides
	close... He throws his arm around her ...

	And off they go ... As The Turtles' ("Eleanor/Gee, I think you're
	swell/And you really do me well/You're my pride and joy, etc.")
	SING ON... And we hear:

				MEMPHIS (O.S.)
		You like bingo -- ?

	And Eleanor drives away from us ... Into the searing horizon line
	... Becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist
	pattern that is the American road.

SEATTLE 1988

EXT. FRONT YARD.  DAY.

        Slow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of
        unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class
        residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in
        shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram
        to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed
        Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades
        point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be
        ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An
        attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.

        Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the
        front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula.

INT. MURPHY RESIDENCE. DAY.

                                WOMAN
                                (screams)
                    Oough! Ahhh!

                                SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                                (to others)
                    Upstairs.

        Troops pour into the house.

                                WOMAN
                    What's going on? What's the matter?
                    Who are you?

        The troops, and one or two trenchcoated agents, continue
        entering the house and heading upstairs, still with rifles
        ready.

                                WOMAN
                    Hey!

        Upstairs, crowded in the narrow hallway, the troops
        descend on a bedroom.

                                WOMAN
                                (off camera)
                    Dade! Dade!

                                AGENT
                    Knock it down.

        The battering ram knocks down a bedroom door.

INT. COURTROOM.

        The prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing
        argument blandly. She'd rather be somewhere else.

                                PROSECUTOR
                    The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls
                    himself "Zero Cool", has repeatedly
                    committed criminal acts of a malicious
                    nature. This defendant possesses a
                    superior intelligence, which he uses to a
                    destructive and antisocial end. His
                    computer virus crashed one thousand five
                    hundred and seven computer systems,
                    including Wall Street trading systems,
                    single handedly causing a seven point drop
                    in the New York Stock Market.

        As she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning
        down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade
        Murphy.

        Fast forward to the sentencing.

                                JUDGE
                    Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family
                    forty-five thousand dollars...

        The court gasps, Dade's father winces

                                JUDGE
                    ...and sentence you to probation, under
                    which you are forbidden to own or operate
                    a computer or touch tone telephone, until
                    the day of your eighteenth birthday.

        Now Dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry.

        Opening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family
        and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and
        photographers, in slow motion, and driving away.

                        SEVEN YEARS LATER.

        Aboard a jetliner, Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the
        window, wearing headphones. Exterior view from the
        aircraft of approaching New York City. The view becomes a
        direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city,
        which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips
        and digital signals on a stylised computer board. The
        title logo.

INT. DADE'S ROOM.

        Segue to Dade Murphy, now 18, wearing mirrorshades indoors
        and at night, working on his new computer. His mother
        calls him.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                                (off camera)
                    Dade?

                                DADE
                    Yeah, mom?

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    What are you doing?

                                DADE
                                (after a semi-pregnant pause)
                    I'm taking over a TV network.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy
                    birthday.

INT. OTV STUDIOS.

        In the OTV Studios security department, a phone rings, a
        man answers nervously.

                                NORM
                    Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.

                                DADE
                    Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from
                    Accounting. I just had a power surge here at
                    home that wiped out a file I was working on.
                    Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know
                    anything about computers?

                                NORM
                    Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...

                                DADE
                    Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just
                    went AWOL, and I've got this big project due
                    tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get
                    it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari
                    Kari...

                                NORM
                    Uhhh.. ahahaha...

                                DADE
                    Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management
                    techniques.
                                (pause)
                    Could you, uh, read me the number on the
                    modem?

                                NORM
                    Uhhhmm...

                                DADE
                    It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches
                    on it... lets my computer talk to the one
                    there...

                                NORM
                    212-555-4240.

        Dade goes to work on OTV. He closes his eyes and a flurry
        of half-second video clips from old TV shows flashes by.
        He opens his eyes. His screen says ENTERING ARPS 331 and
        then wipes to another screen. Automated Record Playback
        System. There is a graphic representation of the
        station's automatic videotape changer. Dade turns on his
        TV set and turns to OTV. It is running a Rush-Limbaugh
        type TV show.

                                COMMENTATOR
                                (on TV)
                    ...so-called American Indians, Latinos and
                    Blacks come from a genetically mediocre
                    stock...

                                DADE
                    Yak yak yak. Get a job!

        Dade presses a key on his keyboard. The Video Changer
        diagram lights up in red. At the station, a robotic arm
        selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of
        tapes.  The "America First" tape slides out of the VTR and
        is replaced by an episode of "The Outer Limits" as Dade
        watches, drinks Coke and smiles, full of himself.

                                TV
                    You are about to experience the awe and
                    mystery, which reaches from the inner mind,
                    to... The Outer Limits.

                                DADE
                    Yesssss!

        Suddenly, the ARPS screen is replaced by an ominous
        message:

                        U HAVE TREAD
                        UPON MY DOMAIN &
                        MUST NOW SUFFER
                        WHO R U?

                                DADE
                    Hey! What?

        He starts to type ZERO...

                                DADE
                    No, wait.

        Dade types:

                        CRASH OVERRIDE.
                        WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

        Dade's screen dissolves into:

                        ACID BURN

                                DADE
                    Unbelievable. A hacker!

        Then the screen changes again:

                        ACID BURN
                        SEZ LEAVE B 4
                        U R EXPUNGED

        "The Outer Limits" suddenly flashes off.

                                DADE
                    Yeah, okay "Acid Burn", that's enough.

        Dade starts hacking. Apparently so does Acid Burn. The
        tape changer machines at OTV are swamped, sometimes
        fighting over the same tape. The program on TV keeps
        changing.

        The message comes up on Dade's computer screen:

                        I WILL
                        SWAT U LIKE
                        THE FLY U R

        More dueling tape changers, more half second video clips.
        Another message.

                        I WILL
                        SNAP YOUR BACK
                        LIKE A TOOTHPICK

        As the duel continues, Dade types back a taunt of his own:

                        MESS WITH THE BEST
                        DIE LIKE THE REST

        One last from Acid Burn:

                        YOU ARE
                        TERMINATED

        Then his own computer confirms for him that the connection
        is terminated.

                                DADE
                    Shit on me!

        Next morning. Mrs. Murphy is unpacking. Dade emerges
        from his room in a housecoat. He makes a beeline (dodging
        moving boxes) for the fridge.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?

                                DADE
                    Mm-hmm.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Up all night again, huh?

                                DADE
                    Can this wait until both my eyes are open,
                    please?

        Dade's mom picks up the phone, mocking a call to the
        building superintendent.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll
                    sleep normal hours? He's been playing with
                    his computer all night for a solid week.
                                (pause)
                    Well yes, he could be playing with himself.
                    Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls,
                    don't you?

                                DADE
                    Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as
                    charming as you yet.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    You haven't been doing anything stupid, right,
                    Dade?
                                (louder)
                    Right, Dade?!

                                DADE
                    Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!

        Dade slams the bathroom door. Mrs. Murphy quickly checks
        his room. Dade is showering.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                                (angry, through the bathroom door)
                    You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?
                    Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up
                    again and you won't get into college!

        She pauses and regains some of her cool.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.
                    I didn't want to sell the house but I had to
                    take this new job, you know that. You're
                    going to love New York, it's the city that
                    never sleeps!

EXT. NEW YORK CITY.

        We enjoy several views of New York, the morning sun
        shining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day
        and night. Dade emerges from the ground-floor apartment
        on rollerblades and skates down the street to school.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL.

        At school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around,
        head to class.  Dade looks lost among them. He walks up
        to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard-skin muscle
        shirt. The kid is on a pay-phone, speaking in Spanish.

                                DADE
                    Excuse me.

                                KID
                    Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.

                                DADE
                    Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the
                    principal's office.

                                KID
                    Sorry, I can't help you, okay?

        Now Dade really looks lost. He heads off in search of the
        office.

INT. OFFICE.

        Dade is filling out a form.

                                GIRL
                    Do you have your transfer forms?

        Dade stares at her, stunned. The girl has a decidedly
        unconventional appearance, yet is a first-rate beauty.

                                GIRL
                    It's a relatively straightforward question.

        Dade notices her lips, and in his imagination launches
        into a flurry of half-second video clips and art bites,
        all involving lips and kissing.

                                GIRL
                    Do you speak English?

                                DADE
                    Sorry, you wanted...?

                                GIRL
                    I wanted transfer forms.

        He gives them to her.

                                GIRL
                    Thank you.

        She starts leaving. He doesn't.

                                GIRL
                    Are you coming?

        Dade clues in, gets up and follows her. She takes him on
        a brief tour.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.

                                GIRL
                    The gym is through there, and the cafeteria is
                    through there.

                                DADE
                    Great. Cool.
                                (pause)
                    What's your name?

                                GIRL
                    Kate. Kate Libby.

        They arrive at a classroom.

                                KATE
                    Here's your class.

                                DADE
                    My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?

                                KATE
                    No, you're not in my class.

        Kate starts away.

                                DADE
                    Give me time!

        A guy in the halls notices Dade.

                                GUY
                    Hey, you new?

                                DADE
                    Yeah.

                                GUY
                    Tell him about the pool, Kate.

                                DADE
                    Pool?

                                KATE
                    Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up
                    on the roof. Take the stairs over there.

                                DADE
                    Yeah! Sure.

        Kate starts away again.

                                DADE
                    Thanks!

EXT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP.

        Dade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the
        roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over
        the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention.
        One of them notices Dade.

                                GEEK
                    Hey! Hold the door!

        He's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool.

                                Dade
                                (realizing he's been had)
                    No pool.

        Dade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with
        his palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins
        raining.

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR.

        Dade is soaking wet, and trudges among his classmates
        leaving a muddy trail. A three-second video clip rolls
        through his mind: it is a screaming woman being strangled
        in an old movie. He walks past Kate, who giggles.

                                KATE
                    Oh my God! He found the pool.

INT. SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB.

        The kids are all seated at computer workstations. Dade
        is hacking, the latino kid who was on the phone to
        Venezuela is running a demo involving dirty-dancing
        skeletons.

                                TEACHER
                    I'm Mr. Simpson. And I'm subbing for Ms.
                    Bayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur
                    rally. I know some of you kids got computers
                    at home. But these are school property,
                    people, and I don't want to see any gum stuck
                    to 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical
                    interface...

        Meanwhile, the latino kid notices that Dade has been
        looking up Kate Libby's school records. And hacking
        himself into her advanced English class.

EXT. SCHOOL QUAD.

        It's after school, kids are heading home, Dade too. The
        latino kid notices Dade and catches up with him.

                                KID
                    So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby,
                    eh? Academic? Purely sexual?

                                DADE
                    Homicidal?

                                KID
                    What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!

        The name rings no bells with Dade.

                                PHREAK
                    The Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I
                    know you play the game.

        Another kid, younger and a little geeky looking, runs up
        to Dade and The Phantom Phreak.

                                JOEY
                    Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak,
                    dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...

                                PHREAK
                                (slaps Joey)
                    Joey, Joey...

                                JOEY
                    What? whatwhatwhat?

                                PHREAK
                    One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap
                    the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to
                    save you from yourself but you gotta stop
                    letting your mama dress you, man!
                                (To Dade):
                    Check it...

        Phreak starts to hand Dade a flyer.

                                JOEY
                                (interrupting)
                    I need a handle, man. I don't have an
                    identity until I have a handle.

                                PHREAK
                    You know, you're right about that.
                                (to Dade)
                    Check it, Friday.

        Phreak hands Dade a flyer for Cyberdelia.

                                JOEY
                    Alright. How about the Master of Disaster,
                    huh?

                                PHREAK
                    You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.

        Phreak walks away.

                                JOEY
                    Ultra Laser.
                                (desperate)
                    Doctor Doom!

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET VILLAGE. NIGHT.

        Dade rolls in on rollerblades.  Street vendors hawk
        computer parts and bootleg software. A bootleg music
        vendor catches Dade's attention.

                                CEREAL
                    Check this out, each and every one of you.
                    Compilation tape, of my own making. I call
                    this the "Greatest Zooks Album". Featuring
                    artists like, well I got some Hendrix on
                    there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... all
                    great artists that asphyxiated on their own
                    vomit!

        The small crowd around him finally gets the joke.

                                CEREAL
                    Can't get this in stores, man, I made it!

        Dade wheels into Cyberdelia, which just happens to be
        equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the
        benefit of skaters. The place pounds with loud, bassy
        techno music and coloured light. Video monitors with
        psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere. There is a
        video game with a huge screen.  Phreak is at a pay phone.

                                OPERATOR
                                (on phone)
                    Please deposit five dollars for the first
                    minute.

        Phreak holds a small box up to the receiver, presses a
        button, and the box emits a series of tones.

                                OPERATOR
                    Thank you.

                                PHREAK
                    Nonono, thank YOU!

        Dade checks out the scene. Kate is playing the big video
        game. Dade skates up to her. She loses her last man.
        She's got the high score, in fact her name dominates the
        top-10 list.

                                DADE
                    That's a nice score for a girl.

                                KATE
                                (irritated by Dade's presence)
                    Think you can do better?

                                DADE
                    I'll give it a shot.

        Kate yields the controls to Dade, who begins playing.
        Kate's boyfriend looks on from a mezzanine several feet
        above.

                                CURTIS
                    Is this kid bothering you, Kate?

                                DADE
                    Sorry, can I get some room here?

                                CURTIS
                    Yeah.
                                (to Kate)
                    Why don't you come up here?

        Kate obliges and joins Curtis.  Dade continues playing.
        He plays brilliantly. The game is a flashy 3-D high-speed
        chase game with lots of surprises. Dade loses, but his
        high score is about to come up.

                                CURTIS
                    He's good!

        Dade's score comes up. He's in the #1 position. Phreak
        is amazed.

                                DADE
                                (to Kate)
                    Well, it looks like I'm on top.

        Kate, defeated, leaves. Curtis follows.

                                PHREAK
                    Congratulations. No one's ever beat her
                    before. You just made an enemy for life.
                                (to someone else)
                    Boy meets world. Let's go?

EXT. OUTSIDE CYBERDELIA. NIGHT.

        Kate and Curtis are sucking face, oblivious to the busy
        world around them. Dade and Phreak watch, more than a
        little disgusted.

                                DADE
                    Who's that?

                                PHREAK
                    Curtis.

                                DADE
                    And what's he do?

                                PHREAK
                    That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks
                    slick all day.

        Kate and Curtis start to take off on Curtis' motorcycle.
        Kate and Dade make eye contact briefly. The motorcycle
        speeds off into the night.

INT. DADE'S ROOM.

        The clock says it's 4:16. As the camera pans up to Dade,
        it changes to 4:17. Dade is hacking again. It's the
        school's administration system. Dade schedules a test of
        the school sprinkler system for 9:30am.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDIR.

        Dade stands alone in the hall, watching the time closely.
        Phreak rounds a corner and meets Dade.

                                PHREAK
                    What's up?

        Dade doesn't answer. He watches the time a couple of more
        seconds, then opens an umbrella. Immediately the fire
        sprinklers turn on. Phreak starts getting drenched. He
        realizes what is happening.

                                PHREAK
                                (amused and highly impressed)
        Oh my God. You...

        A bell rings and students pour out into the halls by the
        hundreds. They're all being showered on. A tall
        cheerleader bounces by Phreak, pushing her pom-pom in his
        face.

                                PHREAK
                    Way cool!
                                (to Dade)
                    You saw that?

        Dade nods in the affirmative.

        Kate walks up to Dade, also understanding what has
        happened.

                                KATE
                    What the hell is going on?

                                DADE
                    Pool on the roof must have a leak.

        Kate gives Dade a look that could kill and skulks away.

        Dade walks away under his umbrella, smug and dry.

                                PHREAK
                    Man, oh man, this is gonna be good.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM.

        Dade, Kate, and a couple of other students are writing on
        the chalkboard. Kate finishes first.

                                KATE
                    If God gave men brains bigger than dogs',
                    they wouldn't hump womens' legs at cocktail
                    parties.

        The class giggles.

                                KATE
                    Ruth Libby.

                                TEACHER
                    I'm not so sure your mother qualifies as a
                    significant author of the twentieth century.

                                KATE
                    Her last book sold two million copies.

                                CLASS
                                (almost in unison)
                    Woooooo!

        The teacher reads Dade's quotation.

                                TEACHER
                    "Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient
                    heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in
                    the machinery of the night."

                                DADE
                    That's Ginsburg.

                                TEACHER
                    Nice. Very nice.

                                KATE
                    He's not in this class.

                                DADE
                    I said give me time.

                                KATE
                    He's not enrolled in this class.

                                TEACHER
                    Well, he's on my list.

        Kate leaps across a desk and snatches the list from the
        teacher. Dade is on it. She gives Dade another filthy
        look, both Dade and the teacher just shrug. The teacher
        moves on to Cereal.

                                TEACHER
                    "Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind
                    the most?"

                                CEREAL
                    Ozzy Osbourne!

                                TEACHER
                    You. What is your name?

        The teacher grabs the list back from Kate.

                                CEREAL
                    Uh, Emmanuel Goldstein, sir?

                                TEACHER
                    You, however, are not on my list.

                                CEREAL
                                (in mock shock)
                    Whoa, this isn't wood shop class?

        The class cracks up. Kate and Dade exchange looks as the
        teacher escorts Cereal to the door.

INT. DADE'S PLACE.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    How was school?

                                DADE
                                (eating)
                    Hmmm.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    What did we learn in school today?

                                DADE
                    Revenge.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?

                                DADE
                    No. No one special.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be
                    home late.  And would you try and please fill
                    these out?

        She indicates a pile of college applications.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Oh don't worry, it's only the rest of your
                    life.

        She starts to the door.

                                DADE
                    Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the
                    lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    And unpack.

        She leaves. Dade looks over the college applications for
        a second, and pushes them away. He'd rather not do this
        now.

INT. CYBERDELIA.

        Dade, Phreak and Joey are sitting at a table. Joey is
        giving a dull account of his hacking adventures. Enter
        Cereal.

                                CEREAL
                    FYI, alright man, you can sit at home, and do
                    like absolutely nothing and...

        Cereal pauses, notices Dade, whom he has never met
        formally but seen around, and then continues.

                                CEREAL
                    ...and your name goes through like seventeen
                    computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's
                    a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living
                    large. We have no names, man, no names. We
                    are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.

                                PHREAK
                    Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But
                    he does know things.

        Dade and Cereal acknowledge each other.

                                JOEY
                    Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me.
                    I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking
                    around...

                                PHREAK
                                (to Cereal)
                    D'you bring those Crayola books?

                                CEREAL
                    Oh yeah, technicolor rainbow.

         Cereal brings a book out of his bag.

                                CEREAL
                    Green one.

                                JOEY
                    What is that, what is that? Lemmie see. What
                    are these?

                                DADE
                    International Unix Environments.

        Cereal pulls out another book.

                                CEREAL
                    Luscious orange?

        Cereal hands the orange book to Phreak.

                                DADE
                    Computer security criteria, DOD standards.

        Another book comes out.

                                DADE
                    The Pink Shirt Book, Guide to IBM PCs. So
                    called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy
                    wears on the cover.

        Another one.

                                CEREAL
                    What's that?

                                DADE
                    Devil book. The Unix Bible.

        Another one.

                                CEREAL
                    What's that?

                                DADE
                    Dragon book. Compiler design.

        Cereal brings out a large red book.

                                CEREAL
                    Oh yeah? What's that?

                                DADE
                    The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks.
                    Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that
                    won't fit on a shelf.

        By now Phreak has made a pile of the books, and the Red
        Book looks wholly out of place on the top of the pile.

                                JOEY
                    Anyway, anyway, guys guys guys, come on. I'm
                    in this computer, right. So I'm looking
                    around, looking around, you know, throwing
                    commands at it, I don't know where it is or
                    what it does or anything. It's like, it's
                    like choice, it's just beautiful, okay. Like
                    four hours I'm just messing around in there.
                    Finally I figure out, that it's a bank.
                    Right, okay wait, okay, so it's a bank. So, this
                    morning, I look in the paper, some cash
                    machine in like Bumsville Idaho, spits out
                    seven hundred dollars into the middle of the
                    street.

                                CEREAL
                    That's kinda cool.

                                JOEY
                    That was me. That was me. I did that.

                                DADE
                    You did this from your house.

        Joey takes a drag from his cigarette and just nods, with a
        big grin on his face.

                                PHREAK
                    What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't
                    hack a bank across state lines from your
                    house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where
                    are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know
                    anything?

                                CEREAL
                    Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.

                                JOEY
                    You guys always think I should know
                    everything, and you never tell me anything.
                    Am I right?

                                PHREAK
                    Alright, what are the three most commonly used
                    passwords?

                                JOEY
                    Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that
                    order, necessarily, right?

                                CEREAL
                    Yeah but don't forget God. System operators
                    love to use God. It's that whole male ego
                    thing.

                                PHREAK
                    Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a
                    righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.

                                CEREAL
                    Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack,
                    you score one of those Gibsons man. You know,
                    supercomputers they use to like, do physics,
                    and look for oil and stuff?

                                PHREAK
                    Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The
                    big iron?

                                DADE
                    Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy
                    metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some
                    low security, and try the back door.

                                CEREAL
                    Yeah but oh man,
                                (starts rubbing one of his
                                own nipples in mock sexual
                                excitement)
                    wouldn't you just love to get one of those
                    Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!

                                PHREAK
                    Yo, who ate all of my fries?

        Cereal pauses a second.

                                CEREAL
                                (pretending to be enraged)
                    Joey?!

                                JOEY
                    What, no, nonononono, I didn't touch your
                    fries. I did not touch your fries.

                                PHREAK
                    Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.

                                CEREAL
                    It was him, man!

                                PHREAK
                    You're psyched. You need to lay off of that
                    shit.

                    I'm gonna hit you!

INT. JOEY'S ROOM. NIGHT.

        Joey is hacking. A Gibson. He gets in. Using GOD as a
        password. Nice graphics represent the machine's vast
        systems.

                                JOEY
                    YES! Home run, home run. You and me Lucy.
                    We're gonna show em baby.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.

        A system operator at Ellingson Mineral Corporation, a
        large oil company, notices the intrusion. He gets on the
        phone.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

        The place is a mess, typical of the hacker bachelor pad.
        Empty chinese food boxes and Jolt Cola cans litter the
        place.

        Plague's phone is ringing, waking him.

                                HAL
                                (on phone)

                                (sleepily)
                    My name is the Plague.

                                HAL
                    Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's
                    happening on the net.

                                PLAGUE
                    As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

                                HAL
                    Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson
                    is working really hard. We got one person
                    online, the workload is enough for like ten
                    users. I think we've got a hacker.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM.

                                JOEY
                    Okay, okay, we need proof that we were here.
                    Right, uh...

        Joey starts looking for something to download as proof he
        was there.

                                JOEY
                    Yeah, Garbage, okay, give me Garbage.

        He selects a Garbage file and starts the download. His
        screen becomes a psychedelic mind trip.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.

        The Plague glides in on a skateboard. Short and thin,
        bearded, about 35 but still trying to be a teenage
        anarchist, yet not consciously realizing he sold out that
        ideal years ago.

                                PLAGUE
                    Never fear. I is here.

                                HAL
                    I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.

                                PLAGUE
                    Let's echo 23, see what's up.

        The huge monitor lights up with the display of the
        Gibson's resources. Hal and the Plague watch. Plague
        starts "surfing" around.

                                PLAGUE
                    "God" wouldn't be up this late.

        He sees what Joey is downloading. A file called
        "Garbage".

                                PLAGUE
                    Shit! Get me the switching control center.

        He puts on a telephone headset. Hal dials for him.

                                PLAGUE
                                (into the headset)
                    I need to trace a call that's in progress.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM.

        Joey is sneaking a cigarette while his computer downloads.
        There is a knock at the door. It's his mother.

                                JOEY
                                (whispering)
                    Shit!
                                (loudly, panicked)
                    Uh yeah... hold on, mom. Hold on one second.

        He puts out the cigarette and sprays the room with air
        freshener.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    I mean it! Open the door, Joseph.

                                JOEY
                    Yeah, uh, yeah, okay.

        He unlocks the door. Joey's mom bursts in. He's still
        clambering into bed.

                                JOEY
                    There you go.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    Bed. Sleep. Now!

        She turns off the computer. It wasn't finished
        downloading.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    Sweet dreams, Joey.

                    He's gone!

                                PLAGUE
                    Did you get a trace?

                                OPERATOR
                                (on phone)

                    Good.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM. DARK.

        Joey takes a disk out of his computer and stashes it in an
        air vent in the cieling.

INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY.

        Phreak, Dade and Cereal are rollerblading through the
        halls of an apartment building that is filled with
        graffiti. It appears that most of the spray-bomb art was
        created by the residents.

                                CEREAL
                    Nice place, huh.

        Cereal knocks on a door spray-painted "Hackstock"

                                DADE
                    You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You
                    know who he is?

                                PHREAK
                                (surprised)

                                (to Cereal)
                    Do you?

        Cereal shrugs.

        A hooded black man in his early twenties answers the door.

                                PHREAK
                    Nikon! Lord Nikon this is...

        Phreak motions to Dade.

                                DADE
                                (finishing)

                                NIKON
                    Never heard of you. Done anything?

                                DADE
                    No.

        Nikon slams the door.

                                PHREAK
                    Come on!

        Phreak knocks the door again. Nikon opens again.

                                NIKON
                    What, your mom buy you a 'Puter for Christmas?
                                (to Phreak)
                    Does he know anything?

                                PHREAK
                    Sure man, he's elite.

                                (pausing, checking Dade out)
                    Come in.

                                CEREAL
                    Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your
                    place tonight?

                                (removing his hood)
                    Again?
                                (pauses, then grins broadly)
                    Yeah sure.

        Nikon and Cereal do a fake Kung-fu move together.

                                BOTH
                    Ooka-pow!

        Later, the four are watching TV. On TV is a secret

INT. JOEY'S PLACE.

        Joey is taking a shower, wearing walkman headphones,
        singing along with the music. Joey finishes, turns off
        the shower, still singing. He draws open the shower
        curtain to find two secret service agents with shotguns
        pointed at him.

        The agents drag Joey, still naked and wet, out of the

        Joey is pushed into a sofa. He sees his computer, "Lucy",
        being carried away.

                                JOEY
                    Lucy!

        Joey dives onto the agent carrying Lucy away, losing his
        towel.  His mother, seeing his exposed buttocks, is
        shocked.

EXT. OUTSIDE JOEY'S PLACE.

        A police-type vehicle pulls up. It's Agent Richard Gill
        of the Secret Service.  He stops a young agent for an

                                AGENT RAY
                    I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so
                    we don't think he had time to erase his
                    computer files.

                    Alright sir.

        They split up.  A reporter and her sound man run up to

                    Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your

                                GILL
                    Why of course, Jennifer.

INT. ELLINGSON MINERAL CORPORATION.

        A tall, impressive building. A cavernous atrium filled
        with busy people.

INT. ELLINGSON BOARDROOM.

        A handsome looking woman in her late thirties walks in.

                                MARGO
                    Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I
                    see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.

                                PLAGUE
                                (to Margo)
                    Once again, don't call me Eugene.
                                (to the board)
                    A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a
                    superuser acount, giving him access to our
                    whole system.

                                MARGO
                    Precisely what you're paid to prevent.

                                PLAGUE
                    Someone didn't bother reading my carefully
                    prepared memo on commonly used passwords.
                    Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for
                    most used passwords are love,
                                (gesturing lewdly)
                    sex, secret and...
                                (eyeing Margo)
                    ...God. So would your holiness care to change
                    her password?

        Margo just blinks prettily.

                    Virus?

                                PLAGUE
                    Yesterday, the ballast program for a
                    supertanker training model mistakenly thought
                    the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.

                                MARGO
                    Excuse me?

                                PLAGUE
                                (as if to a child)
                    The little boat flipped over. A virus planted
                    in the Gibson computer system claimed
                    responsibility.

                                MARGO
                    What, it left a note?

        Plague hits a button on a remote control, and the virus -
        a long haired male model - appears on a large screen, in
        psychedelic colors. The virus speaks in a hammy Italian
        accent.

                                VIRUS
                    Unless five million dollars are transferred to
                    the following numbered account in seven days,
                    I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson
                    fleet.

                                BOARD MEMBER
                    Is that...

                                PLAGUE
                                (interrupting)
                    That is the virus. Leonardo da Vinci. The
                    problem is we have twenty six ships at sea and
                    we don't know which ones are infected.

                                DUKE ELLINGSON
                    Well then, put the ships' ballasts under
                    manual control.

                                PLAGUE
                    There's no such thing anymore, Duke. These
                    ships are totally computerized. They rely on
                    satellite navigation, which links them to our
                    network, and the virus, wherever they are in
                    the world.

                                MARGO
                    So what are we supposed to do?

                                PLAGUE
                    Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented
                    security officer. I traced the hacker's call.
                    The secret service picked him up this morning.
                    I'll just search his files for the original
                    virus code, and then I can eliminate it.

INT. ELLINGSON MINERAL ATRIUM.

        Plague, Margo and two suits from the boardroom are riding
        down an escalator.

                                SUIT #1
                    Now look, now we expect you to get onto this
                    right away, yeah?

                                PLAGUE
                    Yeah!

                                SUIT #1
                    Well, how soon?

                                PLAGUE
                    Well, we're working on it as fast as we can.
                    This is a very common occurrence in
                    corporations as large as ours. You have
                    nothing to worry about.

                                SUIT #2
                    Yeah, right.

                                SUIT #1
                    Now, you're sure about that, Mr. The Plague?

                                PLAGUE
                    Yeah, the Secret Service is helping us out 100
                    percent. Okay?

                                SUIT #2
                    Yeah.

                                SUIT #1
                    Okay.

                                PLAGUE
                    We'll be in touch. Talk to you later.

        The suits get off the escalator, Plague and Margo take the
        next one down.

                                MARGO
                    What the hell was that all about?

                                PLAGUE
                    I had to move fast. The hacker copied my
                    garbage file.

                                MARGO
                    What?

                                PLAGUE
                    I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in
                    the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the
                    hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we
                    can't do on our own.

                                MARGO
                    I don't want to go to jail for this.

                                PLAGUE
                    Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.

                                MARGO
                    But you've created a virus that's going to
                    cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to
                    arrest some hacker kid?

                                PLAGUE
                    Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.

                                MARGO
                    Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...

        Plague stops a passing secretary and snatches a piece of

                    I'll take care of this.

                                SECRETARY
                    Alright, sir.

                                PLAGUE
                    I can cancel it any time. I don't need any
                    program code. But it's the perfect cover, to
                    confiscate the disc and find out how much of
                    that garbage file has been copied.

                                MARGO
                    Get it!
                                (walking away)
                    Why did I ever trust you?
                                (going back up the escalator)
                    Get the file. Otherwise you'll lose all your
                    toys.

EXT. OUTSIDE JOEY'S PLACE.

                    His parents missed Woodstock and he's been

                                AGENT RAY
                    Secret Service!

                                AGENT BOB
                    Don't move!

        They slam Dade against a wall and start frisking him.

                                DADE
                    Christ! What is the...

                                AGENT BOB
                    Shut up!

                                DADE
                    What are you doing, man? Get off me!

        They lead him into his room and throw him down on the bed.
        Plague is there.

                                AGENT BOB
        Just sit in the bed and keep your hands where we can see
        them.

                    The year was 1988.  And this nasty virus
                    crashed fifteen hundred systems in one day.

        Dade has a flashback.

                    A virus has been planted in the Ellingson
                    Mineral computer system. You were our prime
                    suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found
                    no trace of it.

                                GILL
                    However, we have come to believe that one Joey
                    Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus.
                    He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that
                    Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We
                    want you to help us find it.

        The three secret service agents leave Plague and Dade
        alone.  Plague shuts the door behind them.

                    I can't believe you were only eleven when you
                    wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus.
                    Dade, I know how you might feel about narking
                    on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us,
                    there's no such thing as family and friends.
                    We're each our own country, with temporary
                    allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty
                    with you.

                                DADE
                    I'm sorry. Who are you?

                    Nah. I don't play well with others.

        Plague is holding Dade's baseball bat. He shrugs, turns
        around, and smashes Dade's stereo to smithereens.

                                DADE
                    Shit! Come on!

INT. DADE'S ROOM. LATER.

        Dade is lying in bed. A door opens. It's Kate. She opens
        her motorcycle jacket, revealing her bare breasts. Dade
        starts to get up, she pushes him back own on the bed and
        starts kissing him passionately. He responds in kind.
        Then, Gill, Agent Ray and Agent Bob burst into the room,
        handcuff him, break the two up and haul them away as
        Plague looks on smugly.

        Then Dade wakes up in a sweat.  It was only a dream. He
        regains his composure.  The sound of New York City at
        night surrounds him. He goes back to sleep.

INT. KATE'S PLACE.

        The party. A large, well-furnished apartment in an
        elegant old skyscraper in the fashionable part of town.
        Teenagers dance and writhe to loud, bassy music. Dade and
        Phreak arrive.

                                PHREAK
                    Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help
                    books for women. Stuff like "Women Who Love
                    Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae"

        Phreak shows Dade the book.

                                DADE
                    That explains a lot.

        Kate, the lovely and gracious hostess, mingles and greets
        her many guests, not noticing Dade or Phreak. Cereal
        offers Dade a drink from a plastic bottle. Dade, not
        knowing what he's in for, drinks. Nikon is the Deejay.

                                PHREAK
                                (loudly)

                    Yo Phreak! Dade, man, you made it.

                    check it... don't look right away, what's
                    wrong with you! Look at her man...

        Nikon and Cereal are checking out a truly fine babe.

                                NIKON
                                (concentrating)

                    How did you know that?

                                NIKON
                    I got photographic memory.

                    Lisa!

                                LISA
                    Hey, how do you know my name?

        Cereal and Phreak move through the crowd. Cereal notices
        something.

                                CEREAL
                    Oooo, look at that pooper man. Spandex, it's
                    a privilege, not a right!

INT. MEETING HALL.

        A 12-step recovery group. Addicts, including Joey
        Pardella, sit in a semi-circle.

                                VICKIE
                    Hi, my name is Vickie, and I'm an addict.

                                (smoking)
                    Uh, my name's Joey but, uh, I'm not an addict.

        Joey takes a drag. The group reacts indignantly.

                                JOEY
                    Nono, really, really, listen, listen to this.
                    I got in trouble with my computer, right,
                    okay, and my lawyer told the judge that I'm an
                    addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer!
                    No really, really,

        Joey takes another drag.

                                JOEY
                    I'm not an addict. I'm not, I'm not.

        Joey downs his coffee.

                                JOEY
                    Can I get some more coffee?

INT. KATE'S BEDROOM.

        Phreak is checking out Kate's computer.

                    Dade hits the lights. The four ooo and ahh at
                    its graphics. Kate and Curtis walk into the
                    room and hit the bed, unaware of the hackers
                    in the corner by her laptop.

                    The sensitive type.

        Kate finally notices that Dade, whom she didn't invite, is at her
        party and in her bedroom.

                                KATE

                                MARGO
                    Congratulations.

                    From here I got access to every piece of data
                    ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His
                    parents separated five years ago, reconciled
                    two years later, filed for divorce last year,
                    custody battle, boy chose to go with his
                    mother. Hmm.

                                MARGO
                    So?

                                PLAGUE
                    So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

INT. KATE'S ROOM.

        Kate's room is empty, and Dade can't resist going back in
        to play with her laptop, which far outclasses his own,
        some more. On the balcony, Kate notices and comes back
        in.

                                KATE
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                DADE
                    It's cool, I'm just looking.

                                KATE
                    It's too much machine for you.

                                DADE
                    Yeah?

        Dade starts working furiously on it.

                                KATE
                    I hope you don't screw like you type.

        Dade slows to a two-finger keypoke, not missing a beat.

                                DADE
                    It has a killer refresh rate.

                                KATE
                    P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.

                                DADE
                    Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI
                    bus. But you knew that.

                                KATE
                    Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change
                    everything.

                                DADE
                    Yeah. RISC is good.

        They uncomfortably exchange glances.

                                DADE
                    You sure this sweet machine's not going to
                    waste?

                                KATE
                    Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the
                    Best, Die Like the Rest?"

                                DADE
                    Yeah.

                                KATE
                    Are you challenging me?

                                DADE
                    Name your stakes.

                                KATE
                    If I win, you become my slave.

                                DADE
                                (intrigued)
                    Your slave?

                                KATE
                                (realizing his mind is in the
                                gutter)
                    You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack
                    copyrights, whatever I want.

                                DADE
                    And if I win?

                                KATE
                                (giggles)
                    Make it my first born.

                                DADE
                    Make it our first date.

                                KATE
                    You're not gonna win.

                                DADE
                    And you have to smile.

                                KATE
                    I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so
                    you're on.

MONTAGE: Scenes of Dade and Kate preparing for the challenge.

                                PHREAK
                                (voice over)
                    So here's the deal. The chosen contest: To
                    hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill, and
                    get one back for Joey.

        Dade spray paints camouflage onto his keyboard.

                    Our decisions are final, by a vote of 2 to 1.
                    No appeals.

        Kate rifles through her address book.

                                CEREAL
                    The duel will last until we declare a winner.

        Dade plays quick-draw with disks.

                                PHREAK
                    Use only the dialups, access codes and
                    passwords in your collection. Can't ask for
                    any help from us.

        Dade, having mastered the quick-disk-draw in the mirror,
        looks satisfied.

                                DADE
                                (into mirror)
                    Talking to me?

        All five are together at the beginning of the challenge.

                                PHREAK
                    Any questions?

                                KATE
                    Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?

        Dade and Kate shake hands and the challenge begins.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE.

        At a public phone, Kate hacks into Concourse Bank, looks
        up Richard Gill, and has his credit card maxed out.
        "Destroy Card" is the final instruction. The other
        hackers look on.

INT. RESTAURANT.

        A waiter runs a credit card through a validation machine,
        sees the message and returns to the patron's table. It is
        Richard Gill. Right there, the waiter chops the
        MasterCard in two with a pair of scissors, to Gill's
        horror.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE.

        Dade hacks into an electronic personal ads system and
        changes an ad.

                                KATE
                    Alright, he's in the personal ads.
                                (reading Dade's ad)
                    "Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking
                    for discreet friend to bring dreams to
                    reality. Leather, lace, and water sports.
                    Transvestites welcome."

INT. GILL'S OFFICE.

        At his office, Gill is on the speaker phone with someone
        responding to the ad.

                                GILL
                    I... I... I know where you can stick it... I
                    know where you can stick it...

        Gill punches a button on the phone, another caller comes
        on.

                                CALLER
                    ...wanna lick your earlobes... I wanna lick
                    your lips... I wanna lick your toes... I
                    wanna lick your ankles...

                                GILL
                    Awww, yeah, you wanna lick something? Lick this.

        Gill punches another button, another caller comes on.

                                CALLER
                    That's why they call me Stallion...

                                GILL
                    Aw, that's disgusting!

        Gill punches another button.

                                CALLER
                    My heart is steaming for you...

        Gill punches another button. He is becoming quite flustered.

                                CALLER
                    ...spank you with my...

                                GILL
                    Aww, Spank your ass...

        He punches another button.

        Another caller comes on, and Gill hangs up the phone,
        disgusted, offended, and distraught. The Plague is there,
        witnessing the whole thing.

                                PLAGUE
                    Animal!

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BULDING OBSERVATION DECK.

        It's Kate's turn. Kate is hacking into the Department of
        Motor Vehicles. She adds 113 traffic violations and DUI
        offender status to Gill's record.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY, BUSY STREET.

        Gill is being arrested quite forcefully by a NYC police
        grunt.  He is thrown onto the hood of his car and
        handcuffed.

                                GILL
                     Hey! Hey, ow! Do you know who I am? Do you
                     know who I am?

EXT. CHINATOWN, PUBLIC PHONE.

        Dade's turn. He hacks into the Secret Service's personnel
        file, and changes Gill's status to "Deceased."

INT. GILL'S OFFICE.

                                EMPLOYEE
                                (on phone)
                    This is accounting, sir. You enquired about
                    an employee of ours, an Agent Richard Gill?

                                GILL
                    Yes.

                                EMPLOYEE
                    Our records indicate he's deceased.

                                GILL
                    I'm what?

INT. CYBERDELIA.

        The five are playing pool.

                                DADE
                    Dead.

                                PHREAK
                    Dead?

                                DADE
                    Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.

                                NIKON
                    Very impressive.

                                CEREAL
                    Super hero like even.

                                KATE
                    Yeah, whatever. What's the score?

        Phreak clicks the pool scoreboard so it says 60 - 60.

                                PHREAK
                    Tie.

        The other four protest.

                                PHREAK
                    Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and
                    everything, I guess you two will have to
                    improvise the next round.

                                DADE
                    Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our
                    date.

                                KATE
                    And if I win, so do you.

        Dade thinks about it a second.

                                DADE
                    Deal.

        Kate gives Dade a look that says "I'm going to hold you to
        that."

INT. KATE'S BED. NIGHT.

        A shapely figure wearing a red leather legless suit with a
        zipper that goes all the way around the crotch. Hands
        caress the sultry figure as the camera pans up. The body
        belongs to Dade Murphy.

        Kate wakes up gasping.  It was only a dream. She pants
        and regains her breath. Then she smiles. She enjoyed
        that dream.

                                KATE
                    Oooohhhh...

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY.

                    Kate, at her locker, stops Dade.

                                KATE
                    Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed.

        She opens her locker to reveal a red leather bustier and
        bikini bottom.

                                KATE
                    You are man enough to stick with the deal,
                    aren't you?

        Dade walks off.

INT. DADE'S PLACE.

        Dade signs an electronic pad for a package from UPS. He
        takes the package.

                                DADE
                    Thanks.

        He closes the door and opens the package. It is a laptop
        computer, clear plastic shell, full colour screen. Very
        high-end, perhaps the equal to Kate's machine. He turns
        it on. The Plague's face, distorted, appears. It speaks.

                                PLAGUE
                    You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well
                    let me explain the New World Order.
                    Governments and corporations need people like
                    you and me. We are samurai. The keyboard
                    cowboys. And all those other people out there
                    who have no idea what's going on are the
                    cattle. Mooo! I need your help, you need my
                    help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Ahh,
                    think about it. Enjoy the laptop, "Cool"!
                    Tell me where the disk is.

        Plague's face vanishes.

INT. JOEY'S ROOM.

        Joey lies on his bed with a comic book, looking
        despondent. His mother enters.

                                JOEY'S MOM
                    You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not
                    grounded anymore.

        She kisses his forehead and leaves. He springs back to
        life, gets up and gets the disc from where he stashed it
        in the air vent.

EXT. PARK.

        Joey is nervously waiting on a park bench. Phreak arrives.
        Agents Ray and Bob still have Joey staked out.

                                PHREAK
                    Yo, what's up?

                                JOEY
                    Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute,
                    listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file
                    from...

                                PHREAK
                    Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it,
                    Joey, come on.

                                JOEY
                    Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.

                                PHREAK
                    Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data.
                    Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.

                                JOEY
                    I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're
                    asking me about it, alright? Will you take a
                    look for me?

        Joey hands Phreak the disc. Agent Bob is taking pictures,
        and Phreak notices.

                                PHREAK
                    Oh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.

        Joey sees, and runs for it.

                                JOEY
                    Shit!

        The agents split up, one runs after Joey, the other after
        Phreak.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.

        Phreak has lost his tail. He puts Joey's disc behind a
        condom machine in the boys' room at school, and sticks it
        there with gum.

INT. PHREAK'S ROOM.

        Phreak frantically destroys all records of his hacking
        career. He knows he's about to be busted.

DREAM SEQUENCE.

        The Secret Service is about to burst in on Phreak. He
        still hasn't destroyed any records, and starts manically
        going through everything. Gill is on his laptop screen.

                                GILL
                    I'm watching you...

INT. PHREAK'S ROOM. MORNING.

        A knock on the door. Phreak awakes. It's his mother.

                                PHREAK'S MOM
                    Ramon? Wake up. Ramon! Wake up! Vamano.
                    Time for school, come on.

        The secret service bursts in through the window just as
        Phreak's mom opens the blind. She screams, Phreak leaps
        to his feet.

                                AGENT
                    Secret Service, don't move!

                                PHREAK
                    Deja vu!

                                AGENT BOB
                    Ray Sanchez, you are under arrest, under the
                    Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

        Phreak's mom becomes very angry and starts slapping
        Phreak, cursing in Spanish.

                                PHREAK
                    What are you waiting for, arrest me already!

INT. POLICE STATION LOCKUP.

        The undersized Phreak is just a morsel to the hardened
        thugs behind these bars and they taunt him viciously as he
        is led to his one phone call.

                                COP
                    You get one call. Uno. Understand?

        The cop locks the dial on the phone.

        Phreak waits for the cop to leave, and hangs up. He
        starts rapidly pushing the hangup hook, and he hears a
        ringing tone.

                                OPERATOR
                    Hello, operator services.

                                PHREAK
                    Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a
                    number.

                                OPERATOR
                    What number please?

                                PHREAK
                    555-4202.

                                OPERATOR
                    Just one moment.

                                PHREAK
                    Thank you.

        Kate answers.

                                KATE
                    Hello?

                                PHREAK
                    Hey, it's me.

                                KATE
                    Phreak?

                                PHREAK
                    I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He
                    really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the
                    disc with a file he copied and now I'm in
                    jail! They're charging me with some serious
                    shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do,
                    like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and
                    they keep asking about you guys.

                                KATE
                    You think they're going to bust us?

                                PHREAK
                    Yeah! You better figure out what's on that
                    disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that
                    place where I put that thing that time?

        He hangs up just as the cop returns.

INT. SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.

        Kate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the
        boys look on amusedly.  She finds the disc behind the
        condom machine and pockets it. Then she buys a condom from
        the machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire.

INT. DADE'S PLACE.

        Kate knocks. Mrs. Murphy lets Kate and Cereal in.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Hi!
                                (looking Kate over)
                    Well, now I see what all the fuss is about.
                                (she shows them to Dade's room)
                    Dade... you have company.

                                CEREAL
                    It's a nice room.

                                KATE
                    We need your help.

                                DADE
                    Do my ears deceive me?

        Kate starts to leave.

                                CEREAL
                    Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got
                    a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up
                    call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand
                    free access to data, well, it comes with some
                    responsibility. When I was a child, I spake
                    as a child, I understood as a child, I thought
                    as a child, but when I became a man I put away
                    childish things.
                                (pause)
                    What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse
                    11, no duh. Come on.

                                KATE
                    Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need
                    your help to figure out what's on this disc.

                                DADE
                    I can't. Everybody who touches that thing
                    gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested,
                    I'm sorry.

                                CEREAL
                    Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or
                    something.

        Cereal leaves the room.

                                KATE
                    What is it with you? I know we've been
                    playing games, but, we're supposed to be on
                    the same side and we really need your help. I
                    really need your help.

                                DADE
                    I'm sorry, I can't.

                                KATE
                    Well, could you just make a copy of the disc?
                    And just hide it in case we get busted, so we
                    have something to give our lawyers, something
                    that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do
                    that?

        A knock on the door. Dade's mom peeks in.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in
                    the fridge. Cereal has.

        She leaves.

                                KATE
                                (to Mrs. Murphy)
                    Thank you.

                                DADE
                    Okay. I'll copy it.

                                KATE
                    Okay, thank you.

        Later.  Plague phones Dade. Plague has Lauren Murphy's
        records on his screen.

                                PLAGUE
                    The girl. The girl has the disc I need.

                                DADE
                    I told you, I don't play well with others.

                                PLAGUE
                    Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a
                    file.

        Dade does.

        An extensive criminal record with a strange woman's
        picture comes up. The strange woman transforms into
        Dade's mother.

                                PLAGUE
                    Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the
                    state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement,
                    two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole.
                    When she's arrested, she will not have a
                    trial, she will not pass go, she will go
                    directly to jail. Then I change this file
                    back to the original, and your mom disappears.

                                DADE
                    That's bullshit.

                                PLAGUE
                    What can I tell you. Computers never lie,
                    kid. Your mom will be arrested at work,
                    she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip
                    searched.

                                DADE
                    You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.

                                PLAGUE
                    Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse
                    things than death and, uh, I can do all of
                    them!

        Dade emerges from his room. His exhausted, overworked
        mother is asleep on the couch. He pulls a blanket over
        her.

EXT. PUBLIC PHONE, WET STREET, NIGHT.

        Shortly after, Dade is outside on a payphone.

                                PLAGUE
                    Talk to me.

                                DADE
                    I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's
                    on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it
                    out. She's not the one who planted the virus.
                    You leave her alone.

                                PLAGUE
                    Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent,
                    she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?

        Dade hangs up and waits for some time.  A limousine drives
        by, with a skateboarder tailing. Plague grabs the disc,
        jumps in the limo and speeds away. Dade tries to chase
        but gives up quickly.

INT. KATE'S ROOM.

        Dade shows up.  Kate, Nikon, and Cereal are working on the
        disc.

                                DADE
                    Kate, listen.

                                KATE
                    Uh, hold on...

                                DADE
                    I have to tell you something.

                                CEREAL
                    Hold on a second!

                                NIKON
                    Look at this, it's so lean and clean.

                                CEREAL
                    Looks like a hacker wrote it.

                                KATE
                    Come here, look at this. This thing is dense.

        Nikon points out part of the code.

                                NIKON
                    But that's ill, man. It's incomplete. This
                    is taking forever and a day to figure out.
                    I'm gonna make some coffee.

        Dade takes Nikon's place.

                                CEREAL
                    Tag, you're in.

        Hours pass. Dade studies and reverse engineers the
        garbage file. The other hackers watch, and do just about
        anything but be hackers. Finally, over boxes of
        half-finished pizza, Dade makes an announcement.

                                DADE
                    This isn't a virus. It's a worm!

                                NIKON
                    What's this one eat?

                                DADE
                    It nibbles. You see this?

        Dade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display.

                                DADE
                    This is every financial transaction Ellingson
                    conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to
                    the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.

                                KATE
                    The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.

                                DADE
                    And no one's caught it because the money isn't
                    really gone. It's just data being shifted
                    around.

                                KATE
                    Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out
                    with the money and erases its tracks.

                                DADE
                    Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
                    Check it out. By this point, it's already
                    running at, what, twice the speed as when it
                    started.

                                KATE
                    Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...

                                NIKON
                    Two days.

                                DADE
                    And judging by this segment alone, it's
                    already eaten about...

                                CEREAL
                    21.8 million bucks, man.

        Nikon whistles.

                                KATE
                    Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the
                    fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and
                    that's us. We've got to get the rest of the
                    file, so we can find out where the money is
                    going before the worm disappears, so we can
                    find out WHO created it.

                                DADE
                    I know, I know who wrote it.

                                KATE
                    What?

                                DADE
                    This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a
                    copy of the disc you gave me.

                                KATE
                    You what?

                                DADE
                    I didn't know what was on it.

                                CEREAL
                                (agitated)
                    Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!

                                NIKON
                    Yo, man, you an amateur, man.

                                KATE
                    Why did he come to you?

                                DADE
                    I got a record. I was Zero Cool.

                                NIKON
                    Zero Cool? Crashed fifteen hundred and seven
                    systems in one day?

        Nikon closes his eyes and access his photographic memory.

                                NIKON
                    Biggest crash in history, front page, New
                    York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought
                    you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero
                    Cool! Oh, shit!

                                CEREAL
                    That's far out!

                                NIKON
                    This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!

                                KATE
                                (coldly)
                    Well that's great. There goes MIT.

                                DADE
                    I'll make it up to you!

                                KATE
                    How?

                                DADE
                    I'll hack the Gibson.

                                NIKON
                    They'll trace you like that
                                (snaps his fingers)
                    man, cops are gonna find you, they're
                    gonna find you with a smoking gun.

                                DADE
                    Fucked if I care, man.

                                NIKON
                    Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll
                    take you ten minutes to get in, and you've
                    still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the
                    cops will have you in... five minutes.

                                CEREAL
                    Oh wow, we are fried.

                                KATE
                                (suddenly lighter-hearted)
                    Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With
                    me, we can do it in seven.

                                CEREAL
                    You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.

                                NIKON
                    Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help,
                    we can do it in five minutes, man.

                                DADE
                    Okay. Let's go shopping.

                                CEREAL
                    Woo hoo! Boom!

EXT. OUTSIDE ELLINGSON BUILDING.

        Dade and Kate cut through a chain link fence and jump into
        a dumpster at Ellingson. Kate lands on Dade.

                                DADE
                    You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of
                    honor, I might take advantage of this
                    situation.  Erotically, as it were.

        Kate fishes around in her pants, never breaking eye
        contact with Dade. She pulls out a flashlight. They
        start trashing. They get up to leave and are spotted by a
        security guard.

                                GUARD
                    Alright, hold it right there!

        Kate pulls out a flare gun and fires it at the security
        guard.  He ducks.

                                DADE
                    Shit!!

                                KATE
                    It's my subway defense system.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET.

        Nikon is staring down a manhole, Cereal is fishing through
        an adjacent phone company truck.

                                NIKON
                    He's way down there.

        Cereal emerges with a beltload of equipment and a hard hat.
        But he forgot the most important thing.

                                CEREAL
                    Ta-da!

                                NIKON
                    Yo, brain dead, the manual!

        Cereal goes back to the truck and gets a thick manual. The
        phone company technician comes up from the manhole.

                                PHONE COMPANY TECH
                    Hey!

                                CEREAL AND NIKON
                                (in unison, pointing down the street)
                    TRUCK!!!

        The phone company tech jumps back in the hole, Cereal and
        Nikon take off.

INT. SECRET SERVICE BULDING.

        A woman is seated at the desk.  Agent Gill walks by.

                                WOMAN
                    Find it?

        Cereal emerges from the desk, between her legs. His tool
        belt dangles obscenely from his crotch.

                                CEREAL
                    Phone's alright. The problem must be
                    somewhere else.

        Cereal walks away with his buttcrack seriously showing.

INT. ELLINGSON MINERAL OFFICES.

        Nikon poses as a flower delivery boy. He winds his way
        through the offices of Ellingson Mineral, "shoulder
        surfing", watching the workers entering passwords. His
        photographic memory captures everything.  The Plague walks
        past him, noticing briefly but not making the connection.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

        The Da Vinci virus' launch/cancel prompt is up.

                                MARGO
                                (pacing)
                    They had a large chunk of the garbage file?
                    How much do they know?

                                PLAGUE
                    Not everything. But enough to implicate us.

                                MARGO
                    You said the worm was untreaceable!

                                PLAGUE
                    Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers.
                    But don't worry. All we have to do is launch
                    the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be
                    put away.

                                MARGO
                    Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!

                                PLAGUE
                    No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the
                    time they realize the truth, we'll be long
                    gone with all of our money.

        Margo starts to protest.

                                PLAGUE
                    Look, there is no right and wrong.  There is
                    only fun and boring. A thirty year prison
                    sentence sounds pretty dull to me.  Who do you
                    prefer serves it, us? Or them?

        Plague clicks on "Launch". The virus repeats its demand.

                                VIRUS
                    Unless five million dollars are transferred to
                    the following numbered account in seven days,
                    I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson
                    fleet.

EXT. OPEN SEA.

        As the virus speaks, a supertanker sails on a choppy sea.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

        Plague leaves a message on Gill's answering machine.

                                PLAGUE
                                (sternly)
                    The virus goes off tomorrow morning at 10:30,
                    and those hackers tried to get into our system
                    again. At this point I insist you take more
                    strenuous action, or Ellingson Mineral will
                    hold the Secret Service responsible.

        Gill gets on the phone.

                                GILL
                                (grimly)
                    Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias
                    Acid Burn, Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal
                    Killer, Dade Murphy, alias Crash Override,
                    also known as Zero Cool, and Paul Cook, alias
                    Lord Nikon. We pick them up tomorrow morning
                    at nine o'clock.

        As Gill gives the order, a mysterious device under his
        desk blinks. Cereal put it there.

INT. NIKON'S PLACE.

        Nikon and Cereal taped Gill's orders.

                                CEREAL
                    Snoop onto them...

                                NIKON
                    ...as they snoop onto us.

        Nikon calls Kate.

                                KATE
                    Yeah, it's Kate.

                                NIKON
                    Hey, Burn. We got a little problem here.

INT. SUBWAY.

        Cereal, Nikon, Dade and Kate skate through a run down
        subway platform and get on the "A" Train. They go over
        the results of their password gathering spree.

                                KATE
                    Alright, so what have we got?

                                DADE
                    Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever
                    Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.

                                NIKON
                    Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how
                    many but... my head hurts.

                                CEREAL
                    Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the
                    Da Vinci virus?

                                DADE
                    What?

                                CEREAL
                    Check this out. It's a memo about how they're
                    gonna deal with those oil spills that happened
                    on the fourteenth.

                                KATE
                    What oil spills?

                                NIKON
                    Whoa, whoa. Yo, brain-dead, today is the
                    thirteenth.

                                CEREAL
                    Well this hasn't happened yet.

                                KATE
                    Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same
                    day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci
                    virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was
                    being charged with? Look...
                                (quotes the memo)
                    "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson
                    tankers" - they blame hackers!

                                NIKON
                                (angry)
                    Damn!

                                CEREAL
                    A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.

        Kate gets ready to get off the subway.

                                NIKON
                    Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, where are you going,
                    huh?

                                KATE
                    I got an idea. We've got a few hours, right,
                    till we get arrested. So just stay low. I'm
                    gonna go get some help. I'll beep you, okay?
                                (to Dade)
                    Are you coming?

        Dade gets up.

                                CEREAL
                    May the Force be with you, man.

INT. INDUSTRIAL DANCE CLUB.

        Weird music plays, lots of weird people dance.  Razor and
        Blade are on stage, dancing in front of a huge speaker.

                                KATE
                    There they are!

                                DADE
                    Razor and Blade! They're flakes!

                                KATE
                    They're elite! Let's get 'em.

        Dade and Kate push through the crowd. The song changes to
        a fast industrial rap number, Razor and Blade leave the
        stage, and Dade starts getting moshed. He climbs on the
        stage to follow Razor and Blade. For his trouble, he is
        thrown back onto the crowd, who pass him around overhead.

        Finally the crowd lets him go.  He catches up with Kate.

                                KATE
                    I lost 'em. Where were you?

        Dade tries to explain, but is at a loss for words.

        They make their way to the entrance to Razor and Blade's
        lair. Video monitors are everywhere.

                                DADE
                    I don't like this.

        A robotic arm with a revolver swings around to point at
        Dade.

                                DADE
                    AAAAAUGH! I definitely don't like this!

                                BLADE
                                (through video intercom)
                    What do you want?

                                DADE
                    Ummm... we come in peace?

        Dade winces at his own corniness.

                                KATE
                    We need your help.  If you're up to it.

                                RAZOR
                    She's buff. Ballsy.

                                BLADE
                    Let's keep her.

                                RAZOR
                    Waste the dude.

        The gun goes off. It's only a cigarette lighter! No one
        can accuse Razor and Blade of not having a sense of humor.

INT. RAZOR AND BLADE'S PLACE.

                                KATE
                    A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills
                    at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.

                                DADE
                    It's somehow connected with the worm that's
                    stealing the money.

                                KATE
                    We need your help to overload the Gibson so we
                    can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the
                    worm program.

                                RAZOR
                    She's rabid, but cute.

                                BLADE
                    See, we're very busy. A TV network that

        Dade just smiles.

INT. DADE'S ROOM.

        Dade hacks into the city traffic light control system.
        Suddenly there is gridlock on the streets of New York
        City.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK.

        Nikon is playing chess against two Hassidic Jews.
        Cereal's beeper goes off. It displays the message:

                    Yo. I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand
                    Central. Let's hit it!

        Nikon checkmates his opponent and the two leave.

        Dade, Cereal, Nikon, and Kate skate through the streets.
        Dade's program to freeze all the traffic lights on green,
        runs on schedule at 9:00:00 precisely. Picture New York City in
        morning rush hour, and every traffic light is green. Instant
        gridlock ensues. The four skate through the traffic easily, while
        the Secret Service, now pursuing them, is stuck. Gill punches a
        parked car in frustration. Its alarm goes off.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

        The four hackers skate into Grand Central Station and head
        to the lowest level. They meet up with Joey.

                    Hey Joey, you made it!

INT. GRAND CENTRAL PUBLIC PHONES.

        The hackers are now setting up laptops at a bank of pay
        phones.  Dade is wearing a "Pirate Eye" eyepiece.

                                KATE
                    Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us
                    time, we have to get into Plague's file and
                    copy the worm.

        Cereal takes off to fix the phones.

                                KATE
                    Take his place, man, do it. You can do it.

        Joey takes Cereal's place.

                                KATE
                    Ready?

                                DADE
                    Yeah.

                                KATE
                    Alright, let's boot up.

        The four boot up their machines. Various vanity screens
        come up on the laptops. They begin to hack. We see the
        inside of the Gibson. Viruses of all kinds begin to pour
        in. In the offices and data processing rooms, the
        Ellingson staff are in pandemonium. Happy faces with eye
        patches appear on their screens. "Sit on my interface."
        "Shit for Brains." "Arf Arf Arf!" Cookie monsters.

                    you are floating. And I'm about to flush your
                    ass.

        The intercom beeps.

                                AGENT
                    You've got a Mrs. Murphy to see you, sir.

        Gill leaves.

                                KATE
                    Are you crazy? What are you doing?

                                DADE
                    I'm trying to help you.

        She pauses, realizing his gesture.

                    Dade.

                                DADE

                                KATE
                    Thanks for your help.

        Dade turns on the intercom. Gill can be heard through it.

                                GILL
                                (grimly)
                    Your son is in big trouble. He has violated
                    his probation and he has engaged in criminal
                    activity.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    My son happens to be a genius. He understands
                    something happening today that you won't
                    comprehend if you live to be a hundred, and he
                    would never use what he knows to harm a living
                    soul.

        Agent Bob enters.

                    Oh good. Cause I have a few things to tell
                    them.

                                GILL
                    Your son is facing thirty felony counts in an
                    ongoing investigation. You face possible
                    arrest if you do that.

                                MRS. MURPHY
                    Mister, I don't care if I face certain death.

                                GILL
                    Mrs. Murphy stays right here.

                    threat to the national security. This
                    incident just proves without a doubt that we

                    But for what, you ask? World domination?
                    Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called
                    Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause
                    Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be
                    blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was
                    really the smokescreen, right. What could be
                    so vitally important to protect that someone
                    would create such a nasty, antisocial, very
                    uncool virus program?

EXT. NEW YORK CITY SIDEWALK. NIGHT.

        Dade and Kate are on their date. Dade is smartly,
        somewhat androgynously dressed. Kate is heavily made up,
        and yes, she is wearing a dress.

                                DADE
                    You look good in a dress.

                                KATE
                    You would have looked better.

                    Wanna go for a swim?

EXT. ROOFTOP SWIMMING POOL.

        Dade and Kate swimming, fully clothed, in a pool on a

                                KATE
                    I can't believe they decided you won.

                                DADE
                    They didn't. The guys felt it was the only
                    way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty
                    good. You're elite.

                    Yeah? You know if you would have said so in
                    the beginning, you would have saved yourself
                    a whole lot of trouble.

        They look out at the skyline. Suddenly, the lights in
        three buildings change. They spell out:

                    Beat that!

        Kate continues laughing.

          NARRATOR (V.0.)
          I saw a severed head once. Except for the,
          paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed.
          The end came abruptly you could tell
          'cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence.
          "Shh.  ," the curled lips attempted. Like
          it started saying "shucks" or "Shirley"
          or... "shit happens." Your eyes don't
          forget things like that. Like you don't
          forget the sound animals make when
          they're humping. Primal.
          Raw. They endure
          in you forever because the senses have a
          brain all their own and they recall long
          after you've succumbed to the la-la of
          forgetfulness.

          Sometimes when it's dark out,-so dark
          it's black, I'll see HIM.

          (BEAT)
          And it starts all over again.
          From this blackness, a streak of LIGHTNING splits the night sky.

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          the approaching entity as it hovers before us.
          It's a man.
          It's a man, plus.
          It's a SUPERHERO,
          garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends b
          ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain.
          This Superhero (30). Unshaven.
          Disheveled. Worn. A face
          chiselled with mileage.
          

          

          2.
          In the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed
          nerve, snagged in a fish hook.
          He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off.
          He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated
          visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood.
          And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a
          thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land.
          He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect,
          engulfed in the dimensions of his cape.
          The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it.
          Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT.
          An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating
          the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the
          ruptured orifice as he disappears inside.
          There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches
          nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG
          down the street like loose change.
          The rain continues its onslaught.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Rain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not
          far from the kitchen table. Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits,
          dinner before them.
          HORUS (35) leans over his plate, eating his meal. Here idles a
          man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as
          low fat milk.
          He sits opposite MARY (30), frenetically appropriating food. A
          gentle beauty. entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an
          attitude.
          A meek little AARON (8), slouches between the folks - a BLACK
          EYE tattoos the left of his face. Aaron stares at the damn
          plate, finding no humor in eggplant.

          MARY
          The principal did'nothing. Like
          schoolyard terrorism is no worse than
          being tardy. What's the matter with
          education? Back when, you could go to
          school and learn about Betsy Ross and...
          mollusks and... not get stabbed on the
          way home.

          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

          A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its
          side and plumes into a wall of white mist.
          And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He
          surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his
          gait.
          It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the
          collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck,
          PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him.
          He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He
          strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti-
          raped subway wall.
          On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...

          "YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS."
          He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat
          pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips
          into the metal vendor like it was Jello.
          His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the
          loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.
          Deposits it under his coat.
          And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets
          above.
          At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors.
          Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE
          mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          see STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water.
          It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits
          another set of pots. She's clearing the table.
          Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open
          door. Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes
          out of his clothes.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs. He stands before
          the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in-
          the-face body.

          Fish turns to the back wall. Grabs a random KEY from a nail.

          FISH
          Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front.
          (re: the check-in sheet)
          And your John Hancock makes it sweet.
          The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles

          HANCOCK
          on the dotted line.
          Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's
          grab.

          FISH (CONT'D)
          I don't take messages, I don't do favors,
          and I don't know you from Jack. You want
          sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra.
          Plunger's extra.

          HANCOCK
          I need quiet. Is it quiet?

          FISH
          Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public
          library to you? The girls work. Some of
          them scream, some of them moan...

          (SMILES)
          and some of them just kinda lay there
          cold. You want quiet, I got cotton balls
          you can stick in your ear. They're extra.

          Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare
          hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it
          under the window.

          And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a
          deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly.

          Hancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the
          strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and
          CLINKS off the counter.
          Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue.

          Horus, in full uniform - dark blue pants, shirt.

          He dips into a dresser, pulls out a thick black leather belt -
          complete with holster.

          Horus returns to the dresser for one final item - It's obscured
          by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal.
          He confronts the mirror, twirls this piece, holsters it. And we
          SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT.
          A shoulder patch reads...

          U-RENT SECURITY CO.
          Their motto: "TO OBSERVE AND RECORD"
          Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move.

          INT. AARON'S ROOM - NIGHT

          A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge. Outside, the story
          is rain.
          On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty
          ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face.
          Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it.
          Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's
          interpretation of a man's weapon.
          A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles. Horus peers in.

          HORUS
          How's the eye?

          AARON
          Black.
          Horus enters.
          Stands awkwardly before his son.

          HORUS
          It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it
          up with some make-up and you won't even
          know it's there.

          AARON
          Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly
          make-up on my face.
          Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.

          

          

          

          

          B.

          HORUS
          (almost apologetically)
          There'll always be people around
          who'll... exert force over those of us
          who just want to live in peace.
          Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.

          HORUS (CONT' D)
          (pain in every word)
          The thing to do is... to avoid them.
          They're no-wins. Can't-wins. You hold the
          anger... and move on. You hold the anger.
          (turns to Aaron)
          I tell you because I can't take it,
          seeing you hurt. You're part of me.

          (BEAT)
          I've felt what you're feeling now. And if
          you've got any of me in you, you're gonna
          feel what I felt-when you go up against
          one of 'em. Turn away... that's what you
          do... the other cheek. You do that for
          me. No, you're not the coward. Not you.
          No. I'll be the coward, all right? 'Cause
          I don't want to see you hurt. I love you.
          I ask you to do that for me... your old
          man.
          And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark
          hallway - moved b y his affection.
          She oversees a father-son embrace.

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          I'm late for work. Get some sleep.
          Tomorrow always feels better...

          AARON
          .after a good night sleep.
          The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the
          room.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Horus backs his way out. Shuts the door. Mary's hand greets him
          from behind.
          It startles the man. He.tries to regroup.

          HORUS
          Mary.

          

          

          

          

          9.
           Mary inches closer - passion oozes from every pore. She nestles
          up against her husband.
           Horus stands uncoordinated, pressing his hands against her back.
          He is gentle, but as effective as an armless masturbator.
           Mary caresses his neck. Moves her lips to his ear, enraptured

          BY
          the moment.
          And out of nowhere...

          HORUS (CONT'D)

          (AWKWARD)
          I'm late.
          Mary snaps from her trance. Unshackles her hold, like she almost
          expected it.

          MARY

          (DISAPPOINTED)
          Right.

          (BEAT)
          Coffee's by the door.
           She marches back into the kitchen. Horus stares at his feet.
          S hakes his fists, mentally kicking himself in the face.
           He settles for the door, grabs hisjac ke , coffee thermos. A

           And while the storm rages outside, Mary burns in a feverish
          sweat. The swelling steam and running ho t water combine to
          saturate her chest and face - she drips.
           Mary gazes out at the wet abyss, possessed by some inner
          longing.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM (7F) - NIGHT

          trenehc -lï¿½n open carton of cigarettes accompanies the
          picture.
          An open door faces the MOANING TV set. It's the bathroom and
          it's occupied by the intensely frazzled image of Hancock.
          He squats on the TOILET, pants around the ankles, cape shrouded
          around him.
          Those unforgiving eyes plant on the TV screen, a cigarette
          dangling from the corner of his lip.
          We discern the MOANS to be human and we SEE that he is watching
          a PORNO flick - flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking frenzy.

          T.V. SET (O.S.)

          (male; in ecstasy)
          fly. YES! G0000D!
          Hancock absorbs the action from the can, a glint of pain on his
          face.
          He takes a long hard drag on the cigarette - a full stick
          deteriorates into ashes before our eyes.
          And outside, it rains like there's no tomorrow.

          Morning brings a cease-fire on precipitation. The streets
          glimmer from puddles left behind from the night.
          The overcast sky - its precarious rain formation indicates that
          the storm is far from over.

          A SUPERMAN lunchbox perches on the kitchen table. Mother and son

          INT. RED EYE MOTEL (7F) - DAY

          An ASHTRAY buried under a mountain of butts.
          A bed unslept. The TV is on, commercialing some spring-fresh
          vaginal wash. The room sits empty.
          But the bathroom door is open. Inside, the supersuit peeled down
          to his waist, Hancock shaves.

          From the street, notice the display windows - all mannequins
          come complete with outfit and ultra-erect nipples.
          As EMPLOYEES file into the service entrance, out comes Horus and
          Roheim. They head streetward, to the sidewalk.
          Roheim unscrews the battery cap from his flashlight. Takes a
          swig from its hollow interior.

          ROHEIM

          A POLICE VEHICLE enters this urban landscape. It slows in front

          Boys...
          The cops smile at one another. A large SHOTGUN rests fully erect

          Horus, watching them go, focuses in on the

          "TO SERVE AND PROTECT"
          of their vehicle.
          Roheim watches him - turning red with drama.

          ROHEIM
          Bastards... couldn't protect a pitcher of
          warm spit... couldn't find their
          asshole with common sense and a thumb.

          jerk-offs, they don't got the heart...
          the sensitivity of a man like you.
          Horus tries to shrug off these words. No good - they stick like
          a thorn in the eye of his soul.

          ROHEIM (CONT'.D)

          On the rooftop; the Red Eye Motel.
          A trenchcoated figure - we see him from the back, only. We
          recognize the broad of his shoulders and the red of his cape,
          peering out from a hole in his coat.
          A cloud of smoke lingers above his head, from an unseen
          cigarette. He stands before the Sheepshead neighborhood, ever so
          still.
          Something brews within this superman.

          AARON
          I know it. I know it.

          MARY
          I think I'm... slow down... I'm gaining

          AARON
          What?

          MARY
          Is my dress too tight?

          AARON
          What? Nothing. It's fine.

          MARY
          Really, my waist isn't too big?

          AARON
          What? Not here, mom.

          Geez!
          He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks.

          MARY
          Two-thirty.

          AARON
          All right, mom.
          He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.

          MARY

          You want anything from the store?
          He's gone.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          This is the Longfellow's street - lower-middle class but
          comfortable, quaint, safe. Mr. Longfellow, hustling through the
          street, takes us home.
          Greeting him at the entrance, at the mailboxes, is CLYDE BANNER

          This arm protrudes from the dark Chevy, parked before the bank.
          The engine is running.
          The arm fidgets. SHOOS the insect away. With white knuckles, it
          grips the wheel.

          Same bank, same people. Mary awaits service in the same line.
          A MAN ambles pass Mary's line, up towards the front. He cuts off
          the person in front, an elderly WOMAN.

          WOMAN
          Hey, what's the idea?
          The man turns. Smiles. His smile fades, turning into a maniacal.
          grin. This man is TOM (35), as plainly evil as the eye can see.

          Of course, by now, people have realized the implications of the
          situation at hand. They begin to panic.
          On cue, two new GUNMEN, JERRY and JERRY (30's), emerge from the
          crowded bank, both revealing automatic RIFLES.
          Jerry #1 drops the SECURITY GUARD with the butt of his gun.
          As planned, they take aim at the surveillance CAMERAS on each
          end of the bank. BANG. BANG. They miss, much to Tom's chagrin.
          The crowd ducks, Mary among them. Terror grips,the queues.
          The Jerrys try again. BANG. BANG. No more cameras. And with
          ,Irâº that, Tom takes center stage. He leaps on the teller counter.

          Aaron, nestled mid-room, tries to keep his eyes straight.
          He steals a quick look to the back of the room: there, in the
          back, a BLONDE boy (8) sits chewing gum.
          This kid, from the slicked-back hair and rolled-up t-shirt
          sleeves, is a sub-species of vermin.

          It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway
          Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps

          Hancock approaches earth and swings lateral. He circumvents the

          Everybody ducks. Trash and paper batter about behind his draft.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Tom and the Jerrys stand shackled in their spots.
          Their eyes wander about, lost in confusion. The WHIR outside
          subsides. Stops.
          A loaded beat.
          Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular EXPLOSION of
          bricks sprays the air inside. A caped figure bursts into the
          scene amidst SCREAMS from clueless hostages.
          in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar. With
          a flick of the wrists, Jerry #2 is a human projectile en route
          to the windshield of a police vehicle outside.
          Jerry #1 opens FIRE on Hancock. Bullets careen off flesh of
          steel.

          Smoke and debris smother the air. And as they subside, all eyes
          fall on the caped figure that is Hancock, erect in the rubble.
          Mary can't believe her eyes. She surveys every inch of his
          frame, now clean-shaven, combed, comic book perfect.
          Hancock scans the crowd of stunned hostages - his eyes pick out
          the WOMEN - Veronica's wet smile takes him.
          A heartbeat.

          The bank floor in shambles. No one in sight. But movement jars
          us to the back, where the bank SAFE is.
          We SEE Hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe, a
          thick steel chamber of commerce. Hancock arrives at the safe.
          Confronts the object inside - Tom.

          INT. BANK SAFE - DAY

          There he is, in the corner, a sweaty piece of misery. Tom bears
          his revolver, aimed at Hancock. Hancock enters the safe.

          Hancock turns, grabs the safe door. Slams it shut with a
          resounding THUD. They're locked in.

          TOM (CONT'D)

          (HYSTERICAL)
          What're you doing?

          BANG! Tom fires a. shot off Hancock's forehead. The BULLET
          ricochets about the steel interior, under great velocity.
          It rips Tom's right EAR from his head.

          HANCOCK
          (catching the renegade slug)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back,
          clutching his head. He bleeds.

          HANCOCK

          NO!

          INT. BANK - DAY

          On the bank floor, where a group of cops now huddle, we hear
          THREE SHOTS - from the safe.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          The schoolyard - it looms in the background, as a reference to
          where we are.
          Aaron occupies this alley and we see what he sees - trash and
          fire-escapes and ominous gray skies. DARK FIGURES move into this
          sight - they eclipse the heavens.
          And there Aaron is, twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs
           - his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of SPENGLER
          and ERLICK (both his age.)
          Aaron's face, another BLACK EYE makes it a set. Rage distorts
          his mouth out of symmetry. He stares at PERCEVAL, before him -
          the blonde kid from class.
          We HEAR water, a stream of liquid-something SPLASHING about,
          SPRAYING. Perceval - he's taking a leak on Aaron's exposed leg.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          The aftermath.
          Hancock is swarmed under MEDIA LIGHTS, reporters squeezing
          through a wall of people, police, trying to get a piece of this
          superman.

          

          

          

          

          29.
          We follow Hancock's scope amidst the melee it spots luscious
          Veronica again, it spots WOMEN, all who'd die for a chance to
          suck on his cape.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Mary hastens after Aaron, urine-soaked and on the verge of
          tears. He rages down the street while his mother pursues.

          MARY
          Tell me... what happened?

          AARON
          (about to break)
          You were late.

          MARY
          I was held up...

          AARON
          The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit.

          MARY
          .at the bank. Honey, were they the same
          ones? Don't cry.

          AARON
          Get a grip, mom.
          They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the
          stairs.

          EXT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door SLAMS to signify arrival. School books go flying.
          Mother and son march down the hallway. They are greeted by
          Horus, sleep still on his face.

          HORUS
          How was your day?
          Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel.

          EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          30.
          But all is not well with this typically normal picture. On the
          top floor, outside and on the ledge - a JUMPER stands poised
          before blood and concrete. His TIE flaps in the wind.
          From an adjacent window, a SECRETARY, a FIREMAN attempt to get
          him down.

          JUMPER'

          (SELF-PITY)
          People ignore me.
          From his vantage - a congregation of PEOPLE swarm below in his
          honor. A woman cradling a BABY watches from a building window
          across the street.

          FIREMAN
          Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          (through her teeth)
          You're not unattractive.

          FIREMAN
          Baldness is not fatal.

          JUMPER
          My wife ignores me.

          FIREMAN
          Your wife's a cunt, Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls
          acknowledge you, we all do.

          JUMPER
          No.

          SECRETARY
          Yes.

          JUMPER
          Really?
          The secretary SCREAMS. All attention shifts to the BUILDING
          across the street. The secretary points...

          EXT. OPPOSITE BUILDING - DAY

          There...

          

          

          

          

          31.
          on the top floor, outside and on the ledge - the baby seen
          earlier, diaper-clad, crawls precariously on the rim of doom.
          His mother's FREAKING from the window.
          Below, the crowd makes its way across the street. They point and
          gasp at the infant's every movement - leaving the jumper by his
          lonesome.
          The baby teeters along the edge. It heads for a FLAG pole,
          dazzled by the red-white-and-blue. It reaches out at fabric.
          Almost. Not quite. The baby DROPS from the precipice.
          On the street, people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls
          the infant down.
          But wait... Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and
          silent. He cradles the baby from utter concrete.
          He deposits the youngster with.the ecstatic crowd - they, of
          mostly the FEMALE persuasion, all form around the savior.
          We SEE in the background and across the street, the Jumper nose-
          diving into the sidewalk - without much fanfare.

          Like a wrecking ball, Hancock BURSTS through the burning rubble
          and surfaces clean on the other side of the building.

          We're in the hallway. Where Horus kneels. He's bent listening
          into Aaron's bedroom, in his security clothes. By the TV and in
          her apron, Mary watches the news...

          We see FOOTAGE of the dramatic fire rescue: Hancock recovering
          tenants from the pyre - plebs and dwellers cheer in exaggerated
          astonishment.

          HORUS
          (to Mary)
          Mary?
          Mary blinks back her attention.

          HORUS (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Why is he mad at me?

          MARY
          He's looking for answers. He's Upset.

          HORUS
          (tapping the door)
          Let me see your eye...
          (to Mary)
          I told him about the other cheek. Avoid
          confrontations... to turn the other
          cheek.

          MARY
          .He did. He turned the other cheek and
          they punched it.

          Aaron.

          MARY
          You're late. I'll try again later.
          Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her
          back to him. She's glued to the set.

          HORUS '
          How... what about you?

          MARY

          (ALOOF)
          What?
          Horus turns his focus to the TV - more Hancock FOOTAGE. He
          watches Mary.

          what I'd do... if you...

          turns to face an empty room.

          INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

          A room, a place we don't know. It's dark save the street light
          outside. A rhythmic POUNDING reverberates through this darkness.
          More intense it becomes.
          And then a high-pitch GASP. Two individuals, man and woman,
          stumble into view - their silhouettes obscure the window.
          They're locked at the hips, pumping away like high-revving
          pistons.
          For a second, light dances off the woman's aroused face: it's
          Veronica.

          VERONICA
          (a her voice trembles)
          Oh god.
          The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with
          sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away from his arm.
          Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her
          breasts beckoning at ceiling.
          Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his pants. Unlatches the
          window. She paws after him.

          'Nothing. I'm sorry.
          And with that, he floats out into the night.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Horus. His walk. Unaware of everything but the storm inside his
          head.
          He crosses an alley. A band of THUGS, neighborhood kids of
          malcontent, surprises him. And. versa. They recoil at his
          uniform, his gun.
          They quickly realize that he's rent-a-security.
          The leader speaks first - he's SCARPO (25), as tough as a steel-
          belted radial. The others regroup their DRUGS.

          SCARPO
          Nutri-cop.
          Horus keeps walking.

          SCARPO (CONT'D)

          Shit, ain't half the Man.

          A slight drizzle shimmers pass the streetlight. Pelts a soulful
          Hancock below - he moves through the gray dreariness in
          solitude.

          Taps himself a stick.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          How about spreading some of that joy?
          Hancock turns and faces a young HOODLUM, scraggly in his own
          slimy kind of way.
          In a huff, he shoves Hancock up against the building. Presses a
          gun to Hancock's temple.

          HOODLUM

          (PSYCHOTIC)
          Better yet, why don't I just take it...
          Hancock - enraged. In a caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by
          the throat via one arm, the gun with the other.

          HANCOCK

          (SUPER-PSYCHOTIC)
          What are you thinking?
          The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground -
          one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt.
          The other sneaker teeters on his one foot... and falls to the
          pavement.

          HOODLUM
          (fuck me)
          Shit...

          HANCOCK
          What are you thinking?!
          Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own
          mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D )
          Huh?!
          Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth. Shoves it up the-
          Hoodlum's nose.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)
          Want to see brain? Huh?!
          Sticks the gun back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside.
          Takes it out and this time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth.
          The Hoodlum proceeds to urinate in his pants.

          Please, mister. I got a baby coming.., a
          wife. I got student loans...
          Hancock - intense.
          Is this getting through?

          HOODLUM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          please. Have a heart, mister.
          Hancock - the fire inside subsides. Cools to a rational state.
          He lowers the. Hoodlum.
          He spits the three SLUGS into his hand. Deposits them in the
          Hoodlum's breast pocket. Walks away.

          In the closing hours of business, employees pell-mell about in
          preparation for departure.
          A group of LADIES form around a display T.V., taking in with
          frothy wetness every inch of Hancock's footage. They gasp
          amongst themselves.
          Horus enters the picture, jacket and thermos. He notices the TV -

          Aaron surfaces from the hallway, lured out by the TV He comes up
          behind Mary - his black eyes on the news.

          NEON beer signs. POOL tables. CIGARETTE machines. This is home
          to mean people, tough guys - children of a fucked-up god.
          We cut through the nicotine air to find the bar. A figure
          hunches on the far end, smoking. Popping vodka like mountain
          water in Dixie cups.
          It's Hancock and his trenchcoat. The long day wears heavy on his
          face - those perpetually red eyes, the horror they've seen.

          HANCOCK

          (MUTTERING)
          What he's got to do... a man's got to do
          it.

          EXT. BAR - NIGHT

          Hancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up
          above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds.
          We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He
          peers into the alley.
          There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny
          JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his
          legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl.
          The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it...

          

          

          

          

          38.
          A COUGH stops him - it's Hancock and he discourages further
          violence.
          Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his
          legs.
          A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each
          other's eyes for answers.
          The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves
          it into the light.

          WHORE
          (the sage)
          You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're
          tired...

          (BEAT)
          and in need.
          Hancock - his eyes agree.
          The Whore lifts her skirt, reaching into her panties. She takes
          out a MATCHBOOK.
          Hands it to him.

          WHORE (CONY' D)
          My business card.

          From the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the
          side of a building, strikes the metal fire-escapes, crashing
          into the trash cans below.
          Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage. Falls. He leans
          against the building, glazed over with drunkenness.
          He turns to the only source of light that of a building across
          the street: KILLYBEGS TEXTILES, looming above the rest. Boarded-
          up windows indicate abandonment - an urban relic.
          He stares at the building - perhaps sparing more attention than
          we think it deserves.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Mary swallows. Starts in on the tune.

          MARY
          "Once there was a way, to get back
          homeward. Once there was a way, to get
          back home."

          AARON
          Oh, mom.

          MARY
          Shut up.

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          There, on his ass, his head a raging inferno - Hancock listens,
          as if he can hear.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Aaron, succumbing to his mother's song - his lids flutter.

          MARY
          "Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I
          will sing a lullaby..."

          

          

          

          

          40.
          Mary as her voice carries...

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          Something overcomes this fevered superman. He begins to unravel.
          A calm consumes him. Tames him. It could be Mary's voice - maybe
          he can hear it, and then maybe not.

          MARY (V.O.)
          "Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles
          awake you when you rise."
          Hancock wavers on consciousness - quite unlike him.

          MARY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          "Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I
          will sing a lullaby..."
          And like that, a seamless fade into peace - he sleeps.

           CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Erratic traces of an urban landscape JAG about.
          Aaron's distorted view of his neighborhood comes sharp and in
          flashes as he is pursued by his tormentors.
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They chase him from behind, HOOTING,
          taunting poor Aaron - they're out for blood.
          Aaron cuts into an alley, lungs pumping...

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          .. but a brick wall stares him down, providing no exit. He
          swallows hard.
          FOOTSTEPS approach, just seconds away. Close on Aaron, as blood
          drains from his face. His eyes dash for a garbage CAN - but is
          there time?
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They can smell their prey.

          ERLICK
          He's not going anywhere.

          SPENGLER
          'Less he can walk through wall.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          ERLICK
          Fuck... squeeze through brick.

          PERCEVAL
          (just arriving)
          Let's rock it up.
          They turn the corner, attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just
          the brick wall and a trash can.
          They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler
          scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash
          can.
          He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They
          ATTACK... an empty can. No one inside. Nothing.
          That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron
          hovers - under Hancock's capable arm.
          In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them
          away.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          Mary stands at the designated pick-up spot, pacing like her
          bladder's going to break.

          MARY
          (checking watch)
          No... no... no!

          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

          A secluded view of the city, high above. Hancock, Aaron under
          his arms, rides a light breeze - and then lands.
          Aaron scampers away. Turns and faces the man.
          Hancock examines the boy's face, the black eyes. He shakes his
          head. Disappointed.
          He reaches for his belt. Pulls out a cigarette. Lights it.

          HANCOCK
          You smoke?

          AARON
          What?

          

          

          

          

          42.

          HANCOCK
          Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid.
          (beat; takes a puff)
          Smoke no evil.
          Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          (re: cigarette)
          Ever curious... .what it's like?
          Aaron shakes his head.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          (hands it to.him)
          Go on... give it a try. One time. Won't
          kill you. Once.
          Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on
          it. Doubles over, coughing.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your
          first stick. Then, after a few more... it
          starts getting this. flavor. A little
          nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of
          a sudden, it's as sweet as candy. Only
          now, it takes a whole pack to get
          there.., and you won't settle till your,
          mouth's as sweet.
          Hancock takes another cool drag - Mr. Wisdom waxing
          philosophical.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          From manure to pure cane sugar. That's
          change. Today... you're a boy. Tomorrow,
          Mr. Penis comes knocking. Shakes your
          hand. Takes you for a walk... and tells
          you about life's simple pleasures. You're
          a man. And you don't look back..

          (BEAT)
          You see... things evolve. Nothing is
          wholly inert. A step in any direction...
          you're walking into pockets of evolution.
          That is living... taking those steps. And
          change. Can start by changing some
          principles.
          Blank best describes Aaron's face.

          

          

          

          

          43.

          AARON
          Principles?

          HANCOCK
          Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just
          about all you need to know: a man's got
          to do what a man's got to do.
          (beat; smokes)
          I look at your face, the shiners. You
          took a shove and you let it go clean. Not
          good. That's a formula for future
          abuse... an invitation to the loser's
          dance. Letting it go. Walking away.
          ,(shakes head)
          Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're
          running, looking for a place to hide.

          AARON
          What am I suppose to do?

          HANCOCK
          You do what is necessary.

          AARON
          I wanted... there were three of them.

          HANCOCK
          What is necessary.

          (HEAT)
          Let me tell you something, kid. There was
          this infantry unit, you see... badly
          outnumbered.
          (thinks about it)
          Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you
          relate, OK? There's a fox, you relate? A
          fox and he's walking through what, the
          woods, the forests, right? Next thing the
          fox knows, he's staring down a pack of...
          hounds. Bloodhounds. And there's this
          chase, the fox's running his ass off,
          over boulders and through streams and,
          but the damn hounds are still on his
          tail. Finally the fox comes to this
          cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a
          seven hundred foot drop onto jagged
          rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds
          are closing in and they're going to tear
          him to pieces. So what does he think...
          "I jump and I die for sure. I stay,
          confront them and I'll get my ass
          butchered." Decision time. He thinks,
          "stay and least I'd have something, a
          chance.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          To slip away, maybe." The fox decides to
          go down fighting, make a stand. Right?

          (BEAT)
          The hounds come. What do you think
          happens?

          AARON
          (thinking about it)
          He gets away.
          Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.

          HANCOCK
          No. The fox gets his ass kicked and
          some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs,
          like cheap fabric.

          AARON
          What're you saying?

          HANCOCK
          But you know, when the last hound was
          through with him,-and he's walking away,
          he hears this noise. It's the fox and
          he's muttering something under his
          breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets
          up close. To hear what he's saying. You
          know what the fox's saying... just before
          he keels off?
          Aaron - negative.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Now he's gurgling, choking on his own 
          blood, right? A massacre. The fox's lying
          next to his entrails, you know... and you
          know what he says?
          (raises his fist in the air)
          "No regrets."

          AARON
          What?

          HANCOCK
          No regrets. You make a decision and you
          stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And
          "no regrets."
          Aaron - submitting it to memory.

          AARON
          Why're you telling me all this?

          

          

          

          

          45.

          HANCOCK

          got to do.

          son. She looks at her watch. And up... up ahead, by steps
          apartment - Aaron, levitating in air.
          Hancock explains this defiance of gravity. He gently lowers
          Aaron on the sidewalk, before his mother.
          She beckons him. Like a shield, she envelops him with her arms.
          She stares up at Hancock - her eyes, stricken with fear. Or
          possibly, they were awestruck.

          Hancock nods, watching Mary as she retreats into the kitchen. He
          continues to stare - at Mrs. Longfellow, in frenetics, prepping
          for dinner.
          She catches him looking... looking surreal, this superman, there

          He turns and beholds: Hancock,' rising in full garb, arm

          (at his watch)
          I need to get ready.

          AARON
          mom?

          MARY
          (to Horus)
          What do I do with him... when you're
          gone? I have to entertain this super...
          She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the

          It comes from the bathroom - the sound of PISS, urine versus the
          surface tension.of water.
          LOUD. WET. A turgid firehose at full blast. The force of
          urination grips the room - as powerful as the penile mechanism
          from which it is generated.
          The toilet FLUSHES. Hancock returns to a'room of astonished
          faces - mouths agape.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Later,. by a few minutes.

          HANCOCK
          (lost; sombre)
          and you could see the flames, through
          the storm... I get there, the vessel's
          all over, spread across three miles of
          South Pacific. Bodies floating in the
          water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some
          routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns
          out, the only one alive was the captain,
          up against a buoy... crying 'cause he
          didn't go down with his men... and he's
          got to live with it.

          (BEAT)
          Sprayed his brain all over the dashboard
          in a parking lot a couple months after. A
          good man...

          . did what he had to do.
          A brief moment while the graphics sink in. No one talks. Aaron's
          smitten. Mary, a mixture of repulsion and fascination.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          In the kitchen, in the sink, stacks of plates indicate that
          dinner is through.
          Company has moved into the living room, with the exception of
          Horus. Aaron kneels besides Hancock. Mary, across from him.

          AARON
          (making a fist)
          I wanted to kill him.

          MARY
          Aaron.

          

          

          

          

          51.

          AARON
          I want to deck him, just once. So bad I
          tense up... like I can't even move.

          MARY
          (to Hancock)
          He comes home crying.

          AARON
          Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.

          HANCOCK

          (REACTS)
          No... there's no shame in it. The crying.
          It's relief...
          (to Mary)
          we're older and we don't remember
          when... we go, "God, when was the last
          time?" Maybe it's me. It's more an
          effort, now. Takes more pain... more
          blood. Like it's, do you have the time
          anymore? Even to look back and recall a
          moving experience. To be moved.

          (AARON)
          By rage. Hurt.

          (MARY)
          By love.

          (BEAT)
          But if you have to remember the last time
          something touched you... you've missed it
          - you've forgotten how to cry.
          Horus enters the room, Mr. Security Guard. He observes this
          magic Hancock works over his wife and kid - a talent whose
          nature he has yet to comprehend.
          Horus opts to not disturb their trance. He makes for the door.
          Hancock - holds him accountable.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (AWARE)
          Mr. Longfellow. I'll be leaving, too.

          HORUS
          Oh, I... you don't have to leave. I don't
          want to interfere. I have work.

          MARY
          (the original sin)
          Oh, I forgot to make coffee.
          She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.

          

          

          

          

          52.

          HORUS
          It's all right, Mary. I'm late.

          MARY
          No, I'll make it right now.

          HORUS
          I don't have time. I'll grab some on the
          way. Thanks.
          Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          I don't want to interrupt. Please don't
          let me stop you.

          HANCOCK
          No, I need to go.
          (at' Mary and only Mary)
          The last time I had a meal... an evening
          like this, I was... it was too long ago.
          I appreciate your kindness.

          MARY

          (AWKWARD)
          Please... you're welcome, here. Anytime.
          Horus watches everything - watching her chest heave under
          Hancock's every word, watching his wife slip away.

          HANCOCK
          Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll
          drop by after school. See how you're
          doing.

          AARON

          (SMILES)
          Yeah.
          Horus watches this - his son slipping away.
          The two men leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first.
          Mary closes the door behind them. Leans against the door and
          EXHALES - a sign of relief, of despair, or, of a heart raging
          wild.
          We just .don't know.

          EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The two men appear from the entrance, shoulder to shoulder -
          sort of. They enter the street.

          HORUS

          (POINTING)
          I'm this way.
          Hancock points the opposite way.

          HANCOCK
          Need a lift?

          HORUS
          It's a short walk.
          Acknowledged.
          An awkward beat while they stare at each other...
          . until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk
          and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via flight.
          From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge
          into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face.

          squats on the bed, his brain going a mile a minute. He plops
          back against the bed. Brings his hand up to his face. Makes a

          From here, we can SEE her - entering from the hallway. She
          disrobes down to bare back...
          And from this darkness, the RED tip of a burning cigarette GLOWS

          (CONTINUING)
          You disapprove, I know.

          HORUS
          No.

          J

          

          

          

          

          62.

          ROHEIM
          Sure you do. You disapprove and yet you
          allow me to drink... to poison myself.
          Your friend. Without a word of caution.
          Not a word. Just take it... you take
          everything.

          HORUS
          No.

          ROHEIM
          You're afraid to offend. You don't want
          to be abrasive. Provocative.
          (beat; as'Horus squirms)
          So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it.
          Roheim takes another gulp.

          HORUS
          (pulling teeth)
          You shouldn't drink.

          ROHEIM
          My wife. She left a bad taste in my
          mouth. I drink to kill-the taste.
          Horus has no response to this.

          ROHEIM (CONT'D)

          (SMILES)
          You're a good man, Horus...

          (BEAT)
          And you're right. This stuff's no good.
          It's a coward's way out and I know it.
          He gives the bottle a guilty stare. Tosses the bottle into a
          nearby garbage can.

          ROHEIM (CONY' D)
          (sick of himself)
          What the hell. I can learn to love
          beverage.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Mary. Walking.
          Hancock. Following. From across the street. Mesmerized and in a
          world to himself.
          He crosses. the street, failing to look both ways... BAH! A UPS
          truck STRIKES the clueless superhero, sending him across air -
          towards Mary.

          

          

          

          

          63.
          200 lbs. of superflesh EXPLODES into a JEWELRY display window -
          just ahead of Mary's path. Glass showers the scene. People

          SCREAM.
          Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to
          mere tatters. He pulls a severed SLEEVE from the rubble. Looks
          at Mary, reposed before him.

          HANCOCK
          (nothing happened)
          How are you?
          In unison, they turn to the UPS vehicle - a .mangled heap of
          steel, STEAM billowing from its ruptured radiator.
          Hancock shrugs a smiles.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Mr. Longfellow rounds the corner and ambles home. He is tired
          and his face shows it.
          There to make it worse - Clyde. He's back, getting at the sports
          page on the front steps.
          A sudden burst of outrage consumes Horus. He approaches the
          steps with fire and...

          HORUS
          (burning...)
          Clyde. Can I talk to you for just a brief
          moment?

          CLYDE

          (YAWNING)
          Not now, Longfella. I'm all blocked up.
          Clyde heads inside - with the sports page.. He FARTS as he goes
          in.

          HORUS

          (EXTINGUISHED)
          Sure.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Along a street somewhere who cares - Hancock and Mary - in a
          cool stroll. Mary holds his trenchcoat, surveying the damage.

          MARY
          What were you doing in the street?
          (the trenchcoat)
          You ripped it pretty good.

          

          

          

          

          64.
          Hancock - he's lost.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          What're you:.. how old's this thing?

          HANCOCK
          didn't see it coming... left myself
          open.

          MARY
          It'll be all right.

          HANCOCK
          All right?

          MARY
          It's just the seams. I can sew it back.

          HANCOCK
          What?

          MARY
          (the trenchcoat)
          This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good
          care of it.

          HANCOCK
          You'll sew -it?

          MARY
          Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for
          you, all right?
          Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING}
          Are you okay?
          No reply. He stares at her - simply.

           CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - DAY.

          Mary stands alone on the sidewalk, looking up at heaven. Her
          eyes search the gray sky for signs of life.-
          There, overhead - a DOT. It grows in size, getting closer and
          arriving fast... and gradually, it shapes into Hancock.

          

          

          

          

          65.
          He swoops into view, straight downward. Pulls on the air brakes
          and eases into a soft landing - by Mary's side.
          He is wet from his flight and his hands, 'we notice, are cupped
          together tightly.

          MARY
          (like a little girl)
          Let's see.

          HANCOCK
          You have to be quick.

          MARY
          Come on, I want to see.

          HANCOCK
          If you blink, you'll miss it.
          Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white
          something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into
          moisture. It showers into his open hands.
          Mary reaches for it. Too late.

          MARY
          I saw it, right? A little cloud.
          She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains.
          And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain.
          Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand
          touches his.
          He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls
          her hand away.

          MARY (CONY' D)
          The water is dirty.

          HANCOCK

          MARY

          HANCOCK
          I'm sorry.

          MARY
          (into his eyes)
          It's not your fault.

          

          

          

          

          66.
          Hancock looks away.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You're tense.

          HANCOCK
          I've been tired, lately.

          MARY
          You should slow down. Rest.

          HANCOCK
          -So people tell me.

          MARY
          (heat; upon some thought)
          It must be hard.

          HANCOCK
          Hard?

          MARY
          To always do right... do good when all
          you want to do is rest.

          HANCOCK
          It's harder to not do anything. What am
          I? It's not for me. It's for... it is
          about people. Rest? When there is
          despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am
          relief. You know that instant, that split
          instant of time when you realize that the
          nightmare... the totality of fear
          itself... that it's all been a bad dream?
          That it's safe? That is relief. The
          infant in my arms... to the hysterical
          mother. When you can see her face, what's
          rest? It is self-indulgence.
          Mary - in some advance stage of "wow."

          MARY
          Where... who are you?

          HANCOCK
          It's not important who I am, Mary. Or
          what... where I'm from. It doesn't
          matter. I'm a man. I am every man.

          

          

          

          

          67.

          MARY
          (sizing up his words)
          You probably get a lot of practice
          explaining yourself, on account of who
          you are and what you do.

          HANCOCK
          Why... do you say that?

          MARY
          It's like, everything you say sounds...
          so perfect. Like you rehearse them so
          they'll be that way. I mean, not to say
          that it's insincere...

          (BEAT)
          I mean, maybe it's something about you
          but... it must be hard on you sometimes.
          Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to answer.

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (APOLOGETIC)
          But probably not... probably..

          HANCOCK
          Yes...
          (pulling teeth)
          sometimes.
          Mary allows the moment to sink in.

          MARY
          So, you never answered. Back there...
          what were you doing in the middle of the
          street?

          HANCOCK

          (THINKS)
          I was lost...

          (EXHALES)
          . but I think I'm ok, now.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Trash cans fly. Paper, swept up and sent aflutter. We've seen
          this before - Aaron, running for his life and the bullies in
          pell-mell pursuit.
          He cuts into an alley. Looses them momentarily. Finds a DUMPSTER
          to his liking.

          

          

          

          

          68.
          Erlick. Spengler. They zoom by and with great eagerness.
          Perceval strolls after them, too cool to sweat.
          From the dumpster, little Aaron watches them... looks
          relieved... until conscience kicks in. A moment to reflect, he
          takes.

          AARON

          (HANCOCK)
          " before long, you're running, looking
          for a place to hide."

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Erlick and Spengler - at a dead end. Their trail leads them to a
          metal FENCE, the alley continuing beyond it. No time wasted
          they scale it.
          Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other
          side. Spengler pulls himself over. Joins Erlick on the ground.

          PERCEVAL
          Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed
          my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their
          eyes are of disbelief.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          What's up?
          (checks his hair)
          What?
          Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering
          with clenched fists.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          (rolls up sleeves)
          I just combed my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler make for the fence, to join the fray.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Don't bother. He's mine.
          (to Aaron)
          No biting. I hate biting.

          SPENGLER
          Kick his ass, Percy.

          ERLICK

          (OVERLAPPING)
          Do him, Percy. He's your woman.

          

          

          

          

          69.

          PERCEVAL
          Let's go. Let's have it. While we're
          still kids.
          Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Dick wad, let's go. Come on, you impotent
          little gonad.

          (BEAT)
          Your mother chokes on big, hard, veiny,
          purple-headed shlongs the size of...
          All Aaron needs to hear. He charges - comatose.
          And the pummeling begins. Perceval dictates the assault, landing
          BLOWS to the face and body.
          Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag. He wafts at air,
          left and right...

          ERLICK
          He's yours.

          SPENGLER
          Save some for us.
          Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine.
          Perceval looms over him, silhouetted against the sky.
          He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing. A look of
          recognition in Aaron's eyes - it's going to rain soon.
          He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick
          into Perceval's peeing apparatus. A faint SQUEAL eructs from the
          fellow's mouth. He drops like a wet tea bag.
          Erlick. Spengler. Shock. Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet,
          ready to book... but he doesn't. He stays.

          ERLICK
          What's he doing?

          SPENGLER
          Kick his ass, Percy.
          Aaron stares at them, behind the fence. Then down at Perceval
          fetal position, mouth agape. Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP,
          revenge presents itself.

          ERLICK
          That's cold.

          

          

          

          

          ?0.

          SPENGLER
          Kill him, Percy.
          Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral
          orifice. Contemplates his target.
          Aaron - to pee or not to pee...
          ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.

          AARON
          (to the boys)
          Don't mess with me.
          He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline
          taking him away.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sleeps. Mary enters from the hallway, hush-hush. She moves
          to the closet. Changes out of her clothes.
          Not a stir from Horus - exercising stealth in his efforts to
          watch her, watching her sweater fall to the carpet.
          Mary stands before the closet mirror. Does a profile check. She
          reaches for her bra... and from the mirror, catches Horus
          staring,.

          MARY
          You're still up?
          She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.

          HORUS
          Just get in?
          Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic
          attire. She nods affirmatively.

          MARY
          Nick's market. Are you sick?

          HORUS
          I can't sleep.
          She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms
          her own with the left, as reference.
          Horus tilts his head away from her hand.

          

          

          

          

          71.

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          Please, Mary.

          MARY
          You want some milk? I'll heat it up for
          you, how about that?

          HORUS
          No thank you.

          (BEAT)
          Aaron, today? This Hancock 's picking up

          MARY
          Yes, he is.
          He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues
          dressing - oblivious.

          HORUS
          He'll take him home?

          MARY
          Yes.

          HORUS
          What do we know about this man? The
          papers... they don't have all the facts
          about him.

          MARY
          What facts? He's not a hero.

          HORUS
          Yes. A hero. I know that...

          MARY
          Aaron likes him.

          HORUS

          (TIMID)
          I know that maybe, I've been
          neglectful... that I haven't been
          there...
          Mary does not hear him. She's at the mirror, fixing her hair.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (SERIOUSLY)
          I'm trying... you have to know... I'd
          like to be more... involved. Like it used
          to be. Before we moved here.

          Are you going somewhere?

          MARY
          No. I have to start on dinner. So how
          about that glass of milk?
          Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          All right. Try to get some sleep.
          With that, she's out the door.
          Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his
          wretched face.
          He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside
          - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean?
          Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the
          cover.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Aaron races down the. last leg of his street. On the steps of his
          apartment building - Hancock, making himself at home. Yes, a
          cigarette smolders from his lips..
          Hancock looks at the boy. They share a second of silence.
          And finally, Hancock-puts out his hand - he approves. Aaron,
          triumphant, SMACKS it for five.

          CUT TO:

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          .o his mouth was. open and he just stared
          up at me, it hurt that bad.
          And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair -
          a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned.

          AARON (CONTD.)

          (CONTINUING)
          I said, "don't mess with me." Just like
          that.

          73.

          AARON (CONT'D)
          "Don't mess with me." Mom, remember that
          guy in the cop movie... he said that?

          MARY
          All right, already. How's your mouth?

          AARON
          It doesn't hurt, I told you.

          (CONTINUING)
          He saw everything from the roof. Said I
          did what I had to do.

          HORUS

          (FINALLY)
          Aaron, tomorrow...

          AARON
          (to Mary; oblivious)
          He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up
          again...

          HORUS
          I thought maybe you'd like it -- if I
          pick you.

          AARON
          God, my friends will freak.
          Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Through the dim of light - Horus, alone, prepares for work.
          A framed PHOTOGRAPH of a distinguished MAN (50's) sits on the
          shelf inside the closet - he poses in full police regalia, stern
          and proud.
          Horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph. He closes the closet
          door.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          On the kitchen floor and under the light - Mary and Aaron,
          mother giving son a HAIRCUT.

          MARY
          Hold still.

          AARON
          I like it long.

          MARY
          Shut up.

          

          

          

          

          74.
          Horus walks into the living room,. in the dark. He looks at his
          wife, then at his son - doing their own thing. They don't
          realize he's there.
          Horus leaves, the door'CLICKS shut behind him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Horus?

          AARON
          it's almost eight. Dad's late.

          MARY
          Horus?
          She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the
          bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into
          the stairway outside.
          There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way
          up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          In the kitchen and under the light, Mary. Hancock. Aaron. Mary
          is finishing up on Aaron, applying the last SNIP.

          AARON
          like this?
          (holds up hand)
          How do you make a fist?

          MARY
          (grabs his head)
          Aaron, hold it.
          Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes.
          So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and
          bones. It SNARLS at Aaron.
          Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't
          let go of them.
          Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in
          him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Hancock?
          The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          MARY (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING
          ) turn. Hancock, it's yo ur

          HANCOCK
          What?

          MARY
          Your hair. Come on, have a seat.

          AARON
          Mom's going butcher your hair.

          MARY
          Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n
          homework.

          AARON
          Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her,
          Hancock.
          Hancock shrugs a "what can I do."

          AARON (CONT' D)
          Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I
          got to do.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The Big Haircut. Mary and Hancock - up close. Mary runs her
          fingers through his hair, testing his length. She leans into
          him. SNIP, goes her scissor.
          Hancock - in his seat, as hard as marble. He seems a bit lost in
          her presence. Baffled.
          From his position, the view consists of Mary - blossoming in her
          sweater.
          And that's it. Not a word during this process - just the SOUND
          of their breaths.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Hancock.
          Erected before us, the immediate product of a mediocre haircut -
          he looks plain and un-super. He looks... goofy.

          MARY
          There... my hero.
          He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.

          

          

          

          

          76.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          How do you like it?

          HANCOCK
          Nice. Thank you.
          Mary - peripatetic, putting away things...

          MARY
          I started out just trimming for Horus.
          Here and there. He had to look just right
          for the academy, says his father, a
          police captain there... in Philly. When
          we moved here, I pretty much took over as
          the resident barber. You know, to save
          some money.

          HANCOCK
          He was in the-police academy?
          A pause.

          MARY
          His father's idea. Not his. He went
          through it anyway, like he had something
          to prove... the validation of his
          manhood.

          (BEAT)
          It tpok everything out of him. He didn't
          talk for days after he was cut. He took
          it real hard. I mean, still, he's not...
          I mean,, he's still...
          (edits herself)
          .it was a difficult time for hi.. Me. I
          understand that I'm not intolerant of it,
          the working-through process. It's just
          that, sometimes...
          (at Hancock)
          sometimes, I need his strength. I
          miss. the strength.

          HANCOCK
          Is that what you want?

          MARY
          Want?

          HANCOCK
          What you need?

          MARY
          The hair... I need to...

          

          

          

          

          77.
          She kneels to sweep up hair. Hancock follows her down.

          HANCOCK
          Mary?

          MARY
          Yes?

          HANCOCK

          (BEAT)
          You ever been down the boardwalk, at
          night?

          MARY
          Why... what for?
          They're eye to eye. Close.

          AARON (O.S.)
          Mom?
          Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands
          in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower.

          MARY
          Yes.
          Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!

          AARON
          my mouth. It's starting to swell. I
          think he loosened a tooth.
          Mary - maternal duty calls.

          MARY
          All right. Go to your room. I'll get the
          ice pack.
          Aaron exits. Mary exits.
          Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for
          the front door.
          Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him...

          MARY (CONT' D)
          You're leaving?

          HANCOCK
          It's getting late.

          

          

          

          

          78.

          MARY
          I'm sorry.

          HANCOCK
          I'm going to take a walk.

          MARY
          Really? On the boardwalk?

          HANCOCK
          Maybe.
          Pause.

           AARON (O.S.)
          Mom.'

           MARY
          I'm sorry.
          She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he
          stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.

          HANCOCK

          (FINALLY)
          Good night, Mary.

          MARY
          Good night.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          The clock - 9:45 pm.
          The store rests in afterhour stillness. Horus paces by the side
          door, his ears pressed to the phone receiver - no answer.
          He hangs up. Checks his watch. Goes to the front entrance and
          peers out at the street - no Roheim.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          The bar. The smoke. The scums of humanity. Gina - over there,
          marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis.
          She mingles with a BAR FLY.
          Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat.
          From an adjacent stool, A MAN places his hand on Hancock's lap.
          Whispers to him.

          

          

          

          

          79.

          MAN
          I wear dresses. How about you?

          HANCOCK
          (considers; nah)
          Get lost.
          The warning comes across quite well - the man exits.
          Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the
          bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.

          GINA
          (to bar fly)
          Meet you outside. The El Camino, right?
          The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face
          in her hands, studies him.

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Your eyes are calm. It's good.
          She withdraws her hands.

          HANCOCK
          What?

          GINA
          But you're still here.
          She rises. And as she makes for the exit...

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Nice haircut.
          Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the
          rest of his cigarette - pensive.

          CUT TO:

           INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          The clock, it reads 1:05 am.
          Horns, his flashlight, they're making their rounds. His routine
          takes him outside - via an EXIT door.

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          A dark alley. Dumpsters. Boxes.
          Horus peruses the premises. Heads around the building and to the
          street.:.

          

          

          

          

          80.
          . as a ragged FIGURE collapses onto.him. It's Roheim and he's
          been drinking, right?

          HORUS
          Dear God.
          Horus catches him.

          INT. WATANABE'S - NIGHT

          They find a chair in the back, Horus Positioning Roheim in the
          light. The old man isn't drunk - his mouth agape, his face
          bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling.
          A chunk of lip dangles, bleeds.

          HORUS
          Jesus.
          Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to
          nurse' the wounds.

          ROHEIM
          Figured I can get you by the front... but
          you weren't there.

          HORUS
          (dabbing the torn lip)
          Who... what happened?

          ROHEIM
          They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and
          his boys. They were waiting on me.
          Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back.

          HORUS
          Why didn't you come through the back...
          standing out there in the dark?

          ROHEIM
          -Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped
          them'in the fight.
          (feels his lip)
          Shit...
          He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom.

          HORUS
          What're you doing?

          

          

          

          

          81.

          ROHEIM
          (into the mirror)
          the old man
          Look at what they did.. gave
          a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for
          shit.

          HORUS

          (FRUSTRATION)
          Sit down
          Could you knock it off, please.
          so I can clean the cuts.
          He leads the old wretch back to the chair.

          ROHEIM
          I'm a waste of time...

          HORUS
          Stop.

          ROHEIM
          I'm too old for this.

          HORUS
          You're not old.

          ROHEIM
          What am I... I'm biologically challenged.
          Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort.

          (BEAT)

          I
           Use to be, I blame the job. The job.
           think, bullshit job. Not right for a man.
           "To observe and record..." I say, what a t's for
           the hell is DIo nly
           dogs. They got a d o o gs in t g g hisn
           reason we're he d re, we don't shit on the
          carpet.
          Horus looks away. Doesn't want to hear it.

          ROHEIM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          But you know what, Horus. That's all
          wrong. It ain't the job. The job don't
          make the man. It's me. Not the uniform.
          It starts right here... 'cause I can't do
          anything right. Fuck up my ABC's.
          (a beat; at Horus)
          But you. Why do you put up with this
          crap? A wife. A kid. There... waiting for
          you at home.
          Horus - he just doesn't know anymore.

          

          

          

          

          82.

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          On the rooftop of this building - Hancock, on another end of a
          Marlboro. Eyes red. Hair in wet dishevelment. He's a mess.

          HANCOCK
          got to do what you got to do.
          He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other
          hand. We sense a decision brewing...

          INT. THE LONGFELLOW BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A desk clock points to 2:30 am.
          Mary - awake undercover. She twists, turns...
          A shadow engulfs the side of her wall, smothering the light in
          the room. Mary catches it. Rises above her blanket.
          What she sees - outside the window, Hancock hanging there in non-
          gravity. He stares directly at her.

          HANCOCK
          I know you're up, Mary. I know you can
          hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk
          tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's
          important that I talk to y ou, then.

          (GRAVELY)
          Please, Mary.
          And with that, he's off and away. Mary.- stunned.

          CUT TO:

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We're in the staircase - where Horus is, supporting Roheim up
          the stairs.

          ROHEIM
          They're going to can me.

          HORUS
          No one's canning anyone. No one saw us...
          watch your step... leave.

          ROHEIM
          Should be an extra key over the door.

          

          

          

          

          83.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          In the kitchen, Mary and Aaron - the morning routine. Something
          is off this morning, like someone threw a wrench into the
          machinery.
          Mary appears a bit frazzled, handing her son toasts. She rushes
          back to the stove - her eggs beckoning.

          AARON
          The toast's burnt.

          MARY
          What?
          Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.

          AARON
          We're late... you forgot the corn chips.
          Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all
          over the place.

          MARY
          Eat... and we'll go.
          (checks her watch)
          Where's your father?
          She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.

          AARON
          You forgot the corn...
          (the comb snags)
          . ouch!

          MARY
          I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll
          be home before we leave. I'm sorry.

          AARON
          You having your period, mom?
          She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK.

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We enter an anal-retentively neat and manicured living room.
          Horus ushers Roheim in...

          ROHEIM
          Shoes.
          The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom.

          

          

          

          

          84.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sets Roheim down on the bed. Tucks him under.

          HORUS
          You're going to be okay?

          ROHEIM
          I don't know. You might have solo act
          tomorrow night.

          HORUS
          Get some sleep.

          ROHEIM
          You're a good man, Horus.

          HORUS
          (washing over it)
          I have to get home, now. I'll call.
          Roheim grabs on to his sleeve.

          ROHEIM
          You know what Olga said before she walked
          out on me? Her last words to me. She
          turned at the front door. Looked around
          the room and she says, "keep it clean."
          That's it, can you believe it? Then out
          the door.

          (BEAT)
          But like a.shmuck,.I keep the place
          spotless... in case she walks through
          that door one day.
          (at Horus; with pain)
          I don't think she's coming back.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Horus struggles homeward - his mind in a headlock with anger,
          despair, a combination thereof.
          He moves down his street. Looks ahead - where Clyde stands,
          pillaging his morning paper. Clyde Spots Horus on the approach.
          Smiles at him, with impunity. Goes back in.
          On Horus - you can boil an egg in his seething mouth.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Fist clenched, the morning paper under his arm - Horus. steadies
          down the hallway. His eyes target the door at the end of the hall, seeing red.

          

          

          

          

          85.
          He gets there, the door. He swallows. Wipes sweat off his hand.
          KNOCK. And again, KNOCK.
          ï¿½ow
          He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed
          second. Until finally, Horus is a pile of dung.
          The door opens.
          And Clyde emerges, tall and ugly. He's holding up his pants with
          one and the SPORTS PAGE with the other.
          Caughtin mid-defecation, he is none too happy.

          CLYDE
          The box scores are waiting and I got an
          inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make
          it snappy.

          HORUS
          (loosing his voice)
          I'd like my sports page, please.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          I want you to stop taking my sports page.

          CLYDE
          All right.
          Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck.
          He stutter-steps... KNOCKS...

           CLYDE (CONT' D)

           (AGITATED)
           What's the matter, you deaf? I'll stop
           taking your sports page. Now get out of
          here and let me...

          HORUS

          (INTERRUPTS)
          I want today's sports page.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          That there... my sports page.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          CLYDE
          What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden?
          You don't even like football.
          Horus does.not budge.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You'll get it back... after I take my
          dump.
          Clyde proceeds to close the door... but Horus interjects, his
          foot in the door.

          HORUS
          No.

          CLYDE
          What?

          HORUS
          No. I would like my sports page now.
          Please.

          CLYDE
          After I finish.

          HORUS
          I'd prefer it now.

          CLYDE
          What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy?
          Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm
          a kamikaze move, indeed.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (SHOCKED)
          Give that back.
          Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a punch into Clyde's
          midsection. Harmless - it tickles him, maybe.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Clyde belts up has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the
          massacre commences.
          He simply tears into Horus... SLOWS to the stomach... RIGHTS
          across the face. It ends quickly and without resistance - as if
          Horns accepted it as fate.

          

          

          

          

          87.
          Clyde 'kneels over. Picks up the sports page. And as if yawning,
          returns to his room.

          KAW/

          CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          By the fence - Mary and Aaron.
          Mary, with a brown paper BAG, seems.distant, preoccupied in a
          far away place.

          AARON
          Are you all right, mom?

          MARY

          (DISTRACTED)
          Yeah... why?

          AARON
          You're acting weird.

          MARY
          (didn't hear)
          What?

          AARON
          I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think
          it's time for your nap.
          Aaron leaves.
          Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door swings open to admit Horus - battered, enraged,
          disoriented. He confronts an empty apartment.

          HORUS
          Mary!
          A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the
          apartment.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          The ocean RAGES against the shore, in the distance and at some
          muffled volume.
          Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a
          cigarette. His hair drips of salt water - he's been here a
          while, one would suspect.

          

          

          

          

          88.

          COP (O.S.)
          Come back here! Stop him!
          In the background, a COP commences pursuit on a THIEF.
          The thief dashes by - pass an indifferent Hancock. The cop
          follows suit, passing by.

          COP (CONT'D)
          Stop him!
           Hancock - his gaze wavers not from the distant waters.

          EXT..STREET - DAY

           Horus stumbles. Keeps his balance. Trudges down the street to a
          corner BAR.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          The bar is empty at this hour. The chairs are up, the floor
          swept. A husky BARTENDER unloads liquor in the back.
          Horus enters. Finds a stool.

          HORUS
          Drink.
          The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Is this a bar... or what? Drink.
          (uncomfortable with his own

          RUDENESS)
          Please.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          Mary stands there on the boardwalk, the bag in her arms.
          It's cold this morning. A little wind has picked up. And the
          clouds - they're alive, restless.
          She finds Hancock, staring at her, waiting for. her.

          HANCOCK
          Hi.

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Thank you for being here.

          MARY
          Is everything all right?

          

          

          

          

          89.
          Hancock has no response.

          U

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (CONCERNED)
          What's wrong?

          HANCOCK
          (constipated; following some

          THOUGHT)
          It's cold.
          Mary and Hancock - we notice, they look good together.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          (at the clouds)
          They're moving. The turbulence has
          started.

          MARY
          Tell me what's wrong.
          He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into
          darkness.

          HANCOCK
          Look out there and what do you see, Mary?

          MARY

          (PERPLEXED)
          Nothing. I don't know... I don't see
          anything.

          HANCOCK
          see it,can
           It's out there. But you can't
          Y nu?
          (beat; holding on to a thread)
          And that's good, not seeing. But for me,
          I've seen it. It's where I'm from... out
          there.

          MARY
          Please, Hancock. What are you talking
          about? What's out there?

          HANCOCK
          Duty.
          (beat; at Mary)
          You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you.
          He'll say: "you do what you have to do."
          Or what? You let the next guy do it for
          you, if you don't... if you can't.
          (losing it)
          And... but. If I can't, then who?

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          90.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          The next guy? No. There is no "I can't."
          Just "I must."
          Mary - watching a grown superman unravel.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          But I don't ask, "why me?" I don't
          question it. This is me. I'm it. I do
          what I have to do. I get in there.., all
          the killing... the blood... and I deal
          with it. I clean up. I make things right.

          (BEAT)
          And. But when.., where does it end?
          (re: his cape)
          Can't stop the hemorrhage... it's
          everywhere. And it stays. All that I can
          do, Mary. The things I am capable of
          doing, I can't blink away the hell I've
          seen. It's in me...
          (points to his head)
          in here and I can't not think about
          it. It's in me. It's me.

          MARY
          Hancock... what...

          HANCOCK
          I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll
          break. I need to get away. Get away to
          where? I don't know.
          (at Mary)
          I need your help.

          MARY
          Me? What can I do?
          (she's helpless)
          What do you want me to do?

          HANCOCK
          I want you to save me.

          MARY
          How?
          Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her.
          Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing
          her senses, pulls away.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Don ' t.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          HANCOCK

          (DESPERATE)
          Save me.

          MARY
          I can't.

          HANCOCK
          You can.
          (the hard sell)

          AND
          Mary,-I'll take you away. And Aaron.
          what... I'll quit. Get a real job. An
          apartment. I'll flip burgers. I don't
          know what I'm doing... what I'm saying
          anymore.

          MARY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          I'm married.
          A pause.

          HANCOCK
          To whom?

          MARY
          I love him.
          The death blow.

          HANCOCK
          No.
          (turns from her)
          Unacceptable.

          MARY
          I love him. I'm sorry.
          One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this
          superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel.
          Mary wants to console... but what can she do?

          HANCOCK
          I'm cold.
          Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat.

          MARY
          I'm sorry.

          

          

          

          

          92.
          She leaves.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          Aaron. The school hallway. He holds a wooden hall PASS,
          indicating that class is in session.
          He swings into the BOYS ROOM.

          INT. BOYS ROOM - DAY

          A large restroom - empty. Little Aaron passes up on the urinals.
          Selects a private STALL. ZIP - urination begins.
          Splash segues into drip. DRIP. Aaron shakes off the last drop...

          PLOP.
          And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles
          surface from below, shackling Aaron in his spot. He can't see
          but, from behind, the stall door opens...
          Guess who?
          Perceval - possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron's head.
          Introduces it to the yellowed waters below.
          SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron sees for the
          next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of.bubbles, the
          shine.-of white porcelain at.intimate range.
          What he hears: the GASPING of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked
          laughter.
          The ambush ends. Perceval. Erlick. Spengler. One of them says...

          THEM

          (MOCKINGLY)
          "Don't mess with me."
          They leave - laughing.

          THEM (CONT'D)
          (in the distant)
          Little shit.
          Left there and in the stall - Aaron, slumped against the bowl.
          On the tile floor. A wet rag of piss.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Mary hurries into the room - flustered, adrenaline coursing
          wild.
          She runs down the hallway to her bedroom, seeking solace in
          Horns. The cold, empty bed says he hasn't been home.

          MARY
          Horus...

          CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The school front. KIDS swarm into the streets, freshly released
          from captivity. And there amidst bedlam - Aaron, roughed-up and
          soiled in disgrace.
          He moves to the curb, waiting for someone to take him away. No
          Hancock, anywhere.
          Aaron waits, hopeful.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Hancock walks an aimless walk - in oblivion, a WHISKEY BOTTLE in
          his hand. He's been drinking. L"i
          in his path and up ahead, a little girl SUE (8) beckons at the
          upper branches of a tree.

          SUE
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Hymie. Come down, Hymie.
          She catches Hancock, Mr..Superhero who can fly, stumbling by.

          SUE (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Mister? My Hymie won't come down from the
          tree.
          Hancock's reaction - "what?"

          SUE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          My pussycat. She won't come down.
          She stares up at him with big, blue, sad, helpless, innocent
          eyes.

          

          

          

          

          94.
          So cool, Hancock reaches down for a PEBBLE - takes it in his
          palm. Finds the little pussy named Hymie. And with a simple
          flick of the wrist... shoots it down.
          A sharp MEOW. punctuates the task. Hymie drops from the branch,
          limp and lifeless. A THUD we hear on impact.

          SUE (CONT'D)
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Holy fuck.
          Hancock resumes his course, taking off and into the wet sky.

          EXT. SKY - DAY

          Hancock's drunken flight - erratic and dangerously close to...
          BAM... buildings. He strikes the corner of a brick tower,
          plummeting downward with the dislocated debris.
          He bounces off the concrete -.in an alley.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Mary is on the sofa - wondering where Horus might be. She checks
          h er watch.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The place is empty. Deserted.
          Aaron. On the curb. Some trash flutters by his feet. On his face
          - the abandonment of all hope. Nobody's coming, this is clear.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Hancock - on his back and amidst the rubble.
          He braces the building to get up. Drops. Gets to his feet, only
          to be confronted by the police officer from the boardwalk.
          We'll call this one officer REED - a beat cop with something
          stiff up his ass.

          REED
          What do we have here? A piece of shit.
          A slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that
          superguy.
          Hancock stares at him.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          HANCOCK

          (HUMORLESS)
          Fuck off.
          He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly.

          EXT. STREET - DAY


          A
          Aaron. Walking home. Dejected. His eyes catch a glimpse of
          particular pedestrian down the street - Hancock. He gives
          chase... and confronts him, out of breath.

          AARON
          (a slight smile)
          Hi.

          HANCOCK
          (turning; drunk)
          What're you doing here?

          AARON
          (the smile fades)
          I saw you walking. Where were you today?
          You said you'd... be there.
          Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.

          HANCOCK
          I don't know what you're talking about.

          AARON
          Where are you going? Can I go?

          HANCOCK
          You don't want to go where I'm going.

          AARON
          Those assholes got me in the bathroom,
          today...
          (trying to hold on)
          and you said you'd pick me up at
          school.
          Hancock turns. He's upset now.

          HANCOCK
          Listen.
          Aaron recoils.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Listen. I'm not here to save you.

          96.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          No, not my job. Don't put that on me.
          (pounds his chest)
          Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal
          with it, kid. You are what you are and...
          what I say, it won't do you any change.
          You'll grow up to be just like-your old
          man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can
          do about it... 'cept grab both ankles,
          hope by the grace of God the reaming's
          gentle.
          Aaron backs away from his angry wrath.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          That's right. Walk away. Me... I'm not
          here to save you.
          He watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed
          against the rocks.
          In Hancock's eyes - a .glint of regret. But only a glint.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          This empty bar.
          With the exception of Horus and the bartender - while he's
          drying some mugs, let's call him JOEY (30).

          HORUS

          (BOOZED)
          One.more.
          Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill it...

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          No... nevermind.
          (going to blow)
          Where's your bathroom?

          JOEY
          (not in my place)
          Bathroom's closed.
          Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit.

          HORUS
          How much.

           JOEY

          (SARCASM)
          Let's see... that's one beer. Tell you
          what. I'll take care of this one.

          

          

          

          

          97.

          HORUS
          Thank you.

          JOEY
          The register ain't open yet, anyhow.
          Horus doesn't hear him. He's already on the move, making a dash
          for the door. But too late - he VOMITS at the front entrance.

          JOEY (CONT'D)
          Shit.

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          In the armpit of town - Hancock. He lights a cigarette with the
          matchbook Gina had given him earlier.
          At attention before him - Gina, gnawing on gum, heaving in all
          her glory.

          GINA
          I've been waiting.
          They stare for one horny beat.
          Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking
          for solace. She takes him in, very maternal this Gina.

          \./

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The front door opens, but slowly. Aaron steps inside.
          From the kitchen, Mary spots him in his violated condition. He
          sees her reaction, that of shock - and like that, he runs
          s obbing into her arms.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          A phone booth - Gina's office.
          There in the back alley and in this glass booth - Hancock and
          Gina, their organs ensnared. They're pumping away. Up. Down.
          A surreal sight, indeed - the red of his cape and the black of
          her leather.

          GINA
          Come on, baby. Relax.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          

          

          

          

          98.

          GINA
          You can.
          The phone begins to RING - but they're busy.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          GINA
          Let it go, baby. Just let it...

          RING...

          HANCOCK
          (in tears)
          I can't.
          His arm rips through the glass...

          GINA
          . go.

          (ORGASMS)
          Oh god.

          HANCOCK
          I can't!

          RING...
          He DRILLS a hole into the phone - killing it.'

          GINA
          Don't give up, now.
          He lets her down. Tears out of the booth. Finds the sky.

          EXT. SHEEPSHEAD BAY - NIGHT

          There is movement in the sky above - aggressive formations and
          grooves in clouds once coy and demure. The wind HUMS its
          presence, toys with fallen leaves.

          'INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          It's dinner - but all is not well. Mary and Aaron and an empty
          chair. '
          They sit without talking.. They eat without making a sound.
          Between them - a ketchup bottle.
          The door bursts wide, coughing up Horus. He locates his chair
          and plops on it... misses... kisses the carpet.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          HORUS
          (on the ground; prone)
          Son. Go to your room.
          Struggles to his knees.

          MARY
          What happened toyou?

          AARON
          Dad, are you wasted?

          MARY
          Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to
          your room.

          AARON
          He is wasted.
          Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa.
          When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away.

          HORUS
          Aaron. Go to your room.

          AARON
          But dad...

          MARY

          (AUTHORITY)
          Go!
          Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          What do you think you're doing, Horus
          Longfellow?
          Horus gauges her.

          HORUS
          Don't "Horus Longfellow" me, Mary. I'm
          not your child. I'm your husband.

          MARY
          Horus, what're you talking about?
          (re: bruises)
          Who did this to your face?
          Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          HORUS

          (OBLIVIOUS)
          But you didn't know-about me...
          Mary knows where this is headed.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You didn't know I was going to do this to
          you.
          (a half-chuckle)
          I guess I should've known. We were
          married and I knew... at the reception. I
          couldn't dance. so I sat in the back and
          watched. You were with Stuart Olmsted and
          I watched you dance. In your white dress.
          And I remember zoning out... for a
          second, just watching you. God, Mary...
          the little girl next door who used to get
          into fist fights with her brothers in
          those patched-up Toughskins. We met only
          'cause the tallest tree in the
          neighborhood was in my backyard and you
          needed to climb it.

          (BEAT)
          But that night. God, you looked so
          beautiful I.had to realize it... how much
          I loved you... one more time.

          (BEAT)
          You and Stuart danced. Laughed. And I
          remember I'm watching you there, with
          him... together like that. You looked
          good with him, I thought all of a sudden.
          Like you belong... better. And as I
          stared across the floor, it was the same
          story with all the guys there, that they
          were more right for you.

          (SWALLOWS)
          More right because that night, you walked
          in with the wrong man.

          MARY
          Why do you say that?

          HORUS
          Because I let you down.

          (BEAT)
          I'm a coward. I can't do anything about
          it. Look at me, I'm breaking up in front
          of you. And God, I fear the day when I'd
          have to defend you and Aaron. What do I
          do, then? What am I if I can't do that...
          my own wife, family? Not a man.

          

          

          

          

          101.

          MARY

          You're a fool, that's what you
          you think I was completely blind when I
          married you? Something cuts at your
          masculine ego and it's the pressure...
          the standard's unreasonable. The woman,
          she wants me to part oceans. That's the
          kind of bull shit's made of. I went w
          through it...,I was there when the hurt
          came, when the academy said no. I
          there. And when you felt like hiding...
          from me and your ownforward. taking

           the closet,
          Horus stands there - tears, almost. He takes to his security
          retrieving his U-Rent Security Jacket. He grabs
          hat. Straightens his hair. Puts it on.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          Horns, what are you doing?
          Inserts the flashlight into his holster.

          HORUS
          All that I can do.
           the frontdoor.
          And with that, stumbles out of

          MARY
          Horus!

          INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           A dark room somewhere. Close on the top of aBdr dresser - a framed The e

          The picture of Ted "the police captain" Brock succumbs to the

          Casualties come in the form of CRIES, women and children on the v erge of incineration.
          Hancock's POV: a burning hallway, flames spewing from every
          crevice - we're walking through Hell.
          We see a BOY, huddled under a table. Hancock wraps his cape
          around him. Bolts through the inferno... as glass SHATTERS...
          and gas pipes ERUPT.
          He takes the boy to safety. Unwraps the cape... only to see the
          CHARRED remains of a human BODY...
          the-CRIES, they continue...

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The room is dark, of course. A BED - as the SQUEAKING of springs
          suddenly stops.
          A woman's VOICE says...

          VOICE
          What's the matter?

          HAN000K
          I need a cigarette.

          HANCOCK

          I need a cigarette, goddamn it!
          He storms from the bed. Heads for the bathroom.

          VOICE
          I don't smoke. What's wrong with you?
          She rises after him and into view - it's no other than the TV
          reporter, in the flesh. She bounces over to the bathroom, as the
          door SLAMS shut.

          REPORTER
          What're you doing?

          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Hancock stares into the mirror - a face in the latter stages of
          deterioration.
          And in disgust, he swipes EVERYTHING off the sink.

          REPORTER (O.S.)
          What're you doing, in there! I'm calli ng
          the police.
          Hancock drops his pants.
          Straight-arms the wall with his left. And with his right,
          latches on to his magnanimous member.
          Outside and beyond the door, the reporter has her ear pressed
          against wood - listening.
          So there our superhero stands, bent over a bit, yanking up a
          storm. His body convulses under said stimulation. He GROWLS...
          Cue for the reporter to back away.

          REPORTER (CONT'D)
          Jesus...
          Hancock stiffens, in full throttle. Full. Throttle...
          up and into a fevered pitch... and BOOM, we hear a He GROWLS... P
          baby explosion. The reporter leaps back.
          Beat.
          The bathroom door flies open. Hancock emerges, buttoning his
          pants. He brushes pass her. Finds the window... and he's off
          with a gush of wind.

          He turns a corner... a dark FIGURE jumps him.,, knocks him
          against the wall... GUN pointed.
          it is the Hoodlum - from before..,

          HOODLUM
          Scream and I blow...
          (not you again!)
          oh shit.
          Hancock in a foul mood. He brushes the Hoodlum away, sending
          flesh and bone against the opposite wall. SNAP goes the landing.
          The Hoodlum. Dead.
          Hancock - realization. He hastens to the body... limp... broken.

          HANCOCK
          No... don't. No.

          (LOUDER)
          No!

          Signal acknowledged. The Rifleman loads his piece...

          Fuck the woman, this is Armageddon. I

          INT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILE - NIGHT

          Bullets EXPLODE against walls... bricks... Mary SCREAMS, ducking
          to the floor.
          Hancock REACTS, the chaos throbbing inside his head. And like
          that something snaps.
          He BURSTS out of the building - eyes lit with the Hell inside.
          He lands on the wet surface below. ROARS before the police force
          - possessed.

          HANCOCK
          Go away! Go. Away.
          The authorities - they pause, startled. They open FIRE. Cops.
          S.W.A.T. teams. Their cousins.
          Bullets ZIP through the air and with dead accuracy. Hundreds of
          shells strike Hancock - the target. They PING off his armor of
          superFLESH.
          He stares at them all, invincible.

          EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Through this downpour hobbles Horus - pass police CARS
          SCREECHING by, en route to Killybegs. A police car sits in front
          of his apartment, lights blaring.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Horus storms into the room... in time to greet a police OFFICER,
          trying to pry Aaron from the bathroom sink.

          AARON
          Let me go you bastard.

          

          

          

          

          118.

          OFFICER
          Let go, you little asabite.
          Aaron spots Horus in the hallway...

          AARON
          Dad!
          He breaks loose - running into his father's arms, crying.

          AARON (CONT' D)
          I'm sorry dad. I didn't know what to
          do...

          OFFICER
          Mr. Longfellow...

          AARON.
          He's got mom, dad. He came and took her
          away. What do we do, now?
          Horus - he hasn't a clue.
          On the TV - a graphic depiction of war at Killybegs.

          OFFICER
          There's not much you can do. We've got
          every man out there, already. I suggest
          you take your son some place safe. Let us
          do our jobs.

          HORUS
          (on the TV)
          Mary...

          AARON
          I'm sorry, dad. I'm sorry.

          OFFICER
          (dreading it)
          I have to go... they need me.
          He exits.
          Roheim enters, out of breath. He notices the nasty, gaping hole
          in the kitchen.

          HORUS
          He's got Mary, Roheim.
          (blank; uncertain)
          I got to get her.

          What do you mean, you got to get her?

          HORUS
          I got to do what I got to do.
          Aaron stares up at his father - "did he just say that?"

          AARON
          Damn right, dad. We got to get her.
          Horus at the screen - oblivious. "What can I do?"

          ROHEIM
          Brain damage runs in this family or
          something?
          Aaron senses his father's state of overwhelmness.

          AARON
          Dad. You ever hear about the fox and the
          bloodhounds?

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          A HELICOPTER (Chopper Three) has since joined the picture of
          CHAOS. A strobe light cuts through the darkness and rain, zeroed
          in on Hancock.
          A machine GUN mounted inside opens FIRE - a wave of bullets
          ricochet off the superhero with no effect.
          Cops and S.W.A.T. teams continue their assault - it's the only
          thing they can do, and it's worthless.
          And on that note, Hancock retaliates - with a vengeance.
          First to go is the helicopter. He slices through the air and
          RIPS the vehicle in half.
          An EXPLOSION punctuates its demise - sending the spinning
          PROPELLER into wild trajectory. It crashes into a cluster of
          Cops - heads are severed, sent flying.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Horus sprints through the downpour, following the SOUNDS of
          destruction. At the scene, he arrives in time to witness the
          dismantling of future law enforcement.

          

          

          

          

          120.

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          Hancock swoops down toward a patrol car. Scares the Cops away.
          Hoists the vehicle over. his head. Throws it at a band of Cops.
          He ROARS...

          HANCOCK
          Go away!

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Aaron and Roheim arrive, finding their places behind Horus. They
          startle him.

          HORUS
          Jesus, Aaron. I don't want you to be
          here.

          ROHEIM
          (at the mayhem)
          I need a drink.
          Aaron, staring at the massacre - a HEAD rolls pass him.
          It looks pale but well-fed, healthy. It Ted's.
          Aaron ducks into his father's chest.

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          In the blink of an eye, the police department is no more. The
          entire block - a panorama of bedlam, overturned vehicles, and
          mangled bodies.
          Satisfied - Hancock returns inside the building.
          From the street, we can SEE Horus - fumbling through the rubble,
          heading towards the confrontation. He'passes a mutilated body -
          belonging to Adams.
          A revolver dangles from his fingers. Horus reaches for the gun
          and stops. He looks around at the vast destruction and realizes
          that no revolver will do. He continues forth.

          INT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          Mary is on the floor, wrapped in cape.
          Hancock returns. He's pumped, deranged, and he's lost that
          loving feeling.

          MARY
          What have you dome?

          HANCOCK
          I made them go away.

          HORUS (O.S.)
          Mary!
          Mary responds to her name like a body to sugar.

          MARY

          (HORROR)
          Horus!

          HANCOCK

           MARY
          Horus!

           HANCOCK
          Why?!

          MARY
          Please, Hancock. Don't hurt him.
          (grabs him)
          It'll never go away.
          Hancock responds to "it."

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          If you've got anything left... inside...
          (hand over heart)
          and you do, I know you do... whatever
          it was that you felt for me... inside...
          then you won't go out there.
          He just looks at her.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Just let go... and it'll go away. Please,
          just let go.

          HANCOCK

          (DESPAIR)
          I can't.

          

          122.

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          Horns stands there in the rain - a feeble frame of a man. He
          wants a fight.
          And he gets it... as Hancock, once again, emerges from the
          building - fire in his eyes.

          HANCOCK
          You ready to rock it up?
          Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock
          follows, toying with the man.
          Horus disappears inside.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D)
          Come out, you little shit.
          A pause in action - no reply from Horus.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Are you a man?!
          Horus answers...
          He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER.
          He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock. It's a hit and it BLOWS
          Hancock against Killybegs Textile. It lodges him inside the
          brick structure.

          HORUS
          Fuck you.
          Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He
          GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus.
          Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden
          EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall
          loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock.
          CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does
          not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt. Finds Horus down the
          street.
          Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He gets there, over Horus
          - grabbing him by the collar.
          With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying.
          THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall. He drops to the
          asphalt below. Horus - in pain, something broken possibly.

          

          123.
          He gets up. Tries to walk. Can't.
          Hancock - on the app roach, maintaining a cruel but steady pace
          towards his wounded game.
          Horns tries to crawl. Can't. Too much pain. He peddles back
          against the curb, nowhere left to go.
          Hancock arrives, looking afully steamed. He stands over Horus -
          not unlike Scarpo much
          The situation presents itself - he reacts.
          A kick into Hancock's groin muscle - CHINK, sliikeyt a soundWofshrugs.
          bone off metal. Absolutely harmless. Horus
          else can he do?
          Hancock tears a YIELD street SIGN it backs Ready to strikeï¿½ es
          this piece of jagged metal.


          (CONT' D)

          (DEFIANT)
          No regrets.

          HANCOCK

          (COOL)
          No mercy.
          He takes aim...

          AARON (O.S.)

          NO!
          Mary SCREAMS in the background...
          Horns. Hancock. They turn to witness the de-physicalization of
          Killybegs Textile.
          they begin to crumble, weakened by the wear Bricks... beams...
          and tear of recent artillery.
          Mary braces herself as the floor beneath begins to give. It
          slips... she SCREAMS... and collapses, taking the rest of the
          building with it.
          A CRASH, followed by a cloud of billowing smoke.
          Mary is no more.

          HORUS

          MARY!
          Aaron. Roheim. In disbelief.

          AARON

          (BLANKLY)
          Mom...
          Horus, he struggles to his feet. Pushes past Hancock, limping
          over to the building that once was.

          HORUS

          MARY!
          Hancock - not a word. He stands in comatose silence, looking
          pale.
          Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics, trying to
          excavate his wife - one brick at a time.
          Roheim meets him there, in an effort to console.

          ROHEIM (O.S.)
          (you're wasting your time)
          Come on, Horus.
          Horus - lost in the pain. He won't listen.
          Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the excavation. He
          r olls up his sleeve and gets to work.
          Hancock drops the yield,sign. Turns to the battlefield in his
          midst... surveys the carnage...
          A loaded beat.
          Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation. He grimaces with defeat.
          Staggers off. SCREAMS, because what else can he do. Falls to his
          knees... by a fallen police GUN.

          He picks it up...
          points it at his head...

           FIRES the remaining rounds against his temple. Bullets carom
          off skull.
          Hancock discards the gun. Breaks into TEARS. Long SOBBING wet
          tears. He CRIES. He WEEPS. Into his cupped hands. Indeed, a
          surreal sight.
          Horus. Roheim. Engaged to the task, brick by brick. Horus works
          his way down... to a lifeless ARM, protruding from its tomb.
          He stops.

          1 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY. 1

          Winter. Silence on the forest floor. Snow falling. Then the
          sound of breathing. The soft footfall of a person running.
          HANNA, fourteen years old, long hair, eyes like blue ice,
          glides through the trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder. She
          is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes. She blends almost
          completely into the landscape of trees and snow.
          She stops dead. Her breath visible in the freezing air.
          Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey. A REINDEER nuzzling
          the snow, trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat. Its head
          pops up - danger. Too late. The sudden swoosh and the snap of
          an arrow piercing its skin.
          The deer flops to the ground with a thud. It whines, its feet
          dig at the earth. Its mouth gnaws at the icy air. Steam
          pouring from its nostrils.
          HANNA approaches, removes a fur glove. She bends to her
          knees.
          She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face.
          She runs her hand down along its neck, in towards the wound.

                         HANNA
          I just missed your heart.
          She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist
          holster.
          She fires two shots directly at CAMERA.

          CUT TO TITLE: HANNA

          2 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER. 2

          A knife enters the deer near its anus.

                         HANNA

                         (WHISPER)
          Remove the penis and scrotum, make
          a deep, circular cut around the
          rectum.
          HANNA pulls the knife up towards the brisket.

          HANNA (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPER)
          Cut from the rear to the brisket.
          She works calmly without expression.

          3 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 3

          The deer lies on it's side.
          HANNA breaths hard. She reaches deep into the body cavity
          and pulls out intestine, stomach, liver.
          She freezes, sensing danger.
          Her hand deep inside the animal. She listens. She looks out
          into the still forest. No sound.
          ERIK, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands
          behind her like a ghost.

                         ERIK
          You're dead. Right now. I've
          killed you.
          HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings
          her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open
          palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the
          snow.
          She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She
          dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her
          pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Use your hands!
          She goes for the gun again and again he stops her.
          He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and
          tossing it deep into the forest.
          HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground.
          She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap...
          ... but she can't.
          He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow.
          ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows
          a touch of frustration.
          He plods into the forest.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Drag it back yourself.
          HANNA drags herself to the deer's side. She stares at its
          dead face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

          4 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 4

          HANNA clears the kill site. Wipes the last dots of blood on
          to a stick. No sign she was ever there.

          5 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - EVENING 5

          HANNA drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled. She lifts
          her knees high and moves at a steady pace.
          Hidden among the trees, a little way off, ERIK is watching
          her.

          6 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - EVENING 6

          A log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the
          thick forest. HANNA is standing in the snow, stripping the
          deer with a knife. It's a tough job but she does it no fuss.

          7 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 7

          Almost everything ERIK and HANNA own they've made themselves
          using what can be found in the forest. What few possessions
          that have been brought in from the outside world are old and
          worn.
          HANNA is making a fire using a bow drill. The friction of the
          drill produces an ember which HANNA carefully transfers to
          some dried leaves.

          8 INT. LOG CABIN - LATER 8

          HANNA and ERIK sit either side of a small fire, still dressed
          in furs.
          HANNA swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew. ERIK takes a
          mouthful, watches HANNA not eating.

                         ERIK
          What's wrong? Are you hurt?
          She keeps swirling her spoon.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          You were half asleep.

                         HANNA
          I'll do better next time.

                         ERIK
          German.

          I'll do better next time.

                         ERIK
          Spanish.
          HANNA studies her food and slowly takes a spoonful.

          ERIK (CONT'D)

                         (INSISTENT)
          Spanish.

          (In Spanish w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Did you really want me to snap your
          neck?
          He looks at her - drops the quiz.

                         ERIK
          How much did you pull off the deer?

                         HANNA
          A hundred and twenty with scraps.

                         ERIK
          About 200 pounds in total?
          HANNA nods.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          That explains it.

                         HANNA
          What?

                         ERIK
          How you beat me. You're getting
          strong.
          HANNA almost blushes.
          ERIK stands to put his bowl away.

          ERIK (CONT'D)

                         SUBTITLES)

          5.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you didn't snap my neck.

          9 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 9

          HANNA is in bed under fur covers listening while ERIK reads
          to her from an old encyclopedia.

                         ERIK
          The Great Blue Whale is the largest
          animal to have ever existed. A blue
          whale's tongue weighs over two and
          a half tons and its mouth is large
          enough to hold 90 tons of food and
          water.

                         HANNA
          How much is that?

                         ERIK
          It's bigger than the cabin. Its
          heart weighs thirteen
          hundred pounds and a male has seven
          gallons of testicles.
          HANNA smirks.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          The Blue Whale's "music" can be
          heard for over 500 miles.
          He shuts the book.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Time for sleep.

                         HANNA
          Good night.
          He stands by her bed looking down at her.

                         ERIK
          Did you forget something?

                         HANNA
          No.
          ERIK takes HANNA'S gun out of his pocket and puts it on the
          table next to her bed.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Sorry.

                         ERIK
          Good night.
          He walks to the door. HANNA stops him with a question.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         HANNA
          What's music like?

                         ERIK
          It's difficult to explain.

                         HANNA
          Try.
          He opens the encyclopedia again, leafs through the pages and
          reads.

                         ERIK

                         (READING)
          âMusic. A combination of sounds
          with a view to beauty of form and
          expression of emotion'.

                         HANNA
          But how does it feel?
          Erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions.

                         ERIK
          Good. It feels good. It's, uh,
          nice.

                         HANNA
          Tell me properly. Can you play
          music?

                         ERIK
          Your mother could. She used to sing
          very well.

                         HANNA
          I'd like to hear it for myself.

                         ERIK
          You will soon enough.

                         HANNA
          How soon?
          Erik looks away from her questioning eyes.

                         ERIK
          When you're ready.

                         HANNA
          I'm ready. I'm ready already.
          They look at each other- he weighs it up.

                         ERIK
          Just go to sleep now. I'll see you
          in the morning.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          Hanna covers herself in an animal skin as ERIK pulls a wattle
          screen across her bed, strokes her hair gently for a moment
          and leaves the room.
          HANNA reaches under her bed and takes out an old battered
          photograph, taken 15 years ago, of a YOUNG WOMAN with eyes
          like hers - her MOTHER, JOANNA ZADEK.

          10 EXT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 10

          The morning sunlight slants through the forest.
          ERIK is walking through the trees. He stops, raises his
          pistol at a tree trunk some distance away and fires.
          The tree breaks apart.

          11 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - MORNING 11

          HANNA wakes with the sound of the GUNSHOT. She is still
          holding her mothers photgraph.
          HANNA pushes the photograph under her mattress and climbs out
          of bed.

          12 EXT. LOG CABIN. SHOOTING RANGE - MORNING 12

          Another GUNSHOT breaks a tree apart.
          Hanna fires. Another tree breaks apart. She rolls and
          fires.
          She rolls and fires. She reloads. And fires.
          ERIK watching.

          13 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 13

          HANNA attacks ERIK. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. He defends
          easily.

                         ERIK
          Again.
          They reset. She repeats the motion. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Again.
          Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. She's getting faster. Her strikes
          are solid.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

          14 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 14

          A medium size log nailed along two pillars of the cabin
          acts as a chin-up bar.
          Erik and Hanna do chin-ups. Both are fit. Neither will give
          up. ERIK observing HANNA's power. Both have the sense that
          he is judging her. HANNA's face fiercely determined.

          15 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 15

          ERIK and HANNA sit with their backs to a tree in the huge
          forest as they breathlessly recover from the exhaustion of
          the exercise. HANNA speaks fast, reciting.

                         HANNA
          I live in Leipzig. German city.
          Population 0.7 Million people. We
          live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I
          go to school at the Klaus Kohle
          Gymnasium and my best friends are
          Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I
          like literature and sport, in
          particular tennis and athletics. I
          have a dog called Trudi.

          16 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - DAY 16

          HANNA is running, racing ERIK. Fierce determination, almost
          anger in her eyes. They reach the river and dive in.

          17 EXT. RIVER - DAY. 17

          HANNA and ERIK are swimming hard against the current of the
          fast-flowing river, working at full pelt just to stay still.
          They swim and swim, their muscles busting, their lungs
          bursting.

                         ERIK
          Don't give up! Don't give up!
          HANNA's arms flails as she fights against the stream and she
          screams in pain. She is grabbed under by the undertow and is
          pulled downwards. For a second she is underwater and in
          darkness but ERIK's hand pulls her back up and she breaks the
          surface with a gasp of relief.

          18 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. RIVER BANK. 18

          On the bank, HANNA climbs out. ERIK approaches her but
          moodily, even angrily, she pushes him away.

                         HANNA
          I didn't need your help.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.
          Her face sullen, she walks away into the forest. He stares
          after her.

          19 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 19

          Outside, ERIK stands alone, thinking. An OWL swoops down to
          catch a mouse then flies back up into the tree tops.

          20 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT. 20

          HANNA is asleep.
          ERIK enters the room.
          ERIK approaches the bed, and solemnly takes out a pistol and
          aims it at HANNA. He is tense with expectation.
          Suddenly HANNA bursts from her covers, smashes the pistol
          from ERIK's hand and smashes him down on to the bed. She
          grabs the pistol and points it at his face. She is alert,
          eyes intense, face proud. She speaks quietly.

                         HANNA
          I'm ready now.

                         ERIK
          Maybe.
          ERIK relaxes. It's a false beat.
          He lunges again at her, really violently. He seems to be
          really trying to hurt her.
          But HANNA has reached under her mattress and there is a flint
          knife - in an instant it is at ERIK's neck. She pricks his
          neck slightly. It bleeds just slightly. Stillness and
          silence. HANNA breathless, angry.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          You didn't tell me you had a knife.

                         HANNA
          You told me to think for myself.
          Isn't that what you want?
          She is angry for the first time. ERIK does not answer. Just
          stares at her.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          I want to see things. I can't stay
          here forever.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          21 EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 21

          ERIK takes long lunging strides straight out from the cabin.
          He counts his paces.

                         ERIK
          One, two, three, four...

          22 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY 22

          ERIK and HANNA are racing through the forest.
          Over this we continue to hear ERIK counting his paces from
          the previous scene.

          ERIK (V.O.)
          ...five, six, seven, eight...

          23 EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 23


                         ERIK
          ...nine, ten.
          After 10 paces, ERIK makes a 90 degree turn and enters the
          tree line. The snow and mud crunch under his boots.
          We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups of
          HANNA training: climbing, fighting, chin-ups, shooting. All
          the while we continue to hear ERIK counting out his paces.
          After 40 paces, with the cabin light distant, ERIK falls to
          his knees. He unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the
          frozen earth.

          24 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - MORNING 24

          HANNA comes out of the cabin, rubbing her eyes and yawning,
          eating a hunk of cold meat.
          She looks up to see a snow fox staring at her from the tree
          line. She crouches and holds out what's left of her
          breakfast.
          The fox approaches gingerly, delicately.

                         HANNA
          Hello little foxy... foxy loxy...
          come on... come and share my
          breakfast.
          The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap,
          withdrawing a few feet to eat it. HANNA shuffles forward
          carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          As the fox eats it makes low grunting noises which HANNA
          expertly mimics - causing the fox to look up, puzzled - they
          seem to have a genuine connection - as if they've done this
          before.
          Suddenly the snow fox freezes, pricks up its ears, looks up,
          HANNA looks up too.
          An aeroplane is approaching overhead. The fox darts back into
          the undergrowth as the roar of the plane reverberates through
          the forest.
          HANNA jumps to her feet and with incredible speed and
          dexterity climbs to the very top of a near by tree. The plane
          roars over her head and disappears over the snowy wilderness,
          oblivious to HANNA'S tiny presence.
          It's only now that we see the full extent of HANNA'S
          isolation.

          25 INT. CABIN - MORNING. 25

          HANNA enters breathless with excitement. ERIK sits pensively
          with his back to the door.

                         HANNA
          Did you see it? Wasn't it
          beautiful, like thunder. I had to
          stick my fingers in my ears it was
          so loud. Did you hear it?
          She stops, sensing ERIK'S mood.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          What's wrong?
          Sitting in front of ERIK is a metal case, caked with frozen
          dirt. ERIK pops open the case. Inside a tangle of technology.
          HANNA looks at the case, mesmerized.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          What does it do?

                         ERIK
          It tells Marissa Wiegler where we
          are.
          He looks at her, a hint of a challenge.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          When you want to leave here all you
          have to do is flip that switch.
          She approaches the box and places a single finger on the
          small red switch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          But once it's done, there'll be no
          going back. She'll never give up
          until you're dead, or she is. You
          understand? I wont be there to hold
          your hand. So be sure. Be sure it's
          what you really want.

                         HANNA
          You're not scaring me.
          He looks at her disbelievingly.
          She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away
          from the switch.
          He softens towards her.

                         ERIK
          It's here. There's no rush. Take
          your time.
          HANNA turns her back on the box, but can't help taking
          another look at it over her shoulder.

          26 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT 26

          HANNA is under the covers again while ERIK reads more from
          the encyclopedia.

                         ERIK
          Laika, a mongrel dog from the
          streets of Moscow, was the first
          animal to orbit the Earth. She was
          launched into outer space on the
          third of November, 1957.
          Scientists believed humans would be
          unable to survive conditions of
          outer space, so flights by animals
          were viewed as an experimental
          precursor to human missions. Her
          rocket was not designed to be
          retrievable, and Laika had always
          been intended to die.

                         HANNA
          That's sad.
          ERIK awkwardly turns the page to change subject.

                         ERIK
          When a star collapses the supernova
          explosion is 10 billion times
          brighter than other stars.
          HANNA shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that
          might be.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          27 INT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 27

          ERIK straps the bow to his chest and grabs a quiver of bolts.

                         ERIK
          Will you hunt with me?
          Hanna is sweeping the ground.

                         HANNA
          If you want.

                         ERIK
          It's up to you.

                         HANNA
          Me?

                         ERIK
          Yes.
          HANNA eyes the box sitting open, it's waiting for her.

                         HANNA
          I'll stay.

                         ERIK
          Fine.
          ERIK leaves abruptly.
          HANNA continues to sweep the ground, her movements bring her
          closer to the metal box. She stops sweeping and looks at the
          box. She turns and walks out of the cabin.

          28 EXT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 28

          HANNA comes out of the cabin and sits down on a tree trunk.
          She sees the snow fox cub but says nothing. It comes over and
          noses around the cabin, but HANNA'S mind is elsewhere.

                         HANNA
          (whispering to herself)
          Marissa Wiegler.

          29 INT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 29

          CLOSE ON - the metal box, the switch catches the light from
          the door as HANNA enters to confront it. The room is still
          and quiet.
          HANNA approaches the metal box and slowly reaches out her
          hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         HANNA

                         (WHISPER)
          Come and find me.
          CLOSE ON - She flips the switch, a little red light begins to
          flash.
          An ALARM CLOCK begins to ring as we cut to -

          30 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - EARLY MORNING 30

          CLOSE ON - a bedside alarm clock ringing loudly.
          MARISSA WIEGLER, a handsome woman in her mid-40's with red
          hair, reaches over and slams the alarm clock off.
          She's alone in her bed. She always is. She has no children.
          She's made choices in her life and lives without looking
          back.
          She walks into her ensuite bathroom and looks at herself in
          the mirror. She collects her toothbrush and bares her teeth
          in a snarl as she brushes them. Her gums bleed a little.

          31 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 31

          HANNA tends to boiling pots. She's cooking a feast. ERIK
          enters. He stamps his feet shedding ice at the door.
          He walks by the box and sees the little red light flickering
          on. HANNA sees this and sees him smile, but she knows he's
          sad.

                         ERIK
          You were lucky to grab that deer.
          There was nothing out there today.
          ERIK looks over at the meal HANNA is preparing.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Smells good.
          He wraps an arm around her shoulder. They don't hug much and
          it shows. HANNA is almost defensive and tense. And then the
          hug is over.

          32 EXT. CIA HQ LANGLEY VIRGINIA - DAY 32

          MARISSA, wearing a sharp business suit, drives a black Acura
          into her designated spot in the CIA HQ's car park.
          As she gets out, we see the parking space is designated for

          MARISSA WIEGLER.
          Her young male PA and TECH ONE are already waiting for her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         TECH ONE
          Ma'am. We've had a signal reported
          by Interpol. We think it's Eric
          Heller.
          An unusual expression of shock on MARISSA'S face.

                         MARISSA
          Well I'll be.

                         TECH ONE
          It seems he's in Sweden. Jokkmokk.
          40 miles out.

                         MARISSA
          What the fuck is he doing there?

                         TECH ONE
          Living in the middle of nowhere,
          like the frigging Una Bomber.

                         MARISSA
          The son of a bitch. Sweden?
          Sweden?!
          The PA hands her a coffee and she hands him some files.

                         TECH ONE
          Apparently he turned on his
          locator.

                         MARISSA
          He's not an idiot.

                         TECH ONE
          I know... I mean I believe so. But
          that's what happened.

                         MARISSA
          After 14 years in Jokkmokk, maybe
          he'd rather go to prison.

          33 INT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 33

          ERIK is leaning over a pail of water, cutting his beard off
          with a knife.

          MARISSA (V.O.)
          Eric Heller. From the Czech
          Republic. I recruited him in 1991
          when they were all joining the
          Velvet Revolution and sticking it
          to the commies
          ERIK, now clean shaven, opens a wooden case in the corner of
          the room and takes out an old folded three piece suit and
          rolled shirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

          MARISSA (V.O.)
          He couldn't wait to kiss some
          yankee butt and make some bucks
          doing our dirty work.
          ERIK awkwardly begins to change into the suit.

          34 INT. VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM, LANGLEY. 34

          MARISSA sits in a video conference room surrounded by worried
          looking faces, with her are her close advisors WALT and BOB.
          She's also speaking into a microphone on the table in front
          of her.

                         MARISSA
          Trouble was he had his own way of
          doing things. Kinda paranoid.
          WALT fires up a computer screen and logs on. He uses an
          access code. This takes him to a new file. He enters the
          tracking device number. A name comes up. ERIK HELLER.
          He clicks on a link. HELLER's face pops on to the screen.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Not a team player. Not a âjoiner.â
          He became increasingly isolated and
          disturbed. Kept mouthing off about
          classified programmes.
          WALT clicks on a link to a newspaper article which comes on
          to the screen: The headline: POLICE HUNT FOR MURDER SUSPECT.
          A picture of Heller in the article and a smashed car on a
          rural road. The two men stare at his face.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I kept warning and he kept getting
          worse. In the summer of 1995 he
          took his girlfriend, Johanna Zadek,
          on a trip to the Baltic coast and
          blew her head off.
          WALT hits a new link: A still of the same young woman as the
          photo HANNA was previously looking at in her bedroom. Her
          name printed below it: JOHANNA ZADEK.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Never heard from him again.

                         BOB
          Anybody know why?

                         MARISSA

                         (DRYLY)
          Maybe the pressure got to him, Bob.
          You know what that's like.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          A MALE VOICE comes from the speaker, this is LEWIS but we
          don't see him yet.

          LEWIS (O.S.)
          What do you want us to do?

                         MARISSA
          Bring him in.

                         WALT
          What do you mean? Call the police,

                         MARISSA -

                         MARISSA
          - Walt. This is exactly the kind of
          shit we can't have out there
          anymore. He was one of ours, we
          trained him. He kills some other
          poor woman and it's a cluster fuck.

                         WALT
          Tell it to Interpol. Let them pick
          him up. Try him for murder.

                         BOB
          He's right. This has nothing to do
          with us. I don't understand.

                         MARISSA
          You don't have to. I'm making the
          call.
          BOB and WALT exchange a look.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Thank you, Gentlemen. That'll be
          all.
          The video screen flickers off, people take their files and
          start to leave. MARISSA WIEGLER stands in the darkness.

          35 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 35

          HANNA sits in her bed reading her encyclopaedia.
          ERIK, dressed incongruously in the suit and tie, enters and
          sits on the edge of her bed. She doesn't look up from her
          book. His face shows more emotion than we've seen before.

                         ERIK
          Hanna...
          HANNA looks up, still trying to hide her fear.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Tell me again?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         HANNA
          Marissa Weigler.

                         ERIK
          Then?

                         HANNA
          Postcard.

                         ERIK
          Then?

                         HANNA
          What?

                         ERIK
          The address where we meet.

                         HANNA
          Wilhelm Grimm's house.
          Stephanstrasse 260. 10559, Berlin.
          Germany.
          ERIK moves a strand of hair from HANNA'S forehead and looks
          at her with paternal care.

                         ERIK
          Good night my sweet girl.
          He stands and quietly goes to the door when her voice stops
          him.

                         HANNA
          Father...
          He turns to look at her, both their eyes full of trepidation.

                         ERIK
          You can do this. You're ready. Just
          remember what I've taught you.
          She smiles reassuringly at him.

                         HANNA
          I'll see you there.

          36 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - NIGHT. 36

          ERIK comes out of the cabin carrying a small rucksack. He
          closes the door behind him and takes a deep breath.

          37 INT/EXT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 37

          HANNA gets out of bed and goes to the small window.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          She watches as ERIK walks away from the cabin for the last
          time.

          38 EXT. EDGE OF NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. NIGHT. 38

          Dusk in the forest as the flickering sun goes down. As
          peaceful a place as you could imagine. A calm blueness of
          impending night on the snow.
          Then a series of ropes break the top frame and FIFTY US
          SPECIAL FORCES dressed in white snow gear silently abseil
          down to the ground.

          39 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 39

          HANNA is doing push-ups on her bedroom floor.

          40 EXT. FOREST/CABIN - NIGHT 40

          Infra-red POV as the SPECIAL OPS TEAM head through the forest
          wearing night vision-goggles. The Leader of the Operation
          follows the tracker signal.

                         SPECIAL OPS
          Is this guy one of ours?

          HEAD OF OPS
          Used to be. Tread carefully, he's
          been in there a long time, he's
          damaged goods, and he knows we're
          coming.
          We see through the infra-red vision the endless trees in the
          pitch blackness.
          The SPECIAL OPS FORCES get closer. They see the cabin in the
          night. They approach. Silence in the darkness. Just the
          breathing of men in the icy cold.

          41 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 41

          HANNA stops her push-ups, sensing the SPECIAL FORCES
          approach.
          She silently springs to her feet and moves to the front of
          the cabin.
          She looks out and sees shadows moving among the trees.
          She turns and presses herself against the wall.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

          42 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - NIGHT 42

          The HEAD OF OPS waves TWO SPECIAL OPERATIVES forward. The
          rest of the forces surround the cabin, but at a distance.
          The two men approach the cabin. One opens the door and the
          other steps in. Then the first follows close behind. Both are
          engulfed by darkness.
          The rest of the forces wait in silence for a radio signal.
          The HEAD of SPECIAL OPS looses patience and picks up the
          radio.

          HEAD OF OPS
          McCullum? Do you read me?
          No response.

          HEAD OF OPS (CONT'D)
          I repeat, do you read me?
          The HEAD of OPS waves all thirty of his men closer to the
          cabin. Guns at the ready.
          The HEAD of OPS and five other men storm the cabin.

          Through night vision we see the cabin interior. Then the two
          SPECIAL FORCES, dead on the floor. Necks broken.
          Then find HANNA sitting quietly, looking timid and unsure.
          Just a little girl, her eyes shining in the dark.

          44 INT. LANGLEY. VIRGINIA. 44

          MARISSA is walking through long concrete corridor as her
          phone rings. She answers quickly.

                         MARISSA
          What is it?

          LEWIS (O.S.)
          Ma'am, this is Lewis.
          MARISSA affects a âbusiness as usualâ tone.

                         MARISSA
          Go ahead.

          LEWIS (V.O.)
          The target escaped.

                         MARISSA
          How did that happen?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

          LEWIS (V.O.)
          We're thinking maybe he got away in
          the snow, in the thick snow, or...
          But he's in the wind and I have two
          men down.

                         MARISSA

                         (URGENT)
          Find him, Lewis. Find him and take
          him out.

                         LEWIS
          Ma'am. There's more. They found a
          child, his daughter.
          MARISSA turns pale.

          45 INT. CAMP G. HOLDING CELL. 45


          ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION:
          A cement box. HANNA lies on a small bed. Not moving. Two
          American voices.

                         VOICE 1
          She hasn't moved since we brought
          her in.

                         VOICE 2 (BURTON)
          Has anyone talked to her?

                         VOICE 1
          They want a psych evaluation before
          they interrogate.

          46 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL. 46

          HANNA lies on the cot. She's been cleaned up and is wearing
          an army regulation jump suit. The metal door drags open. A
          Doctor, BURTON, closes the door behind him. He walks up to

          HANNA.

                         BURTON
          Hello Hanna.
          Hanna lies motionless.

                         BURTON (CONT'D)
          My name is Dr. Burton. Would you
          like to talk to me?
          BURTON'S voice has been trained to engender a state of peace
          and security. HANNA sits up and hangs her legs off the side
          of the cot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         HANNA
          I was told by my father to gain the
          upper hand.

                         BURTON
          Really. Interesting. What else did
          your father tell you?

                         HANNA
          Where am I?

                         BURTON
          You're in holding.

                         HANNA
          I see.

                         BURTON
          This must all be very strange for
          you. You've been in the forest a
          long time. But I want you to know
          no one's going to hurt you. We just
          want to talk to you about your
          father.
          HANNA seems to be staring up at the ceiling.

          BURTON (CONT'D)
          Hanna?
          He follows her eye-line to the CCTV camera above them.

                         HANNA
          Is that a camera?

                         BURTON
          Ah, yes, that's a camera. To keep a
          record.

                         HANNA
          Camera obscura, it's Latin for
          "dark chamber".

          47 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. 47

          LEWIS sits with the MONITOR, watching HANNA watching him.

                         LEWIS
          Plug the CCTV through to Langley.
          Extension 247.
          MONITOR presses some buttons as LEWIS calls on his phone and
          speaks into it.

          LEWIS (CONT'D)
          You should have visual on the psych
          evaluation now.

          48 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY HQ. NIGHT. CONT. 48

          MARISSA, alone in a Langley OBS ROOM. No one else there. Late
          at night in America. Something secret about Marissa here.
          On the screen she sees HANNA in the Interrogation Room. Her
          screen tells she is watching CAMP G - Interrogation Room 3.
          MARISSA watches HANNA intently.

                         HANNA
          It was first described by the
          Arabic scientist Ibn Alhazen in the
          year 1021.

                         MARISSA
          What's she saying?

          LEWIS (O.S.)
          Gobbledygook.

          49 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY HQ. NIGHT. CONT. 49

          MARISSA stares at her screen, at the blank face of the
          fourteen year old HANNA. Focus in on MARISSA's face as she
          studies this strange young woman. The sense that MARISSA
          knows more about this girl than she is letting on.
          On the screen BURTON continues to probe.

                         BURTON
          Can I get you something? What do
          you like? Music? Magazines? Just
          say. Anything at all.

          50 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 50

          HANNA leans forward. Looks at BURTON, who encourages her with
          his eyes. She whispers.

                         HANNA
          I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler.

          51 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 51

          MARISSA sits in stunned silence.

          LEWIS (O.S.)
          Did you hear that?
          MARISSA pauses before she answers.

                         MARISSA
          Tell her I'll be there tonight.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         LEWIS
          But...

                         MARISSA
          Just do it.

          52 INT. CAMP G. MILITARY LABORATORY. 52

          A white space with specialist lighting and the hum of
          specialised air pressurizes. A protected environment - this
          is the DNA lab. A MILITARY DOCTOR is looking at the result of
          something on a computer. It has shocked and intrigued him. He
          calls across to another doctor.

                         MILITARY DOCTOR 1
          John come and take a look at this
          kid's blood sample.
          MILITARY DOCTOR 2 walks across. He sees the sample on the
          screen.

          MILITARY DOCTOR 2.
          Is that right? That can't be right.

                         MILITARY DOCTOR 1
          And I got a sample of her hair.
          MILITARY DOCTOR 2 looks at the results, baffled.

                         MILITARY DOCTOR 2
          That must be contamination.

                         MILITARY DOCTOR 1
          What contamination? What would it
          be?

                         MILITARY DOCTOR 2
          Run it again.

          53 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL. 53

          HANNA is sitting on her cot with her back against the wall.
          A metal door drags open.
          A pair of smart female shoes enter the room, accompanied by
          the military boots of two guards.

          FALSE MARISSA (O.C.)
          My name is Marissa Wiegler. You
          wanted to speak to me?
          HANNA turns to look.
          It is a completely different woman, dressed in similar
          clothes to MARISSA but not her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          HANNA stares at her, then looks at the two guards.

          FALSE MARISSA (CONT'D)
          (to the guards)
          You can wait outside.
          The guards exit and the door slams shut behind them.

          54 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. DAY. CONT. 54

          In the Observation Room LEWIS is looking at a small Monitor.
          He speaks into a consoles microphone.

                         LEWIS
          You should have visual.

          55 INT. CIA LANGLEY OPERATIONAL HQ. EARLY DAWN. CONT. 55

          MARISSA WIEGLER sits alone in the empty CIA Langley
          headquarters, watching the CCTV relay.

          HANNA (V.O.)
          Where am I?

          56 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 56

          HANNA stares at FALSE MARISSA awaiting an answer.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          You're in a safe place. Let's talk
          about your father. You must love
          him very much.

                         HANNA
          Where did you meet him?
          The false MARISSA pauses.

          57 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 57

          MARISSA hears the question. Thinks fast, her mind totally
          focussed.

                         MARISSA
          Tell her it was by a news kiosk in
          Alexanderplatz, East Berlin. Say it
          was raining.

          58 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 58

          FALSE MARISSA pauses looking at HANNA. We see that she has a
          tiny microphone in her ear.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          At a news kiosk. Alexanderplatz. In
          the rain.
          She smiles reassuringly. HANNA nods, looking at FALSE

          MARISSA.

          59 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 59

          LEWIS watches on the screen. But then gets a call from the
          Military Laboratory.

                         LEWIS
          Lewis.

                         MILITARY DOCTOR
          Sir we need to talk to you. We've
          run tests on the girl.
          His voice sounds urgent, concerned. But Marissa has
          interrupted.

          MARISSA (V.O.)
          What tests?
          As the argument continues, we see and hear on the screen the
          FALSE MARISSA continuing to talk to HANNA.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          Do you know where your father is?
          In the OBS room LEWIS, half watching the screen, explains to
          MARISSA on intercom.

                         LEWIS
          Standard DNA and meds.

          60 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 60

          MARISSA, alone in Langley, suddenly alert.

                         MARISSA
          Send the results straight to me.
          On the screen FALSE MARISSA is talking to HANNA.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          Did he tell you where he was going?
          We're all worried about him.
          On the CCTV Hanna looks at the FALSE MARISSA. She begins to
          cry, holds out her arms to be held.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          61 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 61

          The MONITOR sees her cry and turns to LEWIS who is still half-
          embroiled in the tests discussion.

                         MONITOR
          Sir look.
          LEWIS looks at HANNA.

          62 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 62

          The FALSE MARISSA tentatively takes HANNA in her arms.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          It's OK. It's OK.
          HANNA coils her thin arms around the FALSE MARISSA'S neck,
          clinging to her like a monkey.
          The FALSE MARISSA looks up to the security camera, slightly
          concerned. Hanna wriggles in her arms, to get a better
          grip...

          63 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 63

          MARISSA watches this strange image of her false self hugging
          this young girl. HANNA begins to weep more and more,
          burrowing her face into the FALSE MARISSA.
          On the CCTV we hear.

          BURTON (V.O.)
          You want me to give her something?

          64 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 64

          HANNA clutching on to FALSE MARISSA, nestles close, weeping.

                         FALSE MARISSA
          I think it might be necessary.

          65 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY. CONT. 65

          MARISSA watches, now concerned. Something is wrong.

                         MARISSA
          Get her out of there.

          66 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 66

          Burton comes rushing down the corridor filling a syringe as
          he goes. He arrives at HANNA'S door.

                         BURTON
          Open up.
          The first guard opens HANNA'S door.

          LEWIS (V.O.)
          Abort. I repeat. Abort.

          67 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 67

          Hanna hugs, weeping, on to the FALSE MARISSA. BURTON hears
          the instruction to abort but too late...
          ...as suddenly and with total efficiency HANNA SNAPS the
          FALSE MARISSA's neck.

          68 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY. DAY. CONT. 68

          MARISSA stares in shock as her false self slumps dead to the
          floor. Then she watches as HANNA grabs the first GUARDS
          handgun from his holster and fires two rounds into Burton's
          skull. And two more into the first GUARD's chest.

          69 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. CONT. 69

          LEWIS immediately presses the Alarm Bell.

                         LEWIS
          Jee-sus wept!
          On another screen LEWIS watches as the other Guard tries to
          drag the metal door shut. He hits a fleshy door jam - Burton.
          Hanna is upon him. Two shots.

          70 INT. LANGLEY. OPERATIONAL HQ. CONT. 70

          MARISSA watches HANNA aim straight at camera. HANNA'S fierce
          eyes looking at her, MARISSA cant help but pull away from the
          screen. HANNA fires and the screen goes blank.

          71 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. CONT. 71

          LEWIS watches as, one after another, his camera's go down.
          But still there's no sign of HANNA.

                         LEWIS
          She's a child for Christsake!

          72 INT. CAMP G. CORRIDOR IN SECURE BRIEFING AREA. 72

          Alarms are sounding and red lights flashing in the corridor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          HANNA walks fast along the corridor. She ducks into a door to
          avoid two Centre Guards running past, dives down another
          corridor and walks through a pair of double doors with
          warning signs on them. PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT - CLASSIFIED

          PROGRAMME.

          73 INT. CAMP G. MILITARY LABORATORY. CONT. 73

          She finds herself in the specialist Military DNA Laboratory.
          The MILITARY DOCTORS stare at her. One of them reaches for an
          alarm but HANNA is too fast. She flies across the desk and
          smashing a glass test tube, she cuts the doctor's neck, then
          turns and does the same to the other one.
          HANNA looks round, trying to find a way out. Then she sees
          something on the desk. It is a file with a photo of herself
          clipped to it and a collection of papers - she scans it and
          reads in several places the letters âDNA.â
          But before she has time to read properly, she hears a female
          voice from outside the lab.

                         FEMALE GUARD
          This is Sanders. I'm checking Zone
          eleven.
          The FEMALE GUARD radios off, then enters. She senses
          something.
          POV SANDERS - The DNA laboratory suddenly seems empty. The
          buzz of the lab's lighting and the whir of the air-
          pressurizes are the only sounds as the GUARD looks around.
          Then the GUARD hears a rustling from behind her and tenses
          up.
          She turns around but HANNA has vanished into thin air, there
          is silence.

          74 INT. CAMP G. CORRIDOR IN SECURE BRIEFING CENTRE. 74

          HANNA, runs along the corridor. She has in her hands the DNA
          results which she scrunches up and jams into a pocket.

          75 INT. CAMP G. AIR-CONDITIONING DUCT ABOVE CORRIDOR. CONT. 75

          HANNA eyes the vent above her. She peers around a corner -
          her only other route of escape and sees:

          76 INT. CAMP G. CORRIDOR. CONT. 76

          MILITARY PERSONNEL reach the intersection close to HANNA and
          spread out, all going in different directions but none coming
          towards her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.
          The last pair of personnel start heading towards her. She
          looks up at the duct again and a length of ducting along the
          wall, about waist height.
          She puts a foot on a rail, halls herself up towards the vent.
          She fiddles with the vent, eventually opening it as the
          personnel are almost upon her.

          77 INT. CAMP G. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. CONT. 77

          She crawls through the narrow air-conditioning duct. She
          stops, alert to the sounds beneath her. Through small
          perforations in a vent she sees more MILITARY PERSONNEL
          running down the corridor.

          78 INT. CAMP G. AIR-CONDITIONING DUCT ABOVE CORRIDOR. CONT. 78

          The duct bends to a vertical angle. She begins to crawl up a
          steep gradient towards a crack of light.

          79 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. 79

          LEWIS sits in silence. MONITOR looks at him nervously.

                         MONITOR
          You think she's out?

                         LEWIS
          She can't get out.
          LEWIS picks up an internal telephone.

          LEWIS (CONT'D)

                         (INTO TELEPHONE)
          Who's on the perimeter? Detail
          every unit available.

          80 INT. CAMP G. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. CONT. 80

          HANNA is sweating, exhausted, blinking in the darkness,
          trying to make out what the light source is.
          The gradient has got steeper and she starts to slide
          backwards on the smooth metal surface. She digs her fingers
          into the rivets joining the plates of stainless steel, trying
          to get a purchase.
          She summons the last of her strength and reaches a crest. She
          rests a moment, then hauls herself over the crest and
          immediately starts sliding... she tumbles, gathering pace,
          falling down a long chute into the blackness. She has no idea
          where she is or what's happening, but she's covering a lot of
          ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          She hits the bottom with a crunch and cries out.
          When she opens her eyes she sees more tunnel - and at the end
          light. She crawls quickly towards it and stops at a kind of
          manhole cover with a sprung lever - she wrenches the lever
          and pushes against it. After a little effort the cover gives
          way and light floods in, blinding her.
          HANNA recovers and tentatively pokes her head out into:

          81 EXT. MOROCCO/DESERT. CONT. 81

          BLAZING SUN - HANNA's pale face appears, eyes crinkled shut.
          Wider - HANNA emerges from a hole in the ground in the middle
          of a sandblasted desert and slams the cover closed. Total
          silence now, except for the whistle of the wind on sand. It
          takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the blinding light.
          Blearily she looks out across this alien environment.
          After a moment her ears prick up. She turns just in time to
          see a column of Military Jeeps rise over a sand dune in the
          distance behind her. The jeeps are crawling straight towards
          her, ominously shimmering in the desert heat. She quickly
          ducks back down into her rabbit hole and waits.

          82 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT 82

          In the middle of the desert the soldiers convene, looking for
          HANNA. A military truck is stationery. Nothing around for
          miles. We hear a military voice on a radio.

          MILITARY VOICE (V.O.)
          473 are you receiving me? Can you
          confirm your position. Subject has
          escaped.

          83 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT. DAY. 83

          The truck moves off a short distance and stops again.
          Meanwhile a large convoy of Military Vehicles passes right
          over HANNA. When it has past she sees the first vehicle
          crawling to a halt right near the hole - just yards away.
          One of the MILITARY PERSONNEL in the jeep gets out and goes
          over to the hole, lifts the lid, inspects the darkness.
          The Truck radio is on and we hear the voice.

                         MILITARY VOICE
          Can you confirm your position 473?
          Banks? Banks can you hear me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Once BANKS is satisfied he walks away a few paces, gets out a
          pair of high powered binoculars, looks this way and that.
          He walks up a dune and scans the dunes with his binoculars.
          Finally he walks back and climbs into the Jeep, gets on the
          radio.

          BANKS.
          I'm at a perimeter opening at the
          far east wing. Something's not
          quite right...
          He doesn't notice but the lid is open now and the air-
          conditioning duct is empty.

                         CUT TO:
          As the Jeep moves off we see HANNA is clinging to the axle,
          hanging upside down underneath. Her face is pressed to the
          oily metal, her back just an inch from the desert floor
          flashing beneath her.
          The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune.
          HANNA takes her chance and lets go of her grip. She clenches
          her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her. As soon as the
          jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune.
          HANNA rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she
          slows and stops. She lies still and shocked by the quiet as
          the Jeep disappears into the distance. Then she sits up and
          looks around herself. She has no conception of this
          landscape, no idea where she might be.

          84 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 84

          MARISSA moves between her wardrobe and a suitcase packing
          clothes, underwear, another power suit.
          Fully packed she goes to the back of the wardrobe and pulls
          aside some dresses to reveal a hidden safe. She keys in the
          security code, the safe door opens and from the back of the
          safe Marissa retrieves a blue file.
          MARISSA looks at the files title in large blunt letters:

          GALINKA.

          85 EXT. FOREST ROAD - FLASHBACK 85

          FLASHBACK to 1995.
          A much younger MARISSA watching a very fast-moving car on a
          deserted forest road. She takes from her pocket a small
          detonating device and as the car approaches a bend, presses
          it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.
          There is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road
          and smashes headlong into a post. The horn starts to blare.
          MARISSA approaches the car. The road is empty. MARISSA looks
          through binoculars at the car.
          She sees a woman, on the passenger side, head thrust forward.
          JOHANNA ZADEK. Blood everywhere. MARISSA shoots her in the
          head just to be sure. But the driver's seat is empty. MARISSA
          stops dead.
          Then the back door opens on the other side. A man, a younger
          ERIK HELLER crawls out. He is holding a two year old child in
          his hands. The child's coat is covered in blood.
          MARISSA stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to
          her eye to shoot again. As she does, ERIK senses her movement
          and throws himself to the ground.
          Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of ERIK
          and the red glare of the coat covered in blood, ERIK HELLER
          grabbing the child and sprinting for the forest,
          MARISSA taking aim at HELLER, and then firing as HELLER dives
          into the forest.

          86 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 86


          PRESENT DAY.
          MARISSA puts on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves and sets fire
          to the file in the sink.
          When it's all burnt up she switches on the garbage disposal
          and pushes the ashen remains down the gurgler with a dish
          mop.

          87 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT - LATER 87

          The sun has dipped a little now, the shadows of the dunes are
          longer, but the heat is still intense.
          HANNA's throat is parched by the dry heat, her pale eyes
          scorched by the angry sun. She walks purposefully but with a
          growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly endless
          sea of sand. She has no conception of this landscape, no idea
          where she might be.

                         HANNA

                         (MUTTERING)
          I live in Leipzig. German city...
          0.7 Million people... I go to
          school at the Klaus Kohle
          Gymnasium... literature and
          sport... I have a dog called Trudi.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          HANNA climbs a steep dune, eyes down, feet pounding. A shadow
          falls across her path and she looks up to see the shape of a
          GIRL standing at the top of the dune silhouetted by the sun.
          HANNA's hand goes to the concealed gun.
          The GIRL stares at HANNA. They must be about the same age
          but there the resemblance ends. HANNA, dusty, bloodied and
          bruised in military top, trousers and boots stares at this
          perfect image of western adolescence. Dressed head to toe
          in pink and drinking a can of coke, no concession to where
          she is whatsoever. This is SOPHIE LYALL.

                         SOPHIE
          Hello.
          HANNA stares at her, then abruptly turns to walk in opposite
          direction until she sees another convoy of US military trucks
          in the distance.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          All right?
          HANNA turns back. Looks at SOPHIE. Like a wary animal.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          Don't you speak English?
          HANNA is unsure how to speak to this strange person.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          That can't be helped. You look
          terrible.
          At that moment SOPHIE'S brother, MILES, eight years old,
          rises over the dune and stands by SOPHIE'S side. In his hand
          is a stills camera, not digital, film. MILES stares at HANNA
          while talking to SOPHIE.

                         MILES
          Who's she?

                         SOPHIE
          I don't know. I just found her.

                         MILES
          What's her name?

                         SOPHIE
          She can't talk.

                         HANNA
          Hanna.

                         MILES
          She talked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         HANNA
          I live in Leipzig. German city.
          Population 0.7 Million people. We
          live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I
          go to school at the Klaus Kohle
          Gymnasium and my best friends are
          Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I
          like literature and sport, in
          particular tennis and athletics.

                         MILES

                         (RE' HANNA)
          She's weird.

                         HANNA
          I also have a dog called Trudi.

                         MILES
          We had a dog called Vincent, but he
          went mad and died.

                         SOPHIE
          I'm Sophie and this is my brother,
          Shit for Brains.
          From over the dune comes the voice of SOPHIE and MILES'S
          mother, RACHEL LYALL.

          RACHEL (O.S.)
          Come on, Sophie! We'll miss the
          light.
          MILES raises his camera to his eye and snaps a picture of

          HANNA.

                         MILES
          Bye.

                         SOPHIE
          See you.
          SOPHIE takes one more puzzled look at HANNA, then turns and
          disappears over the sand dune.
          HANNA rises to the top of the dune. SOPHIE turns back to

          HANNA.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          Do you need a lift somewhere?

                         HANNA
          No. I prefer to walk.

                         SOPHIE
          Suit yourself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          SOPHIE and MILES head back towards their nouveau hippy
          parents, RACHEL and SEBASTIAN LYALL who are waiting for them
          beside an old VAN parked by a tarmac road that cuts straight
          through the desert.

          88 INT. AEROPLANE - NIGHT. 88

          MARISSA sitting in first class, trying to hide the fact that
          she's on her cell phone mid-flight. There's turbulence.

          LEWIS(O.O.V)
          She's in the desert east of
          Essouiara.

                         MARISSA
          Have you got the DNA results?

                         LEWIS
          We can't find them. It's possible
          she has them on her.
          Marissa takes that in.

                         MARISSA
          Okay. I want you to focus on Erik
          Heller.

          LEWIS (O.O.V)
          Why?
          A sweet-faced male AIR STEWARD hovers over MARISSA.

                         AIR STEWARD
          Excuse Madame, airline regulations
          state that -

                         MARISSA
          I'm in conference.

                         AIR STEWARD
          All the same -

                         MARISSA
          Back off, honey. I'm busy.
          MARISSA'S response is so fierce that the AIR STEWARD
          instinctively does as he's told.

          LEWIS (O.O.V)
          You know this isn't going to go
          away.

                         MARISSA
          I'm dealing with it Lewis.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

          LEWIS (O.O.V)
          Okay but I just want you to admit -
          my Lord - how did she know to ask
          for you?
          She hangs up.

          89 EXT. DESERT/OASIS TOWN - DUSK 89

          HANNA walking along the side of a tarmac desert road,
          approaching a dusty oasis town.
          HANNA enters the outskirts, teaming with scooters, trucks,
          taxis, mules and goats. The impact knocks HANNA backwards,
          assailed by the smells of dried fruit, meat tagines, couscous
          cooking at market stalls, fresh fish and meat, still bloody
          and twitching, hanging in the sun for the flies. She listens
          to the babble of Arabic, her ears, nose and eyes sensitive to
          every conversation and twitch of life. It all overpoweringly
          exotic and visceral to her.
          An old broken-backed woman inches her way to market. HANNA
          stares at her in astonishment. Her wrinkled skin.
          She eyes the abundance of animals - animals she's never seen
          before in her life: Chickens. Goats. A camel, which Hanna
          finds bizarre and hilarious.

          90 INT. CENTRE OF TOWN/NIGHT MARKET - EVENING 90

          HANNA finds a stall with simple cotton clothing. She chooses
          some cheap clothes and unseen goes around the back of the
          stall. She changes out of her ragged old clothes into her new
          clothes.
          HANNA sees MILES running through the crowds carrying a bag of
          cherries.
          She follows him a little way, onto a busy street with hotels
          and cheap jewellery stores.
          He runs up the steps and enters a small mid-range hotel.
          HANNA looks up at the hotel, then enters.

          91 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL RECEPTION - EVENING 91

          HANNA stands at the reception desk. A kindly looking HOTEL
          OWNER is eating a jammy biscuit. He's a little confused by

          HANNA.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          Where's your family?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         HANNA
          Are you Arab?

                         HOTEL OWNER
          I'm Moroccan.

                         HANNA
          Morocco. Capital city Rabat. Places
          of interest. Marrakesh. Essouaira.
          Religion Islam. Language Arabic
          (in Arabic w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          I like Arabic very much. It's like
          Japanese. It's big.
          The HOTEL OWNER nearly spits out his biscuit in shock.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          (in Arabic w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          You speak Arabic?

                         HANNA
          (in Arabic w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Yes, of course.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          (in Arabic w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Where's your family?

                         HANNA
          (in Arabic w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          I need a room for one night. Can
          you help? I don't have any money.

          92 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - EVENING 92

          The HOTEL OWNER leads HANNA into a simple whitewashed hotel
          room with twin beds.
          They speak in Arabic with English subtitles.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          It's the best we've got.

                         HANNA
          Thank you.
          HANNA stares at the light switch.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Do you have one of these in every
          room?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          Of course. All mod cons.

                         HANNA
          It's electricity?
          The HOTEL OWNER looks at HANNA askance.

                         HOTEL OWNER
          Yes.

                         HANNA
          I know a little bit about
          electricity. They say Edison
          discovered it, or was it Franklin?

                         HOTEL OWNER
          Some American, I'm sure.
          He picks up an electric kettle.

          HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)
          Electric kettle for the English -
          they like to make their own tea.
          He switches it on, Hanna stares as it heats up noisily.
          He goes to a small wall mounted TV, switches it on for her, a
          fuzzy, terrible picture of an Arabic TV show. HANNA is
          fascinated, doesn't take her eyes off the TV as she sits on
          the edge of the bed.

                         HANNA
          What is it?

                         HOTEL OWNER
          It's the best we can do.
          She stares at the picture, bemused.

          HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)
          Where do you come from?
          Distracted, HANNA is caught off guard.

                         HANNA
          The forest.
          The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a little puzzled by this
          strange encounter, and leaves.
          She just sits there staring at the TV as it's volume seems to
          increase.
          Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours
          from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle
          violently.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          HANNA gets up and approaches the kettle very warily. She
          tries the light switch in an attempt to stop the kettle, but
          it keeps boiling and making its strange rattle. HANNA tries
          another switch, the ceiling fan begins to turn, confusing
          HANNA even more.
          On the TV the news shows footage of war in the Middle East,
          the sound of gunfire.
          The ceiling fan is at its top speed, it's blades cut the air
          like a helicopter.
          A telephone beside the bed starts to ring.
          Combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo.
          HANNA backs away towards the bathroom. She stumbles and falls
          through the bathroom door straight into the shower,
          inadvertently turning the taps on. Water pours down on her.
          HANNA springs up and turns to face the stream of water as if
          it were an attacker. She runs back into the bedroom.
          In the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum,
          the TV is still screaming, the fan still cutting, the phone
          still shouting.
          HANNA pulls at the exit door, but doesn't know to turn the
          handle. She panics. Smashes at the door. Eventually she falls
          through the door and into the corridor.

          93 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 93

          Silence as HANNA sits on the corridor floor catching her
          breath.
          A little way down the corridor MILES and SOPHIE emerge from
          their bedroom.

                         MILES
          Look. It's that girl.
          He nudges SOPHIE.
          HANNA eyes them suspiciously.

                         SOPHIE
          Hey you made it.

                         MILES
          Hey, again.

                         SOPHIE
          Did you walk here?

                         MILES
          She looks different.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         SOPHIE
          Do you want to hang with us?

                         MILES
          Are you hungry?

                         SOPHIE
          Miles is always hungry.

                         HANNA
          I'm thirsty.

          94 EXT/INT. STRIP CLUB. HAMBURG. 94

          The Reeperbaln, the main street of Hamburg's red light
          district. Tough and unglamorous. MARISSA WIEGLER gets out of
          a taxi, checks the sign of the strip club and crosses the
          road. She is on the phone and we hear.

          LEWIS (O.S.)
          The Swedish borders are sealed. I
          have Swedish, Norwegian and Danish
          border patrols on high alert and
          Interpol have briefed the police.

                         MARISSA
          I don't want any bad news Lewis.
          Neither of us can afford a fuck up.
          MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car park which is
          now a lap dancing bar. It's early in the day and the patrons
          are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers.
          At the far end of the room is the reason Marissa is there,
          MICHAEL ISAACS. Mid fifties. Rumpled suit, bleary, unshaven
          and drinking a scotch.
          ISAACS smiles coldly at MARISSA.

                         ISAACS
          I didn't think they let women in
          here.

                         MARISSA
          They let them in, they just don't
          let them get dressed.
          He smiles, drinks, she eyes the scotch.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Still drinking on the job. You
          haven't changed.

                         ISAACS
          You have.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         MARISSA
          Adapt or die.

                         ISAACS
          You want a drink?

                         MARISSA
          I'll wait until I really need one.
          He grins and drinks. She sits, with a sigh, looks him in the
          eye.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Erik Heller's still alive.
          ISAACS glances up from his drink.

                         ISAACS
          You don't say.

                         MARISSA
          There's more.
          MARISSA passes him a newspaper. He opens it. Hidden inside is
          a picture of Hanna. He looks it over, surprised.

                         ISAACS (IRONIC)
          Wow. All grown up.

                         MARISSA
          He did a good job.

                         ISAACS
          Did she turn out like you hoped?

                         MARISSA
          She just tried to kill me.

                         ISAACS
          Isn't it always the way?

                         MARISSA
          The fuck does that mean?

                         ISAACS
          You bring them into this world,
          teach them how to kill and maim...
          and then they turn against you.

                         MARISSA
          I didn't teach her.

                         ISAACS
          No, it's better than that. You bred
          her from a test tube.
          MARISSA turns to the BARMAN and signals for a round of the
          scotches, âTwo of these...â

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         MARISSA
          Here's the problem: She thinks we
          killed her mother.
          He smiles wryly.

                         ISAACS
          Just get her sectioned or
          something.

                         MARISSA
          Sure, just as soon as she's done
          breaking peoples necks. You get her
          sectioned, if you can catch her.
          The drinks arrive, MARISSA drinks.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Right now she's in Morocco but
          she'll be trying to get out of the
          country. Find her and bring her to
          me. Quietly.

                         ISAACS
          I'll need funds.
          MARISSA slides an envelope of bills across the table.

                         MARISSA
          Don't spend it all on candy.
          She glances meaningfully at the STRIPPERS, who have been
          eyeing up ISAACS as a potential mark.
          ISAACS looks at the money. When he looks back up MARISSA is
          already walking out the door.

          95 EXT. NIGHT MARKET RESTAURANT. OASIS TOWN - NIGHT 95

          HANNA is sitting at a table with the FAMILY who are all
          eating falafel while HANNA eats meat.
          SOPHIE and MILES parents, RACHEL and SEB, have some
          difficulty relating to their daughters attitudes. They belong
          to a generation of counter cultural radicals whose priorities
          have, over the past decade, shifted and they're now trying to
          assimilate into mainstream society whilst still holding on to
          their ideals of autonomy and social liberation.
          SOPHIE is describing a recent cultural phenomenon while she
          picks at her food.

                         SOPHIE
          She's beautiful. I wish I had a
          body like hers. She's really cool
          too. She's married to a footballer
          and really loves him -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Meanwhile HANNA eyes the crowd, constantly on the look out.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          - only the papers found out he was
          shagging like loads of other girls
          so she went and got all successful
          in her own right and now does a
          make-over show where she turns
          right dogs into real babes. I could
          do you a make-over if you'd like?

                         RACHEL
          Perhaps Hanna doesn't want a make-
          over, sweetie.
          SOPHIE ignores RACHEL and addresses all her responses to

          HANNA.

                         SOPHIE
          Rachel doesn't believe in making
          the best of yourself.

                         RACHEL
          No Sophie, I just don't believe
          fourteen year-old girls should be
          dressing to look like porn stars.
          It objectifies them.

                         SOPHIE

                         (TO HANNA)
          Do you shave your armpits yet?

                         HANNA
          I don't think so.

                         RACHEL
          Good. Keep it that way.

                         SOPHIE
          That's SOOO gross.

                         RACHEL
          Do you often travel on your own,
          Hanna?

                         HANNA
          My father encourages me to be
          independent.

                         SEB
          And your mother?

                         HANNA
          She's dead.

                         SEB
          Oh, I'm sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         SOPHIE
          Nice one, Dad.

                         HANNA
          People die.

                         MILES
          What did she die of?

                         HANNA
          Three bullets.

                         RACHEL
          Oh. God. How terrible.
          SOPHIE is weirdly impressed.

          96 EXT/INT. BUTCHERS SHOP. SOUTH SWEDEN - NIGHT 96

          ERIK HELLER, still wearing his three piece suit, enters a
          tiny provincial Swedish butchers shop and walks up to the
          counter. He checks around to make sure no one is following
          him before approaching the BUTCHER and slapping some cash on
          the counter.

                         HELLER
          Three pounds of goose fat if you
          please.

          97 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER 97

          HANNA arrives back at the hotel with RACHEL, SEB, MILES and
          SOPHIE. MILES is sleepy and SOPHIE a little grumpy.

                         SOPHIE
          Why do we always have to get up so
          early?

                         SEB
          If you were a Berber shepherd -

                         SOPHIE
          - I'm not a shepherd. Jesus.

                         RACHEL
          We have to be at the port by eight
          tomorrow so I want you to pack
          now...

                         MILES
          I'm too sleepy.
          HANNA listens anxiously, knowing she needs to go with them to
          be safe.
          She arrives at her door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         HANNA
          Good night.
          But the family are too wrapped up in their discussion to
          notice her.

                         SEB
          No, you're not. Come on we'll do it
          together.
          HANNA enters her room. SOPHIE turns at the sound of HANNA'S
          door closing.

                         SOPHIE
          She's weird. Is it me, or is that
          girl weird?

          98 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT 98

          The TV flickers illuminating HANNA as she sits on her bed
          looking at the DNA report folded up into a tight wad. She
          smooths it out and reads.
          The test reads: HANNA HELLER - âSGM + test results.
          Interfering sequence present. Abnormal. B sample confirms

                         RESULTÂ
          HANNA stares at the words. âInterfering sequence present.
          Abnormal.â HANNA looks at the photo of herself and those
          words.

                         HANNA

                         ÂABNORMALÂ
          What does it mean?
          She looks up at the TV and sees footage of millions of Muslim
          worshipers circling the Kaaba at Mecca. The sheer mass of
          humanity stuns her. HANNA turns up the volume and hears the
          call to prayer.
          She listens in wonder to her first experience of music.

          HANNA (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERS)
          Music. A combination of sounds with
          a view to beauty of form and
          expression of emotion.
          She breathes in the beautiful sounds.

          99 EXT. SOUTH SWEDISH COAST - PRE-DAWN 99

          The music continues over -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          A barren rocky outcrop on the South Swedish coast. HELLER
          arrives. He has a rucksack on his back.
          HELLER undresses and puts his suit in a plastic bag that he
          knots tight. He puts the bag into the rucksack and puts it on
          his back.
          Then HELLER starts to cover his body in the goose fat he
          bought in the butcher's. He stares across the water towards
          DENMARK in the distance.

          100 EXT. HOTEL CAR PARK. - PRE-DAWN 100

          HANNA appears in the blue morning light and stalks around the
          car park looking for the family van.
          When she finds it, she tries the doors but they're locked.
          She tries the back door but that's also locked.
          She gets her foot onto a wheel and another foot onto a
          doorhandle and climbs up onto the roof.

          101 EXT. VAN/ROOF - PRE-DAWN 101

          She studies the sun roof of the recreational vehicle. It has
          been left open a few inches for air.
          She gets her hands in there and tries to prise it open
          further but it's mechanised and won't budge.
          She looks around the car park for an implement.
          She spies a fire escape with a caretaker's nook next to it.
          She climbs back down off the van and goes to the caretaker's
          room.

          102 INT. CARETAKER'S ROOM - PRE-DAWN 102

          HANNA searches the tiny office until she finds a crowbar.

          103 EXT. FERRYPORT. MOROCCO. DAY 103

          A busy bustling ferry-port, cars in both directions.
          ISAACS looks round, makes silent contact with other men. His
          men. Four of them dotted around the ferryport.
          ISAACS approaches a BORDER GUARD. The GUARD is looking at a
          photocopied photo of HANNA from her holding cell. The GUARD
          pockets the photocopy as ISAACS passes him a wad of cash.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          104 INT. VAN - DAY. 104

          THE FAMILY travels towards the ferry-port, sleepy and grumpy,
          yawning, looking around.
          The sun roof to the rear, above the breakfast table and bench
          seats, is wide open.

                         SEB
          ... Somebody broke the sun roof. I
          said somebody broke the sun roof.
          It won't close...

                         RACHEL
          Call the rental.

                         SEB
          I hope its insured.

          105 EXT. FERRYPORT. MOROCCO - CONTINUOUS 105

          ISAACS watches closely every car that approaches the ferry
          from behind his dark glasses.
          He sees the FAMILY have joined a cue of vehicles and are
          having their papers checked. Then they're waved on board. He
          scrutinises them but has no reason to suspect anything.

          106 INT. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 106

          Cars are parking, their headlights on in the dark hull, horns
          blowing, FERRY GUARDS directing people to parking spaces -
          it's chaos.
          SEB parks the van with some difficulty, complaining all the
          while.

                         SEB
          Typical. Get me back to the
          European Union.

                         RACHEL
          Don't be rude.
          They get out, taking with them anything they might need -
          knapsacks, computer games, suit cases.
          They head off towards the stairs up to the decks, passing
          ISAACS on their way.
          ISAACS searches between the cars and trucks.
          He passes the back of the FAMILY'S van as the camera pushes
          in on its back door. The handle is being JIGGLED FROM INSIDE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

          107 INT. VAN/FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 107

          Inside, the van is as the family left it, but the bench seats
          around the breakfast table are disturbed. One has been opened
          out, the lid taken off, the mattress strewn on the floor -
          inside is a big storage space where HANNA has evidently
          hidden... The crowbar has been discarded there.
          HANNA is trying to get out. She tries the back door but its
          locked.
          She climbs over the seats and climbs into the front cabin,
          the driver's seat. She finds a lock on the door and unlocks.
          She climbs out.

          108 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - DAY 108

          HANNA walks out on deck and sees the sea, the sight of it
          takes her breath away. She walks to the railings and looks
          over the edge. Then up at the seagulls following the boat.
          A little way off the FAMILY are sitting eating ice-creams.
          SOPHIE lies out on a bench sunning herself.

                         RACHEL
          What has got into you? Oh my God,
          look over there.
          They all look where she is pointing - at HANNA.

                         SOPHIE
          It's her.

                         SEB
          You think she... you don't think
          she... Rachel, the sunroof?

                         RACHEL
          You think we should say something?

                         SEB
          What's there to say?

                         RACHEL
          Maybe she's in trouble.

                         SEB
          Maybe she's a hooker. Or a
          terrorist. There's a lot of them in
          Germany.

                         SOPHIE
          Hookers or terrorists?

                         RACHEL
          I'll go over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         SEB
          Rachel, walk away. I'm insisting
          here. I'm putting my foot down...
          RACHEL heads off towards HANNA, SOPHIE follows.

                         CUT TO:
          SOPHIE and RACHEL approach HANNA and move to positions either
          side of her.

                         SOPHIE
          All right?

                         HANNA
          Did you know that 71 percent of the
          earths surface is covered in water?

                         SOPHIE
          My father thinks you're a stowaway.
          He thinks you broke our sunroof
          too, which puts you in deep shit.

                         RACHEL
          Sophie just - I'll handle this.

                         (TO HANNA)
          Where's your father?
          No reply.

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          I really think it might help if you
          told us the, you know, the truth
          and all that. Have you run away
          from somewhere?

                         SOPHIE
          Are you okay?

                         HANNA
          I'm fine.

                         RACHEL
          I'm worried about you.

                         SOPHIE
          She said she's fine.

                         RACHEL
          You have to understand this really
          is a problem for us.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         SOPHIE
          You know what? Why don't I stay
          here with her and you go off and be
          with dad? He's looking kind of
          tense.

                         CUT TO:
          RACHEL rejoins SEB and MILES.

                         SEB
          Has she even got a passport?!

                         RACHEL
          I don't think I handled that very
          well.

                         SEB
          How do you know she's not some kind
          of illegal immigrant?

          109 EXT. UPPER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 109

          ISAACS searches the upper deck. Through the bar on the other
          side of the ferry he sees one of his men searching the
          opposite deck.
          A CHILD knocks into ISAACS and the few photocopied
          photographs he has of HANNA fall from his pocket and are
          blown along the deck.
          ISAACS scrambles to pick-up the photocopies.

          110 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 110

          HANNA and SOPHIE are still standing at the railings. SOPHIE
          offers HANNA some of her ice-cream.

                         SOPHIE
          Would you like some?
          HANNA looks curiously at the ice-cream.

                         HANNA
          Please.
          She tries it.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          It tastes like music.

                         SOPHIE
          You're so weird, aren't you? Did
          you have a fight with your dad or
          something?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         HANNA
          Yes.

                         SOPHIE
          Was it bad?

                         HANNA
          No. I won.
          HANNA studies the sea.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Can you help me get home?
          At that moment one of ISAACS photocopied pictures of HANNA
          rolls across the deck and catches on the railings.
          HANNA looks down at it, recognizes herself and quickly
          pockets it. She looks across the deck, too many people, she
          shouldn't have let herself be so exposed.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          You could do me a make-over if you
          like?

          111 INT. VAN. FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 111

          MILES is sitting in the driver's seat, pretending to drive
          the stationary van.
          Through the windscreen, RACHEL and SEB can be seen having a
          heated discussion.
          In the back, HANNA is changing into some of SOPHIE'S clothes.

                         SOPHIE
          You're pretty. You know that?

                         HANNA
          Am I?

                         SOPHIE
          Of course you are. You've got
          pretty eyes and you're tall. I
          always wanted to be tall. If I were
          a man I might fancy you.
          She laughs. HANNA responds seriously.

                         HANNA
          I'm not a man.
          SOPHIE laughs even more.
          The door swings open and SEB is standing there with RACHEL,
          nervous but determined.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         SEB
          Okay, here's the deal. We're going
          to find a way to get you home just
          as soon as we get off this crate.
          But since you don't have a passport
          with you right now, we're just
          going to have to be a bit gorilla.
          Okay?

                         RACHEL
          We passionately believe it's the
          right thing to do.
          They don't look sure at all, but SOPHIE puts her arm round
          HANNA and HANNA returns the gesture, everybody slightly
          embarrassed.

          112 EXT. FERRY PORT ALGECIRAS - DAY 112

          The FERRY is docked, the huge doors are open and cars are
          starting to drive out, halting on the dock to have passports
          checked.

          113 INT. VAN. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 113

          Cars are revving up, manoeuvring and getting ready to
          disembark.
          RACHEL is at the drivers wheel while SEB is in the back
          stripping the cushions from the bench seats to prepare a
          place for HANNA to hide.
          HANNA waits, breath bated, her arm round SOPHIE's shoulders.
          On the far side she sees ISAACS enter the deck. She watches
          him carefully and decides he must be looking for her. She
          ducks down a little further.
          RACHEL, looking nervous, turns to HANNA.

                         RACHEL
          You okay honey?

                         HANNA
          Yes yes I'm ready!
          ISAACS is getting closer, walking between the cars. The ferry
          gates are open and the noise subsides.
          SEB discovers the crowbar, examines it.

                         SEB
          Oh Jesus.
          HANNA grabs it and sticks it back in the box, helps SEB fling
          cushions aside and gets into the compartment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          SEB grits his teeth.

          SEB (CONT'D)
          Here goes nothing.
          He shuts the bench seat over HANNA and replaces the cushions
          just as ISAACS passes the van, sniffing around.
          SEB gets out of the back and walks around to the front. He
          passes ISAACS on his way round.

          SEB (CONT'D)
          Excuse me. Sir?
          ISAACS gets out of the way and SEB gets into the front
          passenger's seat. RACHEL starts the engine, checks her
          mirrors.
          SEB eyes ISAACS with some paranoia - although he has no idea
          who he is.

          INSIDE HANNA'S HIDE OUT -
          HANNA lies quietly, her eyes glistening in the dark. She
          listens, hearing the van disembarking the ferry.

          114 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 114

          Dark rain pours down on to a beach on the Danish coast.
          A figure struggles to land. Then, like a monster from the
          deep, ERIK emerges out of the surf. His lungs bursting with
          the exertion. Water dripping from his body.
          He collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach. He
          approaches the beach car park.
          A POLICE CAR swings into the car park.
          ERIK tries to run, but it's too late. The POLICE CAR is on
          him.
          He stops and turns towards the police car.
          TWO POLICEMEN get out of the car and approach ERIK. He
          watches them very carefully.

          115 EXT. MOTORWAY/SOUTHERN SPAIN - DAY 115

          The FAMILY'S van speeds along the E-15 up from the Bay of
          Gibraltar, heading north east towards the mountains.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

          116 INT. VAN - DAY 116

          HANNA stares out at the changing light in the rugged
          landscape.
          Hills are emerging and the land is turning green in the gold
          evening light.
          HANNA watches RACHEL unscrew the cap of a water bottle and
          brings it to SEB'S mouth while he drives. SEB laughs as a
          little water spills down his front.
          SOPHIE is listening to an iPOD. HANNA looks at her. SOPHIE
          takes one earphone out of her own ear and puts it in HANNA's.

          117 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - DAY 117

          ISAACS shows fake ID to the ferry's frowning SECURITY
          OFFICER, who doesn't appreciate the unsolicited approach.

                         ISAACS
          Sir, I'll be as brief as I can, we
          have a situation here...

          118 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - LATER 118

          ISAACS is studying CC TV footage of the ferry. He views a
          number of scenes with no luck until he notices:
          The car deck - HANNA and SOPHIE weaving through the cars and
          boarding the van.

          119 INT. VAN - DAY 119

          HANNA rests her head on SOPHIE'S shoulder and relaxes for the
          first time. MILES relaxes his head on HANNA's shoulder and
          they stare at the huge, granite mountain range...
          She starts to nod off... she falls asleep on SOPHIE's
          shoulder.

          120 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 120

          MARISSA walks along the desolate patch of coastline. She
          approaches a Crime Scene. Dogs, markings on the ground. Two
          DANISH POLICEMEN lie inert on the pebbles, their throats
          freshly sliced.

                         LEWIS
          The Danish authorities are taking
          this very seriously. They've
          doubled the number of officers on
          the ground. We've sent up spotter
          planes over the channel.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         LEWIS (CONT'D)
          They're appealing for witnesses
          through the local media...
          MARISSA nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea. The
          reality of ERIK'S determination unnerving her.

          LEWIS (CONT'D)
          You think he really swam it?
          MARISSA knows he did. She calls over her shoulder as she
          walks away.

                         MARISSA
          Keep me posted.

          121 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - DAY 121

          The campsite is heaving with humanity, thousands of EUROPEAN
          CAMPERS who have turned the site into what amounts to a
          shanty town - a small city with its own shops, drainage,
          borders and rules. Families come here from cities across
          Europe and bring their whole lives with them.
          The LYALL FAMILY van is squeezed in between a GERMAN family
          walking around in skimpy swimming costumes - and a serious
          looking FRENCH family with quad bikes.
          SOPHIE, MILES and HANNA stare at the other families a moment.

          GERMAN CAMPER.
          Guten tag.

                         HANNA
          Guten Morgen.

          GERMAN CAMPER.
          Wie geht es Ihnen?

                         HANNA
          Gutm und Ihnen?

          GERMAN CAMPER.
          Jah, gut, gut...
          A FRENCH CAMPER nods at them.

          FRENCH CAMPER.
          Bonjour. Ca va?

                         HANNA
          Ca va. Oui. Bien...
          HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's
          tent. He's watches impressed as HANNA expertly ties
          complicated knots.
          RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         RACHEL
          Maybe we could all go for a walk
          when we've put the tent up.

                         SOPHIE
          No thanks.
          HANNA looks off to the tree line. In the distance she spots a
          couple of RABBITS in a pool of sunlight.

          122 INT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 122

          HANNA turns a display unit of postcards.
          Through the window she can see SOPHIE talking to TWO TEENAGE

          BOYS.
          One of the boys enters the shop. He looks at HANNA as he
          passes and smiles. This is FELICIANO. He is handsome. HANNA'S
          not used to this feeling of being looked at.
          While the SHOP ASSISTANT serves FELICIANO HANNA pockets a
          postcard and a book of stamps.

          123 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 123

          HANNA sits on a low wall writing her postcard:
          âMission accomplished'
          HANNA gets up and posts the card.

          124 EXT. WOODS NEAR CAMPSITE - DAY 124

          RACHEL and HANNA are walking in the woods together. Above
          them the evening chorus is in full song.

                         RACHEL
          I just feel connected when I'm in
          the countryside. The city stifles
          me... emotionally, creatively.
          HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in
          the undergrowth.

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          Anyway, I was very young when I...
          Seb and I.... He was so impressive.
          HANNA suddenly runs into the woods.

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          Hanna?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          125 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - EVENING 125

          The FAMILY are sitting in fold-out chairs eating charred
          veggie sausages.

                         SOPHIE
          It's probably just a bunch of
          Spanish farmers, mum. We're hardly
          going to be out all night.

                         RACHEL
          You're not going, Sophie. No way,
          Jose.
          HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS.
          She lays them in front of the family.

                         HANNA
          Food.
          SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and
          RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might
          be.

                         MILES
          That's gross.

          126 INT. CAMPSITE PUBLIC BATHROOM - NIGHT 126

          The girls are hiding out in the Ladies Room as SOPHIE does
          HANNA'S make-up.

                         SOPHIE
          I don't know why I'm doing this,
          you're going to steal all the best
          men off of me.

                         HANNA
          What do you mean?

                         SOPHIE
          Though quite frankly I don't need
          more digits than I've got right
          now. Loads. Loads and loads.
          HANNA watches herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She
          licks the lipstick, puzzled. Almost a woman, but it doesn't
          look right on her.

                         HANNA
          It's like paint.

                         SOPHIE
          Don't lick it off.
          SOPHIE finishes HANNA's face, looks at her in the mirror.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          You're gorgeous.

          127 EXT. CAMPSITE. NIGHT. 127

          SOPHIE and HANNA sneak through the campsite together and move
          secretly between the parked cars. HANNA is dressed in some of
          SOPHIE's clothes and has the make-up on. They are excited,
          SOPHIE alive with the thrill of disobedience.

                         HANNA
          I can't walk in this.

                         SOPHIE
          You look hot.

                         HANNA
          Where are we going?

                         SOPHIE
          Shhhhh!
          HANNA uncomfortable with the situation.

                         HANNA
          I shouldn't take unnecessary risks.

                         SOPHIE
          Says who?
          SOPHIE heads off down the road.
          HANNA weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to
          catch up with SOPHIE.

          128 EXT. RAVE AT ROMAN AMPHITHEATRE. NIGHT. 128

          A loud out door rave in a Roman amphitheatre.
          SOPHIE and HANNA stand at the top of the amphitheatre looking
          down on the thrilling spectacle, soaking up the bass, the
          abstract sounds, the sheer volume, the pulsing lights and
          electric atmosphere - HANNA is thrilled and startled.
          Many of the crowd seem to be wearing fancy dress. HANNA
          stares at a girl dressed as a red ladybird.

                         CUT TO:
          The girls approach a bar and SOPHIE goes to order. She's
          forced to mime and shout her order over the music.

                         SOPHIE
          Vodka. Two.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          The bartender shakes his head and holds up two bottles of
          water.

                         BARTENDER
          Water only. No booze.
          Meanwhile HANNA spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY
          from the camp site shop, across the dance floor. He is
          staring at her again.
          SOPHIE comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to

          HANNA.

                         HANNA
          What do they call this music?

                         SOPHIE
          Banging.
          HANNA stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it -
          SOPHIE just grins, starts to move to the music.
          HANNA smiles awkwardly, tries to copy SOPHIE.

                         CUT TO:
          ISAACS enters the rave followed by two of his HENCHMEN. They
          split up and start to survey the crowd.
          Over in a secluded corner ISAACS sees a drug deal taking
          place.
          ISAACS sidles over to the DEALER and his PUNTER. The PUNTER,
          thinking ISAACS is probably a cop, makes a hasty getaway.

                         ISAACS
          What you got?

                         DEALER
          (in Spanish w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Nothing man. That guys just a
          friend.
          ISAACS frisks the DEALER, nothing. He turns the DEALER
          against the wall and checks his socks where he finds a stash
          of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white
          powder.
          ISAACS samples the powder and pockets the lot.

          DEALER (CONT'D)
          (in Spanish w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Hey, you're not police. What the
          fuck?
          ISAACS turns as he walks away and puts a finger to his lips.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         ISAACS
          Ssh.

                         CUT TO:
          Back near the bar HANNA and SOPHIE are approached by a couple
          of scrawny SPANISH BOYS in day-glow tops.

                         SPANISH BOY
          (in Spanish w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Where are you from?
          The girls just look at each other.

          SPANISH BOY (CONT'D)
          English? American? You like to
          party?
          They watch, puzzled, as SOPHIE smiles disinterestedly and
          leads HANNA away.

                         HANNA
          Will you teach me to do dancing?

                         SOPHIE
          It's easy.
          HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the dance floor and begin to
          dance.
          HANNA starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her
          arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a
          field. But soon her movements become more sophisticated and
          expressive.

                         CUT TO:
          ISAACS is searching through the crowd. He eyes the bodies
          around him greedily.
          He takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his
          gums.

                         CUT TO:
          Back on the dance floor, HANNA and SOPHIE are dancing.
          FELICIANO approaches through the crowd followed by a FRIEND.
          THEY start to circle HANNA and SOPHIE, dancing, insinuating
          their way in.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          He's after you.

                         HANNA
          How can you tell?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         SOPHIE
          Duh, look at the way he's looking
          at you. He's gorgeous.
          FELICIANO'S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he's not bad looking
          either.

          FELICIANO'S FRIEND
          What's your name?

                         SOPHIE
          Sophie.

          FELICIANO'S FRIEND
          Have you come here before?

                         SOPHIE
          All the time.

          FELICIANO'S FRIEND
          Really? You dance well.

                         SOPHIE
          So do you.
          HANNA and FELICIANO hold eye contact.
          The music rises and now they're lit only by the intermittent
          flashes of a strobe light.
          HANNA and FELICIANO begin to dance around each other, their
          movements caught in still flashes.

                         CUT TO:
          From some distance away ISAACS spots HANNA. He smiles and
          starts to move through the crowds towards her.

                         CUT TO:
          SOPHIE and the FRIEND are kissing. HANNA sees this and
          laughs.
          The crowd is jumping.
          HANNA feels FELICIANO'S hand take hers, she flinches a
          moment, then lets him draw her towards him. Their eyes still
          locked.
          ISAACS is getting closer, his eyes flashing eerily in the
          strobe lighting.
          HANNA and FELICIANO are in a world of their own.
          His fingers trace the lines of her arms, shoulders and neck.
          He draws her face towards his.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         HANNA
          Are we going to kiss now?

                         FELICIANO
          Would you like to?

                         HANNA
          Kissing requires a total of thirty-
          four facial muscles.
          Their lips are almost touching.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          The most important muscle involved
          is the orbicularis oris muscle,
          which is used to pucker the lips -
          He kisses her.
          HANNA closes her eyes.
          ISAACS moves in.
          FELICIANO becomes more ardent, puts his arms around her
          waist, she doesn't like it. He tries to open her mouth with
          his.
          HANNA snaps.
          In a few swift moves, HANNA pulls FELICIANO round and throws
          him to the ground. She falls to his side and, with one knee
          on his back, she holds his head, about to snap his neck.
          SOPHIE turns and sees them on the ground. A few of the
          closest DANCERS also stop dancing and stare.
          ISAACS backs off, watching from a safe distance.

                         SOPHIE
          Hanna! Holy crap...

                         FELICIANO
          Please, don't hurt me.

                         (TO SOPHIE)
          Please, tell your friend...
          HANNA looks up at SOPHIE. Now that she has FELICIANO on the
          ground she doesn't know what to do with him.

                         HANNA
          Should I let him go?

                         SOPHIE
          As opposed to what? Yes, you should
          let him go.
          HANNA leans in to whisper into FELICIANO'S ear.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         HANNA
          I'm going to go now.

                         FELICIANO
          Sure.

                         HANNA
          It was nice.
          And she's gone, pulling SOPHIE away through the crowd.
          ISAACS jumps into action. But he's lost sight of the girls
          among the mass of dancing bodies.
          HANNA and SOPHIE move quickly through the crowds towards the
          exit.

                         SOPHIE
          Oh, my God, Hanna. I thought you
          were going to kill him. Where d'you
          learn to do that?

                         HANNA
          My father taught me.
          They escape through a hole in the perimeter fence.

                         129 129

                         NIGHT
          An immaculately tidy lounge in a small apartment on the
          ground floor of a run down East Berlin housing project.
          A well-dressed woman in her 60's, KATRIN, is sitting alone
          listening to music on an old casette machine.
          The door buzzer rings. KATRIN gets up slowly and approaches
          the door.

                         KATRIN
          Who is it?
          No reply. KATRIN puts the safety chain across the door and
          opens it a small amount.

                         MARISSA
          Hello Katrin.
          KATRIN slams the door shut in fright and double locks it.
          Fear racing through her veins, she rushes her way through the
          lounge, knocking furniture as she goes.

          130 INT. KITCHEN. KATRIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 130

          KATRIN races to the kitchen door and bolts it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          Thinking the apartment is secure, she tries to catch her
          breath. But slowly she becomes aware of someone else's
          presence in the room.
          She turns to face the intruder... MARISSA standing, waiting
          patiently.

                         KATRIN
          You look different in pictures.

                         MARISSA
          Well here I am in the flesh.
          KATRIN'S mouth twitches with all the imagined conversations
          she's had with MARISSA.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Has Erik Heller contacted you?

                         KATRIN
          Erik's dead.
          MARISSA sits calmly in an old arm chair.

                         MARISSA
          Huh, if only.

                         KATRIN
          If he's alive why would he contact
          me?

                         MARISSA
          That depends on whether you believe
          he's innocent, or not.

                         KATRIN
          I'm an old woman with a broken

                         HEART -

                         MARISSA
          - What's in the past, stays in the
          past, right?

                         KATRIN
          Something like that.

                         MARISSA
          So why all the years of snooping
          around and sticking your nose in?

                         KATRIN
          You'd understand if you had kids.
          She turns her back on MARISSA.

                         MARISSA
          Kid's, they fuck you up, don't
          they?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.
          MARISSA stands up, puts a 9mm to the back KATRIN'S head and
          pulls the trigger.
          KATRIN drops to the floor revealing a framed, blood
          splattered, photograph of KATRIN ZADEK'S daughter - JOANNA.

          131 INT. TENT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. EARLY DAWN. 131

          HANNA and SOPHIE lie next to each other in sleeping bags with
          a torch between them.

                         SOPHIE
          Can't you sleep?

                         HANNA
          No.

                         SOPHIE
          Me neither.
          SOPHIE pauses. Looks at her.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          Hanna?

                         HANNA
          Yes?

                         SOPHIE
          Where do you really come from?

                         HANNA
          Leipzig, I live in Leipzig -
          SOPHIE looses her patience.

                         SOPHIE
          If we're going to be friends you
          have to be honest with me. Them's
          the rules.
          HANNA is taken aback.

                         HANNA
          Are we friends?

                         SOPHIE
          Yes. I like you.

                         HANNA
          I'd like to have a friend.

                         SOPHIE
          I mean you're a freak and
          everything, but I like you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         HANNA
          I like you too. I really do. But
          there are things I can't tell you.
          Do you understand?

                         SOPHIE
          Yes... Actually, no, I don't.

                         HANNA
          There are people that want to harm
          me. Bad people.

                         SOPHIE
          I see.

                         HANNA
          And they wont stop.

                         SOPHIE
          Right.

                         HANNA
          So for your own safety...
          HANNA looks into SOPHIE'S eyes.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Can we still be friends?

                         SOPHIE
          I don't know. I mean, I don't
          really know who you are. Do I?

                         HANNA
          That's just it. Neither do I.
          She reaches into her bag. Brings out the DNA report. Shows it
          to Sophie. They read. Interfering Sequence. Abnormal.

                         SOPHIE
          What is it?

                         HANNA
          I think it's about me. DNA is kind
          of how we're made I think. I mean
          who we are.
          They look at it.

                         SOPHIE
          What will you do?

                         HANNA
          I'm going to Berlin. I have to meet
          my father at the house of Wilhelm
          Grimm.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         SOPHIE
          As in âGrimm's Fairytalesâ?

                         HANNA
          That's right.
          SOPHIE sighs at HANNA.

                         SOPHIE
          If you say so.

                         HANNA
          Did I say the wrong thing again?
          SOPHIE looks at HANNA, sees she's vulnerable. She takes a
          bracelet off her own wrist. Gives it to her.

                         SOPHIE
          Keep this. To remember me.
          HANNA takes it, puts it on. Moved. Looks at SOPHIE.

          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
          It's a friendship bracelet.

                         HANNA
          Thank you.
          HANNA stares at the ceiling, looks over at SOPHIE who's
          starting to sleep. HANNA reaches out and touches her hair.
          Beside them, separated by a thin piece of fabric, we see that
          MILES has woken and has been listening in the darkness.

          132 INT. KATRIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 132

          MARISSA is searching the apartment. She's thorough and fast.
          She rips cushions and throws books from their shelves. Her
          actions become progressively more frantic, relishing the
          destruction. She finds more and more photograph's of JOANNA.
          The photographs seem to have a driving effect on her.
          She walks down the hall and opens a door onto a small spare
          bedroom that had been turned into home office. Every
          available wall space is covered in newspaper clippings and
          photographs relating JOANNA'S murder.
          On the floor MARISSA finds a box of old casette tapes. She
          stops to inspect one of the tapes. A label reads: âJoanna no.

          24'.

          133 INT. DANISH HOSTEL - MORNING. 133

          ERIK HELLER walks into a small, long-established family hotel
          on a Danish road near the coast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          He is in the slightly dated suit he wore when he left the
          forest and looks a little dishevelled and odd. A sixtyish
          Danish woman stands behind the counter, scrutinising him.
          They speak in Danish with English subtitles.

          ERIK (SIGHS, EXHAUSTED)
          I need a room.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Yes of course.

                         ERIK
          I stayed here fifteen years ago. It
          hasn't changed.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          We don't much like change here.

                         ERIK
          Neither do I.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Name?

                         ERIK
          Olsson. Peter Olsson.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          You have some post.
          She turns and retrieves HANNA'S POSTCARD from the mail rack
          and hands it to him.

                         ERIK
          Thank you.
          ERIK reads: âMission accomplishedâ

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Have you heard about the manhunt?
          A man has killed two coastguards.
          Everybody is being asked to keep an
          eye out.

                         ERIK
          For what exactly?

                         RECEPTIONIST
          I don't know.
          He smiles. She takes a closer look and notices goose fat
          smeared behind his ear.. and blood on a shirt cuff...

          134 INT. VAN/SPANISH CAMPSITE - MORNING 134

          The FAMILY have checked out and are leaving the campsite.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         HANNA
          How long until you drop me off?

                         RACHEL
          We should have you there by dinner
          time. From Lille you can get a
          train to Berlin. Leipzig's just a
          few hours further.
          HANNA and SOPHIE exchange a look.

          135 EXT. RECEPTION. SPANISH CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS 135

          The FAMILY van passes through the campsite gates to reveal
          ISAACS coming out of the reception hut.
          He sees the van, recognises it. He sees the kids in the back.
          Bingo. He runs to a black BMW where two of his HENCHMEN are
          waiting for him.

                         ISAACS
          Wake up. It's them.
          He jumps in the passenger seat whilst the driver revs the
          engine.
          The BMW pulls out in front of an oncoming truck narrowly
          avoiding a collision.

          136 INT. ISAACS' BMW - CONTINUOUS 136

          ISAACS holds onto the dash.

                         ISAACS
          Keep your distance.

          137 INT. DANISH HOSTEL - DAY 137

          The RECEPTIONIST picks up the phone and dials.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Is that the police? Yes, I don't
          want to trouble you but I have a
          new guest you may wish to know
          about.

          138 EXT. VESTERBROGADE STATION/COPENHAGEN. DAY. 138

          A commuter train pulls into the vast station. Amongst the
          morning commuters alighting the train is ERIK HELLER. He
          looks furtively around, and tries to blend in with the crowd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          POV - from a walkway above the station - someone is watching
          HELLER as he tries to conceal himself within the throng. A
          DANISH AGENT, hidden on a metal walkway above the platform.
          On the platform HELLER walks amongst the commuters, past the
          ticket collectors, past another DANISH AGENT posing as a
          commuter - he stops and lingers by him, noting something not
          right.
          He moves off and enters a small bar.
          The second AGENT immediately follows and from the walkway,
          the other rushes downstairs to give chase too.
          HELLER walks through the bar into the toilets, finds a FIRE
          EXIT and walks out through it.

          139 EXT. GOODS YARD/VESTERBROGADE STATION - DAY 139

          HELLER finds himself in a goods yard adjoining the train
          station. He walks through the goods yard, then suddenly, and
          apparently for no reason, stops dead, then throws himself
          behind a skip of empty bottles.
          As he does two new men, AMERICAN SPECIAL OPS, run round the
          corner into the goods yard.
          From the fire exit, the DANISH AGENTS EMERGE and after
          signalling to each other, head off to the perimeter.
          The various agents scour the yard. The SPECIAL OPS get closer
          to HELLER's hiding place. HELLER suddenly emerges from his
          hiding place and sticks an elbow in the face of one, a knee
          in the groin of another.
          There's a brief exchange of blows.
          One of the SPECIAL OPS draws his hand gun.
          HELLER produces a knife out of nowhere and launches at the
          man, cutting him on the hand, making him drop his gun.
          He stabs the other in the eye and the man falls to the ground
          squealing.
          HELLER leans in and takes from the man's pocket his

          CELLPHONE.
          HELLER makes a run for it. One of the SPECIAL OPS lets off a
          shot, the bullet clipping HELLER in the leg.
          He falters but limps off behind the towering containers.

          140 EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY 140

          The FAMILY van is making its way up through France.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          Following in the black BMW, a few cars behind, ISAACS and his
          HENCHMEN are biding their time.

          141 INT. VAN/FRENCH ROAD - EVENING 141

          RACHEL is driving, while HANNA rides in the front seat
          keeping her entertained.

                         HANNA
          ...they can live at freezing
          temperatures for up to nine months
          without food. Imagine that, nine
          months.

                         RACHEL
          Why do you know so much about
          fleas?

                         HANNA
          I read it in my Encyclopaedia.
          HANNA is looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW
          and frowns, she's seen it before.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Also, they can jump around 200
          times their own body length, which
          makes them the best jumpers of all
          known animals except for the
          froghopper. Now they can really
          jump.
          RACHEL makes a turn and HANNA checks the side view mirror
          again. Yes, the BMW is still there. HANNA becomes anxious.

                         RACHEL
          Everything all right?

                         HANNA
          I think so.
          But HANNA'S face betrays her concern.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          Mama, I know you're disappointed in
          me, I know it. I'm so sorry, Mama.
          But I have found maybe a way to
          make it better...

          142 INT. HOTEL SUITE. COPENHAGEN - NIGHT 142

          CLOSE ON - a portable casette machine playing one of the
          tapes MARISSA discovered at KATRIN ZADEK'S.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          I'm in a program now... a program
          to make babies stronger.
          In an adjoining bathroom MARISSA, in a pair of cotton
          pyjamas, is brushing her teeth. Her lips pulled back in a
          snarl.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          An American program. It's very
          scientific. Important scientific
          work.
          Still brushing MARISSA walks through to the tape machine and
          presses fast forward. Then play -

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          Erik says he can get these tapes to

                         YOU -

                         MARISSA

                         (MUTTERS)
          Bastard.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          - He says I look beautiful. I don't
          feel beautiful...
          MARISSA doesn't care, fast forwards. Play -

          JOHANNA (V.O.)
          ...I'm not sure if it's true that
          the baby can hear, but at night I
          sing. I hope it hears me.
          MARISSA listens, for some unknown reason to MARISSA this
          catches her imagination.
          The phone rings.

                         MARISSA
          What?

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Frau Wiegler, this is reception. I
          have one Erik Heller for you.
          MARISSA stops dead.

                         MARISSA
          Put him on.

          ERIK (O.S.)
          You were supposed to be dead.

                         MARISSA
          So were you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          143 EXT. PARK. COPENHAGEN - NIGHT 143

          A phone booth in a city park. ERIK shivering in the cold as
          icy rain falls around him, he's holding the CELLPHONE he
          stole from the dead SPECIAL OPS. HELLER'S leg is bleeding
          profusely.

                         ERIK
          Well, here we are.

                         MARISSA
          How did you know I was here?

                         ERIK
          I killed one of your men. Got his
          cellphone. You've gotten soft.

          MARISSA (O.S.)
          No, I just grew up. The world's
          changed since you died.

                         ERIK
          You got kids?

          144 INT. HOTEL SUITE. COPENHAGEN - CONTINUOUS 144

          MARISSA stops, taken aback by the question.

                         MARISSA
          No, I made choices.

                         ERIK
          Hanna's practically yours, you
          know?
          This goes straight to an ache that's been building in

          MARISSA.

                         MARISSA
          Not interested.
          But she is.

                         ERIK
          She's true and good and funny.
          Yeah, she's funny. She's special.
          You should see her.

                         MARISSA
          I'm looking forward to it.

                         ERIK
          You'll have to catch her first.
          The line goes dead. MARISSA puts the phone down and sits
          quietly for a moment. Then presses play again on the tape
          machine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          Was it like this for you, Mama? I
          think I know what the baby looks
          like. I think it's a girl -- I hope
          so.

          145 EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD - NIGHT 145

          The FAMILY'S van drives - behind ISAACS BMW tails it, lights
          on high beam.

          JOANNA (V.O.)
          I wonder who she'll be? I hope
          she's smart. I hope she's a
          stronger person than I am.

          146 INT. VAN - NIGHT 146

          HANNA sits beside her in the passenger seat, her anxiety
          growing.
          RACHEL is still at the wheel, watching the bright headlights
          behind.

                         RACHEL
          Shit. Shit, shit, shit. I think
          we're lost, Hanna.
          HANNA checks the side view mirror again and sees ISAACS BMW.
          She's knows that whoever is driving that car is after her.
          She looks back and sees SEB, SOPHIE and MILES all comfortably
          asleep. MILES' fingers wrapped around a Transformers toy.

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          I'm going to pull over.

                         HANNA
          No, don't.

                         RACHEL
          I need to check the map.

          147 EXT/INT. CAR/CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 147

          The van slowly pulls in at the side of the road.
          RACHEL waits for the BMW behind to pass but instead it pulls
          in behind the van.
          On either side of the road is an enormous container park. The
          containers are piled on top of each other like a giant baby's
          building blocks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         RACHEL
          Why won't that car pass? He has his
          lights on high beam, I was doing
          everything I could to get out of
          the way...
          SOPHIE wakes up in the back.

                         SOPHIE
          Are we stopped? I need to pee.

                         RACHEL
          Well, I don't want you going too
          far right now.

                         HANNA
          I think you should stay where you
          are, Sophie.
          HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the
          silhouettes of ISAACS and his MEN. They don't move and
          neither does HANNA. Both are waiting for the other to make
          the first move.

                         RACHEL
          Hanna, what's going on. Seb wake
          up.

                         HANNA
          Please.

                         SOPHIE
          This is creepy. You're creeping me
          out.

                         SEB

                         (GROGGY)
          Are we in Lille?

                         HANNA
          I'm sorry. But you really mustn't
          get out of the van.
          HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close to

          SOPHIE.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          What ever you do, don't follow me.
          Promise not to follow me.

                         SOPHIE
          I promise.

                         RACHEL
          Hanna, tell me what's going on or
          Seb will go over to that car and
          find out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         SEB
          Like fuck I will. Everyone stay
          put. Where's my phone?

                         HANNA

                         (TO SOPHIE)
          Thank you for being my friend.
          HANNA looks back at the BMW. All at once all four of the car
          doors open.
          In a flash, HANNA pulls open the van's side door and bolts
          from the van.

                         RACHEL
          Hanna!
          RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the HENCHMEN chase after HANNA.
          The SECOND HENCHMAN appears at her drivers window aiming his
          gun at her head. RACHEL screams.

          148 EXT. CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 148

          HANNA sprints across hard tarmac heading for the relative
          safety of the container park.
          ISAACS and his HENCHMAN follow at speed.
          HANNA enters a dark gully between two enormous containers.
          ISAACS slips around the other side to block her off. He
          signals to the HENCHMAN to loop around and flank HANNA.
          HANNA moves quietly between the containers, turning this way
          and that.
          ISAACS voice comes echoing through the maze.

          ISAACS (O.S.)
          Don't be a silly girl, Hanna. You
          need to come with me now. I know
          where your papa is.
          She listens.

                         CUT TO:
          ISAACS, his gun in hand, calls out again.

          ISAACS (CONT'D)
          He wants to talk to you, Hanna. He
          misses you.

                         CUT TO:
          The HENCHMAN appears directly behind HANNA. HANNA double-
          kicks him in the chest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          HANNA pulls herself up the side of the containers and
          scrambles on top of them and runs, jumping between the
          containers when she reaches a gap.
          The HENCHMAN appears having climbed up too.
          A chase ensues. HANNA, followed by the HENCHMAN climbing up
          higher, now four containers high.
          ISAACS follow below.
          HANNA jumps an enormous gap between two containers and right
          over the head of ISAACS.
          HANNA slips and tumbles but catches the edge of one of the
          containers on her way down. She hangs there a moment, then
          pushes herself off the side of the container and manages to
          land on a lower container on the other side.
          HANNA running across the tops of the containers sees the
          HENCHMAN appear at the far edge. She grabs a discarded wrench
          and throws it at the man, catching him in the side of the
          head - a perfect aim - and he tumbles to the ground.
          She descends the containers with nimble leaps and comes to
          the ground.
          She's running now through a maze of tight alleys between the
          containers. She stops at a âT' junction, unsure which way to
          go. Suddenly ISAACS appears at the end of one alley, HENCHMAN
          ONE at the end of another, and HENCHMAN TWO at the end of the
          third.
          She's trapped.

          ISAACS (CONT'D)
          Just take it easy.
          HANNA makes her decision and runs straight at ISAACS.
          He stretches out his arms in an attempt to catch her.
          She hits him like a bowling ball hitting the last pin and he
          crashes to the ground.
          She rolls and springs to her feet.
          The HENCHMEN follow but HANNA is too quick.

          149 EXT. SCRAP METAL YARD/CANAL - NIGHT 149

          HANNA sprints full tilt out of the container park and through
          a scrap metal yard. Either side of her rise mountains of
          waste.
          HANNA reaches the edge of an industrial canal from where the
          scrap metal is unloaded.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          A large industrial barge is passing beneath. HANNA jumps and
          lands on the moving barge. Then quickly takes cover under a
          tarpaulin.

          150 INT. HOLDING CELLS. DAWN 150

          Four holding cells in a row, each one holding a member of the
          family.
          SEB paces around his cell. RACHEL sits stoically in hers.
          SOPHIE is crying in her cell while MILES is playing with his
          Nintendo in his cell.
          MARISSA walks into SOPHIE'S cell.

                         MARISSA
          Would you please stop crying?

                         SOPHIE
          I'm not telling you anything.

                         MARISSA
          Honey, your friend is in a lot of
          danger. You need to help us find
          her.

                         SOPHIE
          I don't know where to find her!
          MARISSA grits her teeth, shows SOPHIE a photo of FELICIANO.

                         MARISSA
          Do you know him?

                         SOPHIE
          No.

                         MARISSA
          He knows you.

                         CUT TO:
          MARISSA now in RACHEL'S cell.

                         RACHEL
          We gave her a ride because we
          thought she was in trouble.

                         MARISSA
          But you knew she didn't have a
          passport. You smuggled her into
          port and helped her illegally gain

                         ENTRY -

                         RACHEL
          She said she lived in Leipzig. She
          went to the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         MARISSA
          There is no Klaus Kohle Gymnasium.
          It closed five years ago.
          Shock on Rachel's face.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Did she give any idea of where she
          was going?
          Rachel wracks her brains.

                         RACHEL
          She said she was going home, to
          Leipzig. She seemed lost. Like she
          needed taking care of.
          (woman to woman)
          You understand.
          MARISSA shows her the photograph of JOANNA ZADEK.

                         MARISSA
          This was Hanna's mother, Joanna
          Zadek. Fifteen years ago Hanna's
          father shot her to death on a
          camping holiday by the Baltic.
          RACHEL swallows, goes pale.

                         CUT TO:
          MARISSA now in SEB'S cell.

                         SEB
          She was odd. I'll give you that.
          Disconnected. I mean I get on with
          most kids, you know, have a
          rapport. But, this one -

                         MARISSA
          You know, Mr Lyall, it's days like
          these that I really hate my job.

                         SEB
          I'm sure you do.

                         MARISSA
          It's a very, very difficult thing
          to do.

                         SEB
          Absolutely.

                         MARISSA
          But sometimes children are bad
          people too.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          MARISSA in MILES'S cell. MILES is terrified of MARISSA. She
          puts her hand out and strokes his hair.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I'm not going to hurt you.
          MILES shrinks from her touch.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Miles is a nice name. Are you a
          nice boy?
          She strokes MILES' hair and immediately he starts crying
          loudly.
          SEB pounds on the wall from his cell.

                         SEB
          Hey what's going on in there? We
          don't have to put up with this!
          We're in the EU, Goddammit!

          151 EXT. BARGE. RURAL FRANCE INTO GERMANY. DAWN 151

          HANNA watches as the sun rises over the misty fields either
          side be the canal. It's a beautiful sight. HANNA is strangely
          peaceful.

          152 INT. HOLDING CELLS. DAWN 152

          Now the whole family are reunited in MILES' cell. He sniffs
          and plays with his Nintendo. The others look wan as MARISSA
          passes around a photo of the two dead DANISH POLICEMEN. The
          family go silent.

                         MARISSA
          Three days ago Hanna's father
          killed two Danish policemen on a
          beach with a hunting knife.

                         SEB
          Where is he now?

                         MARISSA
          He's still at large and he's still
          very dangerous. We need to find
          Hanna before he does.
          Pause. SOPHIE thinks about it but clams up. Marissa notices.

                         MARISSA (CONT'D)
          If you know anything at all, it's
          vital you tell us for her own
          safety. We are now very worried
          about her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          But SOPHIE doesn't say a word.

                         RACHEL
          Sophie?
          Still nothing. They all look at her. MILES suddenly speaks.

                         MILES
          She's going to Berlin. To Wilhelm
          Grimm's house.

          SOPHIE (TO MILES)
          You little bastard!

                         RACHEL
          How did you know that?

                         SOPHIE
          You fuckwad!
          SOPHIE slaps MILES over the back of the head but SEB pushes
          her back.

                         SEB
          Hey hey hey! Sophie for God's sake.

          153 EXT. BERLIN CANALS - DAY 153

          HANNA'S sits on the prow of the barge as it makes it's slow
          progress into Berlin.

          154 INT/EXT. CAR/STREET - DAY 154

          MARISSA looks out at a school playground as she waits in the
          back of her car.
          The passenger door next to her opens and ISAACS gets in.

                         ISAACS
          I've looked through Heller's
          contacts from the 1980's. There's
          no one called Wilhelm.

                         MARISSA
          Wilhelm Grimm wrote fairy-tales. He
          died two hundred years ago.
          MARISSA hands ISAACS a brown envelope containing one of the
          photographs she took from KATRIN'S apartment.
          The photograph shows a happy looking JOANNA and ERIK at a
          busy family amusement park. Between ERIK and JOANNA is a
          clown, his arms around both of them. This we will come to
          understand is KLAUS KNEPFLER. Behind them is a GRIMM'S

          BROTHERS HOUSE OF FUN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         ISAACS
          What the hell is this?
          MARISSA smiles slightly.

                         MARISSA
          Wilhelm's house.
          (to the DRIVER)
          Drive on.

          155 EXT. BERLIN STREETS - DAY 155

          HANNA wanders through the skyscrapers and glass constructions
          of Berlin.
          People swarm around her but pay her no mind.

          156 INT. TRAM - DAY 156

          HANNA is riding a tram to the outskirts of town.

          157 EXT. ABANDONNED AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY 157

          HANNA walks beside a wire mesh fence that separates her from
          an abandoned amusement park. Behind her is an enormous steel
          works from which great industrial plumes of steam rise.
          HANNA climbs under the fence and walks through this surreal
          playground long since reclaimed by nature. There are huge
          fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and
          abandoned dinosaur legs. Rising above the park, surrounded by
          a muddy moat, is the big wheel now standing at a vertiginous
          angle. In front of the big wheel is the WILHELM GRIMM HOUSE.
          The house is a Grimm Brothers fairytale theme âFun House'.
          It's windows long since shuttered, vines growing through its
          roof.
          HANNA stands in front of the house in deep anticipation. She
          walks up the small steps that lead to the front door and
          knocks. She waits, heart sinking at the thought of there
          being no-one home. Then, ever so slightly the door opens and
          peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of
          work clown.

                         KNEPFLER
          Excuse me young lady?
          It is the man from the photo, but twenty years older. Small,
          with a wiry intensity.

                         HANNA
          Are you Wilhelm Grimm?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         KNEPFLER
          Not exactly, but it'll do for now.
          Come this way.
          He leads her inside.

          158 INT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 158

          They come inside - it's old and full of hoarded junk,
          antiques, boxes, books, dusty china, lamps, figurines, but
          still functional - an old man's home. He stops to look at
          her.

                         KNEPFLER
          So you are Hanna.
          He puts out his hand to shake.

          KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
          It's very nice to meet you, Hanna.
          HANNA smiles and shakes his hand, she likes him already.
          KNEPFLER studies her, quietly moved by his memories.

          KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
          My real name is Knepfler. Herr
          Knepfler. I'm an old friend of your
          father's. I am a sort of
          âcaretakerâ here.

                         HANNA
          What happened to it?

                         KNEPFLER
          No car park. You need a car park
          these days, otherwise people wont
          come. But somebody has to watch
          over it...

                         HANNA
          It's beautiful.

                         KNEPFLER
          I like it too. Erik used to come
          here a great deal.

                         HANNA
          Have you heard from him?
          He nods.

                         KNEPFLER
          You must wait. He will be here
          soon.
          HANNA stares, not quite believing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          HANNA stares out the window, thinking all this through.
          KNEPFLER leads HANNA through a reception area and under a
          spider with a human face that straddles a door to a run down
          kitchen.

          159 INT. KITCHEN. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 159

          HANNA follows KNEPFLER into the kitchen.

                         KNEPFLER
          Please, sit down.
          HANNA sits at the old kitchen table on a wooden bench, while
          KNEPFLER goes to the stove.

          KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
          Would you like an egg? They're
          fresh.

                         HANNA
          Please.
          HANNA takes an egg, breaks it and swallows it raw.
          KNEPFLER smiles. He gives her a buff envelope. She looks
          inside - some money, a passport, ID cards.

                         KNEPFLER
          You'll need a fresh photograph.
          Don't get it wet.
          HANNA looks at the passport with a new name - ANNA-MARIE
          ELKAN. She takes a deep breath, not really comprehending.

                         HANNA
          I don't really understand.

                         KNEPFLER
          ID. Identity. It tells people who
          you are.
          She stares at the passport with the blank space for her
          photo.

          KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
          There is an apartment ready for you
          in the south. Erik will come and
          the car will take you there today.
          You will live there now.

                         HANNA
          Do I have to?

                         KNEPFLER
          Don't you want to?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         HANNA
          I don't know. I miss the forest. I
          miss my home.

                         KNEPFLER
          That's to be expected. But the city
          is so exciting, don't you think?

                         HANNA
          I suppose.
          She drinks her water, thinking.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Did you know my mother?

                         KNEPFLER
          I did.

                         HANNA
          What was she like?

                         KNEPFLER
          She was very gentle, she was very
          funny, very talented - a singer -
          did you know that?

                         HANNA
          Yes...

                         KNEPFLER
          She had your eyes.
          He smiles at her.
          She here's a noise outside and runs to look out the window.
          She sees ISAACS BMW pull up outside the house followed by a
          second car.

                         HANNA
          It's him.

                         KNEPFLER
          Quick.
          KNEPFLER leads HANNA out of the kitchen.

          160 EXT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 160

          The driver of the second car gets out and opens the back door
          for MARISSA. She gets out and looks up at the house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

          161 INT. RECEPTION. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 161

          KNEPFLER points HANNA towards a set of stairs that lead up
          from the reception.

                         KNEPFLER
          Upstairs.
          There's a knock at the door.
          HANNA begins to climb the stairs while KNEPFLER approaches
          the front door.
          There's another knock at the door.

          162 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 162

          HANNA enters a room that's been designed to look like
          Grandma's bedroom from Little Red Riding Hood.
          HANNA hurriedly slides under the bed. Breathing as quietly as
          she can.
          She can hear the sound of ISAAC'S MEN starting to spread
          through the house.

          KNEPFLER (O.O.V)
          Listen to me, listen. There is no
          one here. There is nobody up
          there...

          MARISSA (O.C.)
          Check the attic.
          Footsteps to the attic.

          163 INT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE/STARS - DAY 163

          MARISSA has KNEPFLER cornered on the stairs.

                         MARISSA
          Erik Heller? Do you know him?

                         KNEPFLER
          I have never heard of him.

                         MARISSA
          Really?
          MARISSA shows him the photograph of JOANNA, ERIK and KNEPFLER
          outside the house.

                         KNEPFLER
          I don't know these people.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         MARISSA
          Think very carefully
          He shrugs and MARISSA grabs KNEPFLER by the throat. He speaks
          in gasps.

                         KNEPFLER
          He called me. She's coming soon. To
          meet him.

                         MARISSA
          When?

                         KNEPFLER
          Tomorrow! Tomorrow morning.
          MARISSA lets him go. She turns to ISAACS.

                         MARISSA
          Take him in there. Find out what he
          knows.

          164 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 164

          The sound of KNEPFLER being escorted into a next-door room,
          the door shutting. The sound of footsteps coming into the
          room. HANNA silent under the bed. MARISSA'S GREEN SHOES are
          in sight, nothing else.
          The green shoes come close and HANNA feels the mattress
          compress as MARISSA sits on the bed. She looks at the shoes
          as she hears her call.

                         MARISSA
          Lewis. It's Marissa.
          HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she
          had killed. Her face pale in shock and fear.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          You got anything? He's coming here.
          I can smell it. Double the men.
          But, Lewis, I want to talk to him.
          HANNA hears MARISSA hang. Another pair of shoes enter the
          room. Male. ISAACS.

                         ISAACS
          His name's Klaus Knepfler. He used
          to send Heller's things from Berlin
          before the Communists were kicked
          out of Prague.

                         MARISSA
          How much does he know about the
          programme?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         ISAACS
          Everything. He knew Johanna.

                         MARISSA
          What does he know about the child?

                         ISAACS
          He also thinks Erik's the father.

                         MARISSA
          Well that's good.

                         ISAACS
          Everybody thinks Erik's her father.
          Erik probably thinks he's her
          father.
          They snigger. HANNA's eyes widen in shock. She can barely
          control her breath.

                         MARISSA
          Crazy bastard. You got a fix on him
          yet?

                         ISAACS
          Let's see what else Knepfler has to
          offer.
          He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she
          hear an intake of breath? She turns and quickly looks under
          the bed. No one there. Her imagination maybe.
          MARISSA stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door.
          They reach the door. HANNA, clinging to the bedsprings in mid-
          air, not breathing. The green shoes leave. HANNA breathes.
          Hurriedly she climbs out from under the bed and goes to a
          window.

          165 EXT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 165

          HANNA lands having jumped from the window.
          She looks around quickly. Then, out of sight from the cars at
          the front of the house, she runs for dear life.

          166 EXT. BERLIN STREET - DAY 166

          HANNA walking fast, in total shock and confusion. Who is she?
          She walks head down, determined not to be seen. Not knowing
          where she is going. Her world turned upside down. She sees an
          internet cafe. Ducks into it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

          167 INT. INTERNET CAFE. BERLIN - DAY 167

          HANNA sits down at a computer. The young OWNER comes up to
          her.

                         OWNER
          Excuse me. You have to pay first.

                         HANNA
          How much?

                         OWNER
          3 Euros for half an hour.
          She looks at the money that Knepfler gave her. It contains
          Euros. She hands some over to the OWNER.

                         HANNA
          How does it work?

                         OWNER
          You've never used the internet?

                         HANNA
          No.
          He smiles in amazement and logs on for her. The owner brings
          up a search engine.

                         OWNER
          Just type whatever it is you're
          looking for here.
          He walks away and HANNA slowly starts to type. She types in

          DNA INTERFERING SEQUENCE.

          168 EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK/WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 168

          ERIK HELLER limps, head bowed, through the Amusement Park.
          He suddenly stops dead and ducks behind a fallen fibreglass
          dinosaur as he sees two CIA AGENTS sitting in a car outside
          the house.
          HELLER watches for a moment or two.
          Then, keeping low, he makes a painful run towards the house.
          HELLER throws himself against the back wall of the kitchen.
          He breathes heavily for a moment, clutching his wounded leg.
          He turns and rises to look through the kitchen window.
          Inside he sees KNEPFLER, stripped to the waist his body
          bloodied, hanging upside down from a meat hook. He's
          obviously dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          HELLER crouches back down against the wall, thinking
          furiously. Then, decision made, he checks sight lines and
          runs back across the Amusement Park away from the house.

          169 INT. INTERNET CAFE. BERLIN - DAY 169

          HANNA sits at the computer, looking at the screen breathless
          with tension.
          Phrases from the text leap out at her. âAn interfering
          sequence within the DNAâ , âintervention to the mother's
          uterus during pregnancy.â
          HANNA stands in shock. She reads again. âIntervention to the
          mother's uterusâ
          HANNA deletes the page. Sits in shock. Then writes in her
          mother's name. JOHANNA ZADEK.
          Immediately the article about JOHANNA's death comes up. HANNA
          stares at it. She reads it. No mention of a child. There is
          an address for Johanna Zadek. She came from the Heizinger
          Buildings area in the suburbs of East Berlin. HANNA writes it
          down. Gets up and leaves.

          170 INT. TAXI. EAST BERLIN SUBURB - DAY 170

          HANNA sits in the back of a taxi as it takes her into a grim
          concrete jungle of old East German housing projects.
          HANNA looks at the thousands of tiny windows, so many lives
          being lived in unawareness. Is this normality? Is this the
          world she longed to be a part of?

          171 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM'S HOUSE. BERLIN - DAY 171

           MARISSA and ISAACS wait in Grandma's Room. ISAAC's phone
          rings.

                          ISAACS
          Isaacs.
          He listens. Puts the phone down.

          ISAACS (CONT'D)
          A public computer at a Berlin
          internet cafe just did a web search
          for âDNA Interfering Sequenceâ.

                         MARISSA
          Hanna?

                         ISAACS
          Next they searched the name Johanna
          Zadek.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          MARISSA stops dead. Looks at ISAACS.

                         MARISSA
          She's not coming here.

          172 EXT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT BLOCK. EAST BERLIN HOUSING 172


          PROJECTS - DAY
          HANNA gets out of the taxi and looks up at an enormous grey
          housing block - the Heizinger building.
          She approaches the entrance and looks on all the buzzers.
          Sees a name scrawled on one - Number 14. Zadek.
          She presses the buzzer. Waits. No answer.
          A GANG OF KURDISH YOUTHS come out the block and HANNA catches
          the door and enters.

          173 INT. HALL. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY 173

          HANNA knocks at the door of number 14, waits, knocks again,
          louder. No reply.
          A door further along opens. Kurdish music pours out. A
          KURDISH WOMAN wrapped in shawls emerges pushing a pram. She's
          followed by her two other CHILDREN.

                         HANNA
          (In German w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          Excuse me. I'm looking for Joanna
          Zadek's house. Can you help?
          The KURDISH WOMAN wont look HANNA in the eye as she passes.
          She mutters her response.

                         KURDISH WOMAN
          (In Kurdish w/ English

                         SUBTITLES)
          I don't speak German.
          HANNA kicks at the door but knows it won't be answered so
          doesn't wait.

          174 EXT/INT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT. EAST BERLIN HOUSING 174


          PROJECT - DAY
          HANNA walks round to the back door of the apartment and
          approaches the kitchen window. She peers through.
          On first inspection the kitchen seems undisturbed. Then HANNA
          sees the framed photograph of JOANNA on the wall. Blood
          splattered across the glass.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          HANNA quickly moves to the door, tries to force it. She looks
          around, no-one's coming. With a sharp kick she smashes the
          glass.

          175 INT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT - DAY 175

          HANNA climbs through the broken glass into the kitchen. The
          air is thick with the buzz of Bluebottle flies.
          HANNA sees the photograph of JOANNA. With some trepidation
          she moves round the kitchen table and sees the body of KATRIN
          ZADEK. The back of KATRIN'S head is blown clean away. The
          flies have laid their eggs in the bloody mess of her brain
          that spreads across the cheap lino floor.
          HANNA steps back and gags.
          She backs out of the kitchen and into the hall. Turns and
          goes through into the lounge.
          The lounge has been over thrown. Cushions ripped, shelving
          pulled down. HANNA stares at the destruction wrought by
          MARISSA'S hunt for information.
          HANNA turns, walks back down the hall and passes a door to a
          tiny second bedroom. She stops and enters.
          The room had been turned into a home office, there are
          newspaper clippings relating to JOANNA'S MURDER and
          photographs of JOANNA herself covering every available wall
          space. A testament to KATRIN'S unremitting search for the
          truth behind her daughters murder.
          HANNA begins to search the room for clues. Anything that will
          help her understand who she is and where she came from.
          Then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice.

          ERIK (V.O.)
          You won't find anything.
          HANNA turns in shock.

                         ERIK
          Marissa would have been much too
          careful for that.
          HANNA stares at him. ERIK HELLER.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Sit down Hanna.

                         HANNA
          Are you my father?

                         ERIK
          Sit down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         HANNA
          Are you my father?

                         ERIK
          Please.

                         HANNA
          Are you?
          Moment of electric silence between them. ERIK does nothing
          but she knows the answer is no.

                         ERIK
          I was going to tell you.
          HANNA sinks to the floor. Breathing fast.

                         HANNA
          What's wrong with me?
          ERIK flinches slightly.

                         ERIK
          Nothing.

                         HANNA
          Where was I born?
          ERIK knows he has to tell the truth.

                         ERIK
          At Galinka.

                         HANNA
          What's that?

                         ERIK
          It was a secret CIA research
          programme in rural Poland.

                         HANNA
          What kind of research?

                         ERIK
          Children.
          HANNA stares at ERIK.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          It was run by Marissa Wiegler. The
          science came from the old East
          Germany. The money from the CIA.
          The intention was to explore
          whether small genetic changes could
          be made to embryos... to improve

                         THEM

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          HANNA CONT'D)
          Improve?
          ERIK looks at her. She looks so young, so numb, so lost.

                         ERIK
          Reduce capacity for fear. For pity.
          Increase muscle strength. Heighten
          senses. Anything that might make a
          better soldier.
          HANNA looks up, stares at him. It's her he's talking about.

                         HANNA
          How did you know about it?
          ERIK's stares right at her.

                         ERIK
          I worked for it.
          She stares at him. He hands her a piece of paper from his
          pocket.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          This is what you were looking for.
          HANNA reads. It is an invitation to Johanna Zadek to
          participate in the Galinka project. A projected date of
          arrival at the Galinka Centre. A date - 23rd February 1995.
          An agreed fee to be paid to Johanna. Five hundred American
          dollars. An agreement to give up the child and have no legal
          claim over it. The letter is signed by Erik Heller.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          I recruited your mother at an
          abortion clinic in May 1994. She
          was about to terminate an unwanted
          pregnancy. Some boy at a disco.
          HANNA looks at the paper in shock.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          I had recruited twenty women. She
          was the last. She was different.
          Two years later I heard the
          programme was to be terminated. The
          research âdisposed ofâ.

                         HANNA
          Disposed of?

                         ERIK
          I tried to save all of you. But you
          were the only one I was able to
          rescue.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          HANNA stands in shock. She reaches to the window of the room
          to get some air. She is reeling - faint.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Hanna listen to me.

                         HANNA
          Keep away from me.
          ERIK approaches her. With real conviction.

                         ERIK
          It worked. You worked.

                         HANNA
          You mean I'm a killer?

                         ERIK
          No... no..
          He makes to touch her. HANNA springs back in violent
          repulsion.

                         HANNA
          Don't touch me.

                         ERIK
          We have a new identity for you. A
          new life. A new beginning.
          She stares at him, then pushes past him. ERIK stops, pushes
          her back but then HANNA grabs a sharp letter opener.

          ERIK (CONT'D)
          Don't.
          She attacks, ERIK pushes her to one side, grabs her. A fight
          in the apartment. Chaos, photos of Johanna crashing, lamps
          and bookshelves falling. HANNA murderous, ERIK just defending
          himself, not willing to hurt her. But then she overpowers
          him, has a knife to his throat.

                         HANNA
          Let me go.
          He releases her. She goes to the door.

                         ERIK
          I tried to prepare you for what
          your life would be.

                         HANNA
          You didn't prepare me for this.
          And her look is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK
          knows he has done a terrible wrong. She starts to leave down
          the fire escape. ERIK calls after her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         ERIK
          Hanna wait.
          He looks out to watch her go. It's then ERIK sees the cars
          coming across the estate scrubland.
          ERIK turns in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, runs
          through the destroyed living room, and out through the front
          door.

                         176 176

                         DAY
          ERIK comes out of the main entrance and runs into full view
          of the cars, deliberately distracting them from HANNA.

          177 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. CONT. 177

          MARISSA's car is a about to turn the corner and bump straight
          into HANNA when suddenly...
          MARISSA sees ERIK leaving the front of the apartment block.
          She speaks to ISAACS.

                         MARISSA
          That's him.
          And the car swerves to follow him. Thus moving unknowingly
          away from the slight figure of HANNA. HANNA can see the cars
          in full chase of Erik Heller. He has distracted them.

          178 EXT. STREET. EAST BERLIN. 178

          HELLER sprints fast across the wasteland. Incredible
          athleticism. He dives down a side alley, losing his pursuers
          for a second. Takes out a gun, looking for Marissa. Looking
          to finish it off.
          Just as he has done this ISAACS' HENCHMAN approach from the
          end of the street. HELLER fires in their direction, starts to
          run down an alley. He vaults a dividing wall, scratching
          himself on barbed wire. He sprints round a corner and sees a
          doorway ahead of him. He walks towards the doorway.

          MARISSA (O.C.)
          Drop it.
          MARISSA steps out of the doorway, her gun trained on him.
          There are men at the end of the alleyway. No escape. HELLER
          drops his gun.
          Silence between them. He turns to look her in the eye.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         ERIK
          So go ahead.
          She stares at him. Wants to make this as painful as she can
          for him.

                         MARISSA
          You know I'll find her.

                         ERIK
          Don't under estimate what you
          created.

                         MARISSA
          What we created, together.

          179 EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS 179

          HANNA is walking fast across the grim grey estate to a main
          road.

          180 EXT. STREET. EAST BERLIN - CONTINUOUS 180

          MARISSA with her gun still at ERIK.

                         MARISSA
          Truth is I was always very fond of
          you.

          181 EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS 181

          CLOSE ON - HANNA continuing to walk away.
          She hears a single gun shot. Stops dead. Knows what it means.
          An intense conflict of emotions inside her. Her breathing
          stops for a moment, her world seems to go silent.
          Then a car flies by on the main road, almost running her
          over, and she is woken. She sees a bus stop ahead. On auto-
          pilot she runs to it, a bus coming, she beckons. It stops and
          she is on board.

          182 EXT. WASTELAND. EAST BERLIN. 182

          MARISSA stands over the dead body of ERIK HELLER.

                         MARISSA
          Leave him here.
          And they all walk away leaving him alone in the East Berlin
          dirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          183 INT. BUS, EAST BERLIN. 183

          HANNA on the bus. Shaking from the shock of his death,
          bloodied slightly from the fight. The other passengers stare
          at her as she forces back the tears. HANNA reaches in her
          pocket for a handkerchief, but only pulls out the letter Erik
          showed her. The Galinka letter. She sees the address.
          Galinka, Ostrovska district, Poland.
          HANNA makes a decision. She is going back to where she was
          born. She must find out who she is.

          184 INT. ESTATE BUILDING. KATRIN ZADEK'S FLAT. 184

          MARISSA enters the apartment. And looks at the chaos. ISAACS
          comes up behind her. HENCHMEN at the door.

                         ISAACS
          They had a fight.

                         MARISSA
          She must know the truth.

                         ISAACS
          Where do you think she's gone?

                         MARISSA
          Where would you go?
          MARISSA turns to ISAACS.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I'm closing the CIA operation down.
          Heller is dead, that's all that
          matters to them. This we do alone.

          185 INT. POLISH TRAIN. 185

          HANNA's head rests on the backrest of a train-seat as the
          train crawls through the Polish/German border. Exhausted,
          many nights without sleep. Hungry but unable to eat. Needing
          resolution.
          In the same carriage a Polish woman sleeps alongside her
          child of two, also sleeping. HANNA looks at the child. The
          peace of the innocent.

          186 EXT. POLISH TRAIN STATION. NIGHT. 186

          The train entering a Polish train station. The town is called
          Ostrovska. Freezing cold. The town is in the North of Poland
          and it's very poor. Industrial. Bleak. HANNA exits,
          approaches a station guard.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         HANNA
          I am looking for a train to
          Galinka.

                         GUARD
          Galinka is a small village. No
          trains. You must wait for bus in
          the morning.

                         HANNA
          Where can I stay?
          He points. HANNA sees the hotel.

          187 INT. POLISH HOTEL. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 187

          HANNA enters the tiny, dank hotel room. She looks at the
          filthy carpet, the grey ceiling. She turns on the tiny TV.
          Cartoons. Tom and Jerry type stuff. But she doesn't laugh.
          She flicks channel. Then stands dead still. She is looking at
          ERIK HELLER's dead body on the ground. The report depicts him
          as a dangerous criminal. HANNA stares at the image. The death
          of the man she spent her life with. Lost forever. HANNA's
          face oddly still in the TV flicker. Then she flicks it off.
          Leaves the room.

          188 INT. POLISH HOTEL. FOYER/BAR - NIGHT. 188

          HANNA, exhausted, sleepless and starving, comes down the
          shabby hotel stairs and enters the hotel bar. Grim. Empty
          room, old carpet, bad smell, dated pop music. Three hard-
          drinking men stare at her, making her uncomfortable as she
          goes to the bar. A forty-five year old BUSINESSMAN stands
          there, drinking.

                         HANNA
          Do you have a sandwich?

                         BARMAN
          Kitchen is closed.
          The BUSINESSMAN speaks in German.

                         BUSINESSMAN
          Get her something. Poor girl's
          hungry.
          The barman disappears. HANNA looks round, waits.

          BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          I'm from Leipzig.
          HANNA flinches at the name. Leipzig.

          BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          You?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         HANNA
          The same.

                         BUSINESSMAN
          Business?
          He looks at her body. HANNA senses it. Her sandwich arrives.
          It's grim. She leaves it, walks out.

                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          Where are you going?

                         HANNA
          I am tired. I need to sleep.
          She leaves the bar. HANNA walks back up the stairs.
          BUSINESSMAN follows.

                         BUSINESSMAN
          Hello?
          She walks along the corridor, gets to her room. BUSINESSMAN
          follows.

                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          I was just making nice
          conversation. Yes?
          As she enters her room, he puts his foot in the door.

                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          Let's talk. Maybe we can do
          business.
          HANNA kicks his foot out of the door. Hard.

                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          You don't like talk, huh?
          He barges into the room and grabs her. Tries to push her on
          to the bed. He is strong. His words and tone contrasting
          violently with his actions.

                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          Be nice. Be a nice little dolly.
          HANNA is thrust on to the bed, but suddenly turns him over
          her head and smashes him against a cupboard. BUSINESSMAN
          grabs her hair and throws her on the bed.
          But now HANNA snaps. She starts to roar. It's like an animal,
          like nothing we have seen before. She rips at his face, grabs
          a glass, smashes it and cuts his face with it. Pure animal
          rage. BUSINESSMAN starts to scream, blood pouring from his
          eyes. He collapses on the floor. She kicks him, punches him,
          repeatedly in a grief-fuelled rage until she is spent of her
          primal fury and falls, panting, to the floor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          When she looks up she sees his mangled bloody body lying next
          to her. Not quite dead.
          HANNA suddenly recoils in horror. Shocked by the viciousness
          of her actions.
          Tears begins to run down her cheeks as HANNA grabs the man's
          wallet, and leaves the room.

          189 EXT. POLISH STREET - NIGHT 189

          Shaking in shock, HANNAH walks out of the hotel and down the
          street, in a daze, no idea where she is going. She starts to
          run, faster and faster, just running to run out of herself.
          Finally she stops and is sick. She looks up. A taxi's yellow
          light blinks in the darkness. She looks at the businessman's
          wallet to see how much money is in there. She approaches the
          taxi.

                         HANNA
          I have this much. Can you take me
          to Galinka?

          190 EXT. POLISH HILL ROAD - NIGHT 190

          HANNA is in the taxi as it travels a lonely Polish forest
          road through undulating snow-covered hills. Cold dawn is
          arriving. Grey skies lightening through the windscreen. Tall
          snowy pines tower above the car. No one else on the road,
          just a horse drawn cart guiding cows to pasture. It is as if
          from a different age. Quiet, solitary. HANNA checks the
          paper in her pocket. Still there. Blood on her hands from the
          businessman. A cut in her arm. Carefully, secretly, she wipes
          it clean.
          Suddenly the taxi stops.

                         DRIVER
          This is as far as the money gets
          you.
          HANNA looks out. Middle of nowhere.

                         HANNA
          How much further?

                         DRIVER
          Twelve miles.

                         HANNA
          Please.
          But no smile from him, nothing. HANNA gets out. Starts to
          walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          She is alone in the forest, freezing, shattered, hungry. Just
          about dawn. Cold as hell.
          She hears a car approach. Tries to hail it but it flies past
          fast. Blows icy air in her face.
          She continues in the freezing cold - sees the road ahead.
          It's hilly, winding, she isn't going to make it. Too tired.
          Too shattered.
          Time passes. Still she walks. Dead on her feet. Gathering
          every ounce of energy.
          Then the sounds of another car. But it too just flies by,
          ignoring her waves and cries.
          HANNA almost collapses in frustration. But carries on.
          Carries on walking.
          Time passes. Freezing cold. HANNA alone on the road. Can she
          make it?
          Then another car. HANNA turns, waves, cries out. And, almost
          magically, the car slows and stops. The window winds down.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          I'm going to Galinka. Can you help
          me?
          A woman's voice, German, in German.

          WOMAN (V.O.)
          Yes I can take you there.
          And as HANNA gets in, she looks at the comforting, smiling
          face of MARISSA WIEGLER.

          191 INT. CAR. POLAND. ROAD TO GALINKA - NIGHT 191

          MARISSA starts to drive, HANNA sits in the front with her.
          HANNA has no idea who she is.
          MARISSA speaks in perfect German. Calm, soft, comforting.

                         MARISSA
          It's a very dull place Galinka. Why
          would you want to go there?

                         HANNA
          I was born there. But I've never
          really seen it. Why are you going?

                         MARISSA
          I have some business to sort out.
          She looks at her and smiles a sunny, uncomplicated smile.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          It's very lucky we ran into each
          other, don't you think?

                         HANNA
          Yes...

                         MARISSA
          You've hurt your arm.

                         HANNA
          It's okay.
          MARISSA hands her some tissue. HANNA bandages the arm.

                         MARISSA
          I'm Astrid.

                         HANNA
          You're not German. Are you
          American?

                         MARISSA
          That's right. I lived there for
          many years. I travel a lot.
          MARISSA smiles at her kindly. HANNA feels safe for the first
          time in ages. She feels the tears come.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Oh dear, what's wrong with you?

                         HANNA
          Sorry.

                         MARISSA
          It's okay. Are you in trouble?
          HANNA nods. She fights the tears.
          MARISSA gently holds her hand as she drives. HANNA weeping.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          What sort of trouble?

                         HANNA
          (though her tears)
          I don't know what to do. Nothing is
          what I thought it would be. It's...
          ugly and cruel and I don't know
          where to go, or... I'm stupid. I
          don't know what I expected...
          MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the
          emotion that has surprised her. Human warmth.

                         MARISSA
          Sometimes I feel the same way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          HANNA eyes her, surprised to hear this from a grown up woman.
          MARISSA puts on some music. Gentle. Bach maybe.

                         HANNA
          I like music.

                         MARISSA
          Sleep why don't you? You look very
          tired. It will take half an hour on
          this road.
          HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has
          slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the
          window. She is asleep. Vulnerable.

          192 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAWN 192

          Soft dawn light as MARISSA drives on a narrow rural road.

          193 INT. CAR - DAWN 193

          MARISSA looks at the sleeping HANNA. MARISSA represses her
          gathering emotion. HANNA suddenly looking so young as she
          sleeps the sleep of the innocent. The rush of emotion shocks
          her - she is watching HANNA, not the road - and she veers
          off, nearly crashing the car, narrowly avoiding a tree. She
          puts her foot sharply on the brake. She's wearing the same
          GREEN SHOES as she wore at Wilhelm's House.
          HANNA is jolted awake.

                         HANNA
          Where are we?
          MARISSA calms herself instantly.

                         MARISSA
          Nearly there.
          HANNA doesn't see MARISSA'S SHOES.

          194 EXT. GALINKA 194

          MARISSA's car slows as it enters a tiny deserted hamlet.

          MARISSA (V.O.)
          This is it.

          195 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. 195

          HANNA looks around. There is not much to Galinka. She is
          confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         HANNA
          It's so small.

                         MARISSA
          Yes. Just a few cottages. And the
          old bunker.
          HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions.

                         HANNA
          Thank you for the ride. You're very
          kind.

                         MARISSA
          I wish there was more I could do
          for you.
          MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the
          intimacy. MARISSA reaches into the glove compartment and
          retrieves a torch which she hands to HANNA.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Here, take this.
          HANNA switches the torch on and off, thinking.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I hope you find what you're looking
          for.

                         HANNA
          Thank you.
          She gets out and shuts the door behind her.

          196 EXT. GALINKA. CONT. 196

          HANNA looks around at the grey desolation, rural poverty, the
          ends of the earth. In the car MARISSA stares at her, then
          drives off.
          HANNA walks through the trees along a track. Overgrown, not
          used for many years.
          She reaches a hidden entrance off the track. By the entrance
          there is an old battered sign. GALINKA. HANNA looks at the
          old iron gate. Rusted, locked. It has not been opened in a
          long time.
          She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked. Then
          she climbs the gate. She nearly tears her clothes on the
          spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and,
          exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up
          the narrow tree-lined driveway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

          197 EXT. GALINKA BUNKER - CONTINUOUS 197

          HANNA approaches the gaping mouth of an underground bunker.
          She stops, looks down at the torch in her hand, switches it
          on and walks into the darkness.

          198 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 198

          With only the torch light to see by HANNA treads warily
          deeper into the tunnels as, behind her, the small aperture of
          daylight recedes slowly to nothing.
          The tunnels seem to stretch on for miles ahead of her.
          HANNA reaches a junction where four tunnels meet. She shines
          her torch down each tunnel, trying to decide which way to go.
          She stops when she sees, a little way down one of the
          tunnels, a child's forgotten shoe.
          HANNA steps forward and shines her torch down at the tiny red
          shoe, its buckle rusted.
          She walks on into the dark.
          HANNA finds a door which she pushes at. The door is stiff,
          but HANNA uses her full weight and soon she's made enough of
          a gap to squeeze through.

          199 INT. NURSERY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 199

          At first HANNA has difficulty making out where she is, but
          dotted here and there are parts of an old nursery. The walls
          are painted with a blue sky, clouds and the figures of
          children holding hands.
          She begins to remember as, from a distant place, she hears
          the sound of children laughing. She shines her torch in the
          direction of the laughter and catches a glimpse of a child,
          dressed in a party frock and hat, playing hide and seek. She
          shines her torch the other way, and there's another, then a
          third and a fourth. For a moment the room seems to be filled
          with laughing children.
          Then, in an instant, they're gone again and silence returns.
          HANNA, lit only be the reflected light of her torch, knows
          she has been here before.
          She walks on through the tunnels.

          200 INT. DORMITORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 200

          HANNA enters a long hall which was once the children's
          dormitory.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          At one end is a steep pile of metal bed frames.
          From a distant place in her memory HANNA begins to hear the
          sound of children singing.

                         CHILDREN
          Happy Birthday to you,
          Happy Birthday to you...
          From the far end of the dormitory come a procession of
          CHILDREN, the first of whom is carrying a large birthday cake
          lit with birthday candles. The children's faces glow eerily
          in the candle light. They're looking at HANNA and walking
          straight towards her as they sing.

          CHILDREN (CONT'D)
          Happy Biirrrrthday, dear...
          The CHILDREN arrive at HANNA lifting the cake towards her.

          CHILDREN (CONT'D)
          ... Hanna.
          Happy Birthday to you!
          HANNA leans forward, takes a deep breath and blows. The
          children disappear with the flames of the candles.
          The sound of a woman's approaching footsteps echo through the
          tunnel.
          HANNA swings her torch beam in the direction of the
          footsteps. She freezes as she sees a pair of GREEN SHOES
          walking towards her. The same shoes as in Wilhelm's house.

          MARISSA WIEGLER.
          HANNA raises her torch beam to see the face of the woman from
          the car.

                         HANNA
          You're Marissa Wiegler.
          HANNA starts to shake.
          MARISSA has her gun pointing at HANNA but her expression is
          the same sunny, uncomplicated smile as earlier. Dead silence.
          HANNA breathing fast. MARISSA speaks in English.

                         MARISSA
          Don't worry sweetie. I don't want
          to hurt you.
          MARISSA'S tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of
          maternal care.
          HANNA does not move. Like a wild animal cornered.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I could have killed you already
          when you were asleep in the car.
          HANNA'S still shaking.
          HANNA now sees ISAACS and his HENCHMEN, three of them, all
          with hunting rifles. All ready to shoot her should she attack
          or run. They are some distance away, not coming any closer.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          Did Erik tell you about this place?

                         HANNA
          Where are the other children?
          She looks at MARISSA, who waits, then answers quietly.

                         MARISSA
          Sleeping. They're all sleeping.

                         HANNA
          I don't believe you.

                         MARISSA
          I can protect you, Hanna. Make sure
          you walk out of here and keep
          walking. Grow up and grow old in
          safety and security. No one need
          know a thing. But you have to trust
          me. You can't talk about this with
          anyone. It's what we call
          âclassified.â If you tell anyone,
          it'll be dangerous for both of us.
          HANNA looks at her, remembering what ERIK told her, trying
          hard not to succumb.

                         HANNA
          You killed my mother.

                         MARISSA
          You're mother didn't want you,
          sweetie. I saved you.
          HANNA just stares, not believing her.

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I'm the only person left who
          understands who you are. The only
          one who cares.
          MARISSA holds out a hand to HANNA, for HANNA to take, a
          motherly gesture...

          MARISSA (CONT'D)
          I practically am your mother.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.
          HANNA'S stomach turns in horror. She switches off her torch
          and runs into the shadows.
          ISAACS raises his gun fires.

          201 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 201

          HANNA running through the darkness. Behind her ISAACS and the
          HENCHMEN come after her. ISAACS carries a large heavy torch,
          as does one of the HENCHMEN. The other HENCHMEN all have
          night vision on their rifles.
          HANNA crouches down, she sniffs the air, can smell them
          coming.
          A HENCHMAN treads carefully down the tunnel. We see his point
          of view through his night vision sight, just the dark tunnel
          stretching on.
          Like a ghost HANNA'S face appears up close, her eyes a pearly
          white.
          She slams the gun back in the HENCHMAN'S face.
          Still in night vision we see the fight, quick and hard. The
          flash of a single bullet illuminates his death.
          Silence once more.
          HANNA now has the first HENCHMAN'S rifle.
          From around the corner into the next tunnel she hears the
          sound of feet on dirt. She presses herself against the
          tunnel, waits listening, hears the feet again and in one
          movement raises the rifle and spins round the corner.
          Through her night vision sight she sees a deer, scared eyes
          staring back at her.
          She releases her grip on the trigger and the deer scampers
          into the darkness.

          202 INT. LABORATORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 202

          HANNA comes into the old laboratory. Through her night vision
          sights we see the white tiles and smashed equipment.
          She senses someone coming after her and ducks behind a lab
          bench.
          A HENCHMAN enters the lab carrying a hand gun and a small
          torch. His footsteps make a crunching sound as he steps
          through the broken glass that litters the floor.
          HANNA rises from her hiding place and stands straight into
          the torch light.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111.
          She fires but is off target and only catches the HENCHMAN'S
          left arm.
          He drops his torch which slides across the floor.
          HANNA comes round the lab bench to where the HENCHMAN should
          be lying but he's gone. There's a trail of blood which she
          follows to a metal cabinet.
          She stops at the cabinet and fires three shots into its
          flimsy doors.
          The dead HENCHMAN slides out from the cabinet.
          HANNA takes the dead man's hand gun and goes to retrieve the
          torch.
          She switches the torch off.

          203 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA. 203

          ISAACS, unnerved, presses himself against the wall of the
          tunnel. He feels something at his legs. Points his torch to
          find the deer pulling at his trouser leg. He shoots it. Then
          runs further down into the tunnel.
          Alerted by the sound of ISAACS' shot HANNA starts to pursue
          her prey.

          204 INT. DORMITORY. GALINKA. 204

          ISAACS is back in the dormitory. With torch in hand he
          searches under the beds. Behind him he hears HANNA enter. He
          switches off his torch and crawls under a bed.
          HANNA walks slowly between the beds. Under the bed ISAACS is
          preparing to fire, now watching her feet.
          Suddenly the bed he's under is lifted straight up in the air
          and off him - HANNA has summoned enormous strength and is
          clutching the end of the bed. He fires, hits nothing and she
          lets go - the bed comes crashing down on him again.
          His torch rolls away. His arms are trapped under the bed,
          he's unable to move.
          With all his might ISAACS pushes at the bed and lifts it off
          himself.
          They fight.
          HANNA picks up the torch and slams the torch across his
          temple. She grabs him by the hair and smashes his head
          repeatedly into the floor - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM.
          Silence - he's dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.
          HANNA sits back on the bed and looks at her bloodied hands -
          looks down at what she's done. Shocked by her own violence
          she begins to cry hot tears of bewilderment.
          She gets up and runs from the dormitory.

          205 INT/EXT. TUNNELS/TUNNEL MOUTH. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 205

          HANNA runs back through the tunnels.

                         HANNA
          No more. No more.
          Tears are streaming down her face as she reaches sight of the
          tunnel mouth and the daylight beyond. Standing in silhouette
          is MARISSA. HANNA slows her pace and stops when she can see
          the white of MARISSA'S eyes and the finger on MARISSA'S
          trigger.
          MARISSA raises the gun and aims at HANNA - but HANNA comes
          forward again, walking calmly towards her.
          She stops and drops her gun to the ground.

          HANNA (CONT'D)
          Everything I see is nothing I want.
          MARISSA looks at HANNA, her gentle, childlike countenance.
          She smiles.

                         MARISSA
          Let me take care of you?

                         HANNA
          No. I don't want that.
          HANNA turns her back on MARISSA and starts to walks in the
          opposite direction.
          MARISSA watches her walk away.
          HANNA walks waiting for the shot to come.

                         MARISSA
          Hanna.
          HANNA spins, fires directly at CAMERA.

          CUT TO BLACK.

          206 EXT. FOREST. NORTH SWEDEN. 206


                         FADE UP:
          The sun spreads its golden fingers through the trees catching
          the early morning dew.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.
          A wide shot of the HANNA'S cabin, wisps of smoke rise from
          it's chimney.
          HANNA steps out of the cabin. She's back wearing her furs
          again. In her hands she carries a cup of hot milk and a small
          wooden bowl.
          In VOICE-OVER we hear HANNA reading from her beloved
          Encyclopaedia.

          HANNA (V.O.)
          The Earth is the third planet from
          the Sun, and the fifth-largest of
          the eight planets in the Solar
          System.
          HANNA sits down on a tree trunk outside the cabin and pours
          some milk into the bowl, then drinks a little for herself.

          HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Home to millions of species,
          including humans, Earth is the only
          place in the universe where life is
          known to exist.
          She raises her head and makes a small clicking sound. Her
          friend, the snow fox, appears from the trees. The fox now has
          a small family of cubs.
          HANNA watches as the cubs approach the milk and begin to
          drink.

          HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The planet formed over four and a
          half billion years ago, and life
          appeared on its surface within a
          billion years.
          HANNA sits back and feels the sunlight on her face. Above her
          the trees are beginning to leaf.

          HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It is expected to continue
          supporting life for another one and
          a half billion years, after which
          the rising luminosity of the Sun
          will eliminate it all.
          HANNA surveys her beautiful world.

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT


                

               FADE IN

               RAIN

               Falls from low grey clouds. Down below we see...

               THE RIVER

               Muddy, slow and powerful, overflowing its banks. In the near 
               distance is...

               THE RESERVOIR

               Filled to the maximum, water thundering out of two open gates. 
               We close in on...

               THE DAM

               There's a Dam Control Office in the middle of the dam. We 
               MOVE OFF the reservoir and head out over...

               THE TOWN OF HUNTINGBURG

               We see "NO FEAR" spelled out in stones on one man's roof. We 
               go down and into...

               EXT. STREETS OF HUNTINGBURG - DUSK

               Storefronts are sandbagged and closed. A sign on one store 
               reads: GONE FISHING. A sign on another: HEY LOOTER. NOTHING 
               OF VALUE HERE. TRY NEXT DOOR. And on the next store: HE'S 
               LYING.

               A CHURCH

               Beautiful, old, ringed with a five-foot-high wall of sandbags. 
               The floodwater is up to the first level of sandbags.

               CARS AND PICKUP TRUCKS

               Loaded down, are heading out of town on streets covered in 
               the first water of the flood.

               A STATUE

               On an island in the middle of the street. It's Civil War-
               era, of a general on a horse, sword held high. The floodwater 
               is over the curb, lapping at the base of statue's pedestal. 
               Near the statue stands...

               THE SHERIFF

               50s, with soft edges and friendly eyes. He's talking into 
               his radio mike.

                                     SHERIFF
                         So, are we all going to die?

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               HANK, the dam control officer, is on the radio with the 
               Sheriff.

                                     HANK
                         Not right now. But I'm gonna have to 
                         let out a little more.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               WAYNE and PHIL, two deputies, 30s, are near the Sheriff, 
               shoring up a sandbag wall that has partially collapsed.

                                     PHIL
                         I think my best was when I turned 
                         twelve. My Dad set up a treasure 
                         hunt. It was really cool.
                              (off Wayne's disdainful 
                              look)
                         Well, it was.

               Wayne shrugs a "whatever" and pulls a sandbag up out of the 
               water. There's unpleasant-looking muck all over his arms. He 
               drops the sandbag back into the water and shakes off the 
               crud with disgust.

                                     WAYNE
                         This blows.

                                     PHIL
                         My most awful birthday was sweet 
                         sixteen. I had mono. How about you? 
                         What was your worst?

                                     WAYNE
                         You kidding? You think I could've 
                         possibly had a birthday worse than 
                         this? What kind of loser do you think 
                         I am?

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         Don't answer that, Phil.

               The Sheriff walks over.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank says he's gonna open another 
                         gate. We're gonna get another rise.

               They turn at the sound of honking. The MAYOR drives up.

                                     MAYOR
                         Gentlemen. Hey -- happy birthday, 
                         Wayne.

               Wayne nods. Phil stiffens. They do not like this guy.

                                     MAYOR
                              (to the Sheriff)
                         Mike, I gotta say, what you're 
                         doing... I don't know if I'd be here, 
                         considering.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (good-natured)
                         Well, you would be if you wanted to 
                         get the last couple of paychecks 
                         some bastard owed you.

                                     MAYOR
                              (grins, then:)
                         I just want you to know I think the 
                         people 'round here made a big mistake.

               Phil grumbles to himself.

                                     PHIL
                         "The people"? You're the one who 
                         screwed him.

                                     MAYOR
                         Sorry, Phil?

                                     PHIL
                              (blushes)
                         I, uh --

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Mayor, saving 
                              Phil)
                         You know, Bob, as much as I'd love 
                         to stand here all day talking about 
                         how great I am, if you don't get 
                         moving I'm gonna have to haul your 
                         sorry ass off to jail.

                                     MAYOR
                              (laughs)
                         Okay, okay, I'm going. Keep up the 
                         good work, boys. It's appreciated.

               The Mayor rolls up his window and heads off.

                                     WAYNE
                         Whaddya say we go torch the fucker's 
                         house and blame it on looters. Or 
                         how about we put a dead cow in his 
                         living room. He comes back after 
                         it's been in the water a couple of 
                         days. Hello!

                                     SHERIFF
                              (shakes head)
                         You wanna know how to get the best 
                         revenge on the Mayor and his boys? 
                         You do exactly what we're doing. You 
                         protect the town. You protect it 
                         better than they would. Better than 
                         they ever could.

                                     WAYNE
                              (thinks, shrugs)
                         I think the dead cow's better.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (ignores Wayne)
                         Any looter that comes in here is in 
                         for a big surprise, cause as long as 
                         I'm still wearing this pointy thing...
                              (indicates badge)
                         ...nobody's taking anything from 
                         this town.

               INT. BANK VAULT

               Nervous assistant bank manager WELLMAN is hurriedly tossing 
               stacks of money into two canvas bags.

               A MAN'S SHADOW

               Washes up on Wellman.

                                     CHARLIE (O.S.)
                         Do you think you could go a little 
                         faster, pal?

                                     WELLMAN
                         I -- I'm going as fast as I can.

               SECOND SHADOW COMES UP

                                     TOM (O.S.)
                         Well, it's not fast enough.

               Wellman is about to speak, then sees something, gulps.

               A SHOTGUN

               Is held by one of the men, pointed at the floor.

               WELLMAN

               Sweeps the money off the shelves and into the bags.

                                     SECOND MAN (O.S.)
                         That it?

                                     WELLMAN
                         Yes. We don't keep any of our --

               THE TWO MEN

               Ignore Wellman, grab the canvas bags and stride off.

               EXT. BANK - DAY

               CLOSE ON the lower half of the front doors as they fly open. 
               Out come TWO MEN in long dark raincoats.

               WELLMAN

               Runs up, stopping in the open door.

                                     WELLMAN
                         Hey, wait!

               VERY CLOSE ON THE TWO MEN

               As they slowly turn to face Wellman. We just see their faces, 
               shielded from the rain by hat brims. Meet...

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Tom, 30, handsome, with an easy smile. Charlie, 50, with a 
               tough, red face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Excuse me?

               WELLMAN

               Looks nervous for a second, then holds up a clipboard.

                                     WELLMAN
                         You forgot to sign.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               We see, for the first time, by their hats and uniforms, that 
               they are armored car drivers. There's an armored car parked 
               at the curb, on the other side of a low wall of sandbags.

               Charlie sighs, goes back to Wellman and perfunctorily signs 
               the form. Then he and Tom go to the sandbag wall. Tom holds 
               both bags in one hand and the shotgun in the other. Charlie 
               doesn't want to get wet.

               He steps from the sandbag wall onto the rear bumper of the 
               truck, then keys open the doors.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Okay.

               Charlie reaches out for the money bags. Tom jumps off the 
               sandbag wall and lands in the water, splashing Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         For Christsakes!

                                     TOM
                         It's a flood, Charlie. You're gonna 
                         get wet.

               Charlie takes the bags, tosses them in then shuts the back. 
               He moves toward the front, still trying to keep out of the 
               water. Tom splashes him some more.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey! Do you know what kind of crap 
                         is in that water?

                                     TOM
                              (of course he knows)
                         Well, yeah.

               Tom kicks some more water at Charlie. Charlie gives Tom a 
               withering look and climbs in the truck.

               INT. ARMORED TRUCK

               Charlie gets into the driver's seat; Tom climbs into the 
               shotgun seat. They shut and bolt the doors. Charlie gets on 
               the radio.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch, this is 31.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Go ahead, 31.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're leaving Huntingburg. We'll be 
                         back in an hour.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Ten-four. Get out of there.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're gone. Over and out.

               Charlie hangs up the radio. He starts writing on a clipboard. 
               Silence for a few moments, and then Charlie notices Tom 
               staring at him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What?

                                     TOM
                         Your ear.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What about my ear?

                                     TOM
                         You've got a major hair growth going 
                         on.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Shut up.

                                     TOM
                         I'm serious. You're gonna need 
                         somebody to go in there with a weed 
                         whacker.

               Charlie grabs a donut bag off the seat and tosses it to Tom.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Here.

                                     TOM
                         You're offering me one of your donuts? 
                         I don't know what to say. I'm getting 
                         all misty.

                                     CHARLIE
                         If it'll shut your mouth you can 
                         have the whole bag.

               Charlie starts the truck. Tom thinks about it, then tosses 
               the bag back.

                                     TOM
                         Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll 
                         never get out of this truck.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (disgusted)
                         I love how you think you're better 
                         than this.

                                     TOM
                         Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's 
                         a lot to like about this job -- and 
                         I don't just mean the dashing 
                         polyester ensemble and the solid 
                         three-figure income.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (angry)
                         You ungrateful shit! I don't believe 
                         you!

                                     TOM
                              (surprised)
                         Charlie, relax! I was kidding!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You don't wanna do this? Fine. Go 
                         back to selling hot construction 
                         machinery. That's a helluva career.

                                     TOM
                         It had better hours.

               Charlie slams the clipboard down on the seat.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You think this is a joke? This is 
                         funny? Jesus Christ! You know how 
                         lucky you are you could get in here? 
                         Thirty years old and all the crap 
                         you pulled and you never got caught?

                                     TOM
                              (angry)
                         That wasn't luck, old man. That was 
                         skill. I was good at it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to 
                         fence bulldozers. That's goddamn 
                         genius time.

                                     TOM
                         About as much skill as it takes to 
                         sit in a truck and get fat eating 
                         donuts.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, so that's all I've been doing, 
                         huh? Just wasting my life away.

                                     TOM
                         I didn't say that.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah, building a home, raising a 
                         family -- that's just stupid.

                                     TOM
                         I didn't say that!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know what, Tom? I really don't 
                         give a shit what you said.

               Tom doesn't reply. Charlie puts the truck in gear; starts 
               off. Tom looks at Charlie, shakes his head -- what was that 
               about?

               JIM

               Late 50s, with a creased face and piercing eyes. He's sitting 
               at the bar, drinking coffee. Rain sheets down outside. The 
               BARTENDER watches TV, sound off. Next to Jim at the bar are...

               RAY, KENNY AND MR. MEHLOR

               Ray, 40s, has lank hair, rheumy eyes and a glass of Irish 
               whisky in front of him. Kenny, 20s, long hair, has the energy 
               of a puppy -- unfortunately he has about as much smarts as a 
               puppy. Mr. Mehlor. 40s, looks like -- and was -- a high school 
               teacher.

               ON TV

               Sound off, a MAN is crying about what he has lost in the 
               flood.

                                     RAY
                         "Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters 
                         shall rise up out of the north and 
                         be an overflowing flood and all the 
                         inhabitants of the land shall howl." 
                         Jeremiah 47:2.

               Ray takes a drink. Kenny leans over to Ray, sotto.

                                     KENNY
                         You're gonna be able to buy a helluva 
                         lot of bibles, huh, Ray? Me? First 
                         thing I'm gonna do is get my brother 
                         a lawyer. Best that money can buy.

               A thought comes to Jim -- an answer to a clue in the crossword -- 
               and he starts filling in words as Ray and Kenny talk.

                                     RAY
                         What's he facing?

                                     KENNY
                         Thirty in.

                                     RAY
                         He cap a cop or something...?

                                     KENNY
                         Security guard. "In the commission..." 
                         All he's got is a piece of shit P.D. 
                         Now I'm gonna be able to afford him 
                         a good lawyer -- a guy with a haircut.

               Jim leans over to Kenny.

                                     JIM
                         'Scuse me a second. Take a look at 
                         thirty-one across.

               Jim slides the newspaper in front of Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         Shit, Jim. I don't do crossword 
                         puzzles.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         I'll take a look, Jim.

                                     JIM
                         Kenny can read.
                              (to Kenny)
                         Just look at it. You know when you 
                         write down a word and suddenly it 
                         looks all wrong? Maybe it's right, 
                         but it doesn't look right?

               Jim points at the newspaper.

                                     JIM
                         Thirty-one across.

               Kenny shrugs and looks down at the newspaper.

                                     KENNY
                              (mumbles as he reads)
                         Mention money again and...

               His eyes go wide.

               ECU CROSSWORD PUZZLE

               In an uncompleted part of the puzzle, Jim has written a

               YOU.

               JIM AND KENNY

               Kenny looks up at Jim. Jim glances over at the bartender 
               then back at Kenny. Understand?

                                     JIM
                         Did I get it right?

                                     KENNY
                         Yeah, Jim. You got it right.

               INT. ARMORED TRUCK - DUSK

               Charlie and Tom continue to drive in silence. They both sneak 
               looks at each other. Their eyes meet for a second, then they 
               look away. A moment's pause then...

                                     TOM
                         Jerk.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Jack-ass.

               A hint of a smile on both of them. Tom reaches for Charlie.

                                     TOM
                         Give us a kiss. Come on.

               Charlie goes red in the face, pushes Tom away.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Get out of here.

                                     TOM
                              (laughs, beat)
                         You really are a cranky old fart, 
                         you know that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     TOM
                         What was that about? I mean, I'm 
                         just sitting here and all of a sudden 
                         you go postal on me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't know, I... It's just this 
                         weather. I... I want to get back.

                                     TOM
                         You know, I really do appreciate 
                         what you've done for me. This is a 
                         good job.

                         No, it's not. It stinks. It's putting

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - DUSK

               Looking away from town, the HIGH SCHOOL is on the left. On 
               the right is the CEMETERY. Farther on, on the left, is a CAR 
               AND BOAT DEALERSHIP. The road is covered in water.

               THE ARMORED TRUCK

               Goes by the entrance to the high school, water shooting up 
               from the wheels, pushing out in a wide wake.

               INT. TRUCK

               Tom glances ahead and sees that the road is covered in water.

                                     TOM
                         Jesus. Where's the road?

               THEIR POV

               Stretching out ahead of them are reflector bars on the 
               telephone poles, a few feet above the rippling surface of 
               the floodwater.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's there.
                              (beat)
                         Somewhere. I hope.
                              (beat)
                         Look, Tom, I don't care what it is 
                         you end up doing.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God, here we go again.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is the last time, I swear.

               Tom sees something ahead. He doesn't understand at first.

               HIS POV

               The reflector bar on the pole two poles ahead is lower than 
               the others. No reflector bars for a hundred yards, then they 
               resume.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (looks at Tom)
                         I just think, whatever it is you do, 
                         it's time you did some heavy lifting.

               Tom figures out what's going on with the reflector bars.

                                     TOM
                         Stop!

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, you gotta hear this. You're better 
                         than --

                                     TOM
                         Stop the truck! We're going down!

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               The water rises fast up the grille as the truck angles down.

               INSIDE THE TRUCK

                                     CHARLIE
                         Jesus!

               Charlie stands on the brakes.

               THEIR POV

               A wave of water rushes forward from the truck, then comes 
               back and washes over the hood, splashing up on the windshield.

                                     TOM
                         Back up!

               Charlie throws the truck into reverse but gives it too much 
               power. They hear the rear wheels spinning underwater. Charlie 
               eases off, the tires start to catch, they start moving 
               backwards.

               Charlie and Tom exchange a quick look of relief... and then 
               the engine dies. Charlie tries to restart it, but there's 
               nothing.

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               It's stopped on a downgrade -- it's a dip in the road.

               The water is up to the top of the front tires: up to the 
               hubcaps on the rear wheels. The headlights are underwater, 
               spots of yellow glowing. They've stopped next to a lighted 
               sign.

                        HOME OF THE 1987 STATE CHAMPION WARRIORS.

               IN THE TRUCK

                                     CHARLIE
                         Goddammit!

                                     TOM
                         It's a little dip in the road or 
                         something. You can see the reflectors 
                         come up the other side.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (curses to himself)
                         I knew this would happen.
                              (grabs radio mike)

                                     TOM
                         I'll see if there's anyone coming. 
                         Maybe we can get pulled out.

               Tom opens the door. Charlie adjusts the radio frequency 
               selection button; clicks on.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch, this is 31. 31 calling 
                         dispatch.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                              (over radio)
                         31, this is dispatch.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (into radio)
                         Dispatch, we're stuck outside of 
                         Huntingburg. Truck's dead.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Where are you?

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're on 231, headed for the 
                         Interstate. Right by a sign saying 
                         "Welcome to Huntingburg."

               Tom climbs out and up on top of the truck.

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               Tom stands on top of the truck. In one direction, nothing 
               but blackness. The other way he can see the lights of the 
               town. But there are no cars coming.

               IN THE TRUCK

               Charlie looks over as Tom appears, upside-down, in the 
               doorway.

                                     TOM
                         The town's been evacuated. We won't 
                         get any help from there.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch can't get anyone out.

                                     TOM
                         They are aware we're carrying a 
                         shitload of money...?

                                     CHARLIE
                         They called the National Guard. 
                         They're gonna be here in about ninety 
                         minutes.

                                     TOM
                         Ninety minutes? Jesus.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (nods; into radio)
                         Dispatch, we're gonna need help a 
                         little sooner than --

               There's a sudden sparking sound and the radio cuts out and 
               interior lights and the headlights go out.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, shit.

               INT. HOUSE - DUSK POV THROUGH WINDOW

               Looking out as the Sheriff's car rolls past on the water-
               covered street. A HAND lets go of a curtain and it swings 
               across the window.

               EXT. STREET - DUSK IN THE SHERIFF'S CAR

               The Sheriff motions Wayne to stop the car, then he grabs the 
               radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (into mike)
                         Henry, I saw you. Come on out.

               No one comes out of the house.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Henry, I'm not leaving until you 
                         come out.

               A few moments pass and then...

               HENRY AND DOREEN SWERZKY

               Late 70s, step out onto their porch.

                                     DOREEN
                         Jesus H. Christ, Henry, I told you 
                         to stay away from the damn window.

               THE SHERIFF

               Gets out of the car.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What are you still doing here?

                                     HENRY
                         We're just --

                                     DOREEN
                         We're setting traps.

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's illegal, Doreen.

                                     DOREEN
                         You gonna arrest us, Sheriff? Hell, 
                         are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff? 
                         Didn't you lose an election? I sure 
                         as hell know I didn't vote for you, 
                         and neither did Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         Doreen...

                                     SHERIFF
                         You don't need to set traps.

                                     DOREEN
                         That's what they said in '73. When 
                         we got back, anything the bastards 
                         didn't steal they broke, just for 
                         the hell of it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's not happening this time.

                                     DOREEN
                         Damn right it's not.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You can't stay, you know that.

                                     HENRY
                         We're going to my sister's.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Good.

                                     DOREEN
                         Soon as we finish setting the traps.

               The Sheriff wants to say something more, but he's not about 
               to argue with Doreen. He just nods and gets back into the 
               car.

               IN THE CAR

               The Sheriff climbs back in. He and Wayne watch Henry and 
               Doreen go back into the house, Doreen still nagging at Henry.

                                     SHERIFF
                         God'll understand if you have to 
                         drown her in the basement, Henry.

               The Sheriff sighs, nods to Wayne. Wayne puts the car in gear.

               EXT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT

               The water is creeping up the sloping hood of the truck.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We gotta get out of here.

                                     TOM
                         What about the money?

                                     CHARLIE
                         The money's safe; we're not. Water 
                         rose about a foot in the last twenty 
                         minutes. The National Guard isn't 
                         going to be here for another hour. 
                         You do the math.

               Tom shrugs -- Charlie's right. They're about to get out when 
               light washes up on them. They look out to see...

               THE HEADLIGHTS OF A GMC SUBURBAN

               Approaching on the other side of the dip, a quarter-mile 
               away.

               CHARLIE AND TOM

               Look at each other then get out of the truck.

               THE SUBURBAN

               Stops on the far side of the dip -- a hundred yards away. 
               The headlights shine across the water. Doors open and MEN 
               get out.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Come around the front of the truck. They can't see through 
               the glare of the Suburban's bright headlights.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hello!

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         You okay? You stuck?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes!

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         We'll see if we can get you out! 
                         We'll be right over!

               Charlie looks at Tom, relieved.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Looks like we might just --

               THE SUBURBAN

               Headlights go on high beam.

               CHARLIE AND TOM

               Squint, blinded by the high beams.

                                     TOM
                         Why'd they do that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Probably so they can see better.

                                     TOM
                         Or so we can't see at all.

               Charlie looks at him -- what does he mean? Tom puts his hand 
               on his pistol.

               IN THE WATER

               Assembled by the Suburban are...

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               All holding guns. He speaks to them quietly.

                                     JIM
                         This is my retirement fund, boys, 
                         and if any one of you screws up, I 
                         swear to God I'll kill you. Let's 
                         go.

               They start wading down into the dip in the road. Kenny carries 
               a rifle.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Tom squints through the bright light.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Company dispatch and the National 
                         Guard are the only ones who know 
                         we're here.

                                     TOM
                         Anyone with a scanner from Radio 
                         Shack could've intercepted your call, 
                         Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (realizes)
                         Jesus.

                                     TOM
                              (to Jim and men)
                         Could you turn down your lights?!

                                     JIM
                         We're bringing a rope!

                                     TOM
                         Turn down your lights!

                                     JIM
                         We'll be right there!

               Tom starts to pull his gun.

               KENNY

               is fired up on adrenalin. He has his rifle up and is aiming 
               it.

               HIS POV

               Tom with his hand on his pistol, starting to pull it out.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Charlie sees Tom going for his gun. He moves close to Tom, 
               half in front of him, putting his hand on Tom's.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Take it easy, Tom.

               KENNY

               Stiffens.

               KENNY'S FINGER

               Squeezes the trigger of his rifle.

               TOM

               Jumps at the sound of the rifle crack.

               CHARLIE

               Is knocked back.

               TOM

               Yanks out his gun and starts shooting back.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Duck down in the water.

               TOM

               Shooting blindly, looks over and sees...

               CHARLIE

               A horrible look on his face, blood coming out of his neck. 
               He sinks into the water.

               KENNY

               Shoots off another few quick rounds.

               TOM

               Drops into the water, bullets plugging in around him. Just 
               his hand and pistol are visible, shooting blindly back toward 
               Jim and his men. THE SUBURBAN

               Is hit by Tom's fire.

               TOM

               Runs out of bullets. A beat later we see Charlie start moving 
               through the water -- Tom is pulling him.

                                     JIM
                         STOP SHOOTING!

               KENNY

               Doesn't hear Jim and keeps firing.

               JIM

               Aims his pistol at Kenny's head.

                                     JIM
                         Stop.

               Kenny stops.

               BEHIND THE ARMORED TRUCK

               Tom comes up in the water behind the truck, gasping, holding 
               Charlie. Tom rests his gun on the truck bumper.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm sorry, Tom.

               Charlie's gone.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim glares at Kenny, his eyes on fire.

                                     KENNY
                         He was going for his gun!

                                     JIM
                         He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny. 
                         Goddamnit!
                              (shakes head, calls 
                              to Tom)
                         We just want the money! Get away and 
                         we won't have to kill you!

               TOM

               Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared.

                                     JIM (O.S.)
                         Now!

               Tom opens his eyes. He looks down at...

               CHARLIE

               Floating in the water.

               TOM

               What the hell is he going to do?

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim's men look at him. Jim motions them to wait some more.

                                     JIM
                         You got thirty seconds to get the 
                         hell away!

               Jim and the others wait, but there's no answer from Tom.

                                     JIM
                         The clock's running! Go!

               Still no response from Tom.

               THEIR POV

               All they can see is the front of the truck, in the light of 
               the "Welcome" sign. They can't see the back.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim nods to his men. They head for the truck, down into the 
               deeper water at the bottom of the dip in the road. All have 
               guns up and ready.

               Jim sends Mr. Mehlor and Ray out to circle around. They all 
               move quietly. The only sound is the rain.

               JIM

               Gets to the truck and moves along its side, Kenny right behind 
               him. Jim gets to the back of the truck, nods for Kenny to 
               cover him, then steps out behind the truck, gun up.

               JIM'S POV

               Tom is gone.

               CHARLIE

               Is floating in the water, eyes of glass.

               KENNY, MR. MEHLOR AND RAY

               Step into the circle of light thrown by the "Welcome" sign.

                                     JIM
                              (eyes Charlie)
                         Ah, Jesus.
                              (to Kenny)
                         Your dad'd be real proud of you, 
                         Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         He was going for his gun!

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Mehlor, I believe we're gonna 
                         need your science project.

               Mr. Mehlor nods and digs into his pack. Ray looks down at 
               Charlie in the water.

                                     RAY
                         "I shall bring floodwaters upon the 
                         earth to destroy all that lives under 
                         the heavens and every creature that 
                         has the breath of life in it shall 
                         perish." Genesis 6:17.

                                     KENNY
                         Were you a preacher or something?

               Ray laughs.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Ray did five years in the hole at 
                         Joliet. The only thing you get to 
                         read in the hole is the Bible.

                                     KENNY
                              (to Ray)
                         You got religion?

                                     RAY
                         Obviously.

               Mr. Mehlor laughs as he pulls something out of his pack. 
               It's...

               SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE

               A half-stick of dynamite with a timer, mounted on a magnet.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         When you hit the switch you've got 
                         thirty seconds.

                                     RAY
                         You teach your students how to make 
                         things like that?

               Mr. Mehlor puts the device on the back door.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         You been to a high school recently, 
                         Ray? My students taught me how to 
                         make things like that. Ready?

                                     JIM
                         Hold on.

               Something's wrong. Jim touches the handle on the door. It 
               moves. Uh-oh. He raises his pistol, grabs the door handle 
               and pulls. The door swings open. We don't need to see what 
               he sees -- we can tell from the expression on his face.

               EXT. ON THE ROAD

               Tom is running hard through the knee-deep water, pulling a 
               string of canvas money bags buckled together. The truck and 
               "Welcome" sign are two hundred yards behind him. Tom hears 
               an angry yell.

               EXT. BY THE ARMORED TRUCK

               Kenny is the one yelling.

                                     JIM
                         Shut up. Everyone.

               They quiet. The patter of the rain is too loud -- they can't 
               hear anything. Jim scans the horizon, but sees nothing.

                                     RAY
                         Now why'd he have to go and do a 
                         thing like that?

                                     JIM
                         To stay alive.
                              (off their looks)
                         He thinks we'll kill him -- unless 
                         he knows where the money is and we 
                         don't.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         There is another possibility.
                              (off their looks)
                         He's thinking of keeping it for 
                         himself.

                                     JIM
                         There's always that. Either way, we 
                         got ourselves a sharp one.

                                     KENNY
                         What do we do?

               Jim is looking at something in the distance.

                                     JIM
                         Pretty soon the water'll be too deep 
                         for him to run. But for us it'll be 
                         just deep enough.

                                     KENNY
                              (unclear)
                         Deep enough for what?

               INT. CAR AND BOAT DEALERSHIP - SHOWROOM

               A glass window is smashed and water floods into the boat 
               showroom. Jim and his men stride in. Kenny ogles a 
               particularly nice cruiser. Jim stops at a smallish ski-boat.

                                     JIM
                         Here we go.

                                     KENNY
                              (re: cruiser)
                         What about this monster?

                                     JIM
                              (re: ski-boat)
                         This is all we need.

                                     RAY
                         Shit, Jim, we're stealing. Can't we 
                         take anything we want?

                                     JIM
                         The water isn't very deep yet. We 
                         need something with a low draft. Mr. 
                         Mehlor -- find us some gasoline.

               Mr. Mehlor heads off.

               KENNY

               Sees something else he likes. We don't see what it is.

                                     KENNY
                         Oh, Jim...?

               EXT. CEMETERY

               The name WILLIAM PORTMAN is chiseled into a crypt. Tom appears 
               from underwater, gasping for breath. He gets to his feet and 
               trudges off through the water.

               EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE CEMETERY

               Tom comes out through the gates of the cemetery, splashing 
               through the knee-deep water. He's running when he hears, 
               from behind him, boat engines firing up. He turns to see...

               LIGHTS

               Racing toward him over the water, a hundred and fifty yards 
               back.

               TOM

               Sprints off.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Jim is steering the ski-boat. Mr. Mellor hunkers down beside 
               him. We PULL BACK to see...

               TWO JET-SKIS

               Flanking the ski-boat, piloted by Kenny and Ray.

               ON THE ROAD

               Tom is running as fast as he can. He looks back, sees the 
               ski-boat and jet-skis closing. They'll get him before he 
               gets to town. He suddenly veers off the road toward...

               THE HIGH SCHOOL

               The sign out front reads: GO WARRIORS!

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Tom runs around the side of the high school.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Ride up on the ski-boat and jet-skis and round the corner.

               THEIR POV

               No sign of Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Cut your engines!

               The engines are shut down. They all drift. Jim shines a 
               flashlight over onto...

               WINDOWS

               There's a hole in a window large enough to climb through.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM

               Tom wades through the classroom, pushing floating desks aside. 
               Flashlight beams stab into the room. Tom hurries to the hall.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim turns to his men.

                                     JIM
                         Let's get him out. But for Godsake, 
                         whatever you do...
                              (with a hard look at 
                              Kenny)
                         ...don't kill him. Not until we find 
                         out where he hid that money.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY

               Tom makes his way past banks of lockers, trying to get as 
               far as he can from the probing flashlight beams.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT DOORS

               Kenny drifts up to the front doors. He pulls on them. Locked.

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Mehlor?

               MR. MEHLOR

               Reaches into his pack.

               INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

               Tom tries lockers, looking for a place to hide.

               EXT. FRONT DOORS

               Kenny rides his jet-ski fast away from the front doors and 
               the doors explode.

               INT. SCHOOL FRONT LOBBY

               Tom ducks down as...

               A FIREBALL

               Shoots over him.

               KENNY AND RAY

               Ride the jet-skis into the flooded school.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom is swimming as hard as he can, out of breath. KENNY AND 
               RAY

               Ray goes off down a hall while Kenny idles in the lobby.

               TOM

               Surfaces, gasping.

               KENNY

               Hears the gasp, turns, grinning.

                                     KENNY
                         Enemy sub off the port bow!

               TOM

               Gets to his feet runs as fast as he can down the hall. He 
               rounds a corner and keeps going.

               KENNY

               Guns his engine and takes off after Tom.

               TOM

               Runs another thirty feet, then trips on something and goes 
               down.

               KENNY

               Comes around the corner, grinning when he sees...

               TOM

               Halfway down the hall, standing frozen, caught in Kenny's 
               light.

               KENNY

               Guns it, racing forward down the hall toward Tom.

                                     KENNY
                         Full steam ahead!

               THE JET-SKI

               Hits something underwater and stops.

               KENNY

               Keeps going. He flies through the air, slams headfirst into 
               a trophy case and drops into the water.

               TOM

               Stands up -- he was kneeling.

                                     TOM
                         Low tide, sailor.

               A HANDRAIL

               On the wall, angles down into the water. Underwater there 
               are a couple of steps leading up to a change in level in the 
               hall -- that's what the jet-ski grounded on.

               HALLWAY

               Ray motors down the hallway toward the corner.

                                     RAY
                         Kenny?

               HIS POV

               Around the corner comes a jet-ski. Ray assumes it's Kenny.

                                     RAY
                         See him?

               Then the jet-ski speeds up and shoots by him. Ray sees it's...

               TOM

               Wearing Kenny's hat and jacket.

               RAY

               Gives chase.

               SCHOOL HALLWAYS

               Ray races after Tom along the flooded hallways, taking the 
               turns fast. Ray pulls a gun, starts shooting.

               TOM'S POV

               Tearing through the halls, flashlight lighting the way. 
               Bullets hit the walls, ceiling, water around him.

               TOM

               Comes around a corner, sees the open front doors ahead of 
               him.

               JIM AND MR. MEHLOR

               Come into view in the ski-boat, blocking the exit.

               TOM

               Turns hard and speeds down a side hall.

               TOM'S POV

               A wall of windows at the end. No way out. Trapped. Then...

               KENNY

               Rises out of the water, blood running down his face, pistol 
               up.

               TOM

               Looks back.

               RAY

               Is on his tail.

               TOM

               Makes his choice and guns the jet-ski straight at Kenny.

                                     TOM
                         Yee-hah!

               KENNY

               Fires, misses and is knocked to the side as...

               TOM

               Hunches down on the jet-ski and crashes through the windows.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim and Mr. Mehlor are moving right outside the windows just 
               as Tom blasts out of the school and races off into the dark.

               EXT. OPEN WATER

               Tom moves fast over the water. He yanks off his clip-on tie.

               JIM AND THE OTHERS

               Chase Tom's light, behind by fifty yards, heading out into 
               farm fields. They get closer and closer and then watch as...

               TOM'S JET-SKI

               Runs straight into a tree and explodes.

               JIM AND THE OTHERS

               Race up to find the burning, flaming wreckage of the jet-
               ski. Ray circles on the other jet-ski. Kenny, still bleeding 
               from the head, is in the boat with Jim and Mr. Mehlor.

                                     KENNY
                              (laughing)
                         Nice driving, buttwipe!

                                     RAY
                         I'm glad you're enjoying this, Kenny, 
                         but if he's dead, how do we find the 
                         money?

               Kenny reacts -- oh, right.

                                     JIM
                         Oh, he's still alive.

               We see what Jim sees.

               ECU THROTTLE OF JET-SKI

               Tom used his tie to wrap the throttle open.

               HUNDRED YARDS AWAY

               Tom is hiding in the branches of a floating tree, watching 
               the distant lights of Jim and his men. The current carries 
               Tom away.

               WITH JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim scans the horizon; sees nothing.

                                     JIM
                         Ray, I'm in need of a little 
                         inspiration.

                                     RAY
                         "With a raging flood he makes an end 
                         of those who oppose him, and pursues 
                         his enemies into darkness." From one 
                         of the more obscure --

                                     KENNY
                         Sorry to interrupt Bible study and 
                         all, but has no one but me noticed 
                         how completely screwed we are? We 
                         should be back in the motel room, 
                         counting out the money. Instead --

               Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in 
               the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water. 
               Kenny comes up in the thigh-deep water, sputtering.

                                     JIM
                         No one likes this particular turn of 
                         events, Kenny, but we have a choice -- 
                         we can can either deal with it or we 
                         can walk away. There's a lot of money 
                         out there, so I choose to deal with 
                         it. If you want to go, that's fine -- 
                         start swimming. You want to stay, 
                         that's fine, too -- just stop your 
                         damn whining.

               Jim pushes the throttle forward and the ski-boat takes off, 
               leaving Ray on the jet-ski, with Kenny in the water.

                                     KENNY
                         What the hell's his problem? All the 
                         money in the world ain't worth a 
                         goddamn nickel if you get caught. 
                         It's not like there won't be other 
                         jobs.

                                     RAY
                         You may have more of these in you, 
                         Kenny, but Jim doesn't.

               Ray pulls Kenny up onto the jet-ski and takes off after Jim.

               EXT. BACK OF CHURCH - SANDBAG WALL

               The water level is creeping up a five-foot-high wall of 
               sandbags.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               Looking out over the top of the sandbag wall. A tree floats 
               by on the water.

               HANDS

               Suddenly appear on the top of the wall and...

               TOM

               Pulls himself into view. He climbs over the wall, exhausted.

               BEHIND THE SANDBAG WALL

               Gasoline-powered pumps are sucking up any rainwater. The 
               sandbags have kept the floodwater at bay.

               TOM

               He hurries up the back steps and goes into the church.

               INT. CHURCH - BACK ROOM

               Tom walks through a small room lined with closed cupboards. 
               He goes through a door.

               INT. CHURCH - MAIN HALL

               Tom comes out into the altar. He looks around, impressed. 
               It's a beautiful church. Scaffolding goes up one wall -- the 
               church is being restored. Tom is startled by a sound from 
               above. He grabs a heavy silver candlestick as a weapon and 
               looks up to see...

               BIRDS

               Fluttering up in the rafters.

               TOM

               Takes a breath. Just as he relaxes, he hears a whooshing 
               sound from behind him and turns to see...

               A LARGE CRUCIFIX

               Being swung at his head. Thunk and...

               THE SCREEN GOES BLACK

               FADE IN:

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom slowly regains consciousness, blinking his eyes. He 
               hears...

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         What are you doing here?

               But the Sheriff isn't asking Tom, he's asking...

               KAREN

               30, pretty, even in head-to-toe rain gear.

                                     KAREN
                         I was setting up pumps.

                                     WAYNE
                         I sure as hell don't get what you 
                         see in that church.

                                     KAREN
                         I wouldn't expect you to, Wayne.

                                     WAYNE
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Karen, did you think the order was 
                         for everyone but you to evacuate?

                                     KAREN
                         I was gonna go as soon as I filled 
                         the pumps, but the next thing I know, 
                         I've got a looter on my hands. Now, 
                         maybe I'm crazy, but I was expecting 
                         a little gratitude?

                                     PHIL
                         I think it's great what you did.

                                     WAYNE
                         That's it, Phil. That'll finally get 
                         you into her pants.

                                     PHIL
                         Shut up.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What if he'd had a gun, Karen? A lot 
                         of these looters carry guns.

                                     TOM (O.S.)
                         I'm not a looter.

               TOM

               Sits up on a cot, behind bars in the holding cell, woozy.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim and his men are searching the school for the money.

                                     RAY
                         Jim, it could be anywhere. It might 
                         not even be in the school.

                                     JIM
                         Keep looking.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The rain sheets down hard. A lightning flash reveals...

               THE STATUE

               The water is up to the horse's knees. The lightning passes 
               and a second later thunder rolls.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The Sheriff, Phil, Wayne and Karen stand outside the cell. 
               Tom is inside, on the cot. He touches the cut on his forehead.

                                     WAYNE
                         What were you doing at the church?

                                     KAREN
                         I told you -- he was looting it.

                                     TOM
                         I just said I'm not a looter!
                              (to Karen)
                         You're the one who nailed me?
                              (Karen nods)
                         You got a better arm than my ex-wife. 
                         What the hell did you hit me with -- 
                         a statue? I saw a flash of some guy 
                         coming at me.

                                     KAREN
                              (mumbles, embarrassed)
                         It was a crucifix.
                              (to others)
                         It was the only thing there!

                                     TOM
                         Oh, great. Now I'm gonna have people 
                         coming from around the world to see 
                         the face of Jesus on my forehead.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Look, son, what were you doing in 
                         the church?

                                     TOM
                         Looking for a place to hide out.

                                     WAYNE
                         From who -- Swamp Thing?

                                     TOM
                         The bastards who killed my partner.

               That stops the room.

                                     TOM
                         We were driving an armored truck. 
                         The truck got stuck out past the 
                         high school. They must've picked up 
                         our call to dispatch, 'cause they 
                         knew where we were. Charlie and I 
                         were just standing there and all 
                         hell broke loose.

                                     SHERIFF
                         How much money did you have?

                                     TOM
                         A little over three million.

               They all exchange a look -- that's a lot of money.

                                     TOM
                         The bank was afraid of looters. They 
                         had us cleaning out their branches 
                         up and down the river.

                                     WAYNE
                         They stole three million dollars?

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, I don't think so.

               They all look at the Sheriff. He looks at Tom.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You took the money, didn't you.

                                     TOM
                         I hid it in the cemetery. Tied it to 
                         a crypt for a guy named Portman.

                                     WAYNE
                         What the hell'd you do that for?

                                     TOM
                         I don't like to carry around that 
                         much cash.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Jesus, Wayne, use your head. If he 
                         hadn't hidden it, they woulda killed 
                         him, too.

               The Sheriff looks at Tom -- is that it? Tom nods.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You got any ID?

                                     TOM
                         No, it was in my jacket and I --

                                     WAYNE
                         Color me surprised.

               The Sheriff thinks for a beat, then tosses some keys to Phil.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Get out two rifles and a shotgun.

               Phil nods and goes to it. The Sheriff opens a desk drawer, 
               pulls out an ankle holster.

                                     WAYNE
                         You believe him?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Well, yes, Wayne, I do. And even if 
                         I didn't, I'd say we sure as hell 
                         had an obligation to check it out, 
                         don't you think?

               The Sheriff starts strapping on the ankle holster.

                                     TOM
                         I'll go with you. I can show you 
                         where --

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, I think you better stay put. But 
                         that was --

                                     WAYNE
                         Yeah, all we need is an armored car 
                         guy helping us out.

               The Sheriff thwacks Wayne in the ear.

                                     WAYNE
                         Ow!

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne, what's the worst that's ever 
                         happened to you? When old Mrs. Dugan 
                         went after you with a knife? This 
                         guy just got shot at!
                              (dismisses Wayne; to 
                              Tom)
                         Smart move with the money.

               Phil comes over with the guns.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Phil)
                         Wayne and I'll check out the cemetery. 
                         You escort Slugger...
                              (nods at Karen)
                         ...out of town. Get her to some high 
                         ground, then come on back.

               The Sheriff jams a small pistol into his ankle holster.

                                     KAREN
                         I have to fill the pumps --

                                     SHERIFF
                              (pulling her out)
                         Not any more you don't.

               The Sheriff straightens up, grabs a rifle from Phil and pulls 
               Karen to the door. Wayne goes to Tom's cell door and pulls 
               it shut with a click.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne...

                                     WAYNE
                         He could still be lying!

               The Sheriff rolls his eyes and gestures for Wayne to come 
               along. He opens the door for Karen, Wayne and Phil to go 
               through.

                                     TOM
                         Sheriff -- they killed my partner 
                         without any warning.

                                     SHERIFF
                         And they're gonna regret that, I 
                         guarantee you. They're gonna regret 
                         coming anywhere near this town 
                         tonight. And out he goes.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Water is halfway up the four-foot high wall of sandbags around 
               the station. There are three outboard motorboats moored to 
               the sandbags.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Phil, take Karen's boat.

               The Sheriff and Wayne climb toward their boats.

                                     WAYNE
                         You can do it, Phil. The men of 
                         Huntingburg are counting on you.

                                     PHIL
                         Just bite me.

               Wayne laughs as he and the Sheriff fire up their boat engines.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom hears boat engines start up and move away. He lays back 
               down on the cot, listening to the rain.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Empty. Light comes out from under the door to the bathroom.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Hank is on the can reading a copy of "American Survivalist" 
               magazine. An odd reaction comes over his face. He feels 
               something weird. He looks down.

               ON THE FLOOR

               Water is seeping in under the door.

                                     HANK
                         Holy shit!

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               The bathroom door flies open and Hank waddles out, pants 
               around his feet. He shuffles fast to the control wheels and 
               starts spinning them.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Two gates open fast, all the way, and water thunders out.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Hank pulls up his pants as he gets on the radio.

                                     HANK
                         Sheriff! Sheriff!

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring in their boats, zooming 
               through the trees, engine noise obliterating anything coming 
               in over the radio.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

                                     HANK
                              (on the radio)
                         Sheriff, come in!

               EXT. MAIN STREET - MOVING BOAT

               Phil steers Karen's small boat down Main Street, past the 
               statue. The water is up to the rider's stirrups.

                                     KAREN
                              (pleading)
                         Did you see the stained glass windows, 
                         Phil? Did you see what a good job 
                         they did? I can't let anything happen 
                         to the church, not after all I've 
                         put into it.

                                     PHIL
                         Karen, you know I'd do anything for 
                         you, but the Sheriff told me to get 
                         you out of town. I'm sorry. It's for 
                         your own good.

               Karen stands up.

                                     PHIL
                         What're you doing?

                                     KAREN
                         If you're not going to take me back 
                         to the church, then I'll swim.

               Karen moves to get out of the boat.

                                     PHIL
                         No. Hey, hold on.

               Phil lets go of the throttle and stands, moving toward Karen.

                                     KAREN
                         What am I saying?

               Karen suddenly turns on Phil and pushes him out of the boat.

                                     KAREN
                         This is my boat. You swim.

               Karen guns the engine and shoots off down a side street. 
               Phil stands in the waist-deep water and watches her go, 
               flabbergasted.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen comes around a corner and drives her boat up to the 
               church. The water is swirling quietly, still a good three 
               feet below the top of the wall.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN

               Close on the lighted "Welcome to Huntingburg" sign. There's 
               a rushing sound and a two-foot-high wall of water hits the 
               sign. The lights explode in geysers of sparks and the water 
               rushes on.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff and Wayne are racing through a grove of half-
               submerged trees. There's a rushing sound above the sound of 
               the engines. WHAM! and they're hit by the wall of water. 
               Wayne falls out of his boat and is lost in the swirling water.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Jim and his men are motoring down an alleyway when...

               THE WALL OF WATER

               Rushes down the alley.

               RAY

               The water hits him hard, knocking him off the jet-ski. He's 
               swept away by the water.

               CLOSE ON A FENCE LACED WITH CONCERTINA WIRE

               The surge water shoots through it. And suddenly there's...

               RAY

               Slammed up against the fence, pinned to it, water rushing 
               over and around and by him. He yells as the wire cuts into 
               him.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen is pouring gasoline into the pumps.

               She hears the rushing and looks up as the surge hits. Water 
               shoots over the top.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom hears the sound and opens his eyes -- what the hell is 
               that?

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The wall of water slams in hard, cascading over the sandbag 
               wall.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               TOM SITS UP, SWINGING HIS LEGS OVER THE SIDE OF THE COT. HE 
               REACTS, LOOKS DOWN. HIS POV

               There's two feet of water in the station.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The building is like a rock in a stream, with the water 
               rushing up high against one wall, roiling and swirling around 
               the sides.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom looks over, stunned, to see... THE DOOR

               As a fine stream spits in through the keyhole.

               THE WINDOWS

               Are heaving as the water rises up against them.

               TOM

               Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell. He 
               remembers -- uh-oh: the cell door is locked.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Jim pulls Ray, coughing, choking, bleeding, into the ski-
               boat.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The water level inside is rising fast. It hits the wall 
               sockets and there's a spit of sparks, then all the desk lamps 
               go dark. Light still comes from overhead fluorescent panels. 
               Tom sees...

               TWO KEYS ON A KEY RING

               Laying on the Sheriff's wooden desk. They're four feet away -- 
               too far to reach.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen suddenly has a horrible thought and stops. She shakes 
               it off -- doesn't want to think about it -- and mutters to 
               herself.

                                     KAREN
                         They'll get him out.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Phil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below 
               him.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               Wayne gets back into his boat. The Sheriff realizes something.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne... You locked him in.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in 
               the water. The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating. Tom 
               gets an idea. He takes his belt off.

               EXT. NEAR SHERIFF'S STATION

               A telephone pole is half-submerged, being pulled along fast 
               by the current.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at...

               THE DESK

               Bobbing in the rising water. He misses the keys.

               TOM AND THE DESK

               Tom tries again. The belt lands on the desk top.

               Tom very gently starts pulling. Too hard; the belt starts 
               slipping off the desk. He gets it just right and the desk 
               starts moving toward Tom. He reaches out with his hand, 
               stretching.

               HIS FINGERS

               Touch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and 
               he just gets a firm grip on the desk when...

               THE TELEPHONE POLE

               Smashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window, 
               shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the 
               room.

               THE DESK

               Is moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs...

               THE KEYS

               And grips them tight.

               TOM

               Tries the keys in the lock. They don't fit. He looks at them.

               CU KEYS

               The tag is emblazoned with the Ford logo.

                                     TOM
                         Great! I can drive out of here!

               Tom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at...

               THE WATER LEVEL

               Rising very fast. A foot in ten seconds.

               TOM

               Climbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him. He's 
               running out of room between himself and the ceiling. Three 
               feet. Two feet. He's being pushed up by the water toward...

               FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE

               On the ceiling, caged in a wire cover.

               TOM

               Is terrified, about to die. The water rises up past his face.

               TOM'S HANDS

               Pull his Maglite flashlight from his belt. He takes off the 
               lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out.

               TOM

               Sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over 
               the light fixture.

               He blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then 
               breathes. Reprieve for a few moments and then...

               THE WATER

               Reaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle 
               in when...

               THE FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE

               Goes dark. In the darkness, there's the sound of tubes 
               breaking and metal being wrenched.

               TOM

               Looks up, astonished, to see...

               THE FLUORESCENT FIXTURE

               Being lifted up and away from above. Streetlight comes in, 
               silhouetting...

               A FIGURE

               Standing on the roof. The figure leans down and starts tugging 
               at the wire cage over the inside of the fixture. In the light, 
               Tom sees that it's...

               KAREN

               And she's pulling as hard as she can, but the wire cage isn't 
               budging. She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small 
               knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in 
               place. She gets two screws out.

               TOM

               Pulls on the cage and it swings down. He climbs up it.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION ROOF

               Tom surfaces in a hole in the roof. There's a vent duct laying 
               on the roof -- Karen must've kicked that over to get to the 
               light fixture. Karen helps Tom up. She sits and he lays down 
               on the roof, catching his breath.

                                     TOM
                         Thank you.

                                     KAREN
                         I owed you -- for hitting you and 
                         all. But we're even now, okay?

                                     TOM
                         Even.
                              (beat, looks around)
                         What happened?

                                     KAREN
                         I don't know.

               They get up.

                                     KAREN
                         Maybe another levee broke upriver. 
                         They've been --

               Just then...

               A PROPANE TANK

               Explodes. The fireball rips across the dark sky, illuminating 
               everything, showing...

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Fifty feet away -- Jim, Mr. Mehlor and Ray in the ski-boat 
               and Kenny on the jet-ski -- guns aimed at Tom and Karen.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God.

               DARKNESS

               As the lightning passes, and in the darkness, the thunder 
               rolls.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Switch on their lights and move forward. They pass...

               CARS

               Floating down the street with other debris. The cars have 
               been damaged by the flood -- one is missing a door.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               When they get closer to the Sheriff's station, what they see -- 
               or don't see -- makes them stop.

               THEIR POV

               Tom and Karen have disappeared. Karen's boat is still moored 
               to the Sheriff's station roof, empty.

                                     JIM
                         They're in the water! Kenny, cut 
                         your engine!

               Kenny shuts off the engine of the one remaining jet-ski. Jim 
               shuts down the boat engine. They float in silence, scanning 
               the water with their flashlights. There's no sign of Tom and 
               Karen.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom motions Karen to follow him. She's freaked and hesitates. 
               Tom grabs her hand and pulls her.

               THEIR POV

               The ski-boat and jet-ski are right above them, flashlights 
               playing over the water.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Reach the roof of the Sheriff's station. Jim looks around.

                                     JIM
                         Kenny, go that way. We'll go down 
                         here.

               LONG SHOT POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD

               Of Kenny and Jim heading off in different directions.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Rise into view in a car. They gasp for air and keep low.

                                     KAREN
                         Tell them where the money is.

                                     TOM
                         I can't.

                                     KAREN
                         Well, I can.

               She's about to call out. Tom grabs her hard.

                                     TOM
                         If they know where the money is, 
                         they will kill us.

               Before Karen can say anything, a flashlight beam comes 
               swinging toward them and they have to duck underwater.

               JIM

               Watches as his flashlight beam washes over the car. Nothing 
               there. He guns his engine and heads off down the street.

               THE CAR

               Floats off around a corner.

               IN THE CAR

               Tom and Karen surface, catch their breath. Quiet for a few 
               moments as they both look around to see that Jim and his men 
               are gone.

                                     KAREN
                         So what do we do?

                                     TOM
                         I guess just drive around until we 
                         run out of gas.

                                     KAREN
                              (pissed)
                         Look, I've spent the last eight months 
                         of my life restoring that church, 
                         and I just left it to come save your 
                         ass, so spare me, okay?

                                     TOM
                              (beat)
                         When we get down here a little further 
                         we'll find a place for you to hide.
                              (off her look)
                         I'm gonna get back to the truck and 
                         wait for the National Guard.
                              (checks watch)
                         They should be there pretty soon.

               Karen nods. Tom looks at her. She's shivering.

                                     TOM
                         Cold?

                                     KAREN
                         No, I'm fine. The heater just kicked 
                         in.

               Tom looks at her, gives a little grin. Their eyes meet for a 
               second, then they look away.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Phil climbs up onto the roof, exhausted. He sees the hole in 
               the roof and goes to look at it. As he's looking down...

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         Is he dead?

               Phil turns to see...

               THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE

               Coasting up in their boats.

                                     PHIL
                         No. Someone got him out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Who?

                                     PHIL
                              (hesitates)
                         Maybe Karen.

                                     WAYNE
                         Karen? How could she get him out? 
                         You took her out of town.

                                     PHIL
                         I -- It --

                                     SHERIFF
                         Let's hear it, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         It happened real fast, okay?

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Tom and Karen float down the alley in the car.

                                     KAREN
                         You ever been robbed before?

                                     TOM
                         No. The scariest thing that ever 
                         happened before was Charlie running 
                         out of donuts.
                              (off her look)
                         I've only been doing this for a couple 
                         months.

                                     KAREN
                              (not what she wanted 
                              to hear)
                         Oh.

               Silence for a few moments.

                                     KAREN
                         What'd you do before this?

                                     TOM
                         I, uh... I sold construction 
                         machinery.
                              (off her look)
                         I was making good money, it just... 
                         I don't know. It just didn't seem 
                         right for me anymore.

                                     KAREN
                         How'd you end up in this?

                                     TOM
                         My uncle did me a favor; got me in.

                                     KAREN
                         Nice favor. How's he gonna feel after 
                         tonight?

                                     TOM
                         My uncle was Charlie -- my partner 
                         in the truck.

                                     KAREN
                         Oh, God. I'm sorry.

               Tom nods -- so is he.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Phil climbs into the Sheriff's boat.

                                     WAYNE
                         She know karate or something, Phil? 
                         Maybe kung fu? I mean, I can't see 
                         how else she could overpower the 
                         likes of you.

                                     PHIL
                         Shut up, Wayne.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Shut up, both of you. Let's go find 
                         Karen; see if she's got him.

               The Sheriff fires up his engine and heads off, Wayne 
               following.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Karen and Tom are still in the car. They freeze at the sound 
               of engines in the distance. The sounds fade. Tom looks around.

                                     TOM
                         God, I wonder whose car this is.

               Karen plucks some cassette tapes out of the water.

                                     KAREN
                         Well, whoever it is, he listens to 
                         Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and the 
                         soundtrack to "Footloose."

                                     TOM
                         Really?
                              (looks at tapes)
                         Hold on...
                              (looks around car)
                         ...I think this is my car from high 
                         school.

               Karen laughs. Just then...

               THE CAR

               Gets caught on something and stops.

                                     TOM
                         Looks like we get out here.
                              (Karen hesitates)
                         Come on -- I told your father I'd 
                         have you home by ten.

               Karen grins. Just then...

               A TRANSFORMER

               down the street explodes.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Hear a sparking sound and look over to see...

               A TRANSFORMER

               On a telephone/power pole close to them. Rain hits it, causing 
               the sparking sound. The floodwater is inching up the pole 
               toward it.

               The water will reach the transformer in a matter of seconds. 
               And while they're staring at that...

               ANOTHER TRANSFORMER

               At the end of the street explodes as water hits it.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look around -- what to do? Tom points.

                                     TOM
                         There!

               They climb out of the car and start swimming toward a house.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               Water is three inches from the transformer; two inches...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Swimming as hard as they can.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               One inch from the water...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Reach the house. They pull themselves up onto a television 
               antenna/ladder running up the side of the house. Karen's 
               feet are still in the water.

                                     TOM
                         Get your feet up!

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The water is about to touch. There's a sizzling sound.

               TOM AND KAREN

               They heave a huge sigh of relief -- but then Tom realizes...

                                     TOM
                         Oh, shit!

                                     KAREN
                         What?

                                     TOM
                              (re: antenna/ladder)
                         It's metal!

               Tom pushes Karen over onto a window ledge. Then, just as 
               Tom's about to step over...

               KENNY

               Comes screaming in on the jet-ski. He dives off the jetski, 
               gets a hold of Tom and pulls him under.

               KENNY AND TOM

               Surface. Kenny is stronger and he has Tom in a tight grip. 
               One problem -- Kenny doesn't know the danger they're in.

                                     TOM
                         We've gotta --!

               Kenny shoves Tom underwater.

                                     KENNY
                         HEY! I GOT HIM!

               Tom comes up, looks over at...

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The sizzling is getting louder.

                                     TOM
                         We have to --!

               Kenny dunks Tom again.

                                     KENNY
                         I GOT HIM!

               UNDERWATER

               Tom grabs Kenny's arms and pulls himself up fast.

               KENNY AND TOM

               Tom's head comes out of the water and slams into Kenny's 
               chin. Kenny is stunned. Tom gets free of his grasp.

                                     KAREN
                         Hurry!

               Tom does the backstroke, pulling hard toward Karen.

               KENNY

               Still stunned, finally hears the sizzling and looks over 
               at...

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The water touches the outer casing of the transformer.

               KENNY

               Starts swimming fast toward...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Karen grabs Tom's arm and Tom gets a hold of the windowsill 
               and pulls himself up.

               KENNY

               Grabs onto...

               THE TV ANTENNA

               And starts pulling himself out of the water.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               Explodes.

               KENNY

               Feels pretty pleased with himself until...

               THE TV ANTENNA

               Starts dancing with electricity and...

               KENNY

               Is hit by the voltage and his teeth clamp shut and his body 
               goes rigid and his clothes explode in flames.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look away.

               THE WATER

               Dead fish start floating to the surface.

               KENNY

               Is fried, smoking. He falls off the TV antenna and hits the 
               water with a loud and ugly hiss. He floats away, his body 
               shaking spasmodically.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Tom hears an engine approaching. He looks around, then smashes 
               the window with his elbow.

               INT. HOUSE

               The window glass tumbles in. Tom reaches in, undoes the latch 
               and slides up the window. He climbs in, straddling the window 
               sill. The camera moves down Tom's leg to show...

               A WOLF TRAP

               Laying on the floor, just below the window.

               TOM

               Is oblivious. He starts to put his foot down into the trap. 
               Just then he knocks...

               A POTTED CACTUS

               Off the windowsill. It falls straight down into...

               THE WOLF TRAP

               Hitting the trigger. The jaws snap, obliterating the cactus.

                                     TOM
                         Jesus Christ!

               A SHOTGUN BARREL

               Snaps into view, pointing right at Tom's head.

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         You so much as breathe funny and 
                         your head is going back out that 
                         window without you.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Jim drives the boat down the street. Mr. Mehlor is scanning 
               the water with a flashlight.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Jim! Over there!

               Jim looks over to see...

               THE JET-SKI

               Floating in the water. And not far from it is...

               KENNY

               Still twitching.

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM

               Doreen holds the shotgun on Tom and Karen as they move away 
               from the window, hands raised.

                                     DOREEN
                         Real slow now. Like you were in a 
                         big jar of molasses. That's it.

               They hear footsteps coming down old wood stairs.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Doreen? You haven't killed anybody, 
                         have you?

                                     DOREEN
                         I've got everything under control, 
                         Henry. You go back up.

               Henry enters.

                                     HENRY
                         Jesus, Doreen, you caught a whole 
                         gang.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Jim and Mr. Mehlor pull Kenny into the ski-boat. Kenny is 
               shivering. Part of his hair has been burned away.

                                     KENNY
                         Jesus, God, it hurts!

                                     JIM
                         You're gonna be okay, Ken. Mr. Mehlor 
                         knows these things and he thinks 
                         you're gonna be okay.

               Mr. Mehlor looks at Jim. Mr. Mehlor knows these things and 
               he thinks Kenny is going to die.

                                     KENNY
                         It hurts!

                                     JIM
                         Don't you, Mr. Mehlor? Don't you 
                         think Kenny's gonna be okay?

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Yeah, Kenny. You're gonna be fine.

                                     KENNY
                         Jesus, I can't stop shivering.

               Mr. Mehlor moves aside. Jim puts his arms around Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         I know you didn't want me to come.

                                     JIM
                         You kidding? We couldn't've done 
                         anything without you.

                                     KENNY
                         My dad'd sure be pissed off, huh?

                                     JIM
                         Your dad'd just want you to lay still 
                         while we got you some help.

                                     KENNY
                         Hey -- hey the pain's goin'.
                              (relief)
                         Oh, man.

               He looks up at Jim and grins.

                                     KENNY
                         When you said I was gonna be okay, I 
                         thought you were just shittin' me.

                                     JIM
                         See? You gotta trust me.

               Kenny's shivering stops. It stops because he's dead. Jim 
               slowly lets go.

               INT. HENRY AND DOREEN'S ATTIC

               Henry and Doreen have brought everything into their attic -- 
               a TV, some silver and china, bowling trophies. A Coleman 
               lantern lights the room.

                                     DOREEN
                              (sarcastic)
                         Well, isn't that just wonderful! Now 
                         these bastards are gonna want to 
                         kill us, too! Why the hell did you 
                         have to come to this house?

                                     KAREN
                         We thought it was empty.

                                     DOREEN
                         You know what? The house next door 
                         is empty. So whaddya say we go back 
                         downstairs and you two keep moving?

                                     HENRY
                         We are not going to send these people 
                         out to the wolves.

                                     DOREEN
                         Oh, we're not, are we? Then what's 
                         your plan, General Schwartzkopf?

                                     HENRY
                         I -- I just don't think --

                                     TOM
                         It's okay. I have to go anyway.

               They look at him, surprised.

                                     TOM
                         The National Guard'll be at the truck 
                         in about fifteen minutes. I'm gonna 
                         go wait for them.

                                     DOREEN
                         You can't swim that far in fifteen 
                         minutes.

                                     HENRY
                         He could take our boat.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry!

                                     HENRY
                              (to Tom)
                         I'll go get it ready for you.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry, he is not taking our boat.

               Henry ignores Doreen. He pushes the attic stairs down, heads 
               down them.

                                     DOREEN
                              (grabs TV; to Tom)
                         Here. You want a TV too? How about 
                         some china? Maybe our silver?
                              (sets TV down)
                         Henry! Henry, you leave the boat 
                         where it is!

               Doreen heads off down the stairs. Tom starts down the stairs, 
               stops.

                                     TOM
                         Karen?
                              (she looks at him)
                         I'm Tom.

               They shake hands.

                                     KAREN
                         Watch yourself, Tom. I really don't 
                         wanna have to save your life again.

               Tom nods and goes down the stairs.

               EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE

               Henry stands on the roof of the back porch, steadying a small 
               rowboat as Tom gets in. Doreen nags from the window.

                                     DOREEN
                         You give away our only boat in the 
                         middle of a flood. You are a genius, 
                         Henry. A goddamn genius.

                                     TOM
                              (whispers to Henry, 
                              re: Doreen)
                         You wanna come with me?

               Henry looks at Tom, entertaining the notion...

                                     DOREEN
                         Jesus, Henry, what are you waiting 
                         for -- a kiss goodbye? Get back in 
                         here.

               Henry sighs and lets go of the boat. Tom rows off.

               LONG SHOT OF TOM

               We see him in silhouette, crossing the gap between two houses.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Are watching, from the shadows on the dark side of the street.

                                     RAY
                         Why don't we just get him?

                                     JIM
                         If our resourceful young friend hears 
                         us coming, he'll electrocute us or 
                         sink us or one of you'll shoot him. 
                         Besides...
                              (glances at watch)
                         ...I know where he's going. What I'd 
                         like to know is where he came from.

               EXT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff sits in his boat, moored to the wall of sandbags 
               around the church. Wayne's boat is tied up next to it. The 
               floodwater is trickling over the top of the wall. The gas-
               powered pumps inside the wall are keeping the waters at bay.

               WAYNE AND PHIL

               Come out of the front doors of the church.

                                     WAYNE
                         They're not here.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN

               Tom rows up to the truck and "Welcome" sign. His flashlight 
               shows just the top of the truck and sign. Tom looks at his 
               watch, ties the rowboat to the sign, jumps into the water.

               A few moments pass, then Tom surfaces, holding a shotgun. 
               Then he senses something behind him and turns to see...

               A COW

               Floating in the water, tongue out, eyes glassy.

               TOM

               Kicks away, horrified. And then he hears an engine. He looks.

               TOM'S POV

               Jim's ski-boat is coming over the water. The engine cuts out 
               and the ski-boat drifts, a hundred feet from Tom.

                                     JIM
                              (yelling)
                         Son, before you go underwater and do 
                         something tricky, there's something 
                         I'd like you to see!

               A flashlight comes on, the beam swivels, illuminating...

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               Standing in the ski-boat, blinking in the light.

               TOM

               Slumps.

                                     JIM
                         Now, I know it's your job to protect 
                         that money, and maybe you'd even be 
                         foolish enough to give your life for 
                         it. The question is, are you willing 
                         to give their lives for it?

               Jim puts a pistol to Doreen's head.

                                     JIM
                         Drop the gun and get into the boat.

               TOM

               Thinks for a second, then throws the shotgun away and pulls 
               himself into the rowboat.

                                     JIM
                         Excellent choice.

               TOM, JIM, HENRY AND DOREEN

               As Tom and Jim call to each other across the water, Doreen 
               goes at Henry.

                                     TOM
                         I'll take you to the money, but you 
                         gotta let them go.

                                     DOREEN
                         I hope you're proud of yourself, 
                         Henry Sears.

                                     HENRY
                         Shh.

                                     JIM
                         I think it'd be best if --

                                     DOREEN
                         I told you not to give him the goddamn 
                         boat.

                                     HENRY
                         Doreen, please.

                                     JIM
                         I think it'd be best if we all stayed 
                         together.

                                     TOM
                         You say all you want is the money? 
                         Prove it. Let them go.

                                     JIM
                         I don't know if that's --

                                     DOREEN
                         We could be safe in our home instead 
                         of out here in a boat with these low-
                         life scumbags!

                                     JIM
                              (after a look at 
                              Doreen, nods to Mr. 
                              Mehlor)
                         Let 'em go.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil motor past the statue. Wayne is 
               driving his boat; Phil is with the Sheriff. The water is up 
               to the General's neck.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN

               Tom helps Henry and Doreen over into the rowboat. As he does, 
               his face comes close to Henry's for a second.

                                     TOM
                              (whisper)
                         Karen?

                                     HENRY
                              (shakes head, whispers)
                         In the attic. They never saw her.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Karen swims down the center of the street.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN

               Tom is in the ski-boat with Jim. He looks out at...

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               As Henry rows them off into the darkness.

                                     DOREEN
                              (disappearing in dark)
                         Faster, Henry! The bastards might 
                         change their minds! Stop lily- dipping 
                         and move it!

               Henry starts to turn the boat around.

                                     DOREEN
                         What're you doing?

                                     HENRY
                         I'm gonna row back there and see if 
                         he'll shoot you. Or me. Fine either 
                         way.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry...?

                                     HENRY
                         Do you want me to get us out of here?

                                     DOREEN
                         Yes, of course, I --

                                     HENRY
                         Then shut the fuck up.

               Henry turns the boat around and rows off. Doreen is silent.

               JIM'S SKI-BOAT

               Jim shakes his head. Tom looks at Ray, coughing and at Kenny, 
               dead. Tom doesn't know what to say.

                                     TOM
                         I...

                                     JIM
                         The only thing I want to hear from 
                         you is where the money is.

               EXT. STREET

               The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring fast down a street, the 
               Sheriff leading. The Sheriff sees something in the water in 
               front of him. He curses and throttles down fast.

               KAREN

               Is in the water, exhausted and cold.

               EXT. CEMETERY

               Jim pilots the ski-boat into the cemetery. All are aghast.

               A DOZEN CASKETS

               Are floating in the water. Half of them have drifted up 
               against the fence; the others are headed that way.

                                     JIM
                         I wonder where they think they're 
                         going.

                                     RAY
                         What the hell's going on?

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         This happened in a flood in Georgia. 
                         The ground gets soggy, and the caskets 
                         are air-tight -- anyone who hasn't 
                         been planted too long just pops up.

                                     RAY
                         You teach your students stuff like 
                         that? No wonder they kicked you out.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         I didn't teach my students anything 
                         at all.

                                     JIM
                              (to Tom)
                         Where is it?

                                     TOM
                         It's hard to tell now with the water 
                         so deep.

               Jim cocks the hammer on his pistol. Tom gets the hint.

                                     TOM
                         It's down there a little further.

               Jim nods, gives the engine some juice and they move on.

               TOM

               Takes a quick look at his watch.

               JIM

               Sees Tom looking at his watch.

               EXT. STREET

               Karen is in the Sheriff's boat, wearing Phil's jacket, trying 
               to warm up.

                                     KAREN
                         Tom went off in their rowboat.

                                     WAYNE
                              (to Phil)
                         It's Tom now. Looks like you lost 
                         out, pal.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Where was he going?

                                     KAREN
                         Back to the armored truck.

               EXT. CEMETERY

               Jim throttles down the ski-boat engine.

                                     JIM
                         Here?

                                     TOM
                         Uh... no. A little farther --

                                     JIM
                         They're not coming, son.

               Tom looks over at Jim, pretending to be confused.

                                     TOM
                         What?

                                     JIM
                         The National Guard. They're not 
                         coming.

                                     TOM
                         I don't --

                                     JIM
                         I know you've been trying to stall 
                         until they show up, but they're not 
                         coming.

                                     TOM
                              (pause as he realizes)
                         Oh, God. You intercepted Charlie's 
                         call, then you called them off.

                                     JIM
                         No, son, I didn't call them off. 
                         They never were coming. We didn't 
                         "intercept" Charlie's call. He called 
                         us direct.

               And on Tom's look of disbelief...

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Hank is on the radio.

                                     HANK
                         I'd love to help you, Sheriff, but I 
                         can't leave! If the water goes over 
                         the top again it's bye-bye, dam! Bye-
                         bye, town! In fact, I could use a 
                         little help up here myself.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff is in his boat; Wayne is back in his own. The 
               Sheriff is on the radio.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank, remember when Mike Crane holed 
                         up in Jack Finch's barn and said he 
                         was gonna burn it down?

               CROSSCUT WITH HANK

                                     HANK
                         Hey, I was the one who got the dumb 
                         son-of-a-bitch to come out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Right. And before you went in, I 
                         deputized you, you dumb son-of-a-
                         bitch! So when I say get down here, 
                         it's not a request, it's an order. 
                         So get down here! Now! I won't need 
                         you for long. And bring your gun.

               EXT. CEMETERY

                                     JIM
                         We were gonna hit you just before 
                         you got on the Interstate, but then 
                         you got stuck so we had to change 
                         our plans and take you --

                                     TOM
                         Bullshit. This is all bullshit.

                                     JIM
                         I knew Charlie when we were both 
                         working construction for the Johnstown 
                         company. His middle name was McCarthy 
                         because his parents loved Charlie 
                         McCarthy on the radio. His wife's 
                         name was Mary. She died of a heart-
                         attack last year. He has a daughter 
                         and a son, both grown with children 
                         of their own. I'm afraid I don't 
                         know the names of the grandchildren.

               Tom looks down, not wanting to believe.

                                     JIM
                         What else do I know...? Oh, yes. I 
                         know Uncle Charlie was trying to 
                         steer his favorite nephew away from 
                         a life of crime.

               Tom suddenly lunges for Jim. Ray yanks Tom back.

                                     TOM
                         Why'd you shoot him? Kill Charlie 
                         and you get to keep another share?

                                     JIM
                         No, That was an accident. Ken shot 
                         him.
                              (eyes Kenny sadly)
                         I never told him Charlie was on my 
                         side. Ken liked to talk.
                              (shakes head)
                         He shouldn't've been here. But his 
                         dad asked me to watch over him. I 
                         guess I didn't do the best job.

                                     RAY
                         Excuse me, Jim. I hate to interrupt 
                         and all, but could we just get the 
                         money and get the hell out of here?

                                     JIM
                              (nods; to Tom)
                         I'm gonna ask you one more time. And 
                         before you think of bullshitting me 
                         again, keep in mind I have had a 
                         very frustrating night. And while I 
                         know I'll never get the money if I 
                         kill you, it's getting to the point 
                         where I just don't care.

               Jim casually aims his gun at Tom.

                                     TOM
                         I'll tell you where it is. But it's 
                         not going to do you any good.

               Jim arches an eyebrow.

                                     TOM
                         The Guard may not be coming, but 
                         someone else sure as hell is.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN THE SHERIFF

               At the controls of his boat, moving fast, sprayed by rain. 
               Karen and Phil are in the back of the boat. Wayne is close 
               behind in his boat.

               EXT. CEMETERY

                                     JIM
                         I'll take my chances.

               Tom pauses, looks over to...

               THE CRYPT

               Just the top of it is visible. Two more COFFINS float nearby.

                                     TOM
                         There.

               Jim steers the ski-boat over, hands Tom a flashlight.

                                     JIM
                         Well, go get it.

               Tom climbs over the edge of the ski-boat and into the water. 
               He turns on the flashlight and drops below the surface.

                                     RAY
                              (eyeing Tom in water)
                         "At night we'd go down to the river 
                         and into the river we'd dive."
                              (off Jim and Mehlor's 
                              looks)
                         Springsteen, "The River." I'm all 
                         out of bible quotes.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom shines his light on...

               THE CRYPT

               One end of a rope is tied to the crypt. The other end, cut 
               and frayed, is suspended in the water, waving in the current.

               ON THE WATER

               Jim watches Tom's light rise. Tom comes up fast, takes a 
               breath.

                                     TOM
                         It's gone.

                                     JIM
                         What?

                                     TOM
                              (smug)
                         Looks like somebody beat you to it.

                                     RAY
                         Oh for Christs -- I'm gonna shoot 
                         him, Jim.

               Ray grabs pistol in his belt. Before he can pull it out, 
               holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the 
               sound of the rifle-shots. Ray tumbles into the water. A half-
               second later there's...

               HAIL OF BULLETS

               Ripping into the ski-boat, water, trees, crypt.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT, WAYNE'S BOAT

               Are outside the fence, a hundred feet from the crypt. PUSH 
               IN FAST on...

               THE SHERIFF

               To the rescue. He and Wayne and Phil fire their guns.

               TOM

               Ducks underwater.

               JIM

               Pulls his pistol, returns fire.

               MR. MEHLOR

               Opens fire with a shotgun, shooting wild, yelling. Then he's 
               hit and knocked out of the boat, dead.

               IN THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     KAREN
                         Stop! You'll hit Tom!

               The Sheriff stops shooting, yells at the others.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hold your fire!

               Wayne and Phil stop shooting.

               BY THE CRYPT

               Tom is holding onto a coffin, out of view of the Sheriff. He 
               hears a rush of bubbles and turns as...

               JIM

               Comes to the surface, breathing deep.

               JIM'S GUN

               Comes out of the water fast and the barrel goes to Tom's 
               forehead.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

               There's an adrenal fire in the Sheriff's eyes. He starts his 
               boat forward, Wayne following. Their lights find...

               JIM'S BOAT

               No sign of life. Then there's a sound and the lights sweep 
               over to find...

               JIM AND TOM

               Climbing up on top of the mostly-submerged crypt. Jim is 
               behind Tom with his gun to Tom's head.

               THE SHERIFF

               Stops his boat. Wayne stops, too. They are thirty yards from 
               Jim and Tom.

               KAREN AND TOM

               A look passes between them.

                                     JIM
                              (to Sheriff)
                         Now, sir, I can imagine you'd love 
                         nothing more than to shoot me, but I 
                         caution you -- in order to do that, 
                         you're gonna have to shoot through 
                         young Tom here.

               THE SHERIFF

               Thinks for a second, then shrugs.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Okay.

               He raises his rifle.

               KAREN

               Realizes what is about to happen.

               TOM AND JIM

               Also clue in, but before they can move...

               THE SHERIFF

               Squeezes the trigger as...

               KAREN

               Hits the gun with her arm.

               THE RIFLE

               Fires.

               TOM

               is grazed in the arm by the bullet.

               THE SHERIFF

               Smacks Karen hard with his rifle and she tumbles out of the 
               boat, unconscious.

               TOM AND JIM

               Throw themselves back off the crypt as...

               THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE

               Empty their guns in their direction.

               JIM

               Returns fire, shooting blindly over the top of the crypt.

               PHIL

               Reaches for Karen, floating limp in the water, but...

               WAYNE

               Is closer. He grabs Karen and pulls her into his boat, then 
               grins at Phil.

               TOM AND JIM

               Are behind the crypt. Tom holds his bleeding arm. Jim reloads.

                                     TOM
                         Well, that was unexpected.

                                     JIM
                         Is he the one you thought was coming 
                         to your rescue?

               No answer from Tom, but the answer is clear.

               WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               The Sheriff and Wayne reload.

                                     HANK (O.S.)
                         Anyone mind telling me what the hell 
                         is going on?

               The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil turn to see...

               HANK

               In his boat, right behind them, all dressed up in hunting 
               gear, rifle at the ready.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hey, Hank. That money I told you 
                         about? From the armored car? We're 
                         gonna keep it. Three million dollars. 
                         Four ways.
                              (shoots at crypt)
                         Seven fifty apiece. You okay with 
                         that?

               Hank is stunned. He doesn't answer.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank? You okay with that?

                                     HANK
                         Seven hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars?
                              (beat, grins)
                         Damn straight I'm okay with that.

                                     WAYNE
                              (grumbling, re: Hank)
                         Don't see what we needed him for.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Then I guess you've never been hunting 
                         with Hank.
                              (to Hank)
                         We got two behind that crypt. Get 
                         'em.

               Hank nods. He motions for Wayne to go one way; he'll go the 
               other. They start off. A blind shot comes from Jim behind 
               the crypt. The Sheriff shoots back. Phil finally musters up 
               the courage to say something.

                                     PHIL
                         Maybe I'm not okay with it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Come on now, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         You're gonna kill people?

                                     SHERIFF
                         They're looters, Phil! They come and 
                         steal from an armored truck in our 
                         town -- they're looters.
                              (fires two shots)

                                     PHIL
                         What about Tom? What about Karen? 
                         They're not looters.

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, they're witnesses.

               The Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets.

               TOM AND JIM

               Behind the crypt, bullets winging by. Jim looks over, sees...

               HANK

               Motor into view.

               JIM

               Opens fire.

               HANK

               Shoots back.

               TOM

               Flattens against the crypt, then turns to see...

               WAYNE

               Coming into view on the other side.

               TOM

               Looks at Jim, sees he's occupied in the fight with Hank. 
               Then he sees...

               RAY

               Floating in the water, dead, pistol still jammed in his pants.

               TOM

               Thinks, decides, and reaches out for Ray.

               CLOSE ON JIM

               Shooting at Hank. He hears gunfire from Wayne and is about 
               to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun 
               firing from right next to him. He turns to see...

               TOM

               Shooting back at Wayne with Ray's gun.

               WAYNE

               Pulls back out of the line of fire.

               HANK

               Curses and pulls back, too.

               TOM AND JIM

               Exchange a look.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     PHIL
                         How can you do this?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Jeez, Phil, I always thought Wayne 
                         was the stupid one. Read my lips.
                              (slowly)
                         Three million dollars. Look at it!

               The Sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the 
               boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money.

                                     SHERIFF
                         A couple of those bags are gonna be 
                         yours, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         But -- but -- you're the Sheriff!

               The Sheriff rips his badge off and throws it away.

                                     SHERIFF
                         I'm the what?

               TOM AND JIM

               Jim looks at Tom, then hands Tom his pistol. Tom doesn't 
               know what Jim's doing. Jim slips beneath the water.

               HANK

               Whistles and gets Wayne's attention. He motions Wayne to try 
               it again.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     PHIL
                         For twenty years you've been --

                                     SHERIFF
                         For twenty years I've been eating 
                         shit, breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
                         Well, tonight I'm changing the menu! 
                         From now on everything I eat is gonna 
                         be shit-free!

               BEHIND THE CRYPT

               Tom is looking for Jim, to see what he's doing. And then...

               WAYNE AND HANK

               Come around on both sides.

               TOM

               Starts shooting at them with the two pistols.

               WAYNE AND HANK

               Pull back. As they go...

               TOM

               Sees...

               KAREN'S ARM

               Draped over the side of Wayne's boat.

               TOM

               Takes another shot at Hank but stops firing at Wayne.

               CLOSE ON JIM'S SKI-BOAT

               Jim's hand appears over the gunwale. He reaches in and 
               grabs...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               And pulls it out of the boat.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     SHERIFF
                         Can I make it any clearer, Phil? Do 
                         you want me to draw pictures?

               Phil pulls out his revolver and points it at the Sheriff.

                                     PHIL
                         I can't let you do it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oh for --
                              (beat)
                         Okay, Phil. But here's how it's gonna 
                         go. I'm gonna hear one of two things 
                         out of you. Either I'm gonna hear 
                         you say you're in with us, or...
                              (moves close to Phil's 
                              gun)
                         ...I'm gonna hear a bullet come out 
                         of that gun and go into me.

               Phil is incredulous. The Sheriff weighs his hands like scales.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (one hand)
                         Seven hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars or...
                              (other hand)
                         ...you kill me. Your choice.

               The Sheriff weighs the hands a couple more times. Phil slumps, 
               lowers the gun.

                                     SHERIFF
                         There we go.

               SOMETHING

               Flies through the air; lands in the water by the Sheriff. 
               It's...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               And it starts sinking in the water.

               BEHIND THE CRYPT

               Tom sees...

               JIM

               Haul himself into the ski-boat.

                                     WAYNE (O.S.)
                         In the boat!

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK

               Start shooting at Jim in the ski-boat.

               JIM

               Sticks the shotgun over the gunwale and returns fire.

               TOM

               Starts swimming for the boat.

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK

               See Tom and start shooting at both he and Jim when...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               Explodes and...

               THE WATER

               Erupts in a huge geyser.

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE, PHIL AND HANK

               Are knocked off their feet. The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are 
               thrown into the water. Their boats are rocked up and back 
               and swamped with falling water.

               JIM

               Fires up his engine.

               TOM

               Is almost to the boat.

               WAYNE

               Gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting.

               TOM

               Gets to Jim's boat and grabs onto it.

               JIM

               Cranks the throttle, and, dragging Tom, tears off under the 
               hail of Wayne's bullets.

               TOM'S POV

               As Jim races through the tombstones, barely missing 
               halfsubmerged stone crosses and crypt roofs.

               TOM

               Rams into one cross.

               HIS HANDS

               Start to slip from the boat.

               JIM

               Grabs Tom's hand and holds on as they shoot off across the 
               water.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Get back in the boats.

               EXT. ON THE WATER - MOVING

               Jim hauls Tom into the boat. Tom lays on the bottom, catching 
               his breath. Blood is dripping down from his arm.

                                     TOM
                              (beat, looks up at 
                              Jim)
                         You really want that money?

               Jim gives Tom a look -- of course he wants that money.

                                     TOM
                         'Cause the only way you're ever gonna 
                         see it is if you help me get Karen.

               Before Jim can answer, gunshots ring out behind them. They 
               look back to see...

               THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Coming after them in the three boats, shooting, closing.

                                     TOM
                         We're too slow.

                                     JIM
                              (thinks, then:)
                         Here.

               Jim moves away from the wheel, giving it to Tom. Tom gets up 
               and takes over. Jim bends and picks up...

               KENNY

               Lifeless and limp.

               JIM

               Looks at Kenny for a moment, then pushes his body overboard.

               WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Flying over the water.

               THEIR POV

               They see a body tumble out of the ski-boat.

               WITH JIM AND TOM

               Jim looks back, following Kenny with his eyes.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Jim and Tom make the turn onto Main Street. They look back 
               as...

               THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Come around the corner, two hundred yards back.

                                     TOM
                         They're not going to catch us now.

               LOW ANGLE

               Of the ski-boat, racing toward camera. As it gets closer, 
               the camera BOOMS DOWN underwater to reveal...

               THE STATUE

               The sword tip just below the surface. THE SKI-BOAT

               There's a jarring metal on metal clank as the sword tip slams 
               into the propeller.

               JIM AND TOM

               Are thrown forward.

               JIM

               Slams head-first into the dash.

               UNDERWATER

               The propeller has stopped.

               TOM

               Looks back to see that...

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Has almost been ripped from its moorings.

                                     TOM
                         Okay, so maybe they are gonna catch 
                         us now.

               No answer from Jim. Tom looks down.

               JIM

               Is laying on the deck, unconscious. Just then... BAM! BAM! 
               BAM!

               HANK

               Has his rifle resting on his boat's windshield and is firing 
               off a clip on automatic as he, Wayne and the Sheriff close 
               in.

               TOM

               Ducks down and tries to start the engine. No go. Again. It 
               catches on the third try. Tom guns it and the boat tears 
               off.

               THE OUTBOARD ENGINE

               Is wobbling, vibrating.

               HANK

               Keeps up his stream of gunfire.

               TOM

               Stays down, driving blind, as the bullets fly in, blowing 
               holes in the windshield. He looks at Jim, at the engine and 
               curses. He steers the boat toward...

               THE CHURCH

               All lit-up, brilliant white in the darkness, a quarter-mile 
               away.

               EXT. THE CHURCH

               The water is now over the sandbag wall. The first several 
               feet of the church are flooded.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Comes up fast. Tom grounds it on top of the sandbag wall. 
               Tom hesitates for a half second before grabbing Jim and 
               pushing him out of the boat and into the water.

               JIM

               Hits the cold water and comes to, sputtering.

               TOM

               Grabs guns and ammo and jumps out of the boat and into the 
               water. He lays a rifle on the top of the sandbag wall and 
               fires off a clip.

               THE SHERIFF, HANK AND WAYNE

               Jim's bullets plug into their boats. They circle back.

               AT THE CHURCH

               Tom pushes Jim, still groggy, into the flooded church.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom shuts the door. He piles the weapons on a shelf. He sees 
               Jim touch his head.

                                     TOM
                         That hurt?

                                     JIM
                         Yeah.

                                     TOM
                         Good.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Wayne and Hank are alongside the Sheriff, engines idling as 
               they look at the church.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (nods, to Hank)
                         Then go get some bottles.

               Hank nods, guns his engine.

                                     PHIL
                              (to Hank)
                         Wait -- what about the dam?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It'll be fine.

                                     PHIL
                         You said if it goes it'll wipe out 
                         the town.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Fuck the town.

               Hank nods in agreement and takes off.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim and Tom are by one of the stained glass windows, looking 
               out through a pale-colored pane at the Sheriff and his men 
               across the street. They watch Hank race off.

                                     JIM
                         Does he have the girl?

                                     TOM
                              (shakes head)
                         She's in the small boat.

               Tom touches the wound on his head.

                                     TOM
                         Jesus, I'm gonna get hepatitis.

                                     JIM
                         Hepatitis, hell. You probably already 
                         got cholera.

               Tom gives Jim a look then starts for the back of the church.

                                     JIM
                         What're you doing?

                                     TOM
                         There's a back room.
                              (touches wound)
                         Maybe they've got something I can 
                         use on this.

                                     JIM
                         You been in here before?

                                     TOM
                              (bad memory)
                         Oh, yeah.

                                     JIM
                         What happened?

                                     TOM
                         I saw Jesus.

               EXT. DAM

               Water is starting to go over the top again. It pours down in 
               sheets over the face of the dam.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim is by the window, looking out at the Sheriff and Wayne 
               across the street in the shadows. He turns as...

               TOM

               Enters from the back. He's got a bottle of rubbing alcohol 
               and a towel. He splashes some of the alcohol on the towel, 
               then touches it to his wound. It hurts like a sonofabitch. 
               After a beat...

                                     TOM
                         So, has this all gone pretty much 
                         how you thought it would?

               Jim turns on Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Everything would have gone fine if 
                         you'd've just walked away from the 
                         truck.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, yeah? Well, everything would've 
                         gone even better if you hadn't decided 
                         to rob the damn truck in the first 
                         place!

               Jim looks away. After another silence...

                                     TOM
                         Did Charlie have cancer or something?

                                     JIM
                         You mean why was he doing this?
                              (thinks, shrugs)
                         No cancer.
                              (beat)
                         Didn't you ever think about taking 
                         the money?

                                     TOM
                         No.

                                     JIM
                         Come now. A man who used to make his 
                         living fencing hot jackhammers never 
                         thought about what he'd do with three 
                         million dollars?

                                     TOM
                         Sorry to disappoint you.
                              (beat)
                         What are you gonna do with it?

                                     JIM
                         As little as possible.

               Silence for a few moments, then...

                                     TOM
                         Belize.

               Jim looks at him.

                                     TOM
                         It's this small country in Central 
                         America, on the Atlantic side.

                                     JIM
                         I know where Belize is. What about 
                         it?

                                     TOM
                         They speak English and the dollar 
                         goes a long way. Beautiful beaches; 
                         friendly people. And they've got 
                         liberal banking laws. Very liberal.

                                     JIM
                         No, you didn't think about taking 
                         that money at all.

                                     TOM
                              (busted)
                         You can't ride in the truck and not 
                         think about it.

                                     JIM
                         I'm sure. And I guess that's pretty 
                         much how it started with Charlie.

               Tom thinks, nods and presses the towel to his wound again.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Wayne is thinking about something. He makes a decision and 
               flicks on his engine.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What're you doing?

                                     WAYNE
                         We got too many bodies with bullets 
                         in 'em.
                              (nods at Karen)
                         I'm gonna put her in her house, make 
                         it look like she fell down the stairs 
                         and drowned.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't you touch her!

                                     WAYNE
                         Saving her life... Hmm... You know, 
                         that might have actually gotten you 
                         laid.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oh, for Christsakes, just dump her 
                         here.

                                     WAYNE
                         We got a few minutes before Hank 
                         gets back.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Just dump her here!

               Wayne ignores the Sheriff and motors off.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne! Goddamnit, we've gotta get 
                         them outta there! Wayne!

               But Wayne keeps going.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom watches Wayne drive off with Karen.

                                     TOM
                         Shit. Where's he going?

               Tom grabs a rifle, frustrated and angry.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Hank motors up to the Sheriff and Phil.

                                     HANK
                         Where's Wayne going?

                                     SHERIFF
                         On a date. You all set?

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, but --

                                     SHERIFF
                         Then let's go.

                                     HANK
                         Aren't we gonna wait for Wayne?

                                     SHERIFF
                         We can get started without him, the 
                         dumb shit. He won't be long. Besides, 
                         we got Phil. Phil's gonna earn his 
                         money on this, aren't you Phil?

               Phil looks scared shitless.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Water continues to pour over the top. CLOSE ON CONCRETE

               Chunks of cement are starting to wash away.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom finishes reloading a gun.

                                     JIM
                         What -- you're gonna swim after her?

               Tom doesn't answer. He moves toward the front door. Jim cuts 
               him off.

                                     JIM
                         You ain't gonna help her by getting 
                         shot. He's gone and you don't know 
                         where.

                                     TOM
                         The Sheriff knows. I think maybe 
                         I'll go ask him.

                                     JIM
                         You'll be dead before you get over 
                         the sandbags.
                              (beat)
                         Look, he'll be coming for us. You 
                         can ask him then.

               Jim sees something out the window.

                                     TOM
                         What if he doesn't come?

                                     JIM
                         I wouldn't worry about that.

               Tom sees what Jim sees.

               THEIR POV

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are heading toward the church, 
               flaming Molotov cocktails in their hands.

               EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank heave the flaming Molotov 
               cocktails.

               THE ROOF

               The bottles hit, explode. Sheets of fire rain down the roof.

               ONE BOTTLE

               Smashes through a window.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom and Jim duck down as...

               THE BOTTLE

               Flies across the inside of the church and smashes against a 
               wall, sending sheets of fire down the wall.

               EXT. CHURCH

               The roof is on fire.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Modest, two-story, on a side street. The front door is open; 
               the boat tied up outside. There's a light on in the front 
               hall.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen is unconscious. Wayne has her laying on the stairs 
               leading up from the entry area to the second floor. There's 
               three feet of water in the house. Karen's legs are in the 
               water. Her hands are handcuffed to a railing attached to the 
               wall, running up the stairs. Wayne stands over Karen, pats 
               her face.

                                     WAYNE
                         Wakey-wakey.

               Karen stirs, then starts slipping back into unconsciousness, 
               so Wayne splashes her face with water. Karen comes to, 
               sputtering. Her eyes focus. She looks up at Wayne. Wayne 
               grins.

                                     WAYNE
                         Dear Penthouse: I always thought 
                         your letters were fake, until the 
                         wildest thing happened to me. I'm a 
                         policeman in a small town. In the 
                         middle of the big flood last year, I 
                         was patrolling the streets in a boat, 
                         feeling kind of sorry for myself -- 
                         'cause it was my birthday and all -- 
                         when I saw the front door to a house 
                         was open. I pulled my gun -- afraid 
                         it might be looters. Imagine my 
                         surprise when, instead of a looter, 
                         I find a young woman handcuffed to 
                         the railing of her stairs. Her name 
                         was Karen, and ever since she came 
                         back from college she'd made it clear 
                         she was too good for any of us local 
                         folk. Now here she was, in handcuffs! 
                         I said, "What the heck is going on 
                         here, ma'am?" And she said...

               Karen says nothing. Wayne leans in close.

                                     WAYNE
                         And she said...

                                     KAREN
                         Sorry, Wayne, but I'm not playing a 
                         part in your sick little play.

               Wayne pulls his gun, puts it to Karen's head.

                                     WAYNE
                         You're perfect for the role. I suggest 
                         you reconsider.

                                     KAREN
                         Or what? You'll kill me? You're gonna 
                         do that anyway.

                                     WAYNE
                         I might get clumsy. It might take a 
                         while.

                                     KAREN
                         I'm sure you can hurt me. But it's 
                         all going to be the same when I'm 
                         dead.

               Wayne straightens up, looks at her, then launches back into 
               it.

                                     WAYNE
                         And she said, "Happy Birthday, Wayne. 
                         I've got something for you." Well, 
                         I'm not stupid. I knew what she wanted 
                         to give me and I knew she wanted to 
                         give it bad, so I --

               THE OVERHEAD LIGHT

               Sparks and goes out.

                                     WAYNE
                              (looks up at light)
                         That won't do. Man's gotta see what 
                         he's doing. 'Scuse me.

               Wayne heads off for the kitchen. The second he's gone...

               KAREN

               Raises her hips and digs a hand into her pocket and pulls 
               out her Swiss Army knife. She pries open the big blade. She 
               hears Wayne sloshing back toward her. She gets back into the 
               position Wayne left her in as...

               WAYNE

               Re-enters carrying two burning candles in candle-holders.

                                     WAYNE
                         I got the candles. All's we need is 
                         a cake.

               He sets the candles down on a dry step above Karen's head. 
               He leans in close.

                                     WAYNE
                         Mood lighting. You in the mood yet?
                              (no answer from Karen; 
                              back into Penthouse 
                              letter)
                         And then she said, "My present's 
                         ready and waiting. All's you gotta 
                         do is unwrap it."

               Wayne reaches into the water, undoes Karen's rain pants, 
               yanks off her shoes, then pulls off her pants. He throws 
               them over the banister. Karen remains passive, blank. Wayne 
               takes off his holster; hangs it on the banister. Then he 
               pushes his pants down to his ankles. His shirttail is long 
               enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little 
               pecker. He climbs on top of Karen in the water, brings his 
               face close to hers.

                                     WAYNE
                         It was cold and rainy that birthday 
                         night, and all I wanted was to get 
                         someplace warm and dry. As it turned 
                         out, what I really wanted was 
                         something warm and wet. Wayne grins 
                         and closes for a kiss and...

               KAREN'S HAND

               Moves fast with the knife and...

               WAYNE'S EYES

               Pop open wide.

               WAYNE

               His head jerks back. He tries to shout, but all that comes 
               out is an awful gurgle. He tries to push off Karen, but...

               KAREN

               Wraps her legs around him, holds him close, pinning him.

               WAYNE

               Finally breaks free. He tries to stop the bleeding with a 
               hand, but the blood spurts through his fingers. He reaches 
               for his gun in his holster on the banister, but just as he 
               grabs it...

               KAREN

               Lashes out of the water with her legs, kicking Wayne in the 
               groin, pushing him back.

               WAYNE

               Tries to get his balance, but his feet can't move -- his 
               pants are around his ankles. He falls back into the water, 
               firing his pistol.

               BULLETS

               Blow chunks out of the wall next to Karen, hit the ceiling 
               and...

               WAYNE

               Is floating on his back, trying to lift the pistol, but his 
               strength is fading fast. He gets off one last shot and...

               THE CANDLE

               Nearest Karen is blown to pieces.

               WAYNE

               The gun drops into the water. No more shots. No more life. 
               He floats, pants around his ankles, covered in blood, dead.

                                     KAREN
                         Happy Birthday, Wayne.

               EXT. STREET AND CHURCH

               The church roof is on fire.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Are across the street.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim and Tom hear a creaking and look up.

               THE CEILING

               The fire has eaten holes in the roof. Embers come down.

               EXT. CHURCH AND STREET

               The Sheriff is getting very agitated.

                                     SHERIFF
                         They're not coming out, Hank!

                                     HANK
                         The fire's not catching. The rain's 
                         too --

                                     SHERIFF
                         We have to get them! We have to kill 
                         them! Do you understand? If they're 
                         not dead, we got jack shit!

               INT. CHURCH

               A small chunk of burning ceiling drops down. Jim and Tom 
               look up. Just then...

               BRIGHT LIGHT

               Floods into the church through...

               THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS

               Filling the church with a kaleidoscope of colors.

               TOM AND JIM

               Look out the windows.

                                     TOM
                         My God they're beautiful.

               THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS

               Remain beautiful for a few more seconds until they shatter 
               and blow inwards as...

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT AND HANK'S BOAT

               Come crashing through.

               THE BOATS

               Land, stop fast. The Sheriff's boat lands closer to the 
               pulpit; Hank's boat closer to the balcony.

               THE SHERIFF, HANK AND PHIL

               Look around. It's quiet for a moment. There's no sign of Tom 
               and Jim.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen has her pants back on. She reaches out with one foot 
               and hooks Wayne's holster off the banister. She flips it 
               through the air and catches it with her hands. She opens 
               little leather pockets -- mace, more bullets. No keys. Karen 
               starts to panic.

                                     KAREN
                         There have to be keys. There --

               She sees...

               WAYNE

               Still floating on his back, still dead. She looks closer 
               at...

               WAYNE'S PANTS

               Bunched around his ankles. And there, hanging from a belt-
               loop is a ring of keys.

               KAREN

               Reaches out with her foot for Wayne's pants. She can't reach.

               WAYNE

               Is slowly drifting out the open door. Beyond the door, in 
               the light of the streetlamp, the water is riffling, moving, 
               and Wayne is heading toward it.

               KAREN

               Slides down further on the stairs, into the water, then stops.

               CLOSE ON HANDCUFFS AND RAILING

               There are metal supports going from the railing to the wall, 
               every three feet. Karen is prevented from going any further 
               down the stairs by one of these supports.

               KAREN

               Reaches out with a foot, straining, stretching her body, 
               almost dislocating her shoulder and...

               HER FOOT

               Just barely touches one of Wayne's feet, but then Wayne's 
               foot slips away and...

               KAREN

               Can only watch as...

               WAYNE

               Drifts out the door and is pulled away by the current.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Water is cascading over the top of the dam. Chunks of concrete 
               are washing away.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff, Phil and Wayne scan the water, looking for 
               movement.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Where are they?! Jesus!

               UNDERWATER POV

               Looking up through a tangle of floating pews at the wavering 
               silhouettes of the boats and the men in them against the 
               burning timbers above.

               TWO PISTOLS

               Come into view, pointed up through the water.

               ON THE WATER

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank have let down their guard for a 
               second when there's a series of dull, muted clacks from 
               underwater as...

               BULLETS

               Come streaking out of the water, winging by them, plugging 
               into the boats.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim fires the pistols, the bullets' bubble streaks knifing 
               up through the water.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               hit the deck in their boats, returning fire over the gunwales.

               TOM

               Surfaces over by the stairs up to the balcony, gasping for 
               air. He runs for the stairs.

               BLAZING TIMBERS

               Start to fall from the burning roof frame, hitting the water 
               with loud sizzling hisses.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Turn to shoot at tom through the dropping flaming debris.

               TOM

               Disappears up the stairs, the bullets just missing him.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim runs out of bullets. He's long since run out of air. He 
               drops his guns and swims under the pews.

               HANK

               Looks up, realizing that Tom will be able to shoot down on 
               him. He reverses his boat fast under the balcony as...

               TOM

               Shoots down from the balcony, blowing a chunk out of the 
               prow of Hank's boat.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The water is up to Karen's chin. Her hands are working 
               frantically beneath the water.

               UNDERWATER

               She's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws 
               holding the support to the railing. She's on the last one. 
               The blade slips, misses, gets a quarter turn, another quarter 
               turn...

               KAREN

               Spits out the water that spills into her mouth.

               UNDERWATER

               Another quarter-turn and the screw is loose enough to turn 
               by hand.

               KAREN

               Holds her breath with the water touching her nose. She gets 
               the screw loose, pulls up on the railing and pulls the 
               handcuff through the gap between the support and the railing.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff turns to Phil and nods re: Jim.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You take care of him!

               The Sheriff aims at the balcony as Phil scans the water, 
               looking for Jim.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim pulls an electrical cord out of a wall socket.

               ON THE BALCONY

               Tom ducks down as the Sheriff's bullets start plugging through 
               the wood front of the balcony. Tom moves away from the bullet 
               strikes, splashing through the water in the balcony.

               CLOSE ON BALCONY FLOOR

               As BANG BANG BANG -- bullets start shooting up from below.

               HANK

               Is firing up at Tom through the floor of the balcony.

               TOM

               Jumps back, startled, looking down at...

               THE BALCONY FLOOR

               Holes explode in the floor, sending up small geysers of water. 
               The water then starts whirlpooling down through the holes.

               TOM

               Moves back from hank's advancing bullet holes.

               THE SHERIFF

               Keeps firing.

               TOM

               Is caught between Hank's bullets and the Sheriff's bullets. 
               So he racks a load in the shotgun and dives backwards off 
               the balcony.

               HANK

               Is still shooting up as...

               TOM

               Arcs off the balcony, firing the shotgun under the balcony 
               at Hank.

               HANK

               Dives to the floor of his boat as Tom's shotgun blasts blow 
               plate-sized holes in the church doors.

               TOM

               Lands in the water and goes under.

               THE SHERIFF AND PHIL

               Look for Tom in the water.

               HANK

               Starts to get up from the bottom of his boat, searching for 
               a clip for his gun.

               THE SHERIFF

               Sees Tom's shape in the water and is about to shoot when...

               JIM

               Jumps up out of the water with the electrical cord. He tosses 
               a loop of the cord around the Sheriff's neck and pulls, 
               yanking the Sheriff out of the boat.

               TOM

               Comes out of the water, aiming his shotgun at...

               PHIL

               Who is aiming his pistol at Tom. Phil freezes.

               THE SHERIFF AND JIM

               Struggle in the water. Jim pulls the cord tightly around the 
               Sheriff's neck as the Sheriff tries to get a shot off at Jim -- 
               he can't get the barrel pointed at Jim.

               HANK

               Fumbles with the bullet clip.

                                     HANK
                              (to Phil)
                         Kill him!

               TOM

               Turns his shotgun on Hank and pulls the trigger -- click. Uh-
               oh.

                                     HANK
                         Kill him!

               TOM AND PHIL

               Exchange a look.

               HANK

               Slams the clip into his gun and levels it at Tom.

               PHIL

               Points his gun at Hank.

                                     PHIL
                         No! We can't --

               BANG! and hank shoots Phil. Phil pitches back out of the 
               Sheriff's boat.

               PHIL

               Lands between Jim and the Sheriff, knocking them apart.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is free of Jim's grasp. He shakes off the electrical cord 
               and turns to shoot...

               JIM

               Who moves a little faster. He grabs Phil's pistol and puts 
               it to the Sheriff's head before the Sheriff can bring his 
               gun around.

               HANK

               Draws a bead on Jim and is about to shoot when...

               TOM

               Comes out of the water on the other side of Hank's boat. Tom 
               pushes down hard on the side of the boat.

               HANK

               Is rocked back, thrown off balance. He starts to spin and 
               bring his gun around when...

               TOM

               Swings with the shotgun, catching...

               HANK

               In the side of the head. Hank crumples and falls into the 
               water, taking his rifle with him.

               JIM AND THE SHERIFF

               Jim nods at the Sheriff's rifle.

                                     JIM
                         In the boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Hesitates, then tosses his rifle into the boat.

               TOM

               Grabs Hank's rifle and aims it at the Sheriff.

                                     TOM
                         Where's Karen?

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen undoes a last screw in a metal support.

               She pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support 
               and railing. She's at the top of the stairs.

               THE END OF THE RAILING

               Curves and goes into the wall.

               KAREN

               Tugs at the railing, tries rocking it up and down. It doesn't 
               budge. She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife.

                                     KAREN
                         God, I am really beginning to hate 
                         fine craftsmanship.

               THE WATER

               It's up to her chest.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff hesitates.

                                     TOM
                         Where is she?

                                     SHERIFF
                         They went back to her house.

                                     TOM
                         Where's her house?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It's --

               And just then they all hear something truly ominous -- a 
               siren pierces the night.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               She reacts to the siren -- uh-oh.

               INT. CHURCH

               The siren wails.

                                     JIM
                         What in God's name is that?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank?

                                     HANK
                              (woozy but okay)
                         It's topped out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         How much time we got?

                                     HANK
                         How should I know?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Guess!

                                     HANK
                         It's an old dam! Not long.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Tom)
                         Then I'd say you boys better drop 
                         your guns.

                                     TOM
                         What?

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's the deal! You let me and Hank 
                         go -- with a few of these bags -- 
                         and I'll tell you where to find Karen.

                                     JIM
                              (to the Sheriff)
                         Get out of the boat.

                                     TOM
                         Hold on.

               Jim turns to look at Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Hold on?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It's the only way you're gonna find 
                         her!

                                     TOM
                         It's only a couple of bags.

                                     JIM
                         No.

                                     TOM
                         But I thought --

                                     JIM
                         Look, I don't know what you thought 
                         but I told you, I'm here for the 
                         money; that's all.

               Tom doesn't know what to do. The Sheriff looks pretty pleased 
               with himself. He might just get out of this. And then...

                                     PHIL (O.S.)
                         She lives on Boyd Street.

               They all look over at...

               PHIL

               Alive, but barely.

                                     PHIL
                         Three over. Two-story, blue shutters.

               TOM

               Looks at Jim, disappointed, angry, then hurries to Hank's 
               boat.

               JIM

               Climbs into the Sheriff's boat.

               TOM

               Climbs into Hank's boat. He starts the engine, looks down 
               at...

               PHIL

               Floating in the water, dying. A brief look between them, 
               then...

               TOM

               Drives the boat out through a shattered window.

               JIM

               Pushes the Sheriff out of the boat.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               A large V is being cut in the top of the dam by the raging 
               water.

               A QUARTER-MILE AWAY

               Looking back at the dam. The line of lights on top of the 
               dam start to fall over, then go dark, snuffed out by an unseen 
               force.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim keeps his gun leveled at the Sheriff and Hank, standing 
               in the water, as he pulls the money bags up from the forward 
               hold.

                                     SHERIFF
                         So, you just gonna kill me?

                                     JIM
                         Lord knows I should.

               Jim opens a money bag and smiles at what he sees.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen tilts her head back to keep her lips and nose above 
               water. And then she hears a window smash. She turns as...

               TOM

               Wades in along the upper hall.

                                     TOM
                         I'm guessing you can't get up.

                                     KAREN
                         I'm handcuffed.

               Tom reaches into the water for the railing.

                                     KAREN
                         The railing's bolted to the wall.

               He looks at her.

                                     KAREN
                         I've got a saw.

                                     TOM
                         Where?

                                     KAREN
                         In the kitchen. In the tall cupboard 
                         beside the --

               And then they hear a sound more ominous than the siren -- 
               they hear the siren stop.

                                     TOM
                         Is that good or bad?

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim, the Sheriff and Hank react to the silence. Jim looks 
               off.

               THE SHERIFF

               Drops underwater.

               JIM

               Turns back at the sound of the Sheriff going under.

               UNDERWATER

               The Sheriff pulls up his pant leg.

               JIM

               Is aiming his gun at the water and is about to fire as...

               THE SHERIFF'S HAND

               Comes out of the water shooting a pistol.

               JIM

               Is shot in the gut and the thigh and high on the chest and 
               he stumbles back, bellowing, and falls out of the Sheriff's 
               boat and into the water.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You should've just killed me.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

                                     KAREN
                         You gotta go!

               Tom starts hyperventilating.

                                     KAREN
                         The dam's gone! You gotta go!

                                     TOM
                              (shakes head)
                         I owe you one.

               Tom breathes deep then ducks underwater.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom flicks on his flashlight and starts swimming down the 
               stairs.

               KAREN

               Watches Tom and his light get swallowed up in the murky water.

               INT. CHURCH

               Phil is grabbing for the Sheriff's boat as the Sheriff and 
               Hank zoom out of the church, leaving him behind.

                                     PHIL
                         NOOOO!

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The Sheriff's boat comes onto Main Street, moving fast.

               IN THE BOAT

               Hank is looking back, in the direction the flood will come.

                                     HANK
                         We gotta go faster!

                                     SHERIFF
                         Yeah, you're right.

               The Sheriff pushes Hank out of the boat.

               HANK

               Goes skipping over the water and slams into a streetlight 
               post.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Tom swims down into the living room. His light shows a couch, 
               chairs, TV set. Books and newspapers are suspended in the 
               water.

               EXT. THE CHURCH

               The damaged ski-boat that Jim and Tom took to the church has 
               slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting. A peaceful 
               scene. But then, from the distance, comes a rushing roar.

               INT. CHURCH

               Phil hears the roar. He looks around, lost.

               EXT. STREET

               Hank, groggy in the water, also hears the distant roar.

               INT. CHURCH

               The roar is building, getting louder. Phil sees something in 
               the water and reaches for it, frantically. He gets it. It's...

               A BIBLE

               And he clutches it to his chest as...

               THE FLOOD

               Hits the church.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

               Tom swims into the kitchen. He looks for the tall cupboard 
               by the fridge. He opens it.

               INSIDE THE CUPBOARD

               Hanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw. Tom grabs it.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Hank unwraps himself from around the lamp post. He looks 
               back.

               HIS POV

               Streetlights in the distance, winking out one by one, marking 
               the advance of the wall of water.

                                     HANK
                         Oh my God.

               Hank looks around for safety. He sees it.

               HIS POV

               There's an alleyway.

               HANK

               Swims for the alley.

               EXT. THE ADVANCING FLOOD

               Roars through the town, pushing a rolling wave of debris, 
               obliterating anything in its path.

               EXT. ALLEY

               Hank swims into the alley. Hank looks for something to climb 
               up on, to hold onto. There's...

               FIRE ESCAPE LADDER

               At the end of the alley.

               HANK

               Swims for it. He hears the rushing roar of the advancing 
               flood. He expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley. 
               Wrong.

               WALL OF WATER

               Comes into the alley, banking high on the far wall before 
               coming down and barreling toward Hank. And what makes it 
               worse for Hank is that there's...

               A CAR

               At the front of the wave, being pushed by the water.

               HANK

               Dives clear just as...

               THE CAR

               Smashes into the wall, right where Hank had just been.

               HANK

               Relief in his eyes. He gets to the fire escape and is climbing 
               to safety when...

               PROPANE TANK

               Comes into the alley, rolling in the flood, spraying propane 
               from a torn hose. It explodes.

               HANK

               Barely has time to scream.

               INT. KAREN'S KITCHEN - BREAK OF DAWN

               Tom is threading his belt through the handle of the saw to 
               secure it. He gets it done and starts to swim out of the 
               kitchen.

               BACK TO KAREN

               Just Karen's lips and nose are above water.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               Tom is about to leave when everything starts to move -- 
               rocking, from side to side, as if in a slow motion earthquake. 
               Cupboards and the fridge open and bottles and food and plates 
               tumble out.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house has been hit by the flood. It's being pulled by 
               the massive current, stretching overhead phone and power 
               lines.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen hears the groaning, ripping as the house tears free 
               from water and sewer lines. She's looking down for Tom when 
               there's a snap and the light above her goes out.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house is carried on the current, turning in the water.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               Tom watches, astounded, as the room starts to turn around 
               him. He kicks fast for the door to...

               THE LIVING ROOM

               Tom swims in, fast, toward the stairs when...

               A WINDOW

               Caves in and...

               HUGE TREE BRANCH

               Smashes in, filling the room, blocking Tom's route to the 
               stairs.

               TOM

               Tries to get through the tangle of branches and leaves, but 
               can't. He swims over to another window and slides it up.

               KAREN

               Keeps looking down for Tom.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house is impaled on a tree, the current sluicing around 
               it.

               TOM

               Surfaces near the side of the house, gasping. The current 
               starts ripping him past the house. He swims as hard as he 
               can back to the house, reaches out and grabs onto a gutter.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen doesn't have much time left. The water is washing over 
               her mouth and nose. And just as she's about to go under...

               TOM

               Swims in with the saw. He starts sawing on the handrail. 
               Everything's going fine. And then...

               THE SAWBLADE

               Snaps.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look at each other. Oh no. Karen's going under.

               TOM

               Sees something. He dives into the water.

               KAREN

               Can only watch and wait. What's he doing? Oh, Jesus. And 
               then...

               TOM

               Surfaces, holding Wayne's pistol. He puts the mouth of the 
               barrel to the handcuff chain, shields Karen's face, looks 
               away and pulls the trigger.

               EXT. A TREE IN WATER

               The water swirls through the branches of a half-submerged 
               tree.

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               Are in the tree. Henry is either unconscious or dead. Doreen 
               cradles him.

                                     DOREEN
                         Come on, Henry. Forget that "Go to 
                         the light" crap. Come back to me. 
                         You're all I've got.

               And Henry starts to come to.

                                     DOREEN
                         Oh, Henry. Thank God.

               Henry opens his eyes.

                                     HENRY
                         Next time, when I say "Let's 
                         evacuate," we're gonna evacuate.

                                     DOREEN
                         Whatever you say, honey.

               She hugs him tight and after a beat he hugs her back.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Tom and Karen swim out of a second floor window, grab the 
               rain gutter. Tom pulls himself onto the roof then grabs Karen 
               and helps her up. They crawl until they're clear of the edge. 
               Only the sloped roof of the house is visible in the swirling 
               water. They are just catching their breath when they are hit 
               by...

               BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT

               And they look to see...

               THE SHERIFF

               In his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a 
               gun in the other. He starts shooting.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Tom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets 
               plug in around them. Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns 
               and dives off the roof and into the water.

               KAREN

               Hears an engine behind her and turns.

               A BOAT

               Racing toward the house. It's...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               And at the controls is...

               JIM

               Barely alive.

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Is wobbling, vibrating at the back of the boat, almost loose 
               from its moorings.

               JIM'S POV

               He sees Karen, crouched below the peak of the house, a bright 
               light coming from the other side along with gunshots.

               JIM

               Pushes the throttle all the way forward.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Shoots forward.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom swims hard toward the Sheriff's boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is shooting down into the water at Tom's moving shape.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               With Jim at the wheel, comes racing straight toward the house.

               KAREN

               Thinks he's going to turn.

                                     KAREN
                         No! No!

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Doesn't turn.

               KAREN

               Rolls to the side, just getting clear as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Hits the sloping roof of Karen's house and ramps up it.

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Digs into the shingles of the roof and tears free from the 
               back of the boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Hears the sound and looks up as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Comes over the peak of the roof.

               TOM

               Surfaces to see...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Fly right over him, heading straight for...

               THE SHERIFF

               Who ducks down, just in time as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Misses him, landing just past him in the water.

               THE SHERIFF

               Straightens up, grinning with glee that the boat missed him. 
               And then he hears a piercing whine coming from behind him. 
               He turns, just in time to see...

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Flipping end over end, propeller whirring, heading straight 
               for him.

               THE SHERIFF

               Starts to scream.

               CLOSE ON KAREN

               Looking over the peak of the roof in horror. She hears the 
               Sheriff's scream and the scream of the propeller and then a 
               horrible ugly ripping and both screams stop.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

               The Sheriff is gone. The side has been smashed out of the 
               boat and the boat is flooding with water.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is just some misshapen thing trailing red, floating in the 
               water.

               JIM

               Tries to restart the ski-boat but it's dead. He slumps 
               forward.

               TOM

               Sees Jim slump against the side of the boat.

                                     TOM
                         You okay?

                                     JIM
                         Fine.

               Tom can tell Jim's anything but. Tom swims for the boat.

               THE BOAT

               Tom swims up, pulls himself in. He pulls Jim back off the 
               controls, sees the blood.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God. We gotta get you to --

               Jim looks at Tom. Tom understands -- Jim's not going anywhere.

                                     TOM
                         Thanks.

                                     JIM
                         For what?

                                     TOM
                         You just saved our lives.

                                     JIM
                         I did? I just came for the money.

               Tom looks at Jim -- he knows Jim's lying.

                                     KAREN (O.S.)
                         Do you need any help?

                                     JIM
                              (grabs Tom's arm)
                         No. Tell her to stay back.

                                     TOM
                              (to Karen)
                         It's okay!

               Jim lets go of Tom.

                                     JIM
                         You're going to turn it in?

                                     TOM
                         Sorry to disappoint you.

                                     JIM
                         Well, hell, then I guess I better 
                         take it after all. I figure the 
                         river'll carry me down to the Gulf 
                         of Mexico. If I catch the right 
                         currents, maybe I'll end up in... 
                         Belize?
                              (Tom nods)
                         You come look me up. I'll buy you a 
                         drink.

                                     TOM
                         I'll do that.

               Jim grimaces as he's hit by a wave of pain. He looks away.

                                     JIM
                         Go.

               Tom hesitates for a second.

                                     JIM
                         Please.

               Tom turns and slides into the water and swims away.

                                     JIM
                         Son, don't think too badly of your 
                         Uncle Charlie. He always said you 
                         were capable of remarkable things.
                              (beat)
                         He was right.

               There's a last look between Jim and Tom, then Tom swims away.

                                     JIM
                              (smiles)
                         The rain's stopped.
                              (breathes deep)
                         The air after a rain...

               Jim slowly topples forward and is still.

               TOM

               Swims through the swirling current toward Karen's roof.

               JIM'S BOAT

               Sinks below the surface and is gone.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Karen is down at the water's edge with her arm extended to 
               Tom. Tom grabs it, and as Karen pulls...

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               EXT. CHURCH - SUNSET

               Karen pulls Tom up onto scaffolding running along the edge 
               of the new roof under construction. Tom holds a paper bag. 
               He's wearing work gear -- tool belt, work boots, etc. Tom 
               looks at the work being done on the roof.

                                     TOM
                         They got a lot done today.

                                     KAREN
                         It's coming along.
                              (re: bag)
                         What'd you get?

                                     TOM
                         Barbecue chicken from Lilly's.

                                     KAREN
                         Yum.

                                     TOM
                         You want some? I wish you'd told me. 
                         I woulda got more.

                                     KAREN
                         Ha ha.

               And as they sit down and start to eat, the camera begins to 
               PULL BACK.

                                     TOM
                         I talked to Mikey. He says the 
                         flooring should be in by Friday.

                                     KAREN
                         That's what he said last week.

                                     TOM
                         I said if it wasn't here by Friday 
                         at six that you were going to go 
                         over and beat the crap out of him.

                                     KAREN
                         And I will.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

FADE IN:


EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

A modest but handsome home in the foothills above Gower.

SUPERIMPOSE: "1983"

A young boy, SONNY STORM, rushes out -- excited but pouty
and a little peeved. He glowers at a 1981 Mercury, parked
at the curb -- then turns back toward the house.

                          SONNY
                  (calls back to
                   house)
           Daddy! I don't want you to go!


MASON STORM

emerges from the house -- wearing a dark Gianni Versace
sport coat with a black vest underneath, carrying some
kind of case in his hand. He looks great -- a man of
action, not dandified at all by the snappy attire. He
squints down toward Sonny, proudly -- very much the family
man.

Mason's pretty wife, FELICIA, appears in the doorway.

                          FELICIA
                  (calls to Sonny)
           Your father has work to do, Sonny
           ... but he'll be home soon. And
           we'll all watch it together.

                          SONNY
           You promise, Dad?

                          STORM
           I promise.

Storm and Felicia come down to car, his arm around her.
Sonny grabs his father's shirtsleeve.

                          SONNY
           Daddy ...
                  (very serious)
           Daddy, is E.T. gonna win?

                          STORM
           He's got my vote.

Storm laughs and ruffles his son's hair.

                         FELICIA
                 (tight to Storm)
          I want you back early. Tonight's
          the night those little starlets are
          crawling all over town.

                        STORM
          Don't worry. I'll beat 'em off
          with a stick.

He kisses Felicia, ready to leave.

                          SONNY
          Daddy
                 (wants him to
                  stay)
          What about my joke?

Storm lifts Sonny up into his arms. He gives the boy
100% of his attention, speaks just for him.

                          STORM
          Knock knock.

                          SONNY
          Who's there?

                          STORM
          Old lady.

                          SONNY
          Old lady who?

                         STORM
          I didn't know you could yodel.

Sonny may not get the joke, but he laughs delightedly --
just because it's his dad telling it. Storm kisses him
and sets him down.

                         FELICIA
                 (to Storm)
          Take my advice: Don't give up your
          day job.

INT. STORM'S CAR - MOVING - POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD NIGHT

Freeway traffic. Smoke in the sky ... flames ... the oil
refineries south of Torrance. A police RADIO is on, LOW,
and we can hear the SQUAWKING COMMUNIQUES in the b.g.

We become aware of a black limousine, ahead in the traffic.

INTERCUT POLICE STATION - DETECTIVES ROOM - NIGHT

KARL BECKER, Storm's partner, a nice guy in shirtsleeves
with a huge nautical-type wristwatch. He's wide awake
all right -- eager for this call.

             I'm here, Mase. Where are you


EXT. HARBOR FREEWAY - NIGHT

Storm's Mercury moves discreetly, tailing the limo.

                            STORM
             On the Harbor ... south of Torrance.
             I got Calabrese right in my

             If I had a Sidewinder missile, I

Suddenly he is more alert, slowing the car.


LIMO

veers toward an upcoming exit ramp.

                            STORM (V.O.)
             Here he goes. I'm shutting down

           Lou Gossett just won Best Supporting.

TITLES END.


EXT. COMMERCIAL PIER - NIGHT

The limousine  slowly moves   up beside a stand-alone shack
near the edge  of the wharf.    The shack is an open shelter
with a broad  overhang, and   various kinds of equipment
stored inside  it. A single    bulb illuminates it. The
limo comes to  rest, engine   off, no apparent activity in
or out of the  vehicle.


STORM'S CAR

pulls up at a distance, deep in shadow.


INT. STORM'S CAR - NIGHT

He switches OFF the RADIO, twists a telephoto night lens
onto a specially silenced 8mm surveillance film camera;
he primes a portable sound deck in the case he's been
carrying. A quick check of the .45 in his shoulder
holster, then he exits the car.


ON STORM

Moving carefully onto the wharf, keeping to shadow, using
cover.


EXT. WHARF - NIGHT

Stacks of huge shipping crates and Sea-Land containers
from a long wall along the cluttered dock. The towering
hulks of several ships loom close by. Storm finds a slot
between bulk containers: a good surveillance point.

                             STORM
           Let's go, boys.     I'm missing the
           Oscars.

He is less than forty yards away, looking lengthwise down
the car from its rear. A beat, as Storm picks up the
sound before we do.

STORM'S POV - STATION WAGON

A paneled, expensive model approaches. The wagon pulls
up, a short distance from the limo. A man gets out from
the wagon. A beat later, the driver exits the limo.
Both are armed. They check out the area, in all
directions.


SHACK

One man crosses under the eave of the shack -- reaches
up, SMASHES the single LIGHT BULB. The spot goes dark.


WITH STORM

Seeing the doors open on both cars. A mature man,
CALABRESE, and his stocky confederate, VITALE, step from
the limo. TWO other MEN -- one wearing a stylish hat,
the other bareheaded -- step from the wagon. They cross
to the shadowed, shack area.

                             STORM (O.S.)
                    (to himself,
                     softly)
             I know you, Calabrese. But who are
             these mystery guests?

The two Shadow Men are obscured by the shack and the
position of Calabrese and Vitale.


STORM

Starts his camera soundlessly whirring. He positions his
high-tech directional mike, slipping on earphones.


WHARF - CONSPIRATORS

There is NOISE from various wharf MACHINERY on adjacent
piers, but the high-tech listening equipment still brings
in the sound with acceptable clarity.

                            CALABRESE
             -- Murder is a serious business, my
             friend. And an expensive one.

                            SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
             You'll be well compensated,
             Calabrese. Money now -- and a lot
             more when I get into that office.
             You can take that to the bank.

THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS

Despite the shadows, it's plain the Man With The Hat is
in his prime, full of vigor and impatience. Calabrese,
by contrast, is clearly older, more circumspect.

                          CALABRESE
           Slowly ... slowly. Always with
           caution.

                           SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
           I'm up to here with caution! That
           fuck lives on bean curd and alfalfa
           sprouts -- he ain't gonna die of
           natural causes.

                          CALABRESE
           All I'm counseling is a little
           patience. The man is public. He's
           in the paper every day.

                          SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
           Yeah? Well, the next time I read
           about him, it better be in the
           obituaries.


ON STORM

He squints over the camera, straining to see with the
naked eve Frustration


ANGLE - CALABRESE AND VITALE

Glancing to each other. They're tough guys, but in some
hard-to-define way, the two Shadow Men are tougher.

                          BAREHEADED SHADOW MAN
           Enough bullshit. Can you do the
           job or not? If you can't -

                          VITALE
           We'll do it.


STORM

Knowing he's on to something super hot.

                          STORM
                  (to himself,

It's driving him crazy that he can't make out the Shadow
Men's faces. He peers around the wharf, looking for some
better vantage point.


SHACK - CONSPIRATORS

keep talking.


ANGLE - STORM

Darting closer, using the row of bulk containers for cover.
He takes up a new position, nearer the shack re-aims the
camera.


LOOKOUT #1 (MIKEY)

hears something -- peers directly at the spot where Storm
is hiding.


STORM

ducks quickly back out of sight. As he does this, his
earphone cord catches on something. yanking the phone
off Storm's head. He cannot hear what the conspirators
say next -- but the audience can.


CONSPIRATORS

                         SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
          The job is a light plane ... a Lear
          P61. We want it to take off -- we
          don't want it to land.

Calabrese becomes aware of Mikey checking out the noise;
he motions the conspirators to shut up, then signals Mikey
to proceed. Mikey cocks his pistol, moves swiftly toward
the line of containers.


SHADOW MAN WITH HAT

steps forward into the light. His face comes clearly
into view. Well dressed, magnetic, Bobby Kennedy-ish --
he is L.A. Assemblyman VERNON TRENT.

                         TRENT (SHADOW MAN WITH HAT)

STORM'S HIDING PLACE - MIKEY

steps around one container (out of view of the other men)
to the exact spot where Storm was. But Storm isn't there.
Mikey is about to check farther, when out of nowhere:

Storm lashes out with a savage punch to the face. The
blow is so devastating it knocks Mikey's feet out from
under him so that he topples face-forward into Storm's
arms, out cold. Storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to
the ground.

Storm shakes a sore hand and notices it's cut. Kneeling
down to the outstretched heap, he finds the cause of his
injury -- one of Mikey's teeth wiggles freely in his
fingers. Storm plucks the tooth and folds it inside the
big guy's hand.

                         STORM
                 (re: the fairy)
          A quarter's a quarter.


WHARF - SHACK

Calabrese and Vitale are getting uneasy.

                         CALABRESE
          Mikey! Quit playing with yourself
          back there.
                 (no response)
          Mikey --

Guns come out.   Calabrese and Vitale start this way --


STORM

bolts back up the wharf, toward his car.


CALABRESE AND VITALE

hurry up to their fallen comrade. They see Storm 50 yards
back up the pier, fleeing. Vitale takes off after him at
a dead run. At that instant:


TRENT

moves INTO FRAME beside Calabrese. The Bareheaded Shadow
Man with him is Police Captain DAN HOLLAND (in civilian
business suit) -- 21 years on the force, hard as nails.

CONSPIRATORS' POV

They see Vitale pull up, on foot, as Storm's CAR ROARS
OFF into the darkness. Vitale seems close enough to pick
out the license number.


BACK TO TRENT

As his face moves into the light.     Merciless, implacable.

                           TRENT
                   (to Calabrese)
            Whoever that sonofabitch is, I don't

                           CALABRESE
            He won't, Mr. Assemblyman.


CALABRESE'S LIMO

speeds up beside the conspirators. Calabrese gets in,
the limo whips off down the wharf to pick up Vitale and
take off after Storm.


TRENT AND HOLLAND

stand watching -- grim, furious.


INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVES ROOM - NIGHT

A burly plainclothesman, MAX DUNNE, waves his phone
receiver at Karl, Storm's partner, who's still at the
desk where we last saw him. A TV across the room tuned
to the ACADEMY AWARDS.

                           DUNNE

EXT. MINI-MALL - NIGHT

A crummy mini-mall around Torrance. Storm exits the phone
booth -- crosses toward a liquor store, which is still
open this late at night.


INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Storm enters. A grimy, high-crime booze store.    Not
exactly the place to find Mumm's '36.

                         STORM
          How ya doing?
                 (looking around)
          Got any champagne?

The grizzled MAN behind the counter checks out Storm's
Versace threads.

                         COUNTER MAN
          Right next to the caviar.
                 (winks; points)
          There's some in the big cooler.

Storm likes the guy.    He notes the man's MINI-TV tuned to
WRESTLING.

                         STORM
          You're not watching the Oscars?

                           COUNTER MAN
          The Oscars?    I hate the Oscars.

Storm crosses to the cooler.

                         COUNTER MAN
          Who needs the goddam movies? I get
          it all in here every night.
                 (indicates his
                  view from behind
                  counter)
          Horror. Sex. Freaks. Violence.
          And I ain't gotta pay no four bucks.

Storm pulls a bottle from the cooler. He notices, on a
high shelf, a big stuffed toy. Something for Sonny.
Storm stretches up, grabs it. Suddenly:

He notices something in the big convex shoplifting mirror.
Something approaching from outside.

                         STORM
                 (to Counter Man)
          You got a phone back there?

                 (orders him)
          Punch nine-one-one.

The Man hesitates, letting a few precious seconds pass.
Three Latino PUNKS enter the store. One of them carries
a long-barreled shotgun.

                         COUNTER MAN
          Sonsofbitches! You creeps ripped
          me off two weeks ago!

                          SHOTGUN PUNK
          Shut up.

He gestures to the register.

                          COUNTER MAN
          Take it, man.   Take my life's
          savings.

He scoops bills from the cash drawer (about twenty bucks)
shoves them to the Shotgun Punk. The Punk scowls --

                         COUNTER MAN
          Where is a cop when you goddam need
          one?
                 (to Punks,
                  threatening)
          I got half a mind to come out there
          and teach you sonofabitch --

Shotgun Punk FIRES without warning -- point blank into
the counter display and the Man! The Counter Man is BLOWN
backwards -- cabinets crash; he crumples, groaning and
bloody onto the floor!

                         SHOTGUN PUNK
          Now you got half a mind, old man.

Punk #2 scoops up the money.   The three Punks saunter up
and surround Storm.

Storm looks down at their feet, then to their faces and
smiles. Shotgun Punk points the gun at Storm's face.

                         SHOTGUN PUNK
          What are you grinning at, pindejo?

                         STORM
          We ... ell ... there's only three
          of you and you only got one shot
          left.

The Punks don't know whether to laugh or just shoot him,
but it is too late for either option, as Storm suddenly
spins between the Punks and behind the gun.

The SHOTGUN GOES OFF and BLOWS away part of the back WALL --
BOTTLES EXPLODE -- Storm locks the Punk's fingers into
the gun, rotates the gun as a bar, breaking the Punk's
arm.

The others make their move -- but now Storm has the shotgun
and is using it as a sword or staff. He looks like a
true master conductor in an almost magical manipulation.
These pour stupid Punks have become the instruments in
his spontaneous orchestra.

Punk #2 takes a vicious swipe at Storm with his long knife.
Storm ducks, goes to his knees, and uses the gun to foot-
sweep the Punk. The Punk's legs fly skyward and his head
slams against the floor. As soon as he hits, the shotgun
is slammed through his teeth.

The last Punk has produced an icepick and is staring at
his compadres in disbelief. He and Storm square off.

                         STORM
                 (to Punk, calmly)
          I know what you're thinking.    I
          have this big shotgun and all   you
          have is that little icepick.    Mine's
          bigger than yours. It's not    fair.

Storm sets the gun down.    Punk #3 is still frozen.

                            STORM
          Still not fair?

Storm gets down on his knees.

                         STORM
          Don't wait for the blindfold,
          maricon.

                         PUNK #3
                 (clutching the
                  ice pick tightly)
          Chinga tu madre!

The Punk lungs, thrusting the ice pick with lightning
speed at Storm's face.

Storm makes a slight movement, parries the thrust and
slides his body behind the Punk, simultaneously slamming
his forearm into the rear knee joint.

The Punk buckles and Storm now has one of his legs in
both arms and pins the other leg with his left knee.

We see the leg held in Storm's arms begin to twist ...
and with a blood-curdling scream we hear a LOUD SNAP.

SIRENS are heard approaching outside.


EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Black and whites pack the   parking lot. Police ambulances
make ready to haul off the   three Punks. T he Counter
Man, bandaged on a gurney,   is wheeled out by paramedics.
One medic catches Storm's   eye -- flashes a gesture
indicating the Counter Man   will be okay.

Storm finishes with two other DETECTIVES, obviously
buddies, as they complete their on-site notes. The
champagne bottle rests on the hood of their car.

                         DETECTIVE #1
          You were armed, Storm -- why didn't
          you just use your gun?

                         STORM
          I just got these new glazer bullets.
          You know they're almost a buck a
          pop now?

He grabs the champagne, takes off for his car.


INT. STORM'S CAR - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Chuck Mangione's "Feels So Good" PLAYS in the TAPE DECK.
Storm listens for a few beats, as if letting the horn
cool him out after the liquor store action. Then he ejects
the tape decisively -- reaches into his camera case, pulls
out the surveillance tape from tonight. He punches this
tape into the deck.

Storm listens. The part where the Shadow Man with the
hat (Trent) says, "You'll be well compensated. Money now --
and more when I get into that office. You can take that
to the bank." Storm CRANKS UP the VOLUME.

                         STORM
          I know that voice.

Who the hell is it?   He rewinds the tape --


EXT. STREET - STORM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Storm's car turns into the block, slows approaching his
house.

INT. STORM'S CAR - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Still listening. Can't place the voice. Punches " eject,"
the tape pops half-out. Into the driveway, Storm activates
the garage door remote.


INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Storm's car stops, headlights go out. The garage door
closes. Storm gets out, carrying his camera case,
champagne and the big stuffed toy. He takes a couple of
steps toward the door to the house, then stops, remembering -

He leans back into the car, yanks the surveillance tape
from the deck. Hands full, he tucks the tape into a inside
pocket of his Versace vest.


INT. STORM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

It's late; just a courtesy lamp left on for Storm. He
pulls the tapes and recorder from his case, stashes the
case out of sight. He grabs a couple of champagne glasses --

tiptoes toward the bedroom. Felicia appears at the top
of the stairs, wearing panties and a teddy top. She smiles
seeing the big toy, shooshes Storm --


ANGLE FROM SONNY'S ROOM

Storm stops outside his boy's room, looking in. Felicia
tiptoes up beside him. Sonny sprawls loose-limbed on the
bed in his Woody Woodpecker pajamas.

                         STORM
          Wish I could sleep like that.

                         FELICIA
          Maybe I can help you.

She tugs Storm sexily toward the bedroom --

                         SONNY
          Is that for me, Dad?

Storm stops, toy in hand --

                          STORM
          You faker.

He comes into the room, sits on the edge of Sonny's bed --
tousling his son's hair with great affection. Sonny takes
the stuffed toy sleepily, pulls it into bed beside him.

                          SONNY
          E.T. lost.

Storm knows E.T. is not just a movie character to Sonny;
he's a real person.

                          STORM
          Who won?

                          SONNY
          I dunno.   Candy.

                          STORM
          Candy?

                         FELICIA
                 (from doorway)
          Mahatma Candy. He was a great man.

Storm moves closer to his son. He sees how much E.T.'s
loss has hurt his son, and wants to make it better.

                         STORM
                 (very gently)
          You know why E.T. lost?

                          SONNY
          Why?

                         STORM
          Cause they only let grownups vote.
          If kids had voted --

                         SONNY
                 (cheered by

                         STORM
          We would have given him everything.

                          SONNY
          Yeah.

Storm starts to rise.

                  up)
          One joke a day. I have to make 'em
          last.

Already Sonny is most of the way back to sleep.   Storm
kisses his forehead --


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

INSERT - JOHNNY CARSON - 1982 "TONIGHT SHOW"

In mid-joke behind his famous desk.

Storm and Felicia forms obscure part of the screen --
standing close to each other, beside the bed. Felicia
helps him off with his jacket.

                         FELICIA
          There's blood on your jacket.

                          STORM
          It's okay.   It's not mine.

Storm's hands dump his stuff onto the bedside table --
camera, tapes from case, gun. He gathers the glasses,
pours champagne.

Felicia watches her husband. She plainly loves him deeply --
and is held and excited by his contradictions. They come
closer together, clinking their glasses, sipping.

                         FELICIA
          If people knew how sweet you are,
          they'd never be scared of you.

She kisses him seductively, unbuttoning his shirt at the
collar. Storm still wears the vest.

                         FELICIA
          I'm not scared of you.

                         STORM
          Maybe you should be.

                  increasing

                         STORM
          A couple of things crossed my mind,
          in the car coming home.

Another kiss. They get their glasses out of the way,
Storm lowers his wife languidly onto the bed. They begin
kissing more deeply. Storm helps Felicia slide out of
her teddy top; her beautiful breasts rise into the light.
Storm begins to kiss them, she moans with pleasure. The
lovemaking increases in intensity, Felicia's hand groping
to open Storm's pants. He begins to help her, guiding
her legs apart --

                         FELICIA
                 (in mid-kiss)
          Door's open.

Not missing a beat, Storm grabs a heavy pillow, heaves it --
without looking -- at the door.

ANGLE FROM HALLWAY - BEDROOM DOOR

The pillow strikes it, starting it swinging closed. Storm
and Felicia's forms, on the bed, are eclipsed. Sound
from the "CARSON SHOW" DROPS DOWN -


INT. STORM'S HOUSE - ANOTHER HALLWAY - NIGHT

TWO MEN -- carrying shotguns, faces hidden by masks --
move soundlessly down a hall. A terrible alien presence
within this normal American household. The men turn a
corner into a different hallway --


MEN'S POV - MOVING - HAND-HELD

At the end of this new hall: the bedroom door.


ANGLE - TWO MEN

creeping closer.


BEDROOM - STORM AND FELICIA

Their passion highly aroused now. Felicia's legs wrapped
tight around Storm... their breathing, combined with the
TV sound, seems like it would obscure the men's silent
movement out in the hall. But:

Storm suddenly freezes.   Listening.

                    (frightened)
            What?

Storm lunges for his .45 on the nightstand. Suddenly
LOUD and VIOLENT CRASH and the bedroom door is kicked in.
Two dark figures with shotguns leveled fill the door.

There is an eruption of GUNFIRE and blinding muzzle blast
and smoke. In the dim light for a moment we do not know
what has happened, then:


STORM'S POV

We see one of the assassins thrown backward, jacket blown
open at the shoulder.

                                                SWITCH TO:


ASSASSIN'S PARTNER'S POV

We see Storm hit badly at close range. He takes it in
the right center mass. It looks like his right arm is
torn off as his .45 is literally blown across the room.
Felicia is now hysterically screaming -- but not for long --
as she is mortally wounded. We are sure Storm will
collapse and this horror will be over, but Storm rushes
the remaining assailant, and tilting his body sideways as
he enters, he avoids one more ferocious BLAST.

The momentum of Storm's quick spin catches the assailant
perfectly, and like a fast spinning top slammed against
another, Storm has the puppet by the strings. He clamps
down with his left and only good hand on the assailant's
right hand, and uses it against the gun as a tool for
more torque. Spinning him around until he is at the peak
of his circle, Storm with all his might spins his whole
body in the opposite direction quickly, using the whipping
effect of his shoulder and hip to snap the assailant's
wrist and flip him violently.

There is a LOUD CRACK and   scream as he lands on his head
and neck, and then -- from   the side, point-blank --another
ferocious SHOTGUN BLAST --   Storm is blown into the air
and back onto the bed from   which he came.

                                         QUICK CUTAWAY TO:

INT. STORM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The scene of slaughter we just left. Now in perfect
stillness and quiet we HIGH ANGLE PAN DOWN the room in
...


SLOW MOTION:

Down feathers   slowly float down toward the terribly sad
and lifeless   bodies of Storm and Felicia.  Holes pepper
walls; lamps   obliterated; beds and pillows not even a
semblance of   their original form; crimson red and white
smoke.


BEDROOM - NORMAL SPEED

The two assassins recover themselves.    Bigger Man's
shoulder: limp and bloody.

          Get to work.

They do. Big Man collects tapes and camera from the
bedside table, replacing them with large lumps of cocaine
and cash. Then lie coolly places something on the night
stand directly in front of the lifeless cop's face -- it
is a tooth.

Little Man rifles Storm's pockets, including the Versace
jacket beside the bed.

Storm's little boy stands there, in his Woody Woodpecker
pajamas, holding the stuffed toy. He stares in numb
horror.

HALLWAY - TWO MEN

Big Man (Dunne) boots Sonny's door open, crashes in --


SONNY'S ROOM - WINDOW

Sonny plunges out just as both men OPEN FIRE. They pound
ROUND after ROUND into and through the window, blowing
GLASS everywhere and ripping the windowframe and half the
wall to shreds. An ALARM begins BLARING. The men glance
to each other, flee.


EXT. STORM'S HOUSE - FRONT WALK - NIGHT

ALARM CONTINUING. The men emerge walking swiftly but not
running, shotguns tight to their sides. They cross the
street to a sedan parked in shadows. Up goes the trunk:
in go shotguns, plastic bag with tapes -- and their masks,
which they have just torn off.


INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

Little Man whips behind the wheel. He is Jack Ford, an
extremely bad hombre we've never seen before. He STARTS
the CAR. Big Man in the passenger seat. We recognize
him! He is Max Dunne -- the burly man who took Storm's
phone call in the police station and passed the receiver
to Karl.

strides forward into the crush.

ASSEMBLYMAN TRENT AND CAPTAIN HOLLAND

side by side in the mob scene. We recognize the two Shadow
Men from the wharf -- the ones who ordered Storm's murder.
Under the glare of a mini-cam lamp, a female TV reporter
tries to get Trent to talk.

                          TRENT
                  (emotional)
           knew Storm from when I was City

           ...
                  (can't go on)
           I'm sorry ... sorry --

Trent's grief is so sincere, he himself almost believes
it; his aides shield him from the camera, steer him away,
in the direction of where O'Malley is. Holland goes the
opposite way. The reporter picks up her V.O.:

                          TV REPORTER (V.O.)
           That was Assemblyman Vernon Trent,
           deeply moved by the loss of an
           officer he knew, (etc.).

Medics wheel Felicia's body past, one bloody forearm
visible beneath the sheet.

                          TRENT
           What makes people do this?
                  (in tears, agony)
           Will you tell me? Will someone please
           tell me?!!

O'Malley watches Trent pass, weeping, escorted out by
police and aides.

Across the crowd O'Malley spots Captain Holland, who
apparently is the man he's searching for.

                          O'MALLEY
                  (calls)
           Holland! Captain Holland!

In the general hubbub, Holland doesn't hear -- conferring
with some other officers.

ANGLE PAST HOLLAND - EMERGENCY ROOM

THROUGH the glass partition, we see doctors and nurses
going about their examination of Storm's body.


O'MALLEY

pushes his way toward Holland. Two uniformed cops in the
crush along the way. O'Malley comes up beside Holland.

                          HOLLAND (BAREHEADED SHADOW)
           They always said Storm was
           superhuman. Now we know why he was
           always jacked up on coke!

O'Malley grabs Holland, slams him against the glass wall.

                          O'MALLEY
                  (whisper, full
                   of menace)
           Let me tell you something, you piss-
           ant. That man in there was the
           cleanest I ever knew -- with more
           honor and guts than this whole
           department put together. If I ever
           hear you say fuck all like that
           again, I'll lose my shield to put

O'Malley releases Holland, backs off, calming himself.
The men stare at each other.

                 (hostile)
          What the hell's I.A. doing up at
          this hour?

          Taking over the show.

                         HOLLAND
          This is Homicide, not Internal
          Affairs.

O'Malley tugs out a letter on official stationery.

                         O'MALLEY
          We got two cops down, with money
          and drugs all over the place. This
          is straight from the commissioner.

Holland is clearly upset by this, but knows he can't argue
with a letter from the commissioner. Reluctantly he yields.
He turns his gaze back to the stretcher in the ER.

Now he and O'Malley are just two officers, sharing a loss.

                         HOLLAND
          You and Storm were tight, O'Malley.
          I'm sorry.

                         O'MALLEY
          He was the most unstoppable
          sonofabitch I ever knew.

                          HOLLAND
          Well.

He got stopped tonight.

Holland breaks his stare at Storm's body and drags away,
signaling his own cops to vacate. They exit. No farewells
between Holland and O'Malley. O'Malley waits silently,
watching Holland and his men clear the corridor and
disappear.

O'Malley stares at Storm's body, stunned. The Doctor
stands beside him -- at the side of the room, away from
the medics.

                          E.R. DOCTOR
           The paramedics called it wrong, so
           did my people at first. Look... it
           happens. The man had no vital signs.
           With all the blood and excitement,
           I almost missed it myself. But we
           have a pulse now. Your man is alive,
           Lieutenant.

O'Malley's eyes flash from Storm (over whom the medics
are now working) to the corridor outside, at the end of
which he can see several straggling cops and news people.
His mind is racing --

He spots something on a stainless steel medical table:
Storm's blood-soaked vest, apparently tossed there when
the medics stripped Storm to work on him. O'Malley picks
the vest up. He studies it -

MARTHA COE, an attractive black nurse about Andy's age,
finishes her shift report. She barely pays attention as
Andy comes up, starts unloading her stuff.

                         MARTHA
          You're early again.

                         ANDY
                 (deadpan)
          You won't report me, will you?

Andy gulps from Martha's coffee cup. We see they're good
friends, who've split shifts on this ward for many moons.

                         ANDY
                 (re: shift report)
          Inquiring minds want to know --

                         MARTHA
          -- Dr. Cannon ordered a glucose
          drip on Jimmy See. Mack's E.E.G.
          monitor's developing a nice
          electronic hiccup -- and your
          boyfriend...
                 (indicating
                  Storm)
          ... turned his head.

                            ANDY
                    (electrified)
          He did?

In a coma ward, this is headline news.

                         MARTHA
                 (excited too)
          I thought he was going to sit up.
          I almost shit!

The nurses laugh. But Andy's glance toward Storm's bed
is full of deep care and hope.


INT. COMA WARD - CLOSE ON STORM - LATER

Changed in seven years, softer. His shaggy    hair is
manicured in a sleeker, longer length and he   wears a
smartly short, perfectly trimmed beard. We    glimpse, on
Storm's chart, the identifying label: "JOHN   DOE 461Z."


ANGLE - BEDS OF OTHER PATIENTS

trapped between sleep and death.    A spectral, haunting
scene, full of pathos.


BESIDE STORM'S BED - ANDY

works, full of beauty and youth -- like a beacon of life
and hope in this silent still world. She runs a physical
therapy regimen on Storm and seems quite expert at this
delicate work. The "workouts" are electronically induced
by sophisticated impulse equipment.

                   compassion and
                   hope)

          don't care what the doctors say, I
          know my words are reaching you
          somehow.

             I'm going to  talk to you tonight...
             and tomorrow  night ... and the night
             after that.  I'm going to keep talking
             to you till  you come back --

On the shelf behind his head is a framed photo of Yogi
Berra, with the quote: "IT AIN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER.
Andy lifts it and sets it an the pillow beside Storm's
head.

                            ANDY
             Yogi said it ain't over till it's
             over. Till the fat lady sings.
             There's life in you, J.D., I feel
             it. I'll never give up on you, and
             you'll never give up on yourself --

She finishes working out Storm's muscles, beginning
disconnecting the contact points. She stops, lifts the
robe off Storm so that she can see his lower body, naked,
underneath.

                            ANDY
             Besides ... you've got so much to
             live for.

As Andy replaces the sheet, her WRISTWATCH ALARM BEEPS a
reminder. Checking the watch, she leans over and smooths
Storm's sheet, touching him tenderly.

                             ANDY
             Sorry.   I won't be long.

She exits.

Martha pouring herself a cup of coffee.     Andy comes in.

                            MARTHA
             How's the sleeping prince?

Andy crosses to the counter, starts pouring herself a cup
too.

                             ANDY
             Still sleeping.
                    (serious)

          It's eight hours, not twenty-four.

          I'll make up for 'em later.


INT. COMA WARD - CLOSE ON STORM - NIGHT

His hand moves! A beat ... then another. Something's
happening. Another beat, and then we see him draw several
sharp intake breaths, then a very deep breath. Suddenly
he shudders intensely --


MONTAGE - SUBLIMINAL SEQUENCE

Storm's return to consciousness. Like a disjointed dream
sequence, we meld OPTICALLY DISTORTED FOOTAGE of scenes
into a quick sequence depicting Storm's journey up the
"tunnel" from unconsciousness and back to life:

A) Storm emerging from the door of his house, the night
of the Oscars. Felicia smiling, taking his arm --

B) Sonny's bedroom, the night of the Oscars.   Sonny with,
the stuffed toy, embracing Storm --

C) The masked assassins. SHOTGUN BLASTS detonating point
blank into Storm and Felicia --


INT. COMA WARD - STORM

His eyes open. He grimaces with pain, as if even the dim
illumination of the ward blinds him. His eyes keep
blinking and squeezing, his tongue working for saliva --


INT. NURSES' STATION - ANDY

Alone, doing paperwork, concentrating totally on her work.


INT. COMA WARD - STORM

His hand slowly rises, finds his face. He discovers the
electrodes, pausing to determine what they are, everything
a slow painful effort.

INT. NURSES' STATION - ANDY

A BUZZER sounds on a bank of monitoring equipment. Andy
glances up; a light flashes on one screen. She studies
the screen a moment, gives a perplexed look toward the
ward --


INT. COMA WARD

Andy enters, scanning the area, listening. She moves
down the row of patients, visually checking each. She
stops at Storm and checks him, too.

Storm's eyes are closed; he's motionless.

Andy turns, starts to exit.

                           STORM
                   (in b.g., weakly,
                    directly behind)
            -- Nurse ...

Andy whips around, sucking air and falling back, knocking
over an IV UNIT -- which SHATTERS on the floor!

She turns and sprints from the room.


INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - TRACKING STORM'S GURNEY - NIGHT

As we crash through  doors WITH it. MOVING FAST. Knotted
around Storm is an  emergency team of doctors and nurses.
A controlled chaos  of AD LIB status reports and queries
from them overlaps  as the doors swing shut behind them.

Andy is left alone on the coma ward.


INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

Andy unlocks a drawer, pulls out a laminated card from
the record notice section. She picks up a phone, punches
in a long series of numbers.


INTERCUT:


INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DETECTIVES' ROOM - NIGHT

The PHONE on someone's desk begins RINGING.   JONES, a
plainclothesman, picks it up.

                         JONES
          Internal affairs. Detective Sergeant
          Jones.

                         ANDY
          My name is Andrea Simpson. I'm
          calling from U.C.I. Medical Center.
          I'd like to speak with
                 (reads from
                  card)
          Captain O'Malley.

Wheels start to turn in Jones' head.

                         JONES
          What is this in regard to, please?

                         ANDY
          I have a John Doe coma patient,
          code access 461 zebra, with
          instructions to notify upon any
          change in condition.

                         JONES
          What is the change?

                         ANDY
                 (with enthusiasm)
          The patient has regained
          consciousness.

Jones reacts -- puts his hand over the receiver, turns to
a leather-faced plainclothesman (NOLAN) at the next desk.

                          JONES
                 (urgent)
          Nolan. Get Holland at home ...

                 (back to Andy
                  on phone)
          I'm sorry, Ms. Simpson. Captain
          O'Malley is no longer with this
          division. Let me take your
          information. Please ... contact no
          one else on this matter.


INT. COMA WARD - NIGHT

Storm back in bed. A knot of doctors finishes returning
him from their emergency resuscitation work. "We'll leave
him here for tonight, where they've got the full support
setup." The team wraps up and begins to move off.

The TEAM LEADER instructs Andy in Storm's immediate
condition and care.

                         DOCTOR (TEAM LEADER)
          -- Clip him with 50 cc of Thorazine
          if he gives you any trouble. I'm
          afraid he's very disoriented and
          quite paranoid. He thinks people
          are trying to kill him.

The team exits. Andy is alone in the ward with the
immobile patients -- and Storm. Storm groans and tries
to lift himself onto an elbow.

                         STORM
          Miss ... please ... they won't tell
          me ... think I'm too disorient --

                         ANDY
          This is U.C.I. Medical Center.
          You've been in a coma. Your charts

                          STORM
                 (staggered)
          Seven... years?

He can't absorb this.   It's too much.   His mind reels.

                         STORM
          Who ... who knows I'm awake?

                         ANDY
                 (innocent
                  enthusiasm)
          It's all over the hospital. You're
          the first one that's come out of a
          coma of this duration. You'll
          probably be on the news!

She touches him kindly -- but Storm sees that she doesn't
believe him, thinks he's paranoid.

          Goddamit --
                 (urgent but
                  weak)
          can't stay here. Listen to me -

          I'll have one of the aides take you

          It'll help you relax.

          No --

                         ANDY
          Listen... I've got work to do.
          You're my cutest patient, but you're
          not my only one.

She leaves. Storm blows a sigh of frustration. His body
won't do what his brain tells it! In half-paralyzed rage
he struggles to move his limbs, open and close his hands --


INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT

An accident case being hurried in from an ambulance.
Paramedics, E.R. personnel and patients fill the scene.
A bespectacled doctor in a white coat casually emerges
from the crush and continues on into a hallway.


ANGLE - DOCTOR

This is no doctor; it's Jack Ford, one of the killers who
shotgunned Storm seven years ago!


INT. HYDROTHERAPY ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

DANNY, an aide, has Storm harnessed in a frothing
whirlpool.


INT. FIRST FLOOR/MAIN DIRECTORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Several nurses chat and drink coffee at a clerical station.
Ford comes up - nameplate, stethoscope, looking the part
perfectly. We see him exchange a greeting, ask a question.
One of the nurses hands him a clipboard with some papers
on it. As the killer scans the clipboard -RUSS, the
security man, approaches.

Ford averts his face subtly, continuing to study the list.
Russ passes, with a greeting for the nurses -- and a
(slightly unsure) nod for the killer. The killer nods
back.

SECOND FLOOR SUPPLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Andy arrives and goes about business.


INT. THIRD FLOOR ELEVATORS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A set of DOORS DINGS open.   Ford steps out.


INT. COMA WARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Eerie ultraviolet; motionless forms; steady HUM of
monitoring EQUIPMENT -- and the shuffle of the killer's
shoes ... moving purposefully from bed to bed checking
each chart for the right name.


INT. THIRD-FLOOR NORTH CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Danny helps Storm out of the tub.


INT. COMA WARD - CLOSE ON FORD - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Checking the chart in the dim blue when -- a flashlight
ray suddenly hits his face ...

                          RUSS
           Excuse me, Doctor. I have to check
           everyone on the upper floors.
                  (comes forward,
                   no suspicion)
           Can I just get your I.D. --

PHHT!   Russ takes the SILENCED SHOT right between the
eyes.   His body collapses in a heap there in the entry.


INT. THIRD-FLOOR CORRIDOR

Danny wheels Storm through the big swinging doors.
Suddenly -- he freezes.


DANNY'S POV

He sees Russ's partial body in the doorway up the hall
recognizable because of its security uniform trousers.

DANNY

reacts as if fearing Russ has had a heart attack. He
leaves Storm, rushes forward to investigate. Storm strains
to see.


INT. DOORWAY TO COMA WARD

                            DANNY
                    (dashes up)
            Russ!   Russ, are you --

PHHT!   PHHT!   Danny sprawls onto the floor, dead.


INT. CLOSE ON STORM

Doesn't need to see to recognize that sound. He gropes
at once for the wall corner, trying to propel his litter
back through the swinging doors and out of sight.

Storm strains for it, his limbs maddeningly uncooperative
... stretching, pawing ... until -- he claws far enough
to reach where the janitor's mop rests against the wall.


COMA WARD - HALLWAY - FORD

steps into the hallway, peering up and down -- just as
Storm slides out of view. The killer grabs Danny's body
by the ankles, to drag it back out of sight. Just then:


ANDY

backs   through the double doors at the other end of the
hall,   trying to balance an overloaded tray of supplies
she's   carrying. She and Ford are momentarily in full
view   of each other ... but backs turned. Suddenly --
Ford   hears Andy! He spins ... gun ready.

Andy carefully   heads   that way -- the two corpses visible
ahead and the   killer   poised to waste her. But she's
concentrating   on the   overloaded tray, traveling closer
... closer ...   until   -- she turns off into the medicine
room.

Ford swiftly hauls both corpses out of sight.


AT ELEVATORS

Storm weakly, awkwardly "rows" himself toward the elevators
with the mop handle. Then using his hands, trying to
grasp the wall and push himself along.

He makes it within reach of the call button and stabs at
it with the mop handle. Misses. Again. Then: bull's-
eye! The light comes on!


INT. COMA WARD

Ford has found the last (Storm's) medical chart -- and
the empty bed. He's heading back -- frustrated, angry
out toward the hall when... the elevator BELL DINGS.


AT ELEVATORS

Storm struggles to push himself inside. Everything an
excruciating effort. The doors slap into his litter,
trying to close. Reopen. Close. Reopen. Hindering him
as he throws a look toward --


INT. CORRIDOR - FORD

stalks this way, ears tuned to the SLAPPING DOORS ahead
around the corner. He breaks into a trot --


ELEVATORS - STORM

makes it all the way in with a final heave.   FOOTSTEPS
nearing. The doors not yet closed and --


INT. CORRIDOR - FORD

rounds the corner just as they shut.   Races forward --


INT. ELEVATOR

Storm jabs at the panel for the lobby button -- but the
shaky mop handle hits 7TH FLOOR instead.

                         STORM
          Sonofabitch!

THIRD-FLOOR CORRIDOR - AT ELEVATORS

The killer hears this -- hears the ELEVATOR START UP. He
punches the call button. The other elevator opens. He
plunges in just as:


SOUTH CORRIDOR - ANDY

comes out of the medicine room and spots blood on the
floor, hurries forward -- sees Russ and Danny's bodies!

  Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               38.



She backs off in horror.

Andy rushes to the ward station, lunges for the phone --
finds it's been cut. Her view into the coma room suddenly
brings the realization that Storm's bed is still gone.


STORM'S ELEVATOR

The doors open -- revealing   a dark, deserted seventh floor
still under construction.    He registers the opposing
elevator rising his way --   jabbing again at the control
panel ... exposed there ...   doors wide open.  Wild stabs.
Any button will do -- just   close the goddam door!

DING! Ford's ELEVATOR arrives. Doors open. We make out
the killer's form -- just as Storm's doors close.

Storm blows huge relief. Looks to see what he finally
pushed ... Shit! -- the 3RD FLOOR button. He puts the
mop to the side wall and shoves himself with all he's
got.  The gurney wheels around and places him right next
to the control panel. Storm twists onto his side and
slams a hand over the EMERGENCY STOP button. But the
button jams! And Storm's thrusting hand has pushed his
gurney even farther away! He can't reach it!

He feels the elevator about to stop at a floor ... claws
at the mop, as a weapon ... raises it with all his feeble
strength. The doors open and --

Andy crashes into him!

                            ANDY
             My God!

                            STORM

Pounding down the steps three at a time.    Gun in hand.


INT. LOBBY

Andy hauls Storm's litter full tilt out   of the elevator.
A night janitor is waxing the floor, his   long power cord
snaking down the corridor. He stares in    astonishment at
this nurse racing down the corridor with   a gurney --

bucks, almost capsizes.

          I'm sorry!    Sorry --

She heaves the gurney, despite all its weight, past the
power cord, just as:


FORD

hurtles from the stairwell. In one beat, he takes in the
janitor; in the next, Andy and Storm -- down the hall.
Ford takes off after them. He's going to catch them!


JANITOR

jerks up on the power cord! It whipsnakes down the hall,
flaring up, tripping Ford! He sprawls face-first as:


EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Andy blasts through the exit doors with Storm on the
gurney. She hauls ass with him into the parking lot --


BACK TO FORD

He spins, on the floor, drills TWO SILENCED SHOTS into
the janitor's chest. The janitor drops.


EXT. HOSPITAL EXIT - FORD

highballs from the doors, in time to see:

Storm sprawled, asleep, exhausted, in the passenger seat.
Andy windblown at the wheel. A pair of fugitives, on the

"OJAI."


INT. L.A. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - MEETING ROOM - DAY

OPENING ON a   big table, covered with weapons confiscated
from gangs --   pistols, knives, assault rifles. Reporters
crowd around   Senator Trent at the table. A large sign
reads: "GANG   WEAPONS SEIZED IN ONE WEEK!"

                         TRENT
                 (to group,
                  finishing up)

          week. We're going to put a stop to
          it -- and we're going to start right
          here!

Trent picks an AK-47 off the table and stuffs it
theatrically into a huge TRASH CAN. News cameras record
this juicy nugget for the nightly news.

                         TRENT
          I'll be talking with the mayor.
          We'll have a statement shortly --

He raises a fist in a "power salute," moves off --


SIDE OF ROOM - TRENT

Waving and beaming, edges away to the "wings," where Ford
and Dunne wait, along with Holland -- proper and official
in their plainclothes suits.

                         TRENT
                 (to Holland,
                  furious)
          How much dirt do I have to shovel
          into this goddam Storm's grave?

          Jesus Christ!
                 (turns to Ford)
          The man is flat out on a stretcher
          and you still can't kill him!

Reporters and bystanders continue to approach and
congratulate Trent. He handles them easily, shaking hands --
then ducking back, aside, to his thugs.

                         TRENT
          Holland -- plaster his ass with
          slime in the press. Put a tail on
          every person he knows --

                         HOLLAND
          We know how to do our job, Senator.

                         TRENT
          Then start showing it.
                 (to Ford, Dunne)
          I'm starring in that sonofabitch's
          home movie -- and the Oscar is thirty
          years in the slammer. He's toast,
          understand?

The assassins nod grimly. Trent turns, hands raised
triumphantly, to the crowd.

                         TRENT
                 (to crowd)
          We're going to end violence in this
          state -- and you can take that to
          the bank!


EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - DAY

A horse in sunshine.    Pretty oaks on a hillside beyond.


INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - BEDR00M    DAY

Storm blinks his eyes   -- groggy, disoriented. He is in
bed, just waking up.    Outside his window: this postcard-
perfect ranch scene.    Has he died and gone to heaven? He
can barely absorb it:   nature, sunshine, life.

Storm peers around. He is alone in a pretty room, with
Western and Oriental furnishings. He's safe; someone has
apparently put him to bed, seen that he's comfortable.
He remembers: the nurse ... Andy.

A TV is on at the foot of the bed.     Storm squints at the
digital clock beside him: 4:17 PM.     Storm closes his eyes.

                            STORM
            Seven years.

He struggles to sit. It takes all his strength simply to
get half-propped on pillows. Something jabs him. It's a
TV remote, on the sheet beside him. Storm picks it up.

After a beat, he manages to focus on the TV --

TV SCREEN - "GERALDO SHOW" (FILE TAPE)

Heated argument in progress. Suddenly Roy Innis leaps
from his chair, starts strangling a white supremacist
across from him. Melee. The stage flooded with shooting,
fist-fighting men. Geraldo's nose is broken!

                           ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Dumbstruck.

                            STORM
            Geraldo?

Outside the HORSE WHINNIES loudly and rears up on its
hind legs. Storm turns toward the horse --

When Storm is turned away from the TV, a 10-second ad
comes on. Senator Trent waving and smiling to a crowd.

                           AD (V.O.)
                   (from TV)
            Senator Vernon Trent promises:   No

                   (from TV)
            And you can take that to the bank!

Storm misses this.     He turns back to:

          I want to help him... my God, he
          needs it ... but it's all over the
          T.V., he's some kind of crooked cop
          with drugs and murder and --

CLICK. Andy turns to see Storm standing there, glowering       --
his hand on the PHONE hang-up bar.

For half a beat, Andy is frightened: unsure what this man
will do. Then Storm starts to collapse.

Andy rushes to him, supports him.

                         ANDY
          It's okay -- I'm here, I'm with
          you.

          right   now.
                   (listens)
          Tell   him it's Storm. Mason Storm.

Storm cups the receiver -- steaming -- waiting to be put
through. His eyes flash to the room, the house...

                         STORM
                 (to Andy)
          I can't stay here. They'll trace

          I'm house-sitting...
                  (out of patience,
                   frustrated and
                   frightened)
          This place belongs to a doctor friend
          of my parents. He's in China now,
          on research... won't be back for
          six months. The medical center
          only has my apartment address.
          Even my friends don't have this
          number.
                  (beat)
          Will you believe me?! We're safe
          here.

Storm studies her for a long beat.   Then:   a voice comes
onto the phone line.

                         STORM
                 (into phone)

We see a little more of where we are: a pretty little
retreat, nestled amid rolling hills. With the evening
light, the mood seems softer.

terrible. Andy sits on the floor at the coffee table --a

                         ANDY
          We'll find your friend O'Malley.
          We'll just keep phoning ...

                            STORM
          Listen.     I'm getting out of here.

He grabs for a cane resting against the sofa.

                         ANDY
                 (knows he has
                  no chance)
          I'll buy tickets to that.

                         STORM
          I just need some food -- and a few
          days to get my strength.

                          ANDY
          Days?   Try a few weeks.

Storm braces against the cane, ready to try to stand.
Andy gets up, to catch him. This infuriates Storm's pride.

                         STORM
          You helped me, okay? I'm grateful.
          But every day you keep helping puts
          you in more danger.

                         ANDY
                 (deadpan)
          Danger is my middle name.

This is no joke to Storm.

                         STORM
          I've been dead, Andy.      You wouldn't
          like it.

He tries to get up.    Andy stops him.

                          ANDY
          Hey, hey -- I don't think you get
          the picture here. Your muscles
          have been getting electronic
          stimulation at the hospital, but
          it's not like actually being up and
          bearing weight.

                         STORM

          invalid! And second, I don't have
          time --

He makes it upright, shaking, with a "See, I told you"
look.

He starts toward the kitchen. Andy looks very worried
but doesn't try to stop him. First step -- okay. Second --
okay. Third -- blam! The cane slips and he falls flat on
his face. Too weak to break the fall.


LOW ANGLE - STORM

We see his face on the carpet and a mean desperate
conviction in these eyes not to fail and not to give up.
He struggles to rise -- it is pitiful. He's on his knees
growling with effort. Cane propped up, he manages to
somehow stand again. One step ... two steps ... three,
four ... he's absolutely exhausted. Boom! Falls flat
again.


ANOTHER LOW ANGLE

Storm's face on the floor.


EXTREME CLOSEUP

Fury, frustration, despair --


ANDY

grabs his arm and helps him back onto the couch. She
exits the room and comes back momentarily with a bowl of
rice and begins to try to feed him. Of course he takes
the fork away and tries it himself, but by now his arms
are so fatigued from the previous strain that they shake,
his hand trembles and he misses his mouth -- getting the
rice all down his beard. Spilling a little too much to
ignore and at first it looks like he's going to explode.
He looks up at Andy, who looks so sad.

Storm breaks out laughing and so does Andy. They howl
together for a while and then settle down. Now Andy begins
to "help" feed Storm.

She looks at what Storm is writing: Chinese characters.
Storm writes from top to bottom, straight up and down.

                         STORM
          Just some herbs I need for my
          recovery.

She takes the list, studies it.

                         ANDY
          No problem. This is on my list for
          Safeway every day.


EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - DAY

Andy's car drives up to the house, pulls into the garage.


INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Andy enters, carrying a folder, and stares in surprise.
Storm has shaved and cut his hair. She obviously approves.
She watches for several moments as Storm, weak but on his
feet, holds on to the kitchen counter. He steps out, in
wobbly balance. Not too good at first, he tries again.
This time he does better, but not by much. He turns to
look at Andy, conscious of her look of sympathy.

                         STORM
                 (re: himself)
          That bad ... huh?

She silently hands him a set of newspaper photocopies.
He glances at them... at her ... and understands.

                         ANDY
          I'll be in the other room.

Storm slowly seats himself and begins to read.

INT. TRENT'S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE ON TV SCREEN - JACK ESPOSITO

A well-known L.A. anchorman, Jack Esposito "whom we
glimpsed earlier in the mini-TV in the Armstead kitchen
scene), delivers the news.

A graphic behind him has a photo of Storm, captioned:
"COMA COP. "

                    (on TV)
             -- This reporter was contacted
             personally by the now-infamous 'Coma
             Cop'... fugitive officer Mason Storm --
             who until days ago had languished
             in a seven-year coma.


WIDEN SHOT

             Storm gave me his word that he is
             innocent of all charges preferred
             against him in the press -- and
             that he has access to indisputable
             proof of this. Battling the atrophy
             caused by seven years of
             hospitalization, Storm is struggling
             even now to regain the strength
             that will enable him to come forward
             with this evidence. He has promised
             me and the K.A.B.C. audience a first
             look at his alleged proof.

A WOMAN in a nurse's uniform comes INTO VIEW on the
sidewalk, trots up the steps toward the second floor of
the apartment building.

REVEALING that they are watching this from a parked car
from across the street. They get out, glance around
furtively --


INT. APARTMENT - EVENING

The nurse is Martha -- Andy's friend from the hospital.
She holds a cat in her arms.

                         MARTHA (WOMAN)
                 (responds to
                  interrogation)
          I told you -- Andy's out of town.
          I just came by to pick up her cat.

                         DUNNE
          Where out of town is Andy?

                         MARTHA
          I don't know.
                 (losing patience)
          Look, I've been questioned by you
          cops half a dozen times since
          Tuesday. I'm getting a little tired
          of it.

          You need a warrant to walk in on
          someone like this. Get the hell

The cops don't budge.    It's getting a little scary.

Clutching the cat, she strides for the door. Ford's foot
slides the door shut. He and Dunne block Martha.

                         FORD
          We'll ask you again, Martha:     Where
          is Miss Simpson?

Martha backs away -- toward a telephone.

                         MARTHA
          I'm calling your superior officers
          to report this. I want both your
          names and shield numbers.

She picks up the phone. Dunne's enormous hand engulfs
her wrist, forces her to put the phone back in the cradle.
The two cops stare at her penetratingly.

Martha knows this is it -- life or death.

She hurls the cat into Ford's face; the CAT claws him,
SHRIEKING. Martha knees Dunne in the balls, bolts --


EXT. APARTMENT - WALKWAY - EVENING

Martha sprints from the door, toward the stairs, screaming.

                           MARTHA
          Help?   Help me!

Ford appears in the apartment doorway, his face scratched
and bleeding. He aims his silencer-mounted .45 --


ANGLE - TOP OF STAIRS - MARTHA

The front of her white uniform erupts in a bloody gush;
she plunges face-first down the flight of stairs.


ANGLE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS

Martha's crumpled form. Ford and Dunne hurry swiftly
down -- pick up her body, drag it a few feet to a
smackadjacent steep hillside covered with thick brush.
They peer around swiftly to be sure no one has seen them,
then slide the body under the brush, down the hill. In
three seconds it has slithered ten feet down, out of sight.

The killers take off.

INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - NIGHT

Storm has found a zabutone meditation pillow and is sitting
on his knees in formal Japanese posture with black Dugi
pants and no shirt. He unravels a package with Oriental
characters handwritten on the outside.

In one section: what looks like an old wax Baggie full
of Chinese herbs. In the other, Storm unfolds a pouch
containing an assortment of needles: long, short, skinny,
fat.

Storm fingers the needles and finds a spot in his shoulder
with very bad scar tissue and quickly and coldly sticks
it in deep. He then twirls and adjusts it.

It is apparent that he knows what he's doing. We STAY
CLOSE ON the needles, noting the amount in the package
has greatly diminished.

PULL UP to reveal Storm, with at least 50 needles sticking
out of him.

He is now frozen deep in meditation. CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND
him 360 DEGREES -- he is like a Japanese statue.


MONTAGE

WITH SCORE.


A)    INT. ARMSTEAD GYM - NIGHT

An impressive home facility with floor-to-ceiling mirrors,
Nautilus equipment, etc. Storm ignores the machines and
tentatively selects from an old set of weights, hefting
them to test his own strength, then begins a slow workout.


B)    EXT. ARMSTEAD YARD - DAY

Storm performs a series of Eastern exercises: stick,
Aikido, and meditation. He's obviously pushing himself
beyond exhaustion; Andy watches, growing more and more
concerned.

                           ANDY
            That's enough! I don't care how
            many needles you stick in yourself

Storm, dripping sweat, glowers at her for a long beat,
then... relents. She snatches the stick from his hand,
hauls him toward the house.

            Jesus -- what a patient!


C)    EXT. FIRE ROAD - DAY

Storm tries to run up a dirt hill. He's still too weak --
struggles, sweating, straining with fierce determination.


D)    INT. ARMSTEAD - GYM - NIGHT

Storm at the "sticking point" in a Scott-bench  curl. His
biceps bulge, veins pop as he strains with all  his
strength. He ... can't ... quite -- then: he    Makes it!
Exhausted. Lets the bar crash metal-to-metal"'   into its
cradle.


E)    EXT. ARMSTEAD POOL - DAY

Storm swims, slowly gaining power.


F)    EXT. WOODED CLEARING (ARMSTEAD'S) - DAY

Storm with two long pieces of cut oak. As Andy watches,
he lays them side-by-side on the ground and begins to dig
a deep narrow hole. He tests the hole for depth. When
it's deep enough, he places the boards down into the hole
and begins to fill it in, packing the earth tightly. He
goes to the top of the boards and around them wraps a
length of old hemp rope. Around and around. The boards
stand up about six feet high. Storm steps back, observes
the height, taps it lightly testing the recoil tension.
Now he begins to punch it, harder and harder. Over and
over again. Andy, preparing his lunch, can't keep her
eyes off him. She is awed by his fire and perseverance.


G)    EXT. ARMSTEAD POOL - DAY

Andy and Storm churn up the water in a splashy race. She
wins but not by much. She smiles. He doesn't. She
splashes water on him, but he's not in a playful mood.

END MONTAGE.    MUSIC DOWN --

INT. ARMSTEAD KITCHEN - NIGHT

Storm in frustration at the table.

Medical charts... a scribbled mess of medication dosages,
reading, etc

                             ANDY
            -- You can't  compare blood pressure
            readings now  with when you were in
            a coma. It's   not going to give a
            true measure  --

                           STORM
            What's this reading?     555 over four
            digits --

                              ANDY
            That's crazy --

She snatches the chart, stares at it.

                           ANDY
            It's Martha's chicken scratches.
            Even she can't read 'em.

                           STORM
            I'll tell you what it is.     It's a
            phone number.


NEW ANGLE - KITCHEN - LATER

Andy on the wall phone, Storm listening on an extension.
We hear the PHONE RINGING on the other end, then someone
picking it up.

                           OLD LADY (V.O.)
                   (on phone)
            Redondo Beach Retirement Villa


INTERCUT:


INT. NURSING HOME - OLD LADY AT DESK

                           ANDY
            (into phone) I'm. sorry ... maybe I
            have the wrong number. I'm looking
            for Kevin O'Malley.

                            OLD LADY
            O'Malley?   There's no O'Malley here.

                         ANDY
          My name is Phyllis O'Connor. I'm
          with the pension board of the Los
          Angeles Police Department. We have
          a misplaced check here for Captain
          O'Malley ...

                          OLD LADY
          A check?
                  (pause)
          Well, listen... there's a big
          turnover here, people are dying all
          the time, I never know who's in
          what bed. Can you leave me your
          number?

Andy glances to Storm, he shakes his head: hang up.   He
hangs up his receiver in disgust.

                         ANDY
                 (into phone)
          I'm sorry, we're not allowed to do
          that.

Andy hangs up.   Thinking.


EXT. RETIREMENT HOME (REDONDO BEACH) - DAY

Andy gets out of her car in a sunny parking lot. She's
wearing dark glasses and a big floppy hat, so we can barely
see her face. She passes a sign: "REDONDO BEACH RETIREMENT
VILLA."


INT. RETIREMENT HOME - OFFICE - DAY

Andy sits across from the Old Lady from the phone call.
A plaque on the desk reads: "HENRIETTA WADE." Both she
and Andy look frustrated, irritated.

                         ANDY
          Mrs. Wade, I'll be honest with you --
          I'm not from the police pension
          board. My name is Andrea Simpson,
          I'm a nurse from U.C.I. Medical
          Center.

The Lady listens skeptically, revealing nothing.   We see
that she is in a wheelchair.

                         ANDY
          You probably have no connection to
          this, and what I'm about to say

          will sound completely absurd to
          you.
                 (beat)
          My patient is a police officer named
          Mason Storm. He's in trouble and
          needs desperately to contact his
          friend, Captain O'Malley. If you
          have any idea how to contact Captain
          O'Malley, please help me.

                         MRS. WADE (OLD LADY)
          As I've said, Miss Simpson, I've
          already asked everybody in the home.
          There is no O'Malley here. But
          it's possible O'Malley could be a
          relative of somebody living here.
          Sunday is family day. Why don't
          you leave your phone number and
          I'll contact you if I learn anything.

                         ANDY
          I can't do that.

Crestfallen.   Andy gets up.

                         ANDY
          Can I phone you?

                         MRS. WADE
                 (pleasant;
                  innocuous)
          Of course, my dear.


CLOSET

Andy opens the door, reaches in for her jacket.   Suddenly
she pauses.

She sees on the closet shelf, amid other clothing:
policeman's cap with a gold shield.

Andy makes a decision -- finds a pad on a table, scrawls
a phone number. She holds out the paper.

                         ANDY
                 (pointedly)
          This is my number, Mrs. O'Malley.

The Old Lady never bats an eye.

                         MRS. WADE
                 (correcting her)
          You mean Mrs. Wade. O'Malley is
          the person you're looking for.

Andy meets her gaze.

                         ANDY
          Yes ... you're right.    I'm sorry.


EXT. WOODED CLEARING - DAY

Storm again approaches the Makiwara.

This time it is almost as if no walls can contain him
nothing in his mind can represent a barrier. He has a
sense of total domination before he has begun.

He begins much harder and faster, continues driving his
fist deeper and faster and harder, until even those twelve
inches of solid oak are not enough for him.

With one lightning blow the OAK SPLINTERS and flies in
half. Storm walks away with a frightening calm -- stalks
straight inside toward the gym...


INT. ARMSTEAD GYM - NIGHT

Storm has just finished a major aerobic workout and is
now doing some strange martial aerobic-type movements.
He is sweating profusely and is dressed in a tiny black
tank top and black sweat pants.

CAMERA PANS OVER TO a corner mirror and we see Andy peeking
through a crack in the door. She is enjoying this
immensely. She seems to be fighting her feelings, and
finally she puffs up her courage. Having made some
decision, she enters.

                         ANDY
          Oh, I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to
          interrupt. I, ah, well, I was just
          passing by and ...

They stare at each other in   quite a different way. This
time it's obvious what Andy   wants, and Storm probably
wants the same thing. But    he tries very hard to maintain
his "one objective" in life   -- to get very strong and win
the upcoming battle.

He looks at this woman who now 'Looks more beautiful than
anyone he has ever seen. Storm throws down the light
weights in his hands and walks up to her.

He gently grabs the back of her head and pulls her hair
back and kisses her on the mouth. She seems to explode
with passion as she falls to the floor, pulling him on
top of her.

They roll in passion growing stronger and stronger. The
CAMERA PANS TO the mirror and we see Andy's feet moving
in delight.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


INT. GYM. - STORM - LATER

Alone, sitting up -- bare-chested, glistening with sweat
from the lovemaking. He glances across at his reflection
in the floor-to-ceiling mirror.


MIRROR - STORM

Seeing himself, just after making love.    His wedding ring.


ANDY

appears in the doorway, returning from the kitchen with a
tray and glasses. She wears a robe and has that mussed,
after-lovemaking glow.

She takes one look at Storm and her heart sinks.

She crosses to him -- lowers herself gracefully to kneel
beside him, setting down the tray and glasses.

                             STORM
                    (dead)
          Thanks.

She looks at him. She has a good idea what's tormenting
his mind. She reaches her hand, gently touches his
shoulder ...

Storm pulls back.

                             STORM
          Please.

He gets up, backing slowly away from her -- seeing the
pain in her eyes, feeling his own pain. In frustration,
he slams an elbow punch into a piece of gym equipment --
furiously venting rage! Andy flinches at the sound, the
violence.

                         STORM
          I'm sorry --
                 (wracked with
                  emotion)

                 (another furious
                  punch)
          Why am I still in this fucking cage?!
          What's wrong with my body? Why
          won't it heal faster?!!

He slams another furious punch.     Andy gets up, tries to
approach Storm.

                         ANDY
          Mason, please
                 (wants to ease
                  his pain)
          I love you.

                            STORM
          Don't say that!

                            ANDY
          Why not?!

                         STORM
          Because I can't love you! Don't
          you see? It's seven years to anyone
          else. But it's only days for me.

Andy draws a sharp, pained breath.

                         STORM
          How can I be with you ... how can
          I want you and take you, when --

He can't finish, torn by guilt. He stares at Andy.
Suddenly his tone becomes harsh, accusatory.

                         STORM
          You seduced me. You came in here,
          looking that way, knowing just what
          the hell you were doing --

                         ANDY
                 (defiant)
          Yeah, I knew. What of it? I wanted
          you --

                         STORM
          You have no right to want me!

                            ANDY
          Then who does?!     I've risked my
          life for you --

                         STORM
          Who asked you to? Not me!

          Then don't risk it! Don't do shit
          for me! I don't need you!

For a second it look's like he's going to strike her.
Instead he kicks the tray and GLASSES -- which smashes
into the floor-to-ceiling MIRROR, SHATTERING like a bomb?

Andy glares at him, stalks for the door --


EXT. APUMSTEAD DRIVE - IRON GATE - NIGHT

Andy's CAR ROARS out the dirt drive past the iron gate.


INT. ARMSTEAD BEDRROM - NIGHT

Storm stalks in, slamming the door behind him -- crosses
in fury and despair to the desk. On the desktop: the
news photo of Felicia, Sonny and himself.

Storm stares at the photo in agony for a moment, then
rips the desk drawer open, rummages fiercely. He finds:
keys!


INT. ARMSTEAD GARAGE - NIGHT

Storm strides in, punches the garage door button; the
door starts to open. He grabs the corner of a dusty canvas
cover -- jerks it off an Army-style Jeep.


EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT

The Jeep speeds out into the night.


EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The Jeep parked at the edge of a cemetery road.


STORM

stands in the midst of the graveyard, staring at --


THREE TOMBSTONES

In the light from the road lamp, we read the names: FELICIA
STORM... MASON STORM ... JEREMY "SONNY" STORM.

EXT. ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP - PHONE BOOTH - DAWN

Ethnic neighborhood, Dodger Stadium visible in b.g.

Andy looks exhausted, from a night of black coffee and
anxiety. Now: frustrated by a BUSY SIGNAL.

                         ANDY
                 (into phone)
          Pick up, Martha ... Pick up.

No luck. Andy hangs up.


EXT. CHAVEZ RAVINE STREET AND ALLEY - DAWN

Andy's car pulls past tiered hillside apartment units,
enters an alley behind a row of multi-family dwellings.

Andy at the wheel:   cautious, peering around.

She parks in an out-of-sight spot, TURNS OFF the ENGINE.


INT. CAR - ANDY

The emotion of the parting with Mason catches up with
her.

                         ANDY
          Get a hold of yourself, Andy.

She wipes her eyes, cranks the mirror around, tries to
fix her face. She looks like hell.

                         ANDY
                 (into mirror,
                  sarcastic)
          You're really beautiful.

She puts on shades, pulls up the hood of her sweatshirt.


EXT. ALLEY - ANDY

gets out... wary. She's barefoot, just in the jeans she
threw on before bolting from Armstead's.


EXT. TWO-FAMILY DWELLING - DAWN

Andy pads quickly up to a weathered wooden door, knocks.
No answer. She rings the BELL.

The boy gets a funny look on his face.

          You haven't seen the news?
                 (beat)
          She's dead. They shot her in the

Andy reacts in shock and horror.

EXT. AMRSTEAD HOUSE - MORNING

Storm's Jeep enters the drive, pulls into the garage.
Storm SHUTS OFF the MOTOR. As he steps to the floor, a
man's silhouette MOVES INTO FRAME behind him.

                         MAN
          That's grand theft, auto.

Storm spins. For a second he is ready for anything.
Then his face softens --

                         STORM
                 (with emotion)
          O'Malley.

In the garage doorway stands the friend Storm feared was
dead.


STORM AND O'MALLEY

          -- It's Sonny, all right. Believe
          how big he got? He can throw a
          football forty yards --

PULL BACK to reveal -- Storm looks up at his friend, too
moved to speak.

                         O'MALLEY
          He made it to my house, the night
          you got shot. I hid him, played it
          out like he was dead -- even staged
          a funeral, along with Felicia's and
          yours. They bought it. Everyone
          believed he was dead.

                         STORM
          Where is he now? Is he safe?

Storm gazes with great tenderness at the snapshots of
Sonny.

          O'Mal ... I can never thank you.

                         O'MALLEY
          Just seeing your ugly ass alive,
          that's enough for me.

          You wouldn't happen to have a beer

          He did his thing -- then they waxed
          him.

Storm's wheels are turning.

          The two guys at the pier. They
          ordered the hit on me too.

          And I've got 'em on film. Still in
          the camera, right where I left it.

EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

Andy's car drives north, back to the Armstead house.

Ford in his car keeps a discreet distance back.


ANGLE - FORD'S CAR

as another car carrying three men (including Jones, the
cop we remember who answered Andy's phone call from the
coma ward) pulls up alongside. Ford points ahead, toward
Andy's car. The new car slips in behind Ford's, tailing
Andy.


INT. ARMSTEAD LIVING ROOM - DAY

Coffee table piled with the news clippings Storm has been
studying these past days.

                         O'MALLEY
          -- That night in the hospital, I
          found the audiotape ... in your
          vest. I must've listened to it a
          thousand times -- looking for little
          quirks in the voices, phrases they
          repeat ...

His look shows he came up with nothing.

                         STORM
          Where is the tape?

                         O'MALLEY
          I turned it in for evidence.

Storm scowls.

                         0'MALLEY
          Don't worry, I made a duve. I'll
          get it for you. Meanwhile maybe
          this'll cheer you up.

From O'Malley's briefcase comes .45 automatic, three empty
clips and a box of Glazer ammo.

Storm takes the weapon with pleasure. Checks the action,
hefts it for weight. He glances at O'Malley -- two old
comrades, ready to get back in action. Suddenly a bit of
sadness crosses Storm's face.

                         STORM
          What happened, O'Mal?    To you?

  Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              65.



O'Malley begins loading the clips: grim, almost
heartbroken.

                         0'MALLEY
          I was on the case, trying to find
          who pulled the trigger on you. But
          it was like swimming through shit.
          People kept telling me to back off.
          Then one morning, the phone rings.
          Immaculate Heart Emergency: someone
          ran my mother off the road, her
          back's broken, she's paralyzed.

                         STORM
                 (painful, emotion)
          I'm sorry, O'Mal.

                         O'MALLEY
          That night there's a note in my
          locker -- letting me know it's not
          an accident.

He looks at Storm, tormented.

                         O'MALLEY
          You know me, Storm. I never would've
          backed off. But there was Sonny to
          worry about too. What if they found
          him? What if they found you?

                         STORM
          You did the right thing, O'Mal.

Storm takes a loaded clip from his friend, slams it into
the butt of the .45. He jacks the slide back and lets it
slam home -- chambering a round.

                         STORM
          We'll get 'em, buddy. Every fucking
          one of them.


EXT. ARMSTEAD DRIVEWAY - DAY

O'Malley in his car, in gear.   Storm by the driver's door.

                         STORM
          Get Sonny out of that school, O'Mal.
          Right now. With me alive and making
          a stink, whoever's on that film is
          going to be looking harder than
          ever for Sonny -- just to get to
          me. Get him someplace safe ...
          three thousand miles away if you
          have to.

          Consider it done.

                         STORM
          I'm going straight to get that film.
          When you've got Sonny safe, bring
          me the audiotape. We'll put 'em
          together and get 'em to Esposito
          for the T.V. news. That should be
          quite a show.

                          O'MALLEY
          You got it, partner.
                  (starts to back
                   out)
          You can always reach me through my
          mother.
                  (pauses, shifting
                   to forward)
          What about that nurse? She still in
          this?

                           STORM
          Gone.
                 (with pain)
          For the best. For her best.

                         O'MALLEY
          Thanks for the brew!

He speeds off.    Storm stands, thinking --


INT. ARMSTEAD BEDROOM - DAY

Storm enters, still deep in thought.    Racking his brain --

          I'm gonna take you to the bank,
          Senator Trent. The blood bank.

Storm's vengeance look.    Suddenly O.S. -- a CAR!


INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

Storm poised inside the front door -- .45 in hand.   In
walks ... Andy!

She nearly faints at the sight of the pistol leveled
between her eyes. Storm instantly jerks the weapon back.
They stand there staring at each other.

                           ANDY
          Martha's dead.

Storm takes Andy in his arms. She weeps, sobbing. Feeling
all the tension and terror of the past days -- yet somehow
knowing she's safe in the arms of this man she loves.

                         ANDY
          I won't leave you. Not ever again.

                         STORM
          I won't let you.

Storm holds her, knowing he loves her.

                         STORM
          O'Malley was here.

                          ANDY
          Here?   How did you find him?

                         STORM
          You found him. The old lady was his
          mother.
                  (beat)
          And Andy ... my son's alive.

Andy raises her face to Storm's, her eyes welling with
emotion. He kisses her. They are standing there, just
inside the front door, which has a wood bottom-half and a
frosted-glass top-half. Suddenly:

Storm jerks Andy sideways into the room with all his
strength! He dives with her as -

The TOP of the FRONT DOOR EXPLODES inward in a SHOWER of
flying GLASS! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Three more point-blank
SHOTOGUN BLASTS BLOW the rest of the DOOR to hell.


ANGLE - HALLWAY

Storm hurls Andy so hard and fast it looks like she will
land in pieces. He somehow ends up in front of her on
the floor as a masked man plunges through the front door
into the hallway, shotgun spinning to cover his advance.
Too late.

We hear TWO LOUD ROUNDS and the masked man's head snaps
violently back and he falls into a pile.


EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - DAY

Jones and   Ford pull masks over their faces and sprint for
the other   doors. Both carry assault rifles. An enormous
powerful   third man (Joe Bear), his mask already in place,
vaults to   low balcony, hauls himself up to a second story
window --   his huge Bowie knife glinting in the sun.


INT. HALLWAY - STORM AND ANDY

hurry toward a staircase, their attention focused behind
them -- on the first floor.


INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - INTERIOR BALCONY

Joe Bear waits concealed at  the top of the stairs, on an
interior balcony overlooking  the living room, atrium-style.
Through the mouth opening of  his ski mask, we see he is
smiling a sick smile -- and  sensually stroking his Bowie
knife.


ANGLE - TRACKING - STORM

Storm and Andy scramble up the staircase onto the atrium
balcony and out steps Joe Bear with his knife and his
smile.

Joe Bear, for the first time in his life, is surprised
when Storm smiles too. Joe Bear screams like an animal
and lunges with his knife.

Storm stabs out his left arm like a spear and tilts his
body ever so slightly, then clamps Joe Bear's wrist with
his right hand.

Allowing his tremendous momentum to culminate like a
hurricane, Storm manipulates him in a full circle,
catapulting Joe Bear unbelievably into a tall T'ang Dynasty
cabinet filled with priceless Oriental artifacts!


LIVING ROOM

Ford and Jones, masked, hurtle into the living room, just
below the atrium balcony. They raise their automatic
weapons, but before they can fire --


STORM

hurls Joe Bear's massive body down upon the attackers!
Jones takes the tonnage head-on and is crushed beneath
it! Ford dodges, unleashes a burst of AUTOMATIC FIRE
straight up at the balcony. Storm shoves Andy to safety
onto the exterior balcony and dives there himself, just
as the whole interior balcony is RIDDLED by Ford's BULLETS!

Ford bolts for the staircase, coming after Storm. Storm,
crouched around the corner on the exterior balcony, waits
till Ford hurtles INTO VIEW at the top of the staircase.
Storm FIRES his .45 furiously ... Ford springs back,
Storm's BULLETS BLAST the staircase WALL to ribbons. His
.45 CLICKS empty!


EXT. BALCONY - STORM

rips a magazine from his pocket, slams it into the butt
of his .45, reloading. He has it half-raised when:

Ford appears -- right in his face, assault rifle leveled
at Storm's guts. Storm strikes an instantaneous blow,
sending the rifle flying. In one motion, he pinwheels
Ford over his head, sending him flying off the exterior
balcony and crashing down into the Oriental fountain below!


EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - BALCONY AND FOUNTAIN

Storm swings down to the ground. Andy leaps into his
arms, he breaks her fall and helps her alight safely.

He reaches to Ford in the fountain, rips the mask off his
face.

He recognizes the man.

                         STORM
          I know this fuck. He's a cop!

race INTO VIEW, leap aboard the JEEP, FIRE it UP and fly.


TWO MORE MASKED MEN

appear running down the drive -- SHOTGUN and assault RIFLE
trained on Storm and Andy. They begin to FIRE.

Andy can't shoot and Storm can't drive and shoot at the
same time, so he does what is logical for him -- he keeps
the pedal to the metal and chases them.

BULLETS from the two men OBLITERATE the Jeep's WINDSHIELD.
BUCKSHOT RIDDLES the VEHICLE everywhere. Andy is on the
floor of the Jeep. Storm is periodically ducking. He is
bleeding we don't know from what or how bad -- and then
blam! -- masked man #1's body is airborne. This makes #2
think... and run very fast.


EXT. TEAHOUSE - DAY

He is sprinting the 100 in 5 flat -- racing for the tea
house. He makes it inside and dives for a good position
to resume firing, but there isn't enough time. Storm
just drives right through the front of the tea house and
over the assassin's body! The JEEP ROARS out of the
flattened tea house and keeps on hauling!


EXT. ARMSTEAD GROUNDS - JEEP

ROARS across the terrain... past the horses, ostriches,
etc.


JEEP'S POV

The heavy iron gate straight ahead.


STORM

SLAMS THROUGH the metal GATE with JEEP BLASTING it.


ONCOMING VEHICLE

Captain Holland! -- in the car as a passenger, with another
plainclothes cop. The flying gate sends glass in all
directions, as Storm swerves in his Jeep to avoid the
car.

Storm freaks, seeing Holland as Holland's car is forced
off the road. Storm SKIDS into a wild 180 --

Holland and the driver are out of their car, guns drawn.
Ford races up, reinforcing them. He has an assault rifle --

his body, he races off down the mountain road at high
speed.

O'Malley's car limps to the roadside, in view of a sign:
"VENTURA 21." O'Malley gets out in frustration --


EXT. TRINITY BOYS' PREP (VENTURA) - SOCCER FIELD - LONG
LENS - SONNY STORM - (SLOW MOTION) - DAY

Our first live look at Storm's son as a twelve-year-old.
Wearing colorful soccer duds and TRINITY PREP athletic
shirt. He looks terrific, like a young colt -- free and
fearless -- his shiny hair flying as lie runs down a soccer
ball in the pell-mell action of an eighth-grade game.

The feel of this SLOW MOTION portrait is diametrically
opposite to the corruption and duplicity in the world of
the movie so far. In contrast, Sonny's world seems pure
and unsullied -- youthful and untouched by the harsh
realities of the world. We watch Sonny and his teammates
long enough to absorb his vigorous,full-of-life energy.
Then:

suits in grim contrast to the colorful soccer uniforms --


SONNY (SLOW MOTION)

He falls! The rush of soccer action sweeps past him,
down the field. Sonny -- all attention focused on the
game -- scrambles to his feet, legs churning to take off
in pursuit of his friends. Just as he gets his traction:


MAX DUNNE (NORMAL SPEED)

Out of nowhere scoops Sonny up in his brawny, brutal arms!
Sonny cries out and tries to resist, but --

They don't hear, lost in their own action and cheering.

Dunne and Nolan hustle him swiftly toward their car.
Already they're well away from the field, moving fast

The soccer coach turns back. We see him shout, his arm
raised in a gesture of urgency --

his gun.

          What the hell are you doing?!

                         STORM
          We just made the top of the chart,
          Andy. Every cop in the city thinks
          we shot our way out of a legitimate
          bust --

          There are no cops here!

                         ANDY

          the non-violent way!

Storm is reacting to the sight of his old home -- the
first time he's seen it since the slaughter seven years
ago. He struggles with his pain and rage.

Andy, aware of his turmoil, takes his hand. Her hair is
done up in a businesslike style; she wears a jacket and
carries a briefcase. They cross to the front door --


INT. STORM'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY

A pleasant, chatty (and very pregnant) HOUSEWIFE speaks
through the open door to Storm and Andy. Sounds of
HAMMERING, ETC. in other rooms O.S.

                         HOUSEWIFE

          see it! Then when you do come to
          sell, our office will know the
          upgrades you've made and we can
          market your home more effectively.

Two plasterers troop past, a carpenter with them.

                         HOUSEWIFE
          Hell, come on in. Everyone else
          does.

Storm and Andy enter. Andy immediately begins to steer
the Housewife away from the kitchen, into the living room.
"Oh what a cute place!

I'd love to see what you're doing with the nursery..."


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Storm casually lingers behind, drifting into the kitchen.
He crosses immediately to the alcove where, seven years
earlier, he stashed the camera case.

But the spot has been remodeled!   There's a new wall there!

                         STORM
          New wall ... fucking yuppies!

Without hesitation, he slams his fist through --


WALL

Bang! Gypsum wallboard splinters, revealing a fake panel
of brick adjacent to a real brick wall, six inches behind
the new wallboard. Storm reaches into the hole, yanks
out the camera case. He shakes his sore knuckles from
the blow as:


HOUSEWIFE AND ANDY

arrive from the living room. The Housewife stares in
shock at this strange man -- with his hand halfway through
her new wall.

          Better have this place fumigated --
          quick.

He leads Andy out -- crisply, businesslike.    Housewife
stands there dumbfounded.


ACROSS FROM CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Storm pauses in mid-conversation, drops the phone receiver
from his ear. Thinking fast, troubled. Andy beside him...
both of them keeping their faces obscured as moviegoers
and business people pass.

                         STORM
                 (to Andy)
          O'Malley left his mother's place
          three hours ago -- with the tape.
          He should be at the school by now,
          but she hasn't heard back from him.

Several people pass, glancing curiously at Storm. He
averts his face, getting even more antsy. The camera case
under his arm.

                         ANDY
                 (re: people
                  staring)
          Fuck the tape. We gotta get this
          film to Esposito or I'm gonna have
          a nervous breakdown.

Storm knows this, too -- puts the receiver back to his
ear.

                         STORM
                 (into phone)
          Mrs. O'Malley. Sorry ... listen.
          We're outside the Century Plaza now
          ... the hotel. Right, right. The
          one in Century City. Okay, listen
          closely ...

                  very clear)
          Tell O'Mal to leave a message for
          us at the hotel desk. Leave it for
          Andy ... Andrea Smith. We're not
          gonna check in, it's too dangerous --
          but the desk will hold the message
          if you tell them we're coming in
          this afternoon. Got it? Great.

Mrs. O'Malley hangs up her phone, finishes scribbling the
notes she took from Storm. CAMERA MOVES IN ON the office
window. THROUGH the window, outside DOWN the block, we
see ... a nondescript sedan --

O'Malley hurrying from his car in the lot toward the
school's main administration building.

D)    ANGLE - ADMINISTRATION BUILDING

A priest and the soccer coach hurry from the building,
toward O'Malley.

We see the three men confer urgently. O'Malley reacts

into the building --

F)    EXT. SILVER LAKE STREET - DAY

Storm's JEEP BRAKES HARD at a stoplight, next to four bad-
looking LATINO YOUTHS in a ragged Camaro. The dudes check
Andy out lasciviously.

                              STORM
            Hey, hermano!     You want this Jeep?

He pulls the keys from the ignition, holds them up.

                              YOUTH #1
            How hot is it?

                           STORM
            Fuckin' smoking.

The youths look to each other. Then to the piece of shit
they're driving. In their heads, they've already got the
Jeep stripped, repainted, etc.

                           YOUTH #1
            We got it, my man.

In ten seconds, everyone has switched cars -- BOTH VEHICLES
ROAR OFF in different directions.


MONTAGE ENDS, MUSIC DOWN --


EXT. L.A. ZOO - PARKING LOT - DAY

Storm's Camaro parked discreetly. Storm gets out -- wary,
camera case on a strap from his shoulder. Kids and moms,
other zoo-goers coming and going.


ANGLE - CAMARO - STORM AND ANDY

Andy moves uneasily behind the wheel.

                           ANDY
                   (checking watch,
                    nervous)
            Esposito won't be here yet. He said
            three-thirty.

                              STORM
            He'll be there.

Storm adjusts his jacket to conceal his .45. Peering
around. He passes the camera case back in to Andy.

           Try O'Malley one more time.
                  (ready to go)
           If you hear any lions roaring, haul
           ass.

Andy looks at him with fearful concern.

                           STORM
           Don't worry.   I'm a big boy.

A grin.   A touch --

A lion.   Elephants.   Kids chomping candy apples.    Etc.

moving through the scene.    Tense, but casual ... blending
in.


EXT. ANOTHER ZOO WALKWAY - STO'RIM

So far so good. Zoo goers more interested in chimps and
boa constrictors.


EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE GORILLA COMPOUND - ESPOSITO

The TV reporter we remember from earlier in the film, the
one Storm is now going to meet. He stands nervously
outside, smoking. We hear one of the great APES BELLOW -

ANGLE - GORILLA COMPOUND - STORM

enters the plaza. He spots Esposito.       Starts forward.
Suddenly Storm slows --


ANGLE ON ESPOSITO

as Max Dunne moves INTO FRAME seizing Esposito -- subtly,
not drawing any attention. Another man in a suit
reinforces Dunne from the other side. Esposito shows
terror, but no surprise. Clearly the men have had the
drop on him for several minutes -- but there was nothing
he could do about it. Dunne's posture indicates he has a
concealed gun pressed to Esposito's ribs.

Dunne and Storm make eye contact.    The message is clear:
Try anything and Esposito dies.

As Dunne and the other man hustle Esposito from the plaza --


ANOTHER SECURITY-TYPE IN SUIT

moves into Storm's peripheral vision. Coat over his arm,
concealing a short-barreled automatic weapon.

                         SECURITY-TYPE
          Someone wants to talk to you, Storm.

The man gestures with his coat arm.   Storm's eyes follow
to:


STORM'S POV - PARK BENCH - TRENT

The Senator himself. Big, as life and cool as a cucumber.
Alone and unrecognized on a bench, shelling and munching
from a bag of peanuts. Behind him: a caged vulture.


ANGLE - PARK BENCH

as Storm MOVES INTO FRAME.    He stops, standing above Trent.

                          TRENT
          What a day, huh? Beautiful!
                 (squints up at
                  Storm, offers
                  bag of nuts)
          Want some nuts?

Storm makes no move.

                         STORM
          I haven't got the film on me.

                         TRENT
                 (breezily)
          I didn't think you would.
                 (clears space
                  beside him)
          Sit down. Take a load off.

Storm glances to the coat-over-the-arm-man, who has taken
up a subtle position about twenty feet away.

After a beat ... Storm sits.

                         TRENT
          You do have the film somewhere, I
          assume?

Storm's hard look says yes.

                         STORM
          Still in the camera.

                         TRENT
          Good. Very good. That way I know
          you haven't duplicated it.

Storm inches slightly closer.

                         STORM
          You know, Trent ... I could rip
          your fucking throat out before that
          sonofabitch over there could find
          the spit to sneeze.

                         TRENT
          Oh, I'm sure you could, Storm.
                 (keeps munching
                  peanuts)
          But not before one of those other
          gentlemen, across the way, could
          put a fifty-caliber slug through
          your brainpan.


ANGLE - NEARBY ROOFTOP - TWO SNIPERS

Nicely concealed atop one of the zoo buildings -- their
guns zeroed on Storm's skull.


BACK TO BENCH - STORM AND TRENT

                         STORM
          Very well placed, Trent. But did
          you know that human reaction time --
          even the fastest -- is between half
          and three-quarters of second? And
          in that time, I could easily --

Like lightning, Storm lunges for Trent... whips behind
him, seizing his throat and hauling Trent's body into the
line of fire -- as a shield protecting Storm!

                         TRENT
          You could kill me now, Storm -- but
          you'll die two seconds later.

                         STORM
          You think I care, motherfucker?
          Just so I get you -- one way or the
          other.

Then, a voice from O.S.

                           DUNNE (O.S.)
            Maybe you care about this, asshole.


MAX DUNNE

Twenty feet away -- both hands up -- holding a bay's
athletic shirt... "TRINITY VENTURA."


STORM AND TRENT

Storm: stunned.

                           TRENT
            Reach into my jacket pocket.
                   (when Storm
                    hesitates)
            Reach in!

Storm pulls out a Polaroid snapshot.    Stares at it.


INSERT - POLAROID SNAPSHOT

It's Sonny, looking terrified, in some murky environment --
Dunne and another man (Nolan) smiling with their arms
around the boy.


BACK TO SCENE

Storm releases Trent.    The Senator straightens his tie
and jacket.

                           TRENT
            I want that film and the tape.
            I'll give you three hours.

Storm stands.   Dunne facing him.   The snipers behind him.

                           STORM
                   (to Trent)
            Just tell me one thing. Who pulled
            the trigger on me and my wife?

                           TRENT
                   (sadistic irony)
            Hate poisons people. Let go of it.

Storm glares at Trent.    Dunne takes a step forward.

          I missed your kid seven years ago.
          But I won't miss tonight.

Storm glowers with fury.   Trent hands Storm a business
card.

                         TRENT
          Bring that film, Mr. Storm.    Three
          hours.


EXT. PLAYA VISTA POWER PLANT - NIGHT

Towering smokestacks silhouetted against black sky.     Deep
RUMBLE of DYNAMOS, TURBINES --


INT. POWER PLANT - EQUIPMENT ROOM - NIGHT

A mesh-enclosed space above the main dynamo     room.
Deafening DIN of TURBINE GENERATORS below.      A bulb
illuminates Sonny sitting rigidly on a metal     chair. Nolan,
a cop we saw earlier in the film, and TURNER     (whom we
haven't seen before) play cards, making sure     Sonny goes
nowhere.

                         NOLAN
                 (re: power plant)
          It's fun, huh, kid? Kinda like a
          field trip.

Sonny glowers.   There's a lot of his father in him.

                         SONNY
          I'm remembering both of you.    And
          when my dad gets here --

                         TURNER
          He's gonna have a long trip, kid --
          starting from Forest Lawn.

They both laugh derisively.

                         NOLAN
          By the time this night's over, your
          old man'll have a use for that phony
          grave of his.

A wall-mounted PHONE RINGS.   Nolan picks it up.    He listens
seriously for a long beat.

                         NOLAN
          Yeah... yeah -- we'll be right down.

He hangs up, stands. So does Turner. They exit the wire-
mesh space, re-close the door on Sonny.

                 (to Sonny)
          We'll come back with your French
          fries.

                  door)
          Don't leave home without us.


ANGLE - STAIRWAY DOWN FROM EQUIPMENT ROOM

Nolan and Turner clump down and away, laughing and making
wisecracks.


INT. EQUIPMENT ROOM - SONNY

He waits till they're out of sight, then swiftly mounts a
tall equipment box that reaches almost to the ceiling.
He shoves a few boxes out of his way, revealing --


WIRE MESH HATCH

in the mesh ceiling of the room. Sonny flops onto his
back atop the tall equipment box, kicks up hard -- the
hatch pops open!


ANGLE - ROOF OF EQUIPMENT ROOM - SONNY

climbs out onto the "roof" of the room. He sees a short
catwalk leading to the huge, high wall of the dynamo room.
Against the wall are big windows.

Sonny scoots to the windows, which are cracked open awning
style. He peers out and down.

A 30-foot drop to the pavement below.

Sonny shins down a pipe as niftily as a spider monkey!

EXT. REDONDO BEACH RETIREMENT VILLA - NIGHT

A cab pulls into the curb outside Mrs. O'Malley's place,
Sonny springs out. We see the cabbie shouting after him --
and Sonny arguing, gesturing toward the nursing home.

Mrs. O'Malley emerges from the nursing home wheelchair.
Sonny rushes to her ... they embrace joyfully.

O'Malley comes out too, more cautiously than his mother.
He is armed. He also hurries to Sonny, hugs him tight.

                         SONNY
          Malley!

                         O'MALLEY
          It's okay, sport. It's okay...
          it's okay --

Still hugging Sonny, O'Malley shoves a bill at the cabbie.
Whatever it is, the cabbie is thrilled. He boogies off
ecstatically.


INT. CAMARO - MOVING - NIGHT

Storm wheels the car at high speed -- super-intense,
clutching a tiny chain-link "low-rider" steering wheel.

          Is that a steering wheel -- or a
          Winchell's donut?

Storm has no time for humor -- he twists the wheel,
flooring the accelerator.

The Camaro ROARS through a hairy turn.

The Clerk finds the slot.

          Here it is. There's just one message.

Jones takes the message slip. Ford and one of the
plainclothesmen join him -- the three move aside, confer
briefly. Ford and the cop move off. Jones crosses back
to the Desk Clerk, hands the message slip back to him.

Andy crosses to the desk -- we see her speak to the Clerk

to Storm.

             O'Malley's gat the tape -- they're

Storm:. ecstatic.    He grabs Andy, ready to exit.   Suddenly,
he freezes --

He spots Ford!


STORM

his eyes flash across the lobby. He spots:


JONES


STORM

shields Andy. Plainclothesman #1 steps out, whipping out
his badge. Suddenly Storm grabs the cop with the badge
in front of his face and uses him as a human battering
ram for him and Andy to escape, plunging the man through
two layers of glass windows of the adjoining Hertz rental
office and out into the street in front of the hotel!
Andy follows through the newly formed exit. People scream.
Chaos. The other cops react in pursuit of Storm and Andy.


EXT. CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT

Storm dumps his "battering ram body" and he and Andy sprint
toward the valet booth at the main entrance of the hotel,
where numerous cars are coining and going.


VALET AREA

The valet is a big fat man in a red Beefeater costume.
He is presently handing keys to a large "good old boy" --
boots, ten-gallon hat and all. Tex is just laying a bill
in the Beefeater's hand, and starting to stuff his too-
large frame into a sleek Gullwing speedster with its doors
popped up. Before he can, we see him take a flying seat
on the road as Storm and Andy shove in and --

Instantly the Gullwing is in flight -- SCREECHING away
from the hotel entrance, across the median and the
decorative fountain that separates the Avenue of the Stars.
But almost equally as fast, two cop cars start to close
in on him. It looks like Storm is trapped! But he slams
the pedal to the metal and blasts between them, escaping.
As the two cop cars crash into each other --


FORD AND JONES

on foot, catch up to the scene.    Too late.

                         FORD

bewilderment at the scene of chaos.


EXT. AVENUE OF THE STARS - NIGHT

The Gullwing thunders off into the night.


INT. UNION STATION - NIGHT

0'Malley scans the monitor above the ticket seller's
window. The 11:10 to Albuquerque leaves on track 12.

The waiting area is quiet at this time of night except
for a few travelers and stragglers.

Sonny Storm, quiet and apprehensive, focuses on tearing
open the packet of mustard for his hot dog. He sits on
top of a battered suitcase.

O'Malley returns with the tickets and sits next to Sonny
on a bench.

                         O'MALLEY
          Be careful you don't get any    of
          that guck on your sweater ...    let
          me comb your hair before your    old
          man gets here, it's stinking    up in
          the back.

O'Malley takes a comb out of his jacket pocket.

                         SONNY
          Quit it, will you ...    you're making
          me more nervous than    I am already.

                         O'MALLEY
          I think I'm more nervous than you
          are, kid. We got out of my mother'
          place about two shakes ahead of the
          landlord ... know what I mean?

                         SONNY
          My dad'll get 'em. You guys'll

          You think he's gonna like me?

                         O'MALLEY
          Does a bear dump in the woods? Are
          you kidding -- he's gonna love you.

                         SONNY
          Let me see the tickets. Did you
          get us one of those sleeping cars?
          What time is he getting here anyway?

                         O'MALLEY
          Soon...

Just then, O'Malley becomes aware of a bad vibe in the
air. A foreign presence. Nolan, and Turner have followed
him and Sonny from Mrs. O'Malley's house. Now they
approach --

                         NOLAN
                 (calling out)
          Hey, O'Malley! Long time no see.
                 (approaching)
          Taking a trip somewhere?

O'Malley slip the tape from his pocket, placing it under
Sonny's Jacket on the bench without missing a beat, as he
calmly starts to rise.

                         O'MALLEY
                 (to Sonny, under
                  his breath)
          Make sure your father gets this ...
                 (to Nolan)
          Yeah. Me and my son are visiting
          my mother in New Mexico.

O'Malley gets up, starts to move toward the men.

                         NOLAN
          Your son, huh? That's funny.     He
          doesn't look much like you --
                 (to his partner)
          Does he, Turner?

They both laugh.

                         TURNER
          Looks a lot like Mason Storm.

O'Malley and the men come to face-off point, staring at
each other.

                         NOLAN
          Enough of this fucking around.    We
          want the tape.

CLUNK! O.S. we hear a CLATTERING ECHO.

Sonny has picked up his jacket.   The tape has fallen onto
the marble floor!

                          O'MALLEY
          Sonny -- run!

Sonny snatches up the tape and leaps over the bench, racing
toward the rear doorway heading for the street.

Nolan and Turner start to run after him. O'Malley throws
a fierce body block on both men, sending all three crashing
into a big, loaded luggage cart. O'Malley finds his feet
first as all three struggle to get up. Nolan starts to
pull his gun. O'Malley grabs a heavy metallic suitcase
and smashes Nolan in the face with all his strength.
Nolan crashes backward against Turner, toppling them both
into a huge 25-foot lighting installer's ladder -- which
now starts -- to cave over, pulling a string of dozens of
big industrial GLOBES plummeting to the floor and EXPLODING
into thousands of tiny shards! People scream. O'Malley
shoves the luggage cart at the men and races for the door --


EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT

Sonny has made his way into the parking area, amidst dozens
of cars, but he has stopped -- looking back fearfully,
worried about O'Malley. O'Malley bursts from the exit.

                           O'MALLEY
                  (shouts)
          Go!   Sonny -- get outta here!

In front of the station, a cab is jacked up; the driver
replacing a flat. O'Malley starts to run toward Sonny
past the cab, when suddenly:

He is SHOT in the back by Nolan! His lurching bulk crashes
into cab, knocking it off its jack to the ground. The
tire iron (that's used as a jack handle) springs loose,
onto the ground near O'Malley.

Seeing the gunmen, Sonny in horror crawls under a car.

The cab driver flees for  his life. O'Malley      spins back,
draws and tries to fire  at the oncoming Nolan     and Turner --
but he is SHOT TWICE in  the stomach. Turner      kicks O'Malley
in the hand, sending the  gun flying off under     the cab!

                            NOLAN
          Get the kid!     He's under the cars!

Nolan and Turner sprint off after Sonny.    Sonny rolls
from under one to another.

Nolan and Turner try to trap him, peering under the cars --
but Sonny is too agile and cat-like. Turner crouches down,
spots Sonny.

                         TURNER
          Give us the tape, kid -- and we'll
          take you home.

                            SONNY
          Fuck you, Jack!

Turner aims his gun.   Suddenly:

His head turns to squash as: a bloody O'Malley stands
over him, bashing him with a tire iron!

A crowd of bystanders scream in horror at this horrendous
sight.


EXT. ALAMEDA STREET - NIGHT

A block from Union Station, the GULLWING SCREECHES into
view.


EXT. UNION STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Nolan comes around the end of the car, sees O'Malley --
standing over the dead Turner with a tire iron in his
hand. It is clear  O'Malley is about to die. But still
he staggers toward Nolan, raising the tire iron.

Nolan, gun in hand, watches incredulously. O'Malley
staggers another step. Sonny has crawled out from under
the car; he sees this. O'Malley staggers another step.

                          O'MALLEY
                  (to Nolan, dying)
           You don't deserve to wear your badge.
           with his last failing strength,
           O'Malley raises the tire iron.
           Nolan PUMPS him once, square in the
           chest, killing him.

Sonny screams and flees in fear for his life. Nolan races
after him. Between the maze of parked cars. Sonny,
dodging, in between the endless rows.

Meanwhile a small crowd has gathered around the mortally
wounded O'Malley.

Suddenly, O.S. we hear the SCREECHING of TIRES. The crowd
reacts as the Gullwing blasts into the lot, ROARING
straight toward Nolan and the terrorized Sonny. Finally,
unable to get any closer, Storm leaps out of the Gullwing,
onto the hood of a car and races across the rooftops of
one vehicle after another, closing in on Nolan and Sonny.

Andy stops in horror beside the deathly stricken O'Malley.


ON SONNY

unaware of Storm -- trying to escape from his pursuer.


NOLAN

cursing and unable to gain ground on the fleet-footed --
now actually raising his gun. Suddenly:


STORM

from the roof of the next-to-last car roof in a line of
parked vehicles soars through the air like a night eagle-
setting what looks like a new world record in the long
jump -- surprising Nolan from the rear! Slamming the cop
to the ground in instant death. Cracking his neck.


SONNY

stops. Gasping, breathless -- seeing the father he hasn't
seen in seven years.


STORM

relieved and overwhelmed, grabs his son and lifts him off
the ground in a moment of salvation and triumph. They
hold each other with all their strength.

However their moment is incomplete, as Sonny is visibly
distraught about the stricken O'Malley, beginning to sob
at the loss of his surrogate father. Storm turns and
starts to move toward --


O'MALLEY - ON GROUND

Andy ... the crowd around O'Malley. Sonny breaks through,
with Storm half a pace behind. Sonny kneels, embracing
his fallen friend. Storm joins his son, kneels alongside
him, both mourning the loss of their dearest comrade.


ANDY

watching them.   Touched deeply. Then: O.S. SIRENS!


EXT. ALAMEDA STREET - NIGHT

Two police CARS ROAR into view, racing for the station.


BACK TO PARKING LOT

Storm jumps up -- turns Sonny over to Andy, hurrying them
into a nearby cab. The cab takes off.


INT. CAB - MOVING

Andy and Sonny topple into the back seat.    The DRIVER
picks up on all the frenzy.

                          DRIVER

                         ANDY
          That's a good question.   Out of
          here for sure.


ANDY

turns with Sonny to see Storm, through the back window of
the cab, looking after them protective -- full of emotion.

                         SONNY

EXT. TRENT MANSION - RAIN - NIGHT

No sentries, no dogs. Only a high gate and fence
surrounding the fort-like mansion.


STORM

swiftly sliding through the shadows, he moves around the
perimeter, pausing to examine things, searching for
something. He finds an old storm gate to what would
probably be a cellar or basement.


INT. TRENT MANSION - SPORTING ROOM - NIGHT

RAIN LOUD outside. Holland, Dunne, Ford and Jones. Half-
tanked, shooting pool to pass the time and cool their raw
nerves. No one armed.

                         DUNNE
                 (angry, defending
                  himself)
          What do we have to do, Holland drive
          a fucking stake through his heart?

                         HOLLAND
          I'll settle for a bullet.

Holland and Dunne exchange furious glares.

  Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              95.



                         HOLLAND
          You had him point-blank seven years
          ago, and he's still walking!

                         FORD
          He won't be for long. Not with his
          picture on every T.V. in --

                          HOLLAND
          Fuck his picture! Get off your
          asses --
                 (waves them to
                   get out of
                   here)
          Start earning your money!

Holland grabs his shoulder holster off the back of a chair,
stalks angrily toward a rear door.

The others glower as Holland pounds off into the rear of
the house. Dunne slings a cue ball the length of the
table, breaking the rack with a crack like a pistol shot.

The balls ricochet into each other and the cushions in a
futile expression of rage and frustration. Suddenly:


STORM

Out of nowhere appears at the door opposite the one Holland
just left by.  He is dripping from the rain and has a .45
pointed at them with one hand, while with the other he
holds a finger to his lips as if to say, "Shhh, don't
wake the baby."


DUNNE, FORD AND JONES

don't know whether to shit or go blind.

                         STORM
          How's the action, boys?   Mind if I
          play?

Glances from the men toward the couch at the rear of the
room, on which rest their jackets and shoulder holsters.
Storm: totally aware of every aspect of the situation.

                         STORM
          I know what you guys are thinking.
          You're thinking I couldn't play
          with this gun in my hand. Right?

Pause as the men stand in extreme anticipation.   Then:
Storm holsters his gun.

                          STORM
          Well?   Somebody hand me a cue.

There is a brief moment of hesitation and a look of
disbelief between the boys and then, BOOM! Ford tries to
hand Storm a pool cue as if Storm's head is a baseball
and the cue is a bat. This doesn't work very well, as
Storm enters and simultaneously grabs Ford's cue, using
his momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of the
pool table. We hear Ford's SKULL CRACK and he goes down.

Almost instantly another pool cue in Jones's hands slashes
toward Storm's head. This time Storm has his own tool --
and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect
with his head.

He again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and as
soon as his cue goes down, so does Storm's, onto the back
of Jones's skull with so much force we hear the NECK SNAP
at the same time the cue splinters in half! Storm is
left with the jagged tip of the skinny end.

Dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch
at the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcher
knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table.
Storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne's
midsection. With the other hand he  raises the sharpened
end of the pool stick and slams it down Dunne's throat
via the windpipe!

                         STORM
          That's for my wife. Fuck you and
          die.

Dunne falls to his knees and just stares. Storm does a
flying kick to his chin, breaking his neck. The room now
finished, he turns and exits.


INDOOR POOL

Holland pours himself a nervous drink. He paces, tracking
Trent who's doing a gentle breaststroke.

                         TRENT
          I want Dunne and the others here.
          That goddamn Storm is nuts enough
          to come after me --

                         HOLLAND
          He's nuts -- but not that nuts.

Holland watches Trent swim a few more strokes, then turns
and heads away down a short hallway.

INT. BATHROOM - HOLLAND

as he lifts the toilet seat to pee, he finds a handwritten
note on the seat. Shocked, he nervously looks around.
Seeing nothing, he picks up the note and reads it.


INSERT - NOTE

Anticipation of death is worse than death itself.


HOLLAND

A faint smile comes to his face with great confidence.
As he backs out of the toilet, he pulls his pistol from
his shoulder holster, cocking it. He cautiously exits.


TRACKING

Holland as he   moves toward the sporting room   and his
support team.    He enters the area of carnage   and the smug
confidence on   his face starts to change to a   slight worry.
He then starts   carefully making his way back   to the indoor
pool to inform   Trent.


INDOOR POOL

Holland enters the area and finds no one.     Now the look
on his face is one of fear and confusion.

                           HOLLAND
           Sonofabitch.

But he has a plan. His plan is to try to make it out of
the house in one piece. What was once careful stalking
has turned into panicked blundering.

CONTINUE TRACKING Holland as he bumps into things, knocking
them over, retreating wildly. He passes a raging fireplace
and suddenly out of the shadows comes a voice:

                          STORM (O.S.)
           How does it feel to know you're
           about to die?

Holland FIRES in the direction of the voice, and Storm
comes out of the shadows standing in plain view -- his
.45 pointed at Holland.

                          STORM
           I'll give you more time than you
           and Trent gave my wife.

Holland changes the point of his aim and FIRES again.    As
he fires, Storm EMPTIES his GUN straight at Holland.


WALL BEHIND HOLLAND

A Louis XIII portrait -- where a silver dollar-sized group
of holes has just appeared, two inches above Holland's
head. They are both out of ammo.


STORM'S POV

Holland picks up a fireplace poker. He's swinging like
maniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING the
AIR.

But he gets too close to Storm, who snatches the poker
away from him.

They are like two vicious cats whirling. We see Holland
gasping in agony and hear the sound of BONES BREAKING.

Storm then begins the search for Trent. He casually
strolls through the house calling as if he's playing hide
and seek with a childhood friend.

                         STORM
          Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are
          you?

Storm opens closets, looks in drawers, under the toilet
seat, and then proceeds into --


INT. MASTER BEDROOM

                          STORM
                  (loud enough
                   for Trent to
                   hear)
          Let's see ... where could that bad
          boy be?

From the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a
kiddie game, we are not sure if: Storm has gone mad or
what. He approaches the master closet as he continues
the taunting melody.


MASTER CLOSET

Storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks
aside -- looking for something that's probably not there.
Trent is too smart for this shit ... he's probably on a
jet to the Bahamas by now.

  Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             99.



One more rack of clothes in the farthest-back section.
Storm reaches to shove it aside when, with shocking and
deafening suddenness: a SHOTGUN BLAST erupts point-blank
... shredding $10,000 worth of suit jackets and barely
missing Storm's head. Instantly a figure leaps out. Storm
gently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen
eye to eye.


STORM AND TRENT

Storm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then
violently slams Trent up against the wall, pinning his
chest with the left hand. Storm takes the sawed-off
shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight
into Trent's mouth. The barrel simply goes through the
teeth and in his mouth. It appears Storm has made up his
mind about what to do. Trent's eyes bug out of his head.

Storm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him through
the house, shotgun still in his mouth.

                         STORM
          You know, Trent, I want to kill you
          so bad I can barely contain myself.
          But I keep thinking that death is
          far too merciful a fate for you,
          and that a nice petite white-bread
          boy like you in a federal
          penitentiary ...
                 (pause)
          -- let me put it this way -- I doubt
          whether you could remain anal
          retentive for very long. Yeah... I
          think that's best for you --

Trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about
to go out of his mind. About this time in their journey
through the house, Storm has stopped before Holland's
mangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scared
before, you should see him now.

Storm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, to
pick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his last
chance.

Trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth
impression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comes
flying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps
inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trent
and flips him backwards head-first into the fire.

Trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron
arrows of the fireplace. He is stuck -- struggling to
free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ...
a fate somewhat worse than prison.

Storm turns away --

                                                FADE OUT.

FADE IN:


EXT. CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY

We are not sure where we are yet. In   the distance, we
see a procession of marching men, all  wearing kilts, and
all the accoutrements of traditional  Scottish garb. In
the front, several paces ahead of the  neatly marching
lines of men, is a single BAGPIPER.   Behind all of them
is a hearse, being nobly escorted by  mounted police.


FULL SHOT

Now we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion
of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen
comrade.

CAMERA PAN'S OVER to reveal a section of mourners -- mostly
police but with some civilians. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER
and PANS TO the front row, where we see Storm in full
police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck. Andy
and Sonny are standing near at sober attention.

The procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to
play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position on a
section of lawn. The pallbearers remove the flag from
the casket and present it to the Chief of Police, who now
slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly
in front of Sonny Storm. He presents the flag and salutes
Sonny. The lone bagpiper stops and an officer on TRUMPET
begins playing "Taps." The coffin is slowly lowered.


FULL SCREEN - TV MONITOR

Finally: the film that Storm shot that night seven years
ago on the wharf. Spliced with the audiotape -- with
subtitles including each speaker's name to make every
word and identity clear. We see:

The two Shadow Men step from the station wagon. The
"pushed" film clearly reveals them to be Trent and Holland.
We see them conspire with Calabrese and Vitale.

           of natural cause.

Our SHOT starts to WIDEN, revealing that the TV monitor
is in a news studio. The nightly news is being broadcast:
what we see on this monitor is simultaneously going out
over the air.

As the SHOT WIDENS and TRAVERSES, we begin to see the
actual news set -- including Esposito who got his well-
deserved scoop -- and other anchorpeople, crewmen, etc.

                          CALABRESE (V.O.)
           All I'm counseling is a little

           Yeah? Well, the next time I read
           about him, it better be in the
           obituaries.

CONTINUE MOVE as the wharf scene keeps playing. The TV
monitor passes OUT OF FRAME, SOUND goes DOWN, we're MOVING
PAST the news set and its occupants (who are readying to
go back on-camera as soon as the wharf tape ends) and on
UP TOWARD --


LIGHTS ABOVE NEWS SET

which now FILL the FRAME -- bright and blinding. The
screen starts to bleach out ... it goes white and

picks the TV up from Andy's lap and, while it's still
playing, heaves it over the side and into the drink!

STORM

watching the last ripples from the sinking set. A moment
between him and himself -- when the past is allowed to
slip away, sink out of sight, making way for the future.

Storm turns back from the water surface, to his son and
to the woman he loves. He sits (letting the boat drift
wherever it wants to) and tugs Andy down beside him.

Then he reaches across to his son, pulls the boy to him
with a playful headlock.

For a moment both Andy and Sonny are held in suspension,
wondering what Storm will do or say.

Finally:

                          STORM
                  (to Sonny)
           Knock, knock.

For a beat, the boy is taken aback.    Then he break's into
a broad smile.

           Who's there?

Storm glances to Andy, pulling her tighter to him.

Storm hugs his son with great affection, pulling Andy to

EXT. CEDARS-SINAI - WIDE - DAY

A monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on
Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries
a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant.
Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough.
At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight
years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and
hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were
spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language
is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very
good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high
line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has
to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's
fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine
too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your
problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's
no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps
it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds
flat.

ANGLE

Right now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white
intern's coat from his paper bag.

INT. CEDARS-SINAI CORRIDOR - TRAVELING TWO SHOT - DAY

We DOLLY on Neil as he crosses through the long crowded
corridor. Patients, nurses, interns and doctors pass by.
A P.A. broadcasts occasional messages.

PROFILE

Nail crosses under an "EMERGENCY" sign and keeps going
towards the exit doors.

TRAVELING - FRONTAL

Neil APPROACHES THE CAMERA. From the other direction two
ambulance attendants wheel an old man under oxygen and
pass by Neil.

WIDE REAR SHOT

Without breaking his stride from the moment he got off the
bus, Neil exits through the doors, examines four ambulances
parked in the slots, climbs into one and drives off. Maybe
he's stolen it. We don't know.

EXT. R & C CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES - ON CHRIS - DAY

CHRIS SHIHERLIS crosses past stacks of gravel and cement
with a white-coated BLACK CLERK. Chris wears a hard hat
over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless
sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red,
Milwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction
worker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves.
He's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline
pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made.
Right now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley
were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to
1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and
spends money as fast as he makes it. Right now, he and
the Clerk exit to the sales counter.

Chris pays; Clerk writes receipt.

              (continuing)
          ...that a good racket? I ought

He leaves with the heavy red case.

INT. "TOYS 'R' US STORE" - ON CERRITO - DAY

MICHAEL CERRITO - at 40 - is looking at a doll house.
He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. Sicilian
from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and
Marion penitentiaries. He's strictly a "cowboy": his
natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns
and let's go." He's been off smack and everything else
for five years. He's clean and sober. He's the nicest
guy on the block and a loving father. If you get in his
way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. If you asked
him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you
were talking about.

CLOSE OR DOLL HOUSE DETAILS

It's 3 x 6 and two feet high. Miniature room sets are
inside. Cerrito's thick fingers close the door. He picks
it up. WIDEN. He crosses to a counter and MIDDLE-AGED
CLERK.

                      CERRITO
          Wrap this here up.

                      CLERK
          Yessir. You're going to have a
          happy little girl.

                       CERRITO
          Two.   I got two girls.

                         CLERK
          That's nice.

                       CERRITO
          Yeah. And gimme those three
          masks there.

Clerk takes down Clark Gable, Three-eyed Monster, and
Beautiful Lady, full-head rubber masks.

              (continuing)

Slides across the back of JUSTINE'S thigh.

JUSTINE'S AND HANNA'S FACES

She is 29, auburn,  languorous, her eyes are closed and she
makes love with her  husband, VINCENT HANNA. Pressing her
face to his, their  hair intertwined... It's morning. We
are in an expensive  condominium.

The two bodies locked into the rhythms of their love-making,
twisted in white sheets. OFF SCREEN a shower runs.

             Falls back on the pillow,
             disappointed. It's as if she'd
             been stood-up. The bed sheet
             falls half off of her. She's
             exposed, vulnerable. She looks
             out the window, occluded by light
             muslin, away from us and exhales.

            The plates are mezzotints. They

            called "sabi". They believed
            there were eight scenes of
            transcendental loneliness. They
            painted them over and over again.
            One is a flock of geese hovering
            over a field. There's always
            mist. It's painted just as the

          What is it?

                      CEZAR
          A bank. On Thursdays it gets
          cash deposits for distribution
          to other branches. The branches
          have to buttress their cash
          accounts to handle Friday payroll
          checks from a Toyota and Nissan
          plant, a steel mill and two
          refineries. One day a week,
          Thursday, the main branch carries
          the full whack.

                      NEIL
          You want a $100,000 advance,
          against a full 101. Why?

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org   34.


               CEZAR
   'Cause I can get it. 'Cause
   this is the best thing I seen in
   three years. 'Cause a screw-up
   makes 10 percent of nothin' equal
   nothin'. And 'cause those are
   the terms and they ain't
   negotiable.

               NEIL
   On the prowl or strong?

               CEZAR
   Strong. Through the front door.
   During the day.

               NEIL
   How many guys?

                CEZAR
   Four.   Three plus a driver.

               NEIL
   That's not a $100,000 worth
   anything. You're giving me an
   address to what's strictly a
   cowboy score: "Get the guns and
   let's go!" We smash, grab and
   boogie while they hit the alarm.

               CEZAR
   Three alarms. And that's why
   the price. 'Cause you chop-in
   through the roof the night before
   on the prowl and bypass 'em. I
   got circuit diagrams, blue prints,
   the works. So yeah, they hit
   the alarms, but nothing gonna
   happen.

               NEIL
   Do I have to kill people?

               CEZAR
   I doubt it. Two men have the
   two keys to open the box.

Neon under the vapor lamps. O.S. the cacophony of horns

               (to Hanna)
           Here's how we found her.

POLAROID - BLACK PROSTITUTE

in a nightgown, folded over the lip of a garbage can at
the waist. She's a pitiful rag doll. Someone killed her
and then threw her away.

HANNA

is too controlled.    Anger's underneath.

                         HANNA
           How old?

                       RICHIE
           Sixteen, seventeen.

           How'd she die, Richie?

                       RICHIE
           Blunt instrument. Cerebral
           hematoma.

                       HANNA
           Who are they?

THEIR POV: HEAVYSET BLACK WOMAN

and two stunned young boys. She's crying and arguing with
two uniformed LAPD trying to hold her back. One LAPD is a
black woman. The heavyset woman doesn't really know what
happened yet except it's bad.

                         RICHIE (O.S.)
               (low)
           The family.

                       HANNA (O.S.)
           What the hell are they doin'
           here?

RICHIE + HANNA

                       RICHIE
               (low; shrugs)
           It's fucked up. Somebody inside

Now Richie bends over the body bag on the ground and unzips
it. We don't see the dead girl. We only see Hanna. A
third uniformed officer in the background spins away.

                      HANNA
          Oh, this is nice.

                      RICHIE
          I wanted you to see this 'cause
          I got a feeling it's serial and
          gonna end up in your court.

                      HANNA
          Homicide getting anywhere?

                      RICHIE
          Nowhere.

Hanna rises. The mother's arguing with the man cop because
she wants to see. Horror and hysteria blossoming through
shock. She pushes the uniformed cop of the way. Hanna
goes to try to help. They grapple.

                      MOTHER
              (reaches out)
          Baby! Where's my baby.!

Anguish. It's a mess. The woman collapsing into Hanna's
arms. For one moment Hanna's eyes lock onto hers. He
freezes. One doesn't forget the look he sees in her eyes.

          My father wanted me to marry
          someone in Taipei. It was like
          I was a piece of furniture: "Go
          be his wife." After I left he
          won't talk to me. Because I
          went on my own. I can't let
          people tell roe what to do again.
          And that trust comes from knowing
          someone over time.
              (avoids Neil)
          This is hard between us for me.

Neil looks right into Eady's face.

Waingro winds up and cracks the girl.     She knocks over a

Another woman takes Waingro's eyes. He spins around on

He clicks off makes a drinking motion to...

12:03 a.m. Hanna takes a deep breath. He closes and opens
his eyes. They wait.

Nothing. Then the Pontiac with its lights off rolls

pads down the five steps to the rear entry of the jewelry
store. Chris is in a black suit and sneakers. There are
surgical gloves on his hands. The others stay in the car.

curious. He raises his head over the edge and his eyes go
wide. WIDEN. He's inches from the back of Cerrito's head.
Cerrito twists and turns and jerks back in effort - almost
touching Jackson. Cerrito's too absorbed to sense Jackson's
presence. Jackson carefully closes his eyes and sinks
down.

He gets a nod from Cerrito.   He slams the lock punch with
a cut down sledge hammer.

                       MARCIANO
               (rising; big smile)
           What can I do for you guys?
           Ignores his hand and shoves him
           back into his office chair with
           an open hand.

CLOSER

Hanna rips open Marciano's desk drawer finds a gun, unloads
it, throws it on the floor, finds a small tape recorder,
pops the tape out and tosses it to Schwartz. Then he
flashes a badge at Marciano.

                        MARCIANO
            L.A.P.D. Who the hell you think
            you're pushing around? You got
            no jurisdiction and I know people
            here!

                       SCHWARTZ
            Who? The fucking Tooth Fairy!
            So what?

                        HANNA
            You go back to Newark on a New
            Jersey warrant for smuggling
            cigarettes up from North Carolina
            three years ago or you go to
            work for us. Cut and dried.
            That...is...it.

                        MARCIANO
            Oh, my God...

                        HANNA
            Charlene Shiherlis.

                        MARCIANO
            Who?

                        SCHWARTZ
            "Who?" The stranger you been
            talkin' dirty to on the telephone
            every day for the last month.

                        MARCIANO
            You can't tie me to her!

                        HANNA
            Who has to. You're onna plane
            to New Jersey, jagoff.

                        MARCIANO
            Oh, man...
                (to himself)
            Why did I get mixed up with that
            bitch?

             'Cause she's got a great ass and

                   (defeated)
             So?

                         HANNA
             So it's no big thing. I don't
             even want her. You can have
             her, after. I want her husband
             and all his buddies; that's all.
             And you're gonna help.

INT. ROBERT'S COFFEE SHOP - NEIL + CHRIS - DAY

in a booth next to the window. Out the window is morning
traffic on Beverly Boulevard. Empty coffee cups say they've
been there a while. They lean close and talk low. Neil's
explosive behind it.

                         NEIL
             LAPD? The G? What? Where the
             hell did this heat come from?

                         CHRIS
             Maybe it's only the EMA score,
             not us.

                         NEIL

             Assume they got our phones, our
             houses bugged, I beepers on all
             the cars. We got major problems..
             Where's Cerrito?

Neil looks over at the cook behind the high counter and
recognizes him.

NEIL'S POV: DAVID BREEDAN

                         NEIL (O.S.)
             Recognize the cook?

          armed robbery.

INT. KITCHEN - BREEDAN

Grim, cold, working his ass off on five breakfast orders
simultaneously.

                         NEIL (O.S.)
          Hey, David.     How you doing?

Breedan turns, recognizes Neil and warms as if the sun
rose.

                       BREEDAN
          Hey, Homeboy! All right!
              (flips eggs; checks
               orders)
          How bout you?

                      NEIL
              (sits on counter)
          Gettin' by. You okay?

              (embarrassed; re:
                job)
          Yeah. Temporary. Know what I
          mean?

Neil looks out and sees Cerrito.

                       NEIL
          Sure.   See you around.

INT. RESTAURANT - ON BOOTH

Neil slides in.

          My car. Bugs. Two of 'em.
          Count 'em. One in the wheel
          well. Second behind the fire
          wall. Night of the party? I
          dropped Elaine and swung by EMA
          to check out the junction box...

             Without the platinum how do we
             buy the bank score?

                         NEIL
             I cash in T-bills to pay-off
             Kelso. That's not our problem.

                         CERRITO
             What the hell happened to Van
             Zant and our 750?

                         NEIL
             With the heat we got, you wanna
             play World War Two in the streets
             with Van Zant?

                         CERRITO
             Van Zant gets a pass?!

                         NEIL
             Fuck Van Zant. I got more
             motivation to whack him than you
             do. He is a luxury. Our problem
             is: jam and take the bank or
             split.
                 (beat)
             And I mean right fucking now.
             Do not go home, pack, nothing.
             Thirty seconds from now we are
             on the road. Gone.

No answer.    Chris and Cerrito are thinking.

                         CHRIS
             For me, the bank's worth the
             stretch. I say accept the risk,
             stay.

                         NEIL
             Michael?

                         CERRITO
                 (quietly)
             I roll with you. Whatever...

                         NEIL
                 (quietly)
             Not on this one, Michael. On
             this one you make up your own
             mind.

                         CERRITO
                 (he can't)

                        NEIL
           I got some plans. To go away
           after. So for me, it's worth
           the stretch.

Chris is surprised.

                       NEIL
               (continuing)
           But, Elaine takes good care of
           you. You got plenty put away.
           T. Bonds; real estate. If I
           were you, I'd be smart and cut
           loose of this.

CERRITO

thinks.   The he shrugs, laughs:

                       CERRITO
           Hey. To me the action's half
           the juice anyway. I'm in.

                        NEIL
           All right.   All right.

EXT. WILIMINGTON OIL FIELDS - OIL PUMP - DAY

WIDEN. It's a desolate area - empty space. Off in the
distance is a manufacturing plant and a billboard. PAN
LEFT and HOLD on Cerrito's Coupe de Ville. It pulls down
the dirt access road, lurching up and down on its soft
shocks, and raising billows of tan dust. It stops. Neil -
in a gray chamois jacket over a black T-shirt - gets out.
He hasn't shaved in a couple of days. Chris and Michael
Cerrito get out the left side. They walk TO CAMERA and:

                       CERRITO
           That the place?

                        NEIL
           Yeah. You see how the road leads
           back around?

                        CERRITO
           Yeah.

                       NEIL
           That's the escape route...

VERY LONG SHOT: NEIL, CERRITO AND CHRIS

the three men point. Chris draws a map. Then they climb
back into the sky-blue Cadillac and drive away.

           This is it.

PULL BACK and REVEAL Schwartz with binoculars and Casals
with earphones. They had been surveilling Neil and Cerrito.
There's a tape recorder with a directional microphone in a
parabolic dish.

                        CASALS
           I know.   Let's go!

WIDER

The two men run back from their observation position to an
unmarked car parked a hundred yards behind.

SAME SCENE - WIDE - LATER - SUNSET

It's later. The CAMERA PANS the empty, desolate landscape
of oil pumps, dirt roads and a solitary billboard.

                       HANNA (O.S.)
           What are they taking down out
           here?

PULL BACK to REVEAL Hanna, Schwartz, Casals and Bosko.
Hanna looks through binoculars.

                        CASALS
           They were looking at something
           southwest...

                       HANNA
           What's's that down there?

                       CASALS
           An auto parts company. They're
           going to knock over a payroll?

                       SCHWARTZ
           The company only pays by check.

                        HANNA
           Maybe they're gonna steal the
           hub caps ...

O.S. we HEAR a CLICK.

                       HANNA
               (continuing)
           A billboard. Oil pumps.     What

          figure.

ANGLE ON HANNA

Recognition dawns.

                      HANNA
          I got an idea what they're looking
          at. You know what they're looking
          at?

Hanna turns his back on the rest of the detectives and a
big smile dawns upon his face. He raises his arms out
wide. Hanna turns in one direction, then another. Schwartz
doesn't understand.

                      HANNA
              (continuing; to
               Schwartz)
          Is that guy something; or is
          that guy something? I mean, you
          gotta give this crew credit.
          They are so fucking good...
              (beat)
          Know what he's looking at?

VERY TIGHT ON HANNA IN 3/4 REAR SHOT

The image vibrates. Hanna says more. We don't hear it.
We HEAR a CAMERA SHUTTER CLICK. The IMAGE FOCUSES and
DEFOCUSES. Another CLICK.

                      HANNA
          Us. The L.A.P.D. The Police
          Department. We just got made...

Hanna laughs.

EXT. KNOLL - L.S. HANNA - TWILIGHT

Pull back to reveal he's being surveilled by Neil. He's
been photographing Hanna with a black Nikon on a tripod
with a 1300Mm Questar Reflector lens. Neil's made his
tail. The recce in the blue Cadillac was bait. Neil half
returns Hanna's smile. He climbs into the Caprice. Cerrito
roars off, leaving a cloud of dust which billows into mauve
against the deep sky.

INT. NATE'S MERCEDES - TWO SHOT - TRAVELING - DAY

Vapor lights glide past. Neil examines circuit diagrams
and architectural blueprints of the bank. Next he unfolds
a pasted-together 180 degree view of the street.

                      NATE
          Worth it?

              (beat)
          It's terrific.

Neil puts the materials back in the case and snaps it shut.
Next, Nate hands Neil a thick envelope. Inside are the
pictures Neil took of Hanna and xeroxes of Hanna's
employment records.

                      NATE
          His name is Hanna; first name,
          Vincent. I smeared this sergeant
          in vice five yards. Hanna's all
          over you. He's a hot dog.
          Lieutenant in major Crimes Unit.
          He's taken down some heavy crews.
          Blew away Frankie Yonder in
          Chicago and he was a fucking
          maniac. Was working Narcotics
          before that. He's good, Neil.
          Dedicated. Divorced three times.
          Current wife's Justine. He's
          why the extra heat.
              (pause)
          Vice sergeant says Hanna likes
          you. Thinks you're some kind of
          'star.' 'You do this sharp, you
          do that sharp. Look how sharp
          this guy is to figure that.'

Neil laughs.

                      NATE
              (continuing)
          Funny as a heart attack.
              (pause)
          With this guy and this much heat,
          you should pass on the bank.

Hanna leaves. Then Justine looks at where he stood. Her

her makeup.

plate into the piles of dirty dishes   and rests on his

He approaches Neil's car.

            Well, you're right. You would
            be. But if you don't betray
            Chris, you betray Dominick.
            Because he becomes an orphan
            when you go to prison as an
            accessory 'cause you got no living
            parents to take him. Then he
            ends up state-raised and fucked
            for life. Your son Dominick's
            innocent. He didn't choose a
            life like that. Chris did.

Charlene rises and crosses to a bedroom and looks in the

Dominick, then nods her head "yes." Farina dials a number.

He kisses her.    She doesn't respond.    She stares at him.

          I'm Vincent Hanna.

                      JUSTINE

          I'm angry.

          Ralph, you can ball my wife.
          You can lounge around her $1.7
          million condominium on her sofa.
          You can do all those things.
          But you do not get to watch my
          fucking TV...!

Hanna lifts it off the table, spilling framed pictures.   A
commercial segues to a quiz show.

                      HANNA

          even.

                      JUSTINE

anyway.

something else:

PAINTER TWO'S POV: ROOM

THE HEAVY METAL MOVIE 

- Final Draft -







								SCREENPLAY BY

								Len Blum






								July 18, 1980


 
FADE UP ON 
A WHEATFIELD 
A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead
of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar
devices on the roof that rotate constantly.

AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
two large metal boxes.


 CUT TO 

THE ATTIC WINDOW 
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer
down.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE VAN 
AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE HOUSE 
AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all
over the floor.

Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides.

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.
Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
in the back.

As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The
glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it.


 AUSTIN                     (looking at the holograph)

                 Hmmmm ....


He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
adjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark.


 AUSTIN                     (seeing sparks)

                 Uh - oh ....


As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
green planet begins to silently shake.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake.


 CUT BACK TO 

AUSTIN 
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments.


 CUT TO 

A FOREST 
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance.

The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
girl approaches, picking mushrooms.


 CUT TO 

A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET 
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks
at it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.


 CUT TO 

THE GIRL'S BEDROOM 
The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball
begins to glow brightly.

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
ball behind it.

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans
up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
the city gates, rising higher and higher.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high
above the foothills, we begin to come down.

In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points.


 CUT TO 

THE MOUNTAINS 
A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.

As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow
of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a
thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.


 CUT TO 

THE BARBARIAN LEADER 
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him.

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke
and flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught.

As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting
a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city.


 CUT TO 

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle
raging.

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members.


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 They're killing everyone.  We
                 must escape!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 The city is burning!


 COUNCILMAN #4                     (throwing a parchment
                     before the Elder)

                 Even the mountains glow green and an
                 evil slime oozes down!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We
                 must fight!


 ELDER 
                 Silence!


Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown before
him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.


 ELDER 
                 We are not a race of warriors.
                 We are statesmen, and scientists.
                 From our very beginning it was ordained
                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the
                 Defender would aid us in times of need.
                 This was the Pact!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is
                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 Some say that the race is not dead
                 - that one still lives.


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 One?  What good is one?


 ELDER 
                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.


Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears at
the doorway.


 BOY 
                 Elder!  They are at the walls!


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 Well who is this last Defender?
                 How can he be summoned?


 ELDER 
                 It is Taarna, of the blood of
                 Taarak the Defender - the last of
                 the race.  And must be summoned as
                 my forefathers summoned Taarak
                 himself - from within!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 But will this Defender answer?


 ELDER 
                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They
                 must answer.  It is in their blood.


The clattering of armour becomes audible.


 BOY 
                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!


 ELDER                     (calmly to the boy)

                 Bar the door.
                 (to the Councilmen)
                 We will summon the
                 Defender together.


The Councilmen nod.


 ELDER                     (shutting eyes)

                 Taarna ... Taarna ...


As the Councilmen take up the chant;


 CUT TO 

THE DOOR 
As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
the BARBARIAN LEADER.

With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
troops rush in around him.

The chanting continues as we;


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.

Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S FACE 
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind.

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.

Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into
the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.

Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck.


 HUMANOID 
                 I owe you my life.  Let me
                 repay you ...


He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
towards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he
molests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices
inside her, chanting her name.

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.

Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
next to the growling creature.

As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN GRIMALDI 
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows
thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.


 AUSTIN 
                 Dammit!


AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.

The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound
grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
engines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Where the hell are we?


Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND BELOW 
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The
scene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
the bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.

There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
Silhouetted figures rush by.


 CUT TO 

A GUN EMPLACEMENT 
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.


 CUT TO 

CLOSEUP OF A SHELL 
It is thrust into a breech.


 CUT TO 

THE B-17 FORMATION 
As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
aircraft.  In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl".


 CUT TO 

INT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 We're there Stepek, right on
                 target ... Rabual dead ahead!


Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
electric blue flashes.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Gee!  Thanks for telling me,
                 Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up
the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 For Christ sake, hold her steady!


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
light up his turret.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop
                 'em and let's get outta here!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm
                 gonna hit something.
                 (he settles over the bomb sight)
                 Left two degrees ... steady ...
                 steady ...


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
the fuselage interior.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Hey kid, how ya doing back there?


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
the flak puffs behind the tail.


 TAILGUNNER 
                 Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay
                 ... I think.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up, we're almost there.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 C'mon Stepek, there's the
                 whole island of Rabaul down
                 there, you can't miss!


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Screw you ...


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT 
Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
pilot rears back with the blast.  The right windshield is
shattered.


 PILOT 
                 We took a hit ...


The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
straps.  His eyes stare.  Blood runs from under his helmet.
We know he is dead.


 PILOT 
                 Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 We took one back here too.
                 C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER                     (hand on the release button)

                 Steady ... steady ... bombs away!
                 Let's get the hell outta here!


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk
across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
enormous ball of fire.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Yahoo!  Bullseye!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE PACIFIC PEARL 

 PILOT                     (exhilarated)

                 Nice shooting Stepek, how are the
                 rest of you guys?


 FLIGHT ENGINEER (V.O.) 
                 Flight Engineer okay.


 RADIO OPERATOR (V.O.) 
                 Radio okay.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Navigator check.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Belly okay.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Ah ... tail okay ...


There is abrupt silence.


 PILOT 
                 Bellson ... Lewis?


Still silence, no reply from either name.


 PILOT 
                 Kid, check the waist positions, see if
                 they're okay.


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 

 TAILGUNNER 
                 Yeah ... will do, skipper.


TAILGUNNER crosses himself, then exits back into the body of
the machine.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT                     (wearily)

                 Let's go home.


We hear jumbled comments from all positions.  Everyone is
happy.


 CREW (V.O.) 
                 Cheers and whoops.


The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner
reports back.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both
                 dead.


This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
puzzled.


 PILOT 
                 Dammit!


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Well kid, now you got a real
                 bombing mission under your belt.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a
bottle.


 CUT TO 

EXT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
She rejoins the rest of the group.  The formation is not
quite as tight as before.  As the formation flies along,
puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.


 CUT TO 

LOW VIEW OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod.  A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar.  The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past.  We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing.


 CUT TO 

THE NOSE OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously.  From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Sorry about Elkhorn, skip.
                 What happened?

 PILOT 
                 I dunno.  The shell exploded and he
                 collapsed.  I think he took it in
                 the head.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?


 PILOT 
                 He's dead.


 BOMBARDIER                     (sings drunkenly)

                 Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's
                 hole and the woodpecker said God
                 bless my soul; take it out, take it
                 out, take it out, remove it ...


 TAILGUNNER                     (bolder)

                 Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't
                 like my voice?


While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
thickening.  Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small
talk. It's the NAVIGATOR.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Something's wrong!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 
He is frantically tapping the compass.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 You got a problem, Holden?


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Naw, the kid's the one with the
                 problem.  He don't like my voice!


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up Stepek.  What's the
                 problem, Holden?


 NAVIGATOR 
                 I must have a malfunction, my compass
                 says we're heading north!


 CUT TO 

PILOT 
He looks at his compass.


 PILOT 
                 Mine says east.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Hey, can you guys see the rest of the
                 squadron?


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Negative, there's too much cloud.


A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
the plane.


 CUT TO 

THE COCKPIT 
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in
the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly.


 PILOT 
                 What the hell ...


He reaches forward to tap the compass.


 PILOT 
                 Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
                 crazy.  It's spinning like a son of
                 a bitch!


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
                 field or something !!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights.  Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Christ, now they're all doing it!!


 CUT TO 

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL 
All the dials are going haywire.  Above the instrument panel
we see the windshield is spattered with rain.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 You guys quit talking business?
                 I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I
                 put my finger in a woodpecker's ...


 PILOT                     (irritably)

                 Can it Stepek, we got real problems.


Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
in the distance.  It begins to curve toward the aircraft.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET 
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Jesus!  Look at that!!


From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Look at what ... look at what!!?


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's out there, just look at it ...


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For Christ sake, give us a position!


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's about four o'clock, just below
                 ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!


The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine.


 CUT TO 

PILOT'S POV 
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence
about it ... the whole machine shakes.


 PILOT 
                 Damn.


The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
feathering the bad engine.  Suddenly it's too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 We lost the goddamned prop ...
                 Did it do any damage?  Kid, check
                 the tail.


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Come in kid ... kid are you okay?


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Travis; go check the back.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Will do, skipper.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE HATCH 
TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.


 PILOT                     (to himself)

                 Goddamn it, now what?


He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing.  It detaches
one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.  They blow
away in the slipstream.


 PILOT 
                 Gremlins!
                 (rubbing his eyes)
                 Jesus, I must be getting tired.


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton.

TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash,
from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Travis, what's goin' on back there?


 CUT TO 

TRAVIS 
His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet
headphone, we hear his name.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Holden, how far to base?


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
                 I'd guess about two hundred miles.


All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.


 PILOT 
                 For Christ's sake, find us a place I
                 can put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 It's all ocean down there, skip!


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Mack, can you get us a radio fix?


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 

 RADIO OPERATOR 
                 Negative skip, too much interference.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.


 PILOT 
                 Shit!  I've gotta put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ...
                 ya wanna snort?


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For God sakes Stepek, shut up!


STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle.  He is lying on
his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft.
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head.  He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head.  He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Oh my God, there's ... there's ...
                 ahh ... keep away ... keep away ...
                 (struggles)
                 ... hey no ... hey somebody ...
                 (screams)


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will
                 you lay off the booze, you've got the
                 D.T.'s ...


STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream, kicking
madly.  We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures.


 CUT BACK TO 

STEPEK 
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out
into the night.


 CUT TO 

THE PLANE 
Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back
large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges
are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window.

Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is scared.


 PILOT 
                 Holden, for God's sake get up
                 here on the double.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 What's the problem, skip?


 PILOT 
                 Just get up here!


The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot.


 NAVIGATOR 
                 What is it, skip?
                 (looking out windows)

 JESUS H. CHRIST! 

 PILOT 
                 Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.


He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping
off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings.
The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists
and then bursts open.  A dozen bat-like creatures swarm in.
The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun
from its rack.  He screams as the creatures attack and shoots
right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright
ruby glow.


 NAVIGATOR                     (struggling)

                 Okay you little bastards ... shit ...
                 (screams)


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 
The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him.
Wreathed in flames, he falls back into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
Creatures swarm all over the plane.  The ball turret falls
off.  A wheel suddenly lowers, then falls off.  A flap flutters
free and blows away.  Oil streams back into the slipstream and
sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the
skeleton framework of the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.  Creatures are now in the cockpit,
plucking out the instruments.  The PILOT reaches to the throttle
only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand.
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels
at the attacking creatures with the other.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
It is now almost a flying skeleton.  For the first time, we
see that it is heading for an island.  A figure detaches itself
from the machine and plummets away.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He falls, terror-stricken, through space.  Finally his chute
opens.  A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand.  He rips
off the glove and throws it and the creature away.


 PILOT 
                 (struggling)
                 Jesus H. Christ!


 CUT TO 

THE ISLAND 
The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces,
then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach,
where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop.  The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming
from what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly
to a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks
around incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable
graveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old
wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans
to the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed
Electra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted
on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".

The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
a pile of scrap.

Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The
metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to
lift it up.

WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally
coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls
back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,
who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
needlenose pliers.


 AUSTIN 
                 Got it.


Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,
he begins to re-solder it in place.  Behind him, a LITTLE
GIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?


 AUSTIN                     (concentrating)

                 Yes dear.  But Daddy's fixing
                 it.  (hums)


 LITTLE GIRL                     (watching)

                 How come it's always breaking?


 AUSTIN 
                 I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 When it's fixed, will you make more
                 funny pictures for me?


 AUSTIN 
                 Honey, why don't you go play with
                 your toys and let Daddy finish his
                 work, okay?  Mmmm ...


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 Okay.


The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine,
as AUSTIN flips a switch.  Once again the glass sphere sparkles
and the holographic screen lights up.  AUSTIN uses a tool to
fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;
the glass gates of Kraan.

As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer
to the holograph screen.


 CUT TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
The Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies
in over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautiful
city lies in ruins.

Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of
smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
town's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard
on the reins, and heads her bird up.

The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
down to the Council Chambers below.

Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In the
center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and
manuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNA
dismounts and starts to look around.  At the head of
the marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,
a roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,
their tops glowing green.

TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she notices
that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Prying
his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion
just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.

Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly
in her hand.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING 
TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys
the city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow
coming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,
pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.


 CUT TO 

GIRL'S BEDROOM 
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From
within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.

TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow
coming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,
sword drawn.

Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the
ball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously
ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through
snake-like fangs.


 WITCH 
                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!
                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon
                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies
                 the end of heaven - the beginning of
                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death
                 in your hands.  For death is upon
                 you.  And as you perish ... so dies
                 your race!


The witch's eyes go green.


 WITCH                     (screaming)

                 Take it !!


She hurls tha ball at TAARNA, who dodges it.  The ball sails
past her, out the window.  Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps
at the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes
stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through
the room.

TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  As
she flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,
rising into the clouds and disappearing.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears
in the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting
closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green
meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.

The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the
hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of
an automobile suspended in the open hatch.

Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from
the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now
that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.

With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and
as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its
free-fall to Earth.

As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays
with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
way, then the other.

Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car
radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles
on one.

With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to
Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts
burning up.

As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his
approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking
Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the
repeated impact.

The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into
high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt
to translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then
he pops his drag chute to help slow down.

TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the
chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.


 CUT TO 

EXT. THE PENTAGON - AERIAL SHOT 
From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters
and T.V. newsmen waiting on the front steps.

The '59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below, and seeing
it, the reporters all start to run over.

The camera zooms down and into the car.  Inside, the driver
reaches over, unplugs a rubber hose, and loosens the two
large hex-nuts which connect him to the car.  As he gets out,
the reporters come running up.


 FEMALE REPORTER                     (to driver)

                 Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were
                 sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do
                 you still say this has nothing to do
                 with the green radiation from space.


The driver walks on without speaking.


 T.V. NEWSMAN                     (walking alongside)

                 Doctor, is it true that the President
                 himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six
                 Project so that you could investigate
                 those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.


He ignores the question, and walks past the guard into the
Pentagon.


 CUT TO 

INT. PENTAGON - MEETING ROOM 
Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of
the Cabinet, and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt.
An argument is in progress as the expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK
enters.  The camera follows him as he sits down next to one
of the Generals.


 FAT POLITICIAN 
                 ... well what I wanna know is,
                 what's the Army doing about this?
                 Hell!  My constiuents are turning
                 green!  They're growing arms on
                 their backs.  There's something or
                 someone up there in space and the
                 voters have a right to know about it!


 GENERAL 
                 Senator, we have no proof that these
                 mutations are the result of interference
                 from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak
                 has just come in, so let's hear what he
                 has to say ... Doctor?


The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.


 DOCTOR 
                 First of all, there is no cause for
                 alarm.  As for the theories of interference
                 by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that
                 we on Earth are the only intelligent,
                 technically advanced civilization present
                 in the universe.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
An enormous round spaceship the size of Pittsburg hovers
overhead.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 

 DOCTOR 
                 ... and whatever is causing these
                 mutations is not from outer space.
                 it's more likely just an isolated
                 biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ...
                 ph ... ph ...


Suddenly the DOCTOR'S head starts to jerk from side to side.
Everyone looks on, not knowing how to react.  As the DOCTOR
begins to move in short bursts, like a broken robot, he
fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
From the bottom of the huge spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and
starts to drill through the roof of the Pentagon.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 
The DOCTOR starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty
secretary.


 DOCTOR 
                 Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...


Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table.


As the DOCTOR struggles with the terrified girl, the camera
pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship
drills through.  Descending upon them, it sucks them up instantly.


 DOCTOR 
                 Aaarrgghh!


 SECRETARY 
                 Eeeeeek!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL ROOM 
A metallic robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of
a large glass receiving jar, as DOCTOR ANRAK comes through
the tube and lands in the jar.  As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet
hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of
small metallic parts.


 ROBOT                     (Mechanical voice)

                 Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed
                 to fix this guy?  He's fucked.


ZEKE and EDSEL, two alien space-pilots, are standing nearby,
at the control console.  They look like big furry orange heads
on stilts, with arms coming out of the sider.


 ZEKE                     (to Edsel)

                 I guess we turned it up a
                 little too high.


 EDSEL                     (to Robot)

                 Sorry, man.


 ROBOT 
                 You're sorry?  What about me?
                 I've gotta put this asshole
                 back together.


Suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands
in the jar.  She's a little mussed up, but okay.


 GLORIA 
                 (gasp)  Where am I?


 ROBOT                     (staring)

                 Hey, who's the chick?


 GLORIA 
                 Well look at my clothes!
                 Who's gonna pay for the dry
                 cleaning?  And where am I?
                 I demand that you return me
                 to my office immediately.


 ROBOT 
                 Too late - molecular instability
                 zone around spacecraft. You cannot
                 leave.


 GLORIA                     (to Zeke)

                 What?!  Is he kidding?


 ZEKE 
                 Uh ...


He looks at the ROBOT, who winks at him.


 ZEKE 
                 ... oh yeah.  Instability zone.
                 You're stuck here.


ZEKE and EDSEL try to keep straight faces.


 GLORIA                     (stunned)

                 But I have to be at my parents
                 for dinner tonight.  And my
                 gynecologist appointment is on
                 Wednesday.


 ROBOT 
                 Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like
                 a drink?
                 (leading her away)
                 You'll feel better after a glass of
                 fresh blo-aak.


They disappear down a corridor.


 GLORIA (V.O.) 
                 Do you have any diet soda?


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 

 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Ah, typical robot.  The first
                 Earth-chick we see in ten years,
                 and he's gotta make a play for her.


EDSEL jams the gearshift into 'D' for Drive, and the ship
lifts away from Earth.


 ZEKE 
                 Hey, do we have any of that
                 Plutonian Nyborg left?


 EDSEL 
                 Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's
                 in the transmitter compartment.


 ZEKE 
                 Uh, thanks man.


ZEKE opens a hatch and pulls out a double-spouted plastic
bag on wheels the size of a steamer-trunk.  It is full of
white powder.


He pours two fifteen-foot lines of powder onto the floor.
Then, he pauses.


 ZEKE                     (surveying the lines)

                 Oh great.  Think this is enough?


 EDSEL                     (thinking)

                 Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.


 ZEKE 
                 Good thinking, man.


As he resumes pouring, ZEKE begins singing to himself in an
alien tongue.  When the lines are poured, they both stand at
the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair
to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads.


 ZEKE & EDSEL 
                 Nose dive!


They both start to criss-cross the room, inhaling the white
powder like vaccuum cleaners.  As they happily snort the
Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and
moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.  Reaching
his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the
head.  Through the shattered metal we can see a green ball,
glowing inside ANRAK'S skullpiece.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - ZEKE AND EDSEL'S P.O.V. 
As the round spaceship moves through space, a group of
asteroids approach and whip past.  Up ahead, a red sun
turns white and goes super-nova.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA PEARLMAN and the ROBOT are lying in bed, naked.
They have just finished making love.  She is smoking a cigarette.


 GLORIA                     (glazed)

                 That was incredible.  I've never felt
                 anything like it.


 ROBOT 
                 Oh great.  I have been programmed to
                 be fully proficient in sexual activities.
                 Do you want to go steady?


 GLORIA 
                 Gee, I don't know.  I already have
                 a boyfriend.


 ROBOT

                 hurt him.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed
out into space.  They are obviously stoned.  Suddenly a bell
rings and the communicator screen lights up.  A serious officer's
face appears on it.


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...


ZEKE looks over at the screen and then shouts into it.


 ZEKE

 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling Starcruiser Alpha ...


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Whaddyawant man?


 OFFICER 
                 Now listen, idiot.  Do I have to
                 tell you eight hundred times?  You
                 don't call me "man"!  You call me
                 "Com-Op Officer Blix". Now is that
                 perfectly clear?


 ZEKE                     (into mike)

                 Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER                     (disgruntled)

                 You are to return immediately to
                 the Mother Ship and pick up a
                 humanoid civilian.  Your orders
                 are to escort him to the Interplanetary

                 at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make
                 it snappy!


The screen goes blank.


 EDSEL 
                 Wow!  They finally got Sternn.


 ZEKE 
                 It's about time.  Hang on, man.

                 thing I know, it's how to drive
                 when I'm stoned.  It's like, you
                 know your perspective's fucked,
                 so you just gotta let your hands
                 work the controls as if you're
                 straight.


The round ship rams directly into a wall, and crashes down,
skidding to a stop in front of the loading bay.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow, good landing, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Thanks.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - ENTRANCE HATCH 
ZEKE and EDSEL press a button to open the hatch doors.
As the door opens we see two metallic Regolian guards
waiting on the other side.  Between them stands a small,
shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and
cauliflower ears.  This is HANOVER FISTE.


 REGOLIAN GUARD                     (to Zeke and Edsel)

                 This man is to be delivered to the,
                 clik, Interplanetary Tribunal, Courtroom
                 #3, clik, Galaxy versus Lincoln Sternn.
                 Thenk yew.  Clik.


The guards wheel away.


 FISTE                     (meekly)

                 Ah, hello.


 CUT TO 

CORRIDOR IN SPACESHIP 
ZEKE and EDSEL escort FISTE down the corridor.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Umm, you're gonna testify at
                 Sternn's trial?


FISTE nods.


 ZEKE 
                 They gotta give him at least, like,
                 life.


 FISTE 
                 Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable
                 man.
                 (camera pulls close to Fiste's face)
                 He will be freed.


 CUT TO 

SPACE - LATER 
As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through
a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past
a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Y'know, I wish they'd clean this place
                 up, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Yeah.  It's like pig city out here.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Yeah.


 CUT TO 

ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA is getting dressed as the ROBOT re-charges his energy-
paks.


 ROBOT 
                 ... but I don't understand.  We
                 laugh together.  We care for each
                 other.  We have highly proficient
                 sex.  Why can't we get married?


 GLORIA 
                 Look, we're different, okay?  Let's
                 leave it at that.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL ROOM 
The hatch opens, and GLORIA and the ROBOT walk through,
still talking.


 GLORIA 
                 ... but mixed marriages just don't
                 work.  What if you get tired of me
                 and run off with a vibrator or
                 something?


As they move through the room, and out the other side, they
pass FISTE, who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar,
hands folded.  Looking around, FISTE notices a green glow
coming from the bottom of the jar.  He gets up, quietly opens
the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts.

Finding the small green ball in ANRAK'S head, he pulls it
out and looks at it.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, driving carefully.
FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside
them.


 ZEKE 
                 There it is, man.  I'm gonna hang
                 a louie here.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Yeah, well it won't be long now.  Are
                 you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn.


FISTE says nothing.  He just clutches the green ball and stares
into space.

ZEKE and EDSEL look at each other and shrug.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE SPACESHIP 
An enormous, brightly-lit, multi-level space station/courthouse
floats into view, completely filling the screen.  ZEKE and
EDSEL'S round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame,
approaching the mammoth structure.


 CUT TO 

SPACE-STATION LANDING DOCK 
The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL,
and FISTE.


 GLORIA 
                 ... alright, alright.  I'll marry
                 you - but on one condition ... I
                 want a Jewish wedding.


 ROBOT 
                 A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is
                 space.  95% of the population are
                 robots.


 GLORIA 
                 Well, find me a robot-rabbi!


 ROBOT 
                 Okay, okay!


 EDSEL 
                 I give them six months, man.


 ZEKE 
                 He doesn't even look Jewish!


GLORIA and the ROBOT disappear around a corner as ZEKE and EDSEL
escort FISTE through the hatch.  FISTE is carrying the small
green ball.

As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through
a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly
rotating space-station.  At the top, the camera zooms down
through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge
inter-galactic courtroom.

Voices echo below us.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?


 STERNN 
                 I am.


As we move down, we see square-jawed CAPTAIN STERNN, his
shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing
before the Judge.

STERNN is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from
a long page of charges.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Lincoln Sternn - you stand here
                 accused of twelve counts of murder
                 in the first degree  ... fourteen
                 counts of armed theft of Federation
                 property ...


 CUT TO 

THE GALLERY 
The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at STERNN with
hateful, accusing eyes.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... twenty-two counts of piracy
                 in high space ... eighteen counts of
                 fraud ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN'S LAWYER 
Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to STERNN.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... thirty-seven counts of rape, and
                 one moving violation.  How do you plead?


 CUT TO 

CAPTAIN STERNN 
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.


 STERNN 
                 Not guilty!


 LAWYER                     (whispers to Sternn)

                 Not guilty?!?  Are you nuts?!?


 STERNN                     (whispers to lawyer)

                 It's okay, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


 JUDGE                     (to Prosecutor)

                 Call the first witness!


STERNN and his lawyer move to their seats.


 LAWYER                     (to Sternn)

                 But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold!
                 Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish
                 bowl.


 CUT TO 

THE COURTROOM DOORS 
ZEKE and EDSEL enter with FISTE, and push their way to the
front.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.


 GUARD #1 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #2 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #3 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #4 
                 Hanover Fiste!


ZEKE and EDSEL sit down, while HANOVER FISTE, small and
shabby, walks up to the witness stand, nervously clutching
the small green ball in his hand.  As he passes, STERNN and
his lawyer continue to argue.


 LAWYER                     (pleading)

                 Lissen Sternn ... change the plea
                 to guilty.  Throw yerself on the
                 mercy of the court.


 STERNN 
                 I told you, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


HANOVER FISTE is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs.


 LAWYER 
                 But the most we can hope for is to
                 get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave
                 don't get violated!  Plead guilty!


 STERNN 
                 Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle.


 LAWYER 
                 What angle?


 STERNN                     (pointing to Fiste)

                 Him!


 CUT TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 State your name for the record.


 FISTE                     (fidgeting nervously with
                     the green ball)

                 I am Hanover Fiste.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 

 STERNN                     (winking to lawyer)

                 I promised him thirty-five thousand
                 zuleks to testify on my behalf.


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 You know the defendant,
                 (pointing)
                 Captain Sternn?


 FISTE 
                 Yes, I know Captain Sternn.  And
                 never did there live a kinder, more
                 generous man.  He is an overflowing
                 cup, filled with the very cream of
                 human goodness ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 

 STERNN                     (to lawyer)

                 See?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE 
                 ... in all the time I've known him,
                 he's never done anything immoral ...
                 (thinking)
                 unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's
                 Prostitute ring ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 
They look at each other, shocked.


 STERNN & LAWYER 
                 Huh?!?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE                     (speaking gently)

                 ... and he's ah, never done anything
                 illegal ...
                 (turning sharply)
                 ... unless you count all the times
                 he sold dope disguised as a nun!!
                 (reverting to meekness)
                 He's always been a good, law-abiding
                 citizen ...
                 (shouting at himself)
                 Awww, gimme a break!!
                 (gentle again)
                 ... of the Federation, and, and ...
                 (going schizo)
                 Shut Up!  Shut Up!  Shut Up!
                 (gentle, but starting to sweat)
                 ... a community-concious individual, ah, ah ...
                 (rising in crazed anger)
 STERNN!!!                  (pointing as he screams)
                 He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin',
                 back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm!!


STERNN and his lawyer look on, horrified, as FISTE'S body
starts to grow.


 FISTE 
                 Hangin's too good for him!!


New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.


 FISTE 
                 Burnin's too good for him!!


Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 He should be torn into little bitsy
                 pieces and buried alive!!!


FISTE rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering
it completely.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll kill him!


He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards STERNN with
thundering footsteps.


 FISTE 
 KII - ILLL!!! 

Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes
it.  Finally  he stands towering in rage over the terrified
STERNN. 

 STERNN                     (to Fiste)

                 H-h-hey, Hanover ...
                 n-now take it easy, Hanover,
                 I'm sure we can talk this ov ...


Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come
smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood.  The gallery
scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door.  Slavering,
FISTE thunders after him.  STERNN runs through the exit,
bolting the door behind him.  FISTE follows, tearing the
door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in
the process.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian
cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the
rampaging FISTE.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 Halt, clik, in the name of the
                 Federation, clik.  Where is your
                 corridor pass?
                 (to other Regolians)
                 Unco-operative humanoid, clik,
                 blast him.


They open fire, but FISTE is unstoppable.  Still growing,
he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats
them.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 You are now in violation of Code
                 103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 ...
                 unauthorized consumption of Federation
                 property.  Please come quietly, clik,
                 ... thenk yew.


With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the
Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness
of a dime.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler
room, then down a long dark tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel,
STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.


 STERNN 
                 Oh, this looks good.


 FISTE 
                 (growls)


 STERNN 
                 Oh, duck under here ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll get you!!


 STERNN 
                 I think I'll turn here!
                 (runs, gasping)
                 Come on feet, don't fail me now!


 FISTE 
                 Sternn!!!


 STERNN 
                 Uh oh ...
                 (runs)
                 Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!


 FISTE 
 STERNN!! 

 STERNN 
                 Okay, Hanover, you've had this
                 coming!


Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls
out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to
FISTE. 

 STERNN 
                 Let's see, thirty-three, thirty-
                 four, thirty-five thousand zuleks.
                 Thanks Hanover.


 FISTE                     (taking money)

                 S'nothin, boss.


Counting his money, FISTE starts shrinking back to his
normal size.


 STERNN 
                 And Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 Yes?


 STERNN 
                 Goodbye.


STERNN pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below FISTE,
who screams, falling out into space.  As FISTE slides out,
STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
barren desert.  The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
gets louder and louder.  Then, thud!

A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us.  Fluttering down
around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the
burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his
clothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
distance.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA 
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY 
Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA
dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool.  Here she disrobes,
and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil
over herself.  It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle
even brighter.

Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone
wall.  When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal
a gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.

Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,
so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,
as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE
DEFENDER comes into her head.


 TAARAK (V.O.) 
                 To defend - this is the Pact.
                 but when life loses its value,
                 and it taken for nought, then
                 the Pact is ... to avenge!!


Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously
fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body.  Finally
we pull back to see her fully.

Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks
magnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls
out a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,
almost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicing
cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.  As
the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.
Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run
around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.

Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures
tied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the
creature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the
leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
Elder's fingers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE BARROOM 
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as
various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.

Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and
rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his
head, laugh and kick him.


 CUT TO 

THE BARROOM DOOR 
TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.  She sits
down at the bar.

The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and
walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 Hey, look.  A new one.
                 (to Taarna)
                 Where you from, baby?


TAARNA ignores him.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Doesn't talk much, does she ?


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 She doesn't have to talk for what
                 I want to do with her.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S HAND 
It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.

 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARBARIANS 

 BARBARIAN #3 
                 (running his hand across her breastplate)
                 C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 (starting to undo her breastplate)
                 Yeah, let's have a look.


Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes
a step back.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Heey, she's tough.


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 Maybe she wants to fight?


They all laugh.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 ... or maybe she wants to take
                 us all on?


Still laughing, they move towards her.

In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding
it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads.
In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.

The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.

Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender,
pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and
shows it to him.  The bartender looks at it carefully, then
points out the window.


 BARTENDER 
                 Beyond the oasis.


TAARNA nods and leaves.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARTENDER 
His eyes start to turn green.  The camera gets closer and
closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into
the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN 
AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs,
trying to make the ball move.  Nothing happens.


 AUSTIN                     (to himself)

                 Hmmm ... must be jammed.


Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment
underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside.  While
AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on
the holograph screen and pick up the green ball.  AUSTIN looks
over to the holograph and notices.


 AUSTIN 
                 Where'd it go?


 CUT TO 

THE HANDS

As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back
to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses,
carrying the sphere across his backyard.  This is DAN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It all started when I found the green
                 meteorite.  I read in Farraday's "Life
                 of the Planets" that smaller ones like
                 this are supposed to burn up when they
                 enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
                 this one didn't ...


DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.


 DISSOLVE TO 

T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT

As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down
from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic
window.  The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked
up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... so I brought it up to my room,
                 stuck it in my rock collection and
                 forgot about it.  I was experimenting
                 with natural electricity ...


The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects,
transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
organs, and many books.

In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.

At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
of an old scientific journal.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... and with the storm warnings up,
                 I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the
                 jackpot.  All I needed was a little
                 juice.


He looks out the window at the gathering storm.


 CUT TO 

THE STORM 
Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the
television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic.


 CUT TO 

DAN'S ATTIC ROOM 
The lightning flashes into DAN'S apparatus, lighting it up
brightly.


 DAN 
                 It works!


Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water
and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.


 DAN                     (looking at his
                     green arms)

                 Oh Jesus!


The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another
universe and DAN de-materializes.


 CUT TO 

THE TRANSFORMATION 
We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
zoom past.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I felt like I was nothing
                 - just atoms floating in the
                 darkness ...


Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner
of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
around the screen.  Now, we can make out some of the images
whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling
pyramid, a green ball.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Then, a body started to re-form
                 around me.  Only it wasn't my
                 body - this one had muscles.


Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
light.  They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
human figure.

Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything
gets brighter and clearer.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It was a great body, but I
                 wasn't too crazy about the
                 face.


The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins
to look at his hands and arms.  Moving his mouth, he speaks in
a new voice - deep and powerful.


 DEN                     (feeling head)

                 Hmmm ... no hair.


Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
shimmering gateway.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in
the hand of a huge stone idol.  He is naked and unconscious
Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other
hand.

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid.  The deck forms a walkway
around a swirling pool of green water.

Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing
priest's robes.  Two of them stand beside a glass coffin.  Inside
the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged.


 PRIESTS                     (chanting softly)

                 Uluhtec, Ulutec ...


Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking QUEEN, wearing
a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water.


 QUEEN 
                 By the powers of the glowing
                 Loc-Nar placed in your idol's
                 hand, I demand you come forth,
                 Uluhtec!


The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and
a low rumble is heard far below.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S HANDS

The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as DEN opens his eyes,
looks down and notices his enormous genitals.


 DEN 
                 Hmmm ... big!


Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a
piece and wraps it around himself.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was no way I was gonna
                 walk around this place with
                 my dork hangin' out!


Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This looked like something
                 right out of the Ten Commandments.


 CUT TO 

EDGE OF RAGING POOL

The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.


 QUEEN 
                 Grant me your strength in return
                 for a living mortal sacrifice!  It
                 has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec!
                 I demand it!


Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass
case and hold her out over the swirling water.  The QUEEN
nods and the two priests drop her in.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S WATER 
Seeing the girl struggle in the water, DEN'S eyes grow wide.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 What'd they do that for?


He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully
towards the drowning girl.

 CUT TO 
UNDER WATER 
Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl's  bound ankles, hooks them
over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the
underwater wall.  Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
by the current.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I
                 kept thinking I was going to run
                 out of air, but my new body worked
                 great.  I just hoped her body was
                 working as good as mine.


 CUT TO 

EXT. FIELD OF LILIES - DAY 
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of
a beautiful field of lilies.  He pulls her out of the water,
unconscious.  As he unties her, she begins to stir.


 GIRL 
                 Thank you.


She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her
beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 She had the most beautiful eyes.
                 I wanted to make some conversation
                 but I found my new self asking the
                 same old stupid questions.


 DEN 
                 Are you from around here?


 GIRL 
                 Well, you may not believe this, but
                 I'm from another world - from a place
                 called Earth.


 DEN 
                 Earth?  I too am from Earth.
                 How did you get here?


 GIRL 
                 My name is Katherine Wells, and
                 I'm from the British colony of
                 Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff-
                 erence here, but there it was
                 the summer of 1892.  It was
                 evening - I'd gone for a walk on
                 the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
                 fell from the sky.  Following its
                 glow, I came to a shining gate made
                 out of light.  Unable to resist, I
                 stepped through it and awoke in
                 this world.  There I was thin and
                 weakly, fit only to stay indoors.
                 (she stands up)
                 But here, somehow I am stronger,
                 more alive,
                 (she stretches seductively)
                 ... more fully a woman.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 You're not kidding.


 DEN                     (standing)

                 I, too seem better equipped on
                 this world.
                 (he holds out his arm)
                 My arms are more powerful.
                 (strecthes his fingers)
                 Even my fingers seem to hold
                 great strength.


KATHERINE walks up close to DEN, takes his hand and touches
the fingers to her breast.


 KATHERINE 
                 You saved my life.  I have no
                 reward to give you, but if any
                 part of me pleases your senses
                 - I would give it willingly.


She circles her nipple with his baby finger.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This was great!  There was
                 no way I'd get a chick like this
                 back on Earth.  I mean, look at
                 her!!


Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of
flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was only one problem ...


A spiked boot appears in the frame.  The camera pans up to
show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
KATHERINE. 
The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple,
completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.


 DAN (V.O. 
                 I don't know who these jerks
                 were, but they sure picked a
                 bad time to show up ...


The ugly beast-men grab DEN and KATHERINE as we;


 DISSOLVE TO 

ARD'S THRONE ROOM 
The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on DEN as
the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They split us up and took me to
                 this weird castle-type place.
                 I wanted to find out where they'd
                 taken Katherine, but none of these
                 guys seemed to speak English.


In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
with a throne carved into it.  On the throne sits ARD, a
child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.


 ARD 
                 They tell me you are Den of Earth,
                 the one who dared to steal the
                 female sacrifice from the Queen.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy was a shrimp so I figured
                 I'd play it tough.


 DEN 
                 Where is the girl?


 ARD 
                 I am Ard - supreme leader of
                 the revolution and the next
                 ruler of the world.


 DEN                     (tougher)

                 The girl!!


 ARD 
                 Well, aren't we fierce?
                 If you are truly as tough as
                 you seem, then you will serve
                 me well.  But first, a test.
                 Guards!  Castrate him!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved
short-swords.  DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust
and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head,
crushing his skull.

Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist
into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and
sending him flying across the room.

Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun.  The
Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the
creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the
Captain's jaw.

The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy!  I was pretty good at this
                 stuff.


 ARD 
                 Excellent.  You are worthy to
                 serve me.


 DEN                     (aiming machine-gun at him)

                 Give me the girl or die.


 ARD                     (taking it lightly)

                 Well, if I have a choice, I'll
                 take death.


 DEN 
                 So be it.


DEN fires, spraying a row of bullets across ARD'S body.  The
bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is
no blood.  ARD looks up and laughs.


 ARD 
                 Ha ha ha!  You'll have to
                 do better than that.


As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal
themselves over.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I could see why they made this
                 guy their leader.


 ARD                     (standing up)

                 ... but if you're really interested
                 in the girl; I've had her encased in
                 glass.


ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
KATHERINE, unconscious, sealed inside.


 DEN 
                 She's dead.


 ARD 
                 Actually no.  She's sleeping,
                 but only I can awaken her.


 DEN 
                 What do you want of me?


 ARD 
                 I want you to steal the sacred
                 Loc-Nar.


 DEN 
                 What is this Loc-Nar?


 ARD 
                 The Queen's glowing sphere, you
                 fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec
                 can only be performed by the
                 possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.
                 (calling out)
                 Norl!


NORL, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.


 ARD                     (to Den)

                 This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
                 You will go with him to the Queen's
                 castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then
                 I will give you the girl.


 DEN 
                 And if I refuse?


 ARD 
                 If you refuse, you die, she dies,
                 everybody dies.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Sounded reasonable to me.


DEN looks down at KATHERINE'S motionless body.


 DISSOLVE TO 

RIVER BANKS NEAR THE QUEEN'S CASTLE 
In the moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors,
armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's
castle.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We
                 must go underground.


NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy Norl seemed to know what
                 he was doing.  And, for a gorilla,
                 his English wasn't half bad.


DEN and the warriors enter the underground passage.


 CUT TO 

UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel.  They
pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other
side.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 We're underneath the castle moat.


DEN nods.  An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead.
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own
languages.


 DEN                     (to Norl)

                 What are they saying?


 NORL 
                 They talk of the savage beast who
                 prowls these catacombs with a fierce
                 hunger and sharp teeth ...
                 (gestures)
                 six inches long.


A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL.


 NORL 
                 Sorry ...
                 (indicating)
                 ... sixteen inches long.


Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp
teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line.  DEN, NORL,
and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind
them, the monster pulls his victim apart.


 CUT TO 

DOORWAY IN CATACOMBS 
DEN, NORL, and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the
rock wall.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Now we separate.  You and Korg
                 take this door into the Queen's
                 quarters.    The rest of us will
                 move through the walls and enter
                 her chamber from the other side.
                 Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will
                 return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den.


DEN nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as
NORL moves off.


 CUT TO 

DARK ROOM 
DEN and KORG silently enter.  Across the dark room, the
glow of the green ball casts a pale light.


 KORG                     (whispers and points)

                 Loc-Nar.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  It was just like the
                 ball I dug up in my back yard.


They tip-toe towards it.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I
                 had this real funny feeling.  All
                 by themselves, my hands reached
                 forward to touch it.  But the
                 Loc-Nar moved out of the way.
                 Instead, my hands felt something
                 else - warm flesh.  Then the lights
                 came on.


In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful
semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Talk about embarassing!


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Kill them.


The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords.
As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's
face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.

But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall
and heaves a third out the window.  As the QUEEN watches with
glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
powered and held down.  The Captain of the guards places a long
knife against Den's throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Can I slit his throat, your
                 Majesty?


The QUEEN, eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs.


 QUEEN 
                 Yes, slit his throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Thank you, your Majesty.


As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the
QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Stop!  I have, ah, something better
                 in mind.


She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as
the guards grumble to one another.


 GUARD #1 
                 Jeez, not again.


 GUARD #2 
                 This always happens.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Look, she's the Queen.  She
                 can do whatever she wants.


 GUARD #2 
                 Yeah, sure.


 GUARD #1 
                 Sure.


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR 
The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look
in her eye.


 QUEEN 
                 If you please me, I may let
                 you live.


She smiles, and approaches DEN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


 DEN 
                 What must I do?


 QUEEN 
                 Satisfy my appetites.


The QUEEN lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer.
She is naked underneath.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin'
                 and now, twice in one day.  What
                 a place!


 QUEEN 
                 Come with me.


 DEN 
                 Mmmm.


She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the
bed.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE QUEEN'S BED 
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face.  DEN looks
exhausted.  As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber
window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging
muscles.


 QUEEN                     (softly)

                 The rising moon climaxes our
                 love, Den.  Is is a sign, a
                 new beginning.


 DEN 
                 Yes, a sign.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I had no idea what she was
                 talking about.


 QUEEN                     (stroking him)

                 Neverwhere is a troubled land,
                 but together we could calm it.
                 We could rule side by side.
                 Your strength has brought great
                 peace to my restless body.  It
                 could bring great peace to all
                 the troubled people of this land.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I knew I was good, but I didn't know
                 I was that good.


Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing
                 - stolen!


The QUEEN jumps to her feet in a rage and points to DEN.


 QUEEN                     (screaming)

                 Fiend!  You make love to me while
                 your accomplices steal the magic
                 sphere!  Guards!  Take him!


The guards grab DEN as the  QUEEN snatches one of their big
spiked clubs.


 QUEEN                     (to guards)

                 Hold him still!  I will kill
                 him myself!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy, was she pissed off!


Heaving the guards aside, DEN breaks free and jumps out the
chamber window.


 CUT TO 

THE CASTLE WALL 
DEN falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle
moat.


 (CUT TO) 

THE QUEEN 
She is livid.


 QUEEN 
                 Prepare the flying lizards.
                 I want his head!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE CASTLE 
Pulling himself out of the moat, DEN knocks a guard off his
leopard/horse and rides off.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool.  Beside
him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains.  Through the
chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and
terrified.  Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying
torches and spears.

Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.


 ARD 
                 By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
                 placed in your idol's hands, I
                 command you - come forth Uluhtec!


The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn
violently and leap into the air.  A bolt of lightning
crackles in the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated
pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.

As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling
in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.


 DEN                     (to himself)

                 Katherine!


He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night.


 CUT TO 

ANOTHER PART OF THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
The QUEEN, riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit
of DEN.


 SOLDIER                     (pointing)

                 There he is, your Majesty!


 CUT TO 

QUEEN'S P.O.V. 
Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up
the steps of the pyramid.  The camera pans to the green glow
atop the torch-lit pyramid.


 QUEEN (V.O.) 
                 The Loc-Nar!


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN 

 QUEEN                     (shouting to her men)

                 Faster!  To the pyramid!


She whips her lizard harder.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks
stand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out over
the pool.


 ARD 
                 Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.
                 Now, give me your power!
                 (to monks)
                 Throw her in.


Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw
the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and
grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.

The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the
moonlight.


 DEN 
                 Katherine!


 KATHERINE 
                 Den!


 ARD 
                 No!  You'll ruin everything!


ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone
idol's hand.  Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.


 ARD                     (to his guards)

                 Kill them!  Kill them both!


Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the
Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.


 QUEEN 
                 The Loc-Nar is mine!


 ARD                     (struggling)

                 Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!


As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops
pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers.  Thunder roars overhead.


 CUT TO 

DEN 
Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and
grabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all around
him, DEN looks up at the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.


 CUT BACK TO 

DEN 
DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around
the glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks the
other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear
with all his might into the head of the stone idol.

In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,
striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels through
the spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, the
electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.

Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,
then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  The
troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all
that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.


 KATHERINE                     (to Den)

                 Where did they go?


 DEN 
                 They are gone.  That is all
                 that matters.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They probably went back to Earth.
                 Boy, will Mom be surprised.


Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.


 KATHERINE                     (looking down)

                 The Loc-Nar ... you could have the
                 power of Uluhtec.  You could be
                 ruler over all these people.


 DEN                     (looking over the throng)

                 Forget it.


In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up
onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.  The amazed troops
watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.


 CUT TO 

DEN'S FLYING LIZARD 
KATHERINE clings to DEN as they fly.


 KATHERINE 
                 Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar
                 you could have returned to Earth.


 DEN 
                 I like it better here.


The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the
distance.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here,
                 I am DEN.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,
which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  As
we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
ages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves
and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
the ground.

A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.
Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.

Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and
a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the
fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,
when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing
ball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.

Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,
placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the
Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.
As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched
Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.

Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and
clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
village.

A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with
his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself
a drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking
the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.

Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
transforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and
the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
lit village green.

A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
circles the green.

Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-
looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This
is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the
woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and
leaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo
and leans provocatively up against the well.

The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman
and propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We
pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's
body falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,
where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.

As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles
away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes
dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
sky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim
coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on
their way to work.

The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.
Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard
ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
and into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings
the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
load them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now
full of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become
deserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the
weight.

A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
glowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered
over by rubble.

The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
grows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.
As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but
desert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.


 CUT TO 

PEOPLE 
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying
futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by
a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As
he walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot
on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels.

One of the workers finds something.


 WORKER 
                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!


The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
driven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digs
in and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand has
sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.
It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman
plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.

As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,
then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's
entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.

The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.


 DISSOLVE TO 

NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 
The camera comes down from high above the city.  The general
shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get
closer we sense that something is different.  Fires are
burning in various locations below us, and intermittent
gunshots become audible as the narration begins.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre
                 of the world.


Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and
slummier.  We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline.
Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball
in the garbage-filled street.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 ... and now they're talking about
                 letting in low-lifes from other planets,
                 too.


Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down
through the roof of a parked taxicab.  It stops full frame on
the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan across
the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,
July 6, 2031

One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".
The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers
Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".

There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and
his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case
containing the Loc-Nar.

A knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws
down the newspaper.


 YOUNG MAN                     (from outside)

                 You free?


 HARRY 
                 Yeah.  Get in.
 (V.O.)                  My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive
                 a cab.

He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE CAB 
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door.
Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The
vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic
chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE CAB 
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from
his passenger.


 HARRY 
                 Where to, pal?


 YOUNG MAN 
                 The U.N. Building.


 HARRY 
                 The U.N. Building.  What a joke.
                 Used to be a nice place until they
                 turned it into low rent housing.
                 Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live
                 there if you paid me.


He switches on the car radio.  The music plays as Harry's
cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti
-covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a
decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live
Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech
buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office
buildings, garbage everywhere.

Inside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket,
sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield,
and holds the gun to Harry's head.


 YOUNG MAN 
                 Okay sucker, hand over your cash,
                 now!


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 This city is really going to the
                 dogs.


Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch.
A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly
dematerializes.  The gun which he held at Harry's head
falls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it
into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic
guns and weapons.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches
                 me unless I want 'em to.


CUT TO 

EXT. METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT 
The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main
entrance.  The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming
July 8th".

We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing
through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding.
It is the goateed professor from the desert.  His daughter
runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.


GIRL 
Father!


PROFESSOR 
Run!


The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser
guns come out and start firing.  A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK)
bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.


RUDNICK (to henchmen)

He's dead.  Get the girl!


The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as
Harry's cab comes cruising by.  She runs alongside, pounding
on the window.


GIRL (to Harry)

Help me, please!!


A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.
HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves
her in.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Normally my rule is "Don't
get involved", but something
about this dame got to me.


She dives in the back and HARRY floors it.  The cab screams
away as Laser-shots land all around.


GIRL (in shock, breathless)

The Loc-Nar ... they wanted
it ... but my father wouldn't
tell them ... now I'm the only
one ...


CUT TO 

HARRY 
HARRY (interupting)

Relax sister.  There's a cop
station up here.  You can ...


HARRY looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  The girl has fainted.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Just what I needed ... guess
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.


CUT TO 

POLICE STATION 
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows.
A plaque on thr front reads "N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION".

Harry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious
GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.


VOICE (over intercom)

Police.  Whaddya want?


HARRY 
I wanna report a murder.


VOICE (over intercom)

So what else is new?


HARRY 
You gonna let me in or what?


A buzzer sounds and the door slides open.  HARRY carries the
GIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk.  As
he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum
cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.  Piles
of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.


COP #1 
Okay, this guy's clean - next.


HARRY comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl
down in a chair.


DESK SERGEANT (to Harry)

Before you go any further pal, I
gotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A
thousand bucks a day for a full investigation.
Another thousand if the assailant is caught.
Got it?


HARRY 
Yeah thanks ...


He picks up the girl and turns to leave.


HARRY ... for nuthin'!


DESK SERGEANT (shouting after Harry)

You think you can do better?
Join one of the vigilante groups.
There's a list of 'em outside.


CUT TO 

EXT. POLICE STATION 
HARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes out of the police station, as
a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him.  Two cops
emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.


GREEN ALIEN 
I tell you I'm an American citizen.
I just lost my papers.


COP (to himself)

Goddamn illegal aliens.


HARRY heads toward his cab.


HARRY (V.O.) 
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful
girl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin'
but trouble ...


He looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood.  Every doorway
and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking.


HARRY (V.O.) 
... but I didn't feel right just
leaving her for the sickos.  I
dunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental
or something ...


DISSOLVE TO 

INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT 
This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly
coloured molden plastic.  Bowling trophies sit on a shelf
underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock.  The place is a mess.

HARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to "On",
and lays her down on the sofa.  As he takes off his jacket
he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn
in all the right places.  She moans and starts to come to.


GIRL 
Where am I?


HARRY 
My place ...


Walking over to a hi-tech plastic bar, HARRY pushes a button
and a machine pours and mixes a drink.  He hands the GIRL the
glass.  She sits up and drinks.


GIRL (looking at Harry)

They'd have killed me if it
wasn't for you.


HARRY 
What'd they want to snuff you
for?

								July 18, 1980


 
FADE UP ON 
A WHEATFIELD 
A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead
of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar
devices on the roof that rotate constantly.

AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
two large metal boxes.


 CUT TO 

THE ATTIC WINDOW 
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer
down.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE VAN 
AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE HOUSE 
AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all
over the floor.

Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides.

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.
Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
in the back.

As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The
glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it.


 AUSTIN                     (looking at the holograph)

                 Hmmmm ....


He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
adjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark.


 AUSTIN                     (seeing sparks)

                 Uh - oh ....


As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
green planet begins to silently shake.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake.


 CUT BACK TO 

AUSTIN 
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments.


 CUT TO 

A FOREST 
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance.

The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
girl approaches, picking mushrooms.


 CUT TO 

A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET 
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks
at it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.


 CUT TO 

THE GIRL'S BEDROOM 
The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball
begins to glow brightly.

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
ball behind it.

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans
up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
the city gates, rising higher and higher.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high
above the foothills, we begin to come down.

In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points.


 CUT TO 

THE MOUNTAINS 
A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.

As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow
of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a
thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.


 CUT TO 

THE BARBARIAN LEADER 
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him.

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke
and flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught.

As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting
a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city.


 CUT TO 

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle
raging.

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members.


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 They're killing everyone.  We
                 must escape!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 The city is burning!


 COUNCILMAN #4                     (throwing a parchment
                     before the Elder)

                 Even the mountains glow green and an
                 evil slime oozes down!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We
                 must fight!


 ELDER 
                 Silence!


Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown before
him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.


 ELDER 
                 We are not a race of warriors.
                 We are statesmen, and scientists.
                 From our very beginning it was ordained
                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the
                 Defender would aid us in times of need.
                 This was the Pact!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is
                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 Some say that the race is not dead
                 - that one still lives.


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 One?  What good is one?


 ELDER 
                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.


Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears at
the doorway.


 BOY 
                 Elder!  They are at the walls!


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 Well who is this last Defender?
                 How can he be summoned?


 ELDER 
                 It is Taarna, of the blood of
                 Taarak the Defender - the last of
                 the race.  And must be summoned as
                 my forefathers summoned Taarak
                 himself - from within!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 But will this Defender answer?


 ELDER 
                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They
                 must answer.  It is in their blood.


The clattering of armour becomes audible.


 BOY 
                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!


 ELDER                     (calmly to the boy)

                 Bar the door.
                 (to the Councilmen)
                 We will summon the
                 Defender together.


The Councilmen nod.


 ELDER                     (shutting eyes)

                 Taarna ... Taarna ...


As the Councilmen take up the chant;


 CUT TO 

THE DOOR 
As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
the BARBARIAN LEADER.

With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
troops rush in around him.

The chanting continues as we;


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.

Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S FACE 
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind.

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.

Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into
the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.

Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck.


 HUMANOID 
                 I owe you my life.  Let me
                 repay you ...


He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
towards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he
molests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices
inside her, chanting her name.

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.

Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
next to the growling creature.

As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN GRIMALDI 
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows
thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.


 AUSTIN 
                 Dammit!


AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.

The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound
grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
engines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Where the hell are we?


Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND BELOW 
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The
scene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
the bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.

There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
Silhouetted figures rush by.


 CUT TO 

A GUN EMPLACEMENT 
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.


 CUT TO 

CLOSEUP OF A SHELL 
It is thrust into a breech.


 CUT TO 

THE B-17 FORMATION 
As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
aircraft.  In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl".


 CUT TO 

INT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 We're there Stepek, right on
                 target ... Rabual dead ahead!


Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
electric blue flashes.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Gee!  Thanks for telling me,
                 Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up
the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 For Christ sake, hold her steady!


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
light up his turret.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop
                 'em and let's get outta here!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm
                 gonna hit something.
                 (he settles over the bomb sight)
                 Left two degrees ... steady ...
                 steady ...


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
the fuselage interior.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Hey kid, how ya doing back there?


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
the flak puffs behind the tail.


 TAILGUNNER 
                 Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay
                 ... I think.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up, we're almost there.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 C'mon Stepek, there's the
                 whole island of Rabaul down
                 there, you can't miss!


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Screw you ...


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT 
Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
pilot rears back with the blast.  The right windshield is
shattered.


 PILOT 
                 We took a hit ...


The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
straps.  His eyes stare.  Blood runs from under his helmet.
We know he is dead.


 PILOT 
                 Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 We took one back here too.
                 C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER                     (hand on the release button)

                 Steady ... steady ... bombs away!
                 Let's get the hell outta here!


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk
across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
enormous ball of fire.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Yahoo!  Bullseye!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE PACIFIC PEARL 

 PILOT                     (exhilarated)

                 Nice shooting Stepek, how are the
                 rest of you guys?


 FLIGHT ENGINEER (V.O.) 
                 Flight Engineer okay.


 RADIO OPERATOR (V.O.) 
                 Radio okay.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Navigator check.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Belly okay.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Ah ... tail okay ...


There is abrupt silence.


 PILOT 
                 Bellson ... Lewis?


Still silence, no reply from either name.


 PILOT 
                 Kid, check the waist positions, see if
                 they're okay.


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 

 TAILGUNNER 
                 Yeah ... will do, skipper.


TAILGUNNER crosses himself, then exits back into the body of
the machine.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT                     (wearily)

                 Let's go home.


We hear jumbled comments from all positions.  Everyone is
happy.


 CREW (V.O.) 
                 Cheers and whoops.


The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner
reports back.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both
                 dead.


This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
puzzled.


 PILOT 
                 Dammit!


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Well kid, now you got a real
                 bombing mission under your belt.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a
bottle.


 CUT TO 

EXT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
She rejoins the rest of the group.  The formation is not
quite as tight as before.  As the formation flies along,
puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.


 CUT TO 

LOW VIEW OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod.  A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar.  The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past.  We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing.


 CUT TO 

THE NOSE OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously.  From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Sorry about Elkhorn, skip.
                 What happened?

 PILOT 
                 I dunno.  The shell exploded and he
                 collapsed.  I think he took it in
                 the head.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?


 PILOT 
                 He's dead.


 BOMBARDIER                     (sings drunkenly)

                 Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's
                 hole and the woodpecker said God
                 bless my soul; take it out, take it
                 out, take it out, remove it ...


 TAILGUNNER                     (bolder)

                 Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't
                 like my voice?


While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
thickening.  Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small
talk. It's the NAVIGATOR.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Something's wrong!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 
He is frantically tapping the compass.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 You got a problem, Holden?


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Naw, the kid's the one with the
                 problem.  He don't like my voice!


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up Stepek.  What's the
                 problem, Holden?


 NAVIGATOR 
                 I must have a malfunction, my compass
                 says we're heading north!


 CUT TO 

PILOT 
He looks at his compass.


 PILOT 
                 Mine says east.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Hey, can you guys see the rest of the
                 squadron?


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Negative, there's too much cloud.


A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
the plane.


 CUT TO 

THE COCKPIT 
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in
the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly.


 PILOT 
                 What the hell ...


He reaches forward to tap the compass.


 PILOT 
                 Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
                 crazy.  It's spinning like a son of
                 a bitch!


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
                 field or something !!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights.  Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Christ, now they're all doing it!!


 CUT TO 

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL 
All the dials are going haywire.  Above the instrument panel
we see the windshield is spattered with rain.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 You guys quit talking business?
                 I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I
                 put my finger in a woodpecker's ...


 PILOT                     (irritably)

                 Can it Stepek, we got real problems.


Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
in the distance.  It begins to curve toward the aircraft.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET 
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Jesus!  Look at that!!


From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Look at what ... look at what!!?


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's out there, just look at it ...


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For Christ sake, give us a position!


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's about four o'clock, just below
                 ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!


The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine.


 CUT TO 

PILOT'S POV 
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence
about it ... the whole machine shakes.


 PILOT 
                 Damn.


The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
feathering the bad engine.  Suddenly it's too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 We lost the goddamned prop ...
                 Did it do any damage?  Kid, check
                 the tail.


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Come in kid ... kid are you okay?


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Travis; go check the back.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Will do, skipper.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE HATCH 
TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.


 PILOT                     (to himself)

                 Goddamn it, now what?


He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing.  It detaches
one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.  They blow
away in the slipstream.


 PILOT 
                 Gremlins!
                 (rubbing his eyes)
                 Jesus, I must be getting tired.


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton.

TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash,
from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Travis, what's goin' on back there?


 CUT TO 

TRAVIS 
His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet
headphone, we hear his name.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Holden, how far to base?


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
                 I'd guess about two hundred miles.


All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.


 PILOT 
                 For Christ's sake, find us a place I
                 can put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 It's all ocean down there, skip!

 PILOT 
                 Mack, can you get us a radio fix?


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 

 RADIO OPERATOR 
                 Negative skip, too much interference.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.


 PILOT 
                 Shit!  I've gotta put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ...
                 ya wanna snort?


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For God sakes Stepek, shut up!


STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle.  He is lying on
his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft.
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head.  He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head.  He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Oh my God, there's ... there's ...
                 ahh ... keep away ... keep away ...
                 (struggles)
                 ... hey no ... hey somebody ...
                 (screams)


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will
                 you lay off the booze, you've got the
                 D.T.'s ...


STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream, kicking
madly.  We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures.


 CUT BACK TO 

STEPEK 
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out
into the night.


 CUT TO 

THE PLANE 
Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back
large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges
are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window.

Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is scared.


 PILOT 
                 Holden, for God's sake get up
                 here on the double.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 What's the problem, skip?


 PILOT 
                 Just get up here!


The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot.


 NAVIGATOR 
                 What is it, skip?
                 (looking out windows)

 JESUS H. CHRIST! 

 PILOT 
                 Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.


He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping
off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings.
The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists
and then bursts open.  A dozen bat-like creatures swarm in.
The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun
from its rack.  He screams as the creatures attack and shoots
right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright
ruby glow.


 NAVIGATOR                     (struggling)

                 Okay you little bastards ... shit ...
                 (screams)


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 
The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him.
Wreathed in flames, he falls back into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
Creatures swarm all over the plane.  The ball turret falls
off.  A wheel suddenly lowers, then falls off.  A flap flutters
free and blows away.  Oil streams back into the slipstream and
sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the
skeleton framework of the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.  Creatures are now in the cockpit,
plucking out the instruments.  The PILOT reaches to the throttle
only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand.
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels
at the attacking creatures with the other.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
It is now almost a flying skeleton.  For the first time, we
see that it is heading for an island.  A figure detaches itself
from the machine and plummets away.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He falls, terror-stricken, through space.  Finally his chute
opens.  A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand.  He rips
off the glove and throws it and the creature away.


 PILOT 
                 (struggling)
                 Jesus H. Christ!


 CUT TO 

THE ISLAND 
The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces,
then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach,
where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop.  The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming
from what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly
to a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks
around incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable
graveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old
wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans
to the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed
Electra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted
on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".

The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
a pile of scrap.

Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The
metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to
lift it up.

WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally
coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls
back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,
who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
needlenose pliers.


 AUSTIN 
                 Got it.


Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,
he begins to re-solder it in place.  Behind him, a LITTLE
GIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?


 AUSTIN                     (concentrating)

                 Yes dear.  But Daddy's fixing
                 it.  (hums)


 LITTLE GIRL                     (watching)

                 How come it's always breaking?


 AUSTIN 
                 I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 When it's fixed, will you make more
                 funny pictures for me?


 AUSTIN 
                 Honey, why don't you go play with
                 your toys and let Daddy finish his
                 work, okay?  Mmmm ...


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 Okay.


The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine,
as AUSTIN flips a switch.  Once again the glass sphere sparkles
and the holographic screen lights up.  AUSTIN uses a tool to
fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;
the glass gates of Kraan.

As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer
to the holograph screen.


 CUT TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
The Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies
in over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautiful
city lies in ruins.

Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of
smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
town's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard
on the reins, and heads her bird up.

The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
down to the Council Chambers below.

Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In the
center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and
manuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNA
dismounts and starts to look around.  At the head of
the marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,
a roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,
their tops glowing green.

TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she notices
that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Prying
his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion
just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.

Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly
in her hand.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING 
TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys
the city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow
coming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,
pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.


 CUT TO 

GIRL'S BEDROOM 
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From
within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.

TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow
coming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,
sword drawn.

Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the
ball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously
ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through
snake-like fangs.


 WITCH 
                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!
                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon
                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies
                 the end of heaven - the beginning of
                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death
                 in your hands.  For death is upon
                 you.  And as you perish ... so dies
                 your race!


The witch's eyes go green.


 WITCH                     (screaming)

                 Take it !!


She hurls tha ball at TAARNA, who dodges it.  The ball sails
past her, out the window.  Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps
at the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes
stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through
the room.

TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  As
she flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,
rising into the clouds and disappearing.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears
in the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting
closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green
meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.

The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the
hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of
an automobile suspended in the open hatch.

Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from
the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now
that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.

With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and
as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its
free-fall to Earth.

As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays
with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
way, then the other.

Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car
radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles
on one.

With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to
Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts
burning up.

As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his
approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking
Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the
repeated impact.

The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into
high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt
to translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then
he pops his drag chute to help slow down.

TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the
chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.


 CUT TO 

EXT. THE PENTAGON - AERIAL SHOT 
From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters
and T.V. newsmen waiting on the front steps.

The '59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below, and seeing
it, the reporters all start to run over.

The camera zooms down and into the car.  Inside, the driver
reaches over, unplugs a rubber hose, and loosens the two
large hex-nuts which connect him to the car.  As he gets out,
the reporters come running up.


 FEMALE REPORTER                     (to driver)

                 Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were
                 sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do
                 you still say this has nothing to do
                 with the green radiation from space.


The driver walks on without speaking.


 T.V. NEWSMAN                     (walking alongside)

                 Doctor, is it true that the President
                 himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six
                 Project so that you could investigate
                 those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.


He ignores the question, and walks past the guard into the
Pentagon.


 CUT TO 

INT. PENTAGON - MEETING ROOM 
Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of
the Cabinet, and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt.
An argument is in progress as the expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK
enters.  The camera follows him as he sits down next to one
of the Generals.


 FAT POLITICIAN 
                 ... well what I wanna know is,
                 what's the Army doing about this?
                 Hell!  My constiuents are turning
                 green!  They're growing arms on
                 their backs.  There's something or
                 someone up there in space and the
                 voters have a right to know about it!


 GENERAL 
                 Senator, we have no proof that these
                 mutations are the result of interference
                 from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak
                 has just come in, so let's hear what he
                 has to say ... Doctor?


The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.


 DOCTOR 
                 First of all, there is no cause for
                 alarm.  As for the theories of interference
                 by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that
                 we on Earth are the only intelligent,
                 technically advanced civilization present
                 in the universe.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
An enormous round spaceship the size of Pittsburg hovers
overhead.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 

 DOCTOR 
                 ... and whatever is causing these
                 mutations is not from outer space.
                 it's more likely just an isolated
                 biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ...
                 ph ... ph ...


Suddenly the DOCTOR'S head starts to jerk from side to side.
Everyone looks on, not knowing how to react.  As the DOCTOR
begins to move in short bursts, like a broken robot, he
fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
From the bottom of the huge spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and
starts to drill through the roof of the Pentagon.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 
The DOCTOR starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty
secretary.


 DOCTOR 
                 Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...


Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table.


As the DOCTOR struggles with the terrified girl, the camera
pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship
drills through.  Descending upon them, it sucks them up instantly.


 DOCTOR 
                 Aaarrgghh!


 SECRETARY 
                 Eeeeeek!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL ROOM 
A metallic robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of
a large glass receiving jar, as DOCTOR ANRAK comes through
the tube and lands in the jar.  As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet
hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of
small metallic parts.


 ROBOT                     (Mechanical voice)

                 Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed
                 to fix this guy?  He's fucked.


ZEKE and EDSEL, two alien space-pilots, are standing nearby,
at the control console.  They look like big furry orange heads
on stilts, with arms coming out of the sider.


 ZEKE                     (to Edsel)

                 I guess we turned it up a
                 little too high.


 EDSEL                     (to Robot)

                 Sorry, man.


 ROBOT 
                 You're sorry?  What about me?
                 I've gotta put this asshole
                 back together.


Suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands
in the jar.  She's a little mussed up, but okay.


 GLORIA 
                 (gasp)  Where am I?


 ROBOT                     (staring)

                 Hey, who's the chick?


 GLORIA 
                 Well look at my clothes!
                 Who's gonna pay for the dry
                 cleaning?  And where am I?
                 I demand that you return me
                 to my office immediately.


 ROBOT 
                 Too late - molecular instability
                 zone around spacecraft. You cannot
                 leave.


 GLORIA                     (to Zeke)

                 What?!  Is he kidding?


 ZEKE 
                 Uh ...


He looks at the ROBOT, who winks at him.


 ZEKE 
                 ... oh yeah.  Instability zone.
                 You're stuck here.


ZEKE and EDSEL try to keep straight faces.


 GLORIA                     (stunned)

                 But I have to be at my parents
                 for dinner tonight.  And my
                 gynecologist appointment is on
                 Wednesday.


 ROBOT 
                 Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like
                 a drink?
                 (leading her away)
                 You'll feel better after a glass of
                 fresh blo-aak.


They disappear down a corridor.


 GLORIA (V.O.) 
                 Do you have any diet soda?


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 

 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Ah, typical robot.  The first
                 Earth-chick we see in ten years,
                 and he's gotta make a play for her.


EDSEL jams the gearshift into 'D' for Drive, and the ship
lifts away from Earth.


 ZEKE 
                 Hey, do we have any of that
                 Plutonian Nyborg left?


 EDSEL 
                 Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's
                 in the transmitter compartment.


 ZEKE 
                 Uh, thanks man.


ZEKE opens a hatch and pulls out a double-spouted plastic
bag on wheels the size of a steamer-trunk.  It is full of
white powder.


He pours two fifteen-foot lines of powder onto the floor.
Then, he pauses.


 ZEKE                     (surveying the lines)

                 Oh great.  Think this is enough?


 EDSEL                     (thinking)

                 Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.


 ZEKE 
                 Good thinking, man.


As he resumes pouring, ZEKE begins singing to himself in an
alien tongue.  When the lines are poured, they both stand at
the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair
to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads.


 ZEKE & EDSEL 
                 Nose dive!


They both start to criss-cross the room, inhaling the white
powder like vaccuum cleaners.  As they happily snort the
Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and
moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.  Reaching
his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the
head.  Through the shattered metal we can see a green ball,
glowing inside ANRAK'S skullpiece.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - ZEKE AND EDSEL'S P.O.V. 
As the round spaceship moves through space, a group of
asteroids approach and whip past.  Up ahead, a red sun
turns white and goes super-nova.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA PEARLMAN and the ROBOT are lying in bed, naked.
They have just finished making love.  She is smoking a cigarette.


 GLORIA                     (glazed)

                 That was incredible.  I've never felt
                 anything like it.


 ROBOT 
                 Oh great.  I have been programmed to
                 be fully proficient in sexual activities.
                 Do you want to go steady?


 GLORIA 
                 Gee, I don't know.  I already have
                 a boyfriend.


 ROBOT 
                 Ah, what he does not know will not
                 hurt him.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed
out into space.  They are obviously stoned.  Suddenly a bell
rings and the communicator screen lights up.  A serious officer's
face appears on it.


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...


ZEKE looks over at the screen and then shouts into it.


 ZEKE 
                 Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling Starcruiser Alpha ...


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You gotta use the microphone.


 ZEKE 
                 Oh yeah.
                 (shouts into microphone)
                 Whaddyawant man?


 OFFICER 
                 Now listen, idiot.  Do I have to
                 tell you eight hundred times?  You
                 don't call me "man"!  You call me
                 "Com-Op Officer Blix". Now is that
                 perfectly clear?


 ZEKE                     (into mike)

                 Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER                     (disgruntled)

                 You are to return immediately to
                 the Mother Ship and pick up a
                 humanoid civilian.  Your orders
                 are to escort him to the Interplanetary
                 Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify
                 at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make
                 it snappy!


The screen goes blank.


 EDSEL 
                 Wow!  They finally got Sternn.


 ZEKE 
                 It's about time.  Hang on, man.
                 Here we go.


ZEKE jams the gearshift into hyper-drive.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The round spaceship blasts forward at ten times the speed
of light.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - LATER 
ZEKE and EDSEL'S round spacecraft looks like an apple
heading toward a freight train as it approaches the
enormous mother-ship.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL CONSOLE 
An ashtray full of roaches sits on the console.  ZEKE is
at the controls with a joint in his mouth.  He is swaying
back and forth, eyes glazed.  Beside him, EDSEL watches
the mothership getting closer.


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You okay to land this thing?


 ZEKE 
                 No problem, man.


 CUT TO 

MOTHERSHIP'S LANDING AREA 
Huge red arrows point the way through the ten-mile wide
landing area as the round spaceship glides in.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 I think you're goin' a little high,
                 man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 It's okay, man.  If there's one
                 thing I know, it's how to drive
                 when I'm stoned.  It's like, you
                 know your perspective's fucked,
                 so you just gotta let your hands
                 work the controls as if you're
                 straight.


The round ship rams directly into a wall, and crashes down,
skidding to a stop in front of the loading bay.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow, good landing, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Thanks.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - ENTRANCE HATCH 
ZEKE and EDSEL press a button to open the hatch doors.
As the door opens we see two metallic Regolian guards
waiting on the other side.  Between them stands a small,
shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and
cauliflower ears.  This is HANOVER FISTE.


 REGOLIAN GUARD                     (to Zeke and Edsel)

                 This man is to be delivered to the,
                 clik, Interplanetary Tribunal, Courtroom
                 #3, clik, Galaxy versus Lincoln Sternn.
                 Thenk yew.  Clik.


The guards wheel away.


 FISTE                     (meekly)

                 Ah, hello.


 CUT TO 

CORRIDOR IN SPACESHIP 
ZEKE and EDSEL escort FISTE down the corridor.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Umm, you're gonna testify at
                 Sternn's trial?


FISTE nods.


 ZEKE 
                 They gotta give him at least, like,
                 life.


 FISTE 
                 Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable
                 man.
                 (camera pulls close to Fiste's face)
                 He will be freed.


 CUT TO 

SPACE - LATER 
As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through
a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past
a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Y'know, I wish they'd clean this place
                 up, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Yeah.  It's like pig city out here.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Yeah.


 CUT TO 

ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA is getting dressed as the ROBOT re-charges his energy-
paks.


 ROBOT 
                 ... but I don't understand.  We
                 laugh together.  We care for each
                 other.  We have highly proficient
                 sex.  Why can't we get married?


 GLORIA 
                 Look, we're different, okay?  Let's
                 leave it at that.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL ROOM 
The hatch opens, and GLORIA and the ROBOT walk through,
still talking.


 GLORIA 
                 ... but mixed marriages just don't
                 work.  What if you get tired of me
                 and run off with a vibrator or
                 something?


As they move through the room, and out the other side, they
pass FISTE, who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar,
hands folded.  Looking around, FISTE notices a green glow
coming from the bottom of the jar.  He gets up, quietly opens
the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts.

Finding the small green ball in ANRAK'S head, he pulls it
out and looks at it.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, driving carefully.
FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside
them.


 ZEKE 
                 There it is, man.  I'm gonna hang
                 a louie here.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Yeah, well it won't be long now.  Are
                 you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn.


FISTE says nothing.  He just clutches the green ball and stares
into space.

ZEKE and EDSEL look at each other and shrug.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE SPACESHIP 
An enormous, brightly-lit, multi-level space station/courthouse
floats into view, completely filling the screen.  ZEKE and
EDSEL'S round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame,
approaching the mammoth structure.


 CUT TO 

SPACE-STATION LANDING DOCK 
The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL,
and FISTE.


 GLORIA 
                 ... alright, alright.  I'll marry
                 you - but on one condition ... I
                 want a Jewish wedding.


 ROBOT 
                 A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is
                 space.  95% of the population are
                 robots.


 GLORIA 
                 Well, find me a robot-rabbi!


 ROBOT 
                 Okay, okay!


 EDSEL 
                 I give them six months, man.


 ZEKE 
                 He doesn't even look Jewish!


GLORIA and the ROBOT disappear around a corner as ZEKE and EDSEL
escort FISTE through the hatch.  FISTE is carrying the small
green ball.

As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through
a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly
rotating space-station.  At the top, the camera zooms down
through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge
inter-galactic courtroom.

Voices echo below us.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?


 STERNN 
                 I am.


As we move down, we see square-jawed CAPTAIN STERNN, his
shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing
before the Judge.

STERNN is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from
a long page of charges.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Lincoln Sternn - you stand here
                 accused of twelve counts of murder
                 in the first degree  ... fourteen
                 counts of armed theft of Federation
                 property ...


 CUT TO 

THE GALLERY 
The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at STERNN with
hateful, accusing eyes.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... twenty-two counts of piracy
                 in high space ... eighteen counts of
                 fraud ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN'S LAWYER 
Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to STERNN.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... thirty-seven counts of rape, and
                 one moving violation.  How do you plead?


 CUT TO 

CAPTAIN STERNN 
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.


 STERNN 
                 Not guilty!


 LAWYER                     (whispers to Sternn)

                 Not guilty?!?  Are you nuts?!?


 STERNN                     (whispers to lawyer)

                 It's okay, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


 JUDGE                     (to Prosecutor)

                 Call the first witness!


STERNN and his lawyer move to their seats.


 LAWYER                     (to Sternn)

                 But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold!
                 Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish
                 bowl.


 CUT TO 

THE COURTROOM DOORS 
ZEKE and EDSEL enter with FISTE, and push their way to the
front.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.


 GUARD #1 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #2 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #3 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #4 
                 Hanover Fiste!


ZEKE and EDSEL sit down, while HANOVER FISTE, small and
shabby, walks up to the witness stand, nervously clutching
the small green ball in his hand.  As he passes, STERNN and
his lawyer continue to argue.


 LAWYER                     (pleading)

                 Lissen Sternn ... change the plea
                 to guilty.  Throw yerself on the
                 mercy of the court.


 STERNN 
                 I told you, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


HANOVER FISTE is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs.


 LAWYER 
                 But the most we can hope for is to
                 get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave
                 don't get violated!  Plead guilty!


 STERNN 
                 Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle.


 LAWYER 
                 What angle?


 STERNN                     (pointing to Fiste)

                 Him!


 CUT TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 State your name for the record.


 FISTE                     (fidgeting nervously with
                     the green ball)

                 I am Hanover Fiste.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 

 STERNN                     (winking to lawyer)

                 I promised him thirty-five thousand
                 zuleks to testify on my behalf.


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 You know the defendant,
                 (pointing)
                 Captain Sternn?


 FISTE 
                 Yes, I know Captain Sternn.  And
                 never did there live a kinder, more
                 generous man.  He is an overflowing
                 cup, filled with the very cream of
                 human goodness ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 

 STERNN                     (to lawyer)

                 See?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE 
                 ... in all the time I've known him,
                 he's never done anything immoral ...
                 (thinking)
                 unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's
                 Prostitute ring ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 
They look at each other, shocked.


 STERNN & LAWYER 
                 Huh?!?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE                     (speaking gently)

                 ... and he's ah, never done anything
                 illegal ...
                 (turning sharply)
                 ... unless you count all the times
                 he sold dope disguised as a nun!!
                 (reverting to meekness)
                 He's always been a good, law-abiding
                 citizen ...
                 (shouting at himself)
                 Awww, gimme a break!!
                 (gentle again)
                 ... of the Federation, and, and ...
                 (going schizo)
                 Shut Up!  Shut Up!  Shut Up!
                 (gentle, but starting to sweat)
                 ... a community-concious individual, ah, ah ...
                 (rising in crazed anger)
 STERNN!!!                  (pointing as he screams)
                 He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin',
                 back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm!!


STERNN and his lawyer look on, horrified, as FISTE'S body
starts to grow.


 FISTE 
                 Hangin's too good for him!!


New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.


 FISTE 
                 Burnin's too good for him!!


Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 He should be torn into little bitsy
                 pieces and buried alive!!!


FISTE rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering
it completely.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll kill him!


He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards STERNN with
thundering footsteps.


 FISTE 
 KII - ILLL!!! 

Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes
it.  Finally  he stands towering in rage over the terrified
STERNN. 

 STERNN                     (to Fiste)

                 H-h-hey, Hanover ...
                 n-now take it easy, Hanover,
                 I'm sure we can talk this ov ...


Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come
smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood.  The gallery
scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door.  Slavering,
FISTE thunders after him.  STERNN runs through the exit,
bolting the door behind him.  FISTE follows, tearing the
door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in
the process.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian
cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the
rampaging FISTE.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 Halt, clik, in the name of the
                 Federation, clik.  Where is your
                 corridor pass?
                 (to other Regolians)
                 Unco-operative humanoid, clik,
                 blast him.


They open fire, but FISTE is unstoppable.  Still growing,
he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats
them.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 You are now in violation of Code
                 103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 ...
                 unauthorized consumption of Federation
                 property.  Please come quietly, clik,
                 ... thenk yew.


With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the
Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness
of a dime.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler
room, then down a long dark tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel,
STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.


 STERNN 
                 Oh, this looks good.


 FISTE 
                 (growls)


 STERNN 
                 Oh, duck under here ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll get you!!


 STERNN 
                 I think I'll turn here!
                 (runs, gasping)
                 Come on feet, don't fail me now!


 FISTE 
                 Sternn!!!


 STERNN 
                 Uh oh ...
                 (runs)
                 Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!


 FISTE 
 STERNN!! 

 STERNN 
                 Okay, Hanover, you've had this
                 coming!


Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls
out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to
FISTE. 

 STERNN 
                 Let's see, thirty-three, thirty-
                 four, thirty-five thousand zuleks.
                 Thanks Hanover.


 FISTE                     (taking money)

                 S'nothin, boss.


Counting his money, FISTE starts shrinking back to his
normal size.


 STERNN 
                 And Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 Yes?


 STERNN 
                 Goodbye.


STERNN pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below FISTE,
who screams, falling out into space.  As FISTE slides out,
STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
barren desert.  The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
gets louder and louder.  Then, thud!

A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us.  Fluttering down
around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the
burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his
clothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
distance.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA 
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY 
Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA
dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool.  Here she disrobes,
and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil
over herself.  It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle
even brighter.

Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone
wall.  When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal
a gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.

Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,
so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,
as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE
DEFENDER comes into her head.


 TAARAK (V.O.) 
                 To defend - this is the Pact.
                 but when life loses its value,
                 and it taken for nought, then
                 the Pact is ... to avenge!!


Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously
fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body.  Finally
we pull back to see her fully.

Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks
magnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls
out a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,
almost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicing
cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.  As
the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.
Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run
around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.

Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures
tied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the
creature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the
leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
Elder's fingers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE BARROOM 
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as
various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.

Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and
rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his
head, laugh and kick him.


 CUT TO 

THE BARROOM DOOR 
TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.  She sits
down at the bar.

The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and
walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 Hey, look.  A new one.
                 (to Taarna)
                 Where you from, baby?


TAARNA ignores him.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Doesn't talk much, does she ?


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 She doesn't have to talk for what
                 I want to do with her.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S HAND 
It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.

 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARBARIANS 

 BARBARIAN #3 
                 (running his hand across her breastplate)
                 C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 (starting to undo her breastplate)
                 Yeah, let's have a look.


Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes
a step back.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Heey, she's tough.


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 Maybe she wants to fight?


They all laugh.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 ... or maybe she wants to take
                 us all on?


Still laughing, they move towards her.

In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding
it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads.
In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.

The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.

Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender,
pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and
shows it to him.  The bartender looks at it carefully, then
points out the window.


 BARTENDER 
                 Beyond the oasis.


TAARNA nods and leaves.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARTENDER 
His eyes start to turn green.  The camera gets closer and
closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into
the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN 
AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs,
trying to make the ball move.  Nothing happens.


 AUSTIN                     (to himself)

                 Hmmm ... must be jammed.


Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment
underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside.  While
AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on
the holograph screen and pick up the green ball.  AUSTIN looks
over to the holograph and notices.


 AUSTIN 
                 Where'd it go?


 CUT TO 

THE HANDS

As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back
to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses,
carrying the sphere across his backyard.  This is DAN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It all started when I found the green
                 meteorite.  I read in Farraday's "Life
                 of the Planets" that smaller ones like
                 this are supposed to burn up when they
                 enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
                 this one didn't ...


DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.


 DISSOLVE TO 

T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT

As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down
from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic
window.  The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked
up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... so I brought it up to my room,
                 stuck it in my rock collection and
                 forgot about it.  I was experimenting
                 with natural electricity ...


The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects,
transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
organs, and many books.

In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.

At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
of an old scientific journal.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... and with the storm warnings up,
                 I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the
                 jackpot.  All I needed was a little
                 juice.


He looks out the window at the gathering storm.


 CUT TO 

THE STORM 
Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the
television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic.


 CUT TO 

DAN'S ATTIC ROOM 
The lightning flashes into DAN'S apparatus, lighting it up
brightly.


 DAN 
                 It works!


Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water
and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.


 DAN                     (looking at his
                     green arms)

                 Oh Jesus!


The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another
universe and DAN de-materializes.


 CUT TO 

THE TRANSFORMATION 
We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
zoom past.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I felt like I was nothing
                 - just atoms floating in the
                 darkness ...


Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner
of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
around the screen.  Now, we can make out some of the images
whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling
pyramid, a green ball.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Then, a body started to re-form
                 around me.  Only it wasn't my
                 body - this one had muscles.


Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
light.  They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
human figure.

Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything
gets brighter and clearer.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It was a great body, but I
                 wasn't too crazy about the
                 face.


The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins
to look at his hands and arms.  Moving his mouth, he speaks in
a new voice - deep and powerful.


 DEN                     (feeling head)

                 Hmmm ... no hair.


Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
shimmering gateway.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in
the hand of a huge stone idol.  He is naked and unconscious
Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other
hand.

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid.  The deck forms a walkway
around a swirling pool of green water.

Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing
priest's robes.  Two of them stand beside a glass coffin.  Inside
the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged.


 PRIESTS                     (chanting softly)

                 Uluhtec, Ulutec ...


Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking QUEEN, wearing
a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water.


 QUEEN 
                 By the powers of the glowing
                 Loc-Nar placed in your idol's
                 hand, I demand you come forth,
                 Uluhtec!


The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and
a low rumble is heard far below.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S HANDS

The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as DEN opens his eyes,
looks down and notices his enormous genitals.


 DEN 
                 Hmmm ... big!


Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a
piece and wraps it around himself.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was no way I was gonna
                 walk around this place with
                 my dork hangin' out!


Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This looked like something
                 right out of the Ten Commandments.


 CUT TO 

EDGE OF RAGING POOL

The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.


 QUEEN 
                 Grant me your strength in return
                 for a living mortal sacrifice!  It
                 has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec!
                 I demand it!


Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass
case and hold her out over the swirling water.  The QUEEN
nods and the two priests drop her in.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S WATER 
Seeing the girl struggle in the water, DEN'S eyes grow wide.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 What'd they do that for?


He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully
towards the drowning girl.

 CUT TO 
UNDER WATER 
Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl's  bound ankles, hooks them
over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the
underwater wall.  Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
by the current.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I
                 kept thinking I was going to run
                 out of air, but my new body worked
                 great.  I just hoped her body was
                 working as good as mine.


 CUT TO 

EXT. FIELD OF LILIES - DAY 
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of
a beautiful field of lilies.  He pulls her out of the water,
unconscious.  As he unties her, she begins to stir.


 GIRL 
                 Thank you.


She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her
beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 She had the most beautiful eyes.
                 I wanted to make some conversation
                 but I found my new self asking the
                 same old stupid questions.


 DEN 
                 Are you from around here?


 GIRL 
                 Well, you may not believe this, but
                 I'm from another world - from a place
                 called Earth.


 DEN 
                 Earth?  I too am from Earth.
                 How did you get here?


 GIRL 
                 My name is Katherine Wells, and
                 I'm from the British colony of
                 Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff-
                 erence here, but there it was
                 the summer of 1892.  It was
                 evening - I'd gone for a walk on
                 the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
                 fell from the sky.  Following its
                 glow, I came to a shining gate made
                 out of light.  Unable to resist, I
                 stepped through it and awoke in
                 this world.  There I was thin and
                 weakly, fit only to stay indoors.
                 (she stands up)
                 But here, somehow I am stronger,
                 more alive,
                 (she stretches seductively)
                 ... more fully a woman.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 You're not kidding.


 DEN                     (standing)

                 I, too seem better equipped on
                 this world.
                 (he holds out his arm)
                 My arms are more powerful.
                 (strecthes his fingers)
                 Even my fingers seem to hold
                 great strength.


KATHERINE walks up close to DEN, takes his hand and touches
the fingers to her breast.


 KATHERINE 
                 You saved my life.  I have no
                 reward to give you, but if any
                 part of me pleases your senses
                 - I would give it willingly.


She circles her nipple with his baby finger.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This was great!  There was
                 no way I'd get a chick like this
                 back on Earth.  I mean, look at
                 her!!


Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of
flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was only one problem ...


A spiked boot appears in the frame.  The camera pans up to
show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
KATHERINE. 
The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple,
completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.


 DAN (V.O. 
                 I don't know who these jerks
                 were, but they sure picked a
                 bad time to show up ...


The ugly beast-men grab DEN and KATHERINE as we;


 DISSOLVE TO 

ARD'S THRONE ROOM 
The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on DEN as
the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They split us up and took me to
                 this weird castle-type place.
                 I wanted to find out where they'd
                 taken Katherine, but none of these
                 guys seemed to speak English.


In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
with a throne carved into it.  On the throne sits ARD, a
child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.


 ARD 
                 They tell me you are Den of Earth,
                 the one who dared to steal the
                 female sacrifice from the Queen.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy was a shrimp so I figured
                 I'd play it tough.


 DEN 
                 Where is the girl?


 ARD 
                 I am Ard - supreme leader of
                 the revolution and the next
                 ruler of the world.


 DEN                     (tougher)

                 The girl!!


 ARD 
                 Well, aren't we fierce?
                 If you are truly as tough as
                 you seem, then you will serve
                 me well.  But first, a test.
                 Guards!  Castrate him!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved
short-swords.  DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust
and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head,
crushing his skull.

Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist
into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and
sending him flying across the room.

Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun.  The
Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the
creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the
Captain's jaw.

The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy!  I was pretty good at this
                 stuff.


 ARD 
                 Excellent.  You are worthy to
                 serve me.


 DEN                     (aiming machine-gun at him)

                 Give me the girl or die.


 ARD                     (taking it lightly)

                 Well, if I have a choice, I'll
                 take death.


 DEN 
                 So be it.


DEN fires, spraying a row of bullets across ARD'S body.  The
bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is
no blood.  ARD looks up and laughs.


 ARD 
                 Ha ha ha!  You'll have to
                 do better than that.


As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal
themselves over.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I could see why they made this
                 guy their leader.


 ARD                     (standing up)

                 ... but if you're really interested
                 in the girl; I've had her encased in
                 glass.


ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
KATHERINE, unconscious, sealed inside.


 DEN 
                 She's dead.


 ARD 
                 Actually no.  She's sleeping,
                 but only I can awaken her.


 DEN 
                 What do you want of me?


 ARD 
                 I want you to steal the sacred
                 Loc-Nar.


 DEN 
                 What is this Loc-Nar?


 ARD 
                 The Queen's glowing sphere, you
                 fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec
                 can only be performed by the
                 possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.
                 (calling out)
                 Norl!


NORL, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.


 ARD                     (to Den)

                 This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
                 You will go with him to the Queen's
                 castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then
                 I will give you the girl.


 DEN 
                 And if I refuse?


 ARD 
                 If you refuse, you die, she dies,
                 everybody dies.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Sounded reasonable to me.


DEN looks down at KATHERINE'S motionless body.


 DISSOLVE TO 

RIVER BANKS NEAR THE QUEEN'S CASTLE 
In the moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors,
armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's
castle.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We
                 must go underground.


NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy Norl seemed to know what
                 he was doing.  And, for a gorilla,
                 his English wasn't half bad.


DEN and the warriors enter the underground passage.


 CUT TO 

UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel.  They
pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other
side.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 We're underneath the castle moat.


DEN nods.  An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead.
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own
languages.


 DEN                     (to Norl)

                 What are they saying?


 NORL 
                 They talk of the savage beast who
                 prowls these catacombs with a fierce
                 hunger and sharp teeth ...
                 (gestures)
                 six inches long.


A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL.


 NORL 
                 Sorry ...
                 (indicating)
                 ... sixteen inches long.


Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp
teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line.  DEN, NORL,
and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind
them, the monster pulls his victim apart.


 CUT TO 

DOORWAY IN CATACOMBS 
DEN, NORL, and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the
rock wall.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Now we separate.  You and Korg
                 take this door into the Queen's
                 quarters.    The rest of us will
                 move through the walls and enter
                 her chamber from the other side.
                 Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will
                 return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den.


DEN nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as
NORL moves off.


 CUT TO 

DARK ROOM 
DEN and KORG silently enter.  Across the dark room, the
glow of the green ball casts a pale light.


 KORG                     (whispers and points)

                 Loc-Nar.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  It was just like the
                 ball I dug up in my back yard.


They tip-toe towards it.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I
                 had this real funny feeling.  All
                 by themselves, my hands reached
                 forward to touch it.  But the
                 Loc-Nar moved out of the way.
                 Instead, my hands felt something
                 else - warm flesh.  Then the lights
                 came on.


In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful
semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Talk about embarassing!


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Kill them.


The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords.
As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's
face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.

But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall
and heaves a third out the window.  As the QUEEN watches with
glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
powered and held down.  The Captain of the guards places a long
knife against Den's throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Can I slit his throat, your
                 Majesty?


The QUEEN, eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs.


 QUEEN 
                 Yes, slit his throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Thank you, your Majesty.


As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the
QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Stop!  I have, ah, something better
                 in mind.


She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as
the guards grumble to one another.


 GUARD #1 
                 Jeez, not again.


 GUARD #2 
                 This always happens.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Look, she's the Queen.  She
                 can do whatever she wants.


 GUARD #2 
                 Yeah, sure.


 GUARD #1 
                 Sure.


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR 
The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look
in her eye.


 QUEEN 
                 If you please me, I may let
                 you live.


She smiles, and approaches DEN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


 DEN 
                 What must I do?


 QUEEN 
                 Satisfy my appetites.


The QUEEN lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer.
She is naked underneath.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin'
                 and now, twice in one day.  What
                 a place!


 QUEEN 
                 Come with me.


 DEN 
                 Mmmm.


She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the
bed.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE QUEEN'S BED 
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face.  DEN looks
exhausted.  As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber
window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging
muscles.


 QUEEN                     (softly)

                 The rising moon climaxes our
                 love, Den.  Is is a sign, a
                 new beginning.


 DEN 
                 Yes, a sign.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I had no idea what she was
                 talking about.


 QUEEN                     (stroking him)

                 Neverwhere is a troubled land,
                 but together we could calm it.
                 We could rule side by side.
                 Your strength has brought great
                 peace to my restless body.  It
                 could bring great peace to all
                 the troubled people of this land.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I knew I was good, but I didn't know
                 I was that good.


Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing
                 - stolen!


The QUEEN jumps to her feet in a rage and points to DEN.


 QUEEN                     (screaming)

                 Fiend!  You make love to me while
                 your accomplices steal the magic
                 sphere!  Guards!  Take him!


The guards grab DEN as the  QUEEN snatches one of their big
spiked clubs.


 QUEEN                     (to guards)

                 Hold him still!  I will kill
                 him myself!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy, was she pissed off!


Heaving the guards aside, DEN breaks free and jumps out the
chamber window.


 CUT TO 

THE CASTLE WALL 
DEN falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle
moat.


 (CUT TO) 

THE QUEEN 
She is livid.


 QUEEN 
                 Prepare the flying lizards.
                 I want his head!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE CASTLE 
Pulling himself out of the moat, DEN knocks a guard off his
leopard/horse and rides off.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool.  Beside
him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains.  Through the
chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and
terrified.  Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying
torches and spears.

Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.


 ARD 
                 By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
                 placed in your idol's hands, I
                 command you - come forth Uluhtec!


The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn
violently and leap into the air.  A bolt of lightning
crackles in the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated
pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.

As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling
in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.


 DEN                     (to himself)

                 Katherine!


He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night.


 CUT TO 

ANOTHER PART OF THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
The QUEEN, riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit
of DEN.


 SOLDIER                     (pointing)

                 There he is, your Majesty!


 CUT TO 

QUEEN'S P.O.V. 
Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up
the steps of the pyramid.  The camera pans to the green glow
atop the torch-lit pyramid.


 QUEEN (V.O.) 
                 The Loc-Nar!


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN 

 QUEEN                     (shouting to her men)

                 Faster!  To the pyramid!


She whips her lizard harder.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks
stand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out over
the pool.


 ARD 
                 Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.
                 Now, give me your power!
                 (to monks)
                 Throw her in.


Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw
the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and
grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.

The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the
moonlight.


 DEN 
                 Katherine!


 KATHERINE 
                 Den!


 ARD 
                 No!  You'll ruin everything!


ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone
idol's hand.  Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.


 ARD                     (to his guards)

                 Kill them!  Kill them both!


Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the
Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.


 QUEEN 
                 The Loc-Nar is mine!


 ARD                     (struggling)

                 Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!


As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops
pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers.  Thunder roars overhead.


 CUT TO 

DEN 
Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and
grabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all around
him, DEN looks up at the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.


 CUT BACK TO 

DEN 
DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around
the glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks the
other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear
with all his might into the head of the stone idol.

In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,
striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels through
the spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, the
electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.

Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,
then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  The
troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all
that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.


 KATHERINE                     (to Den)

                 Where did they go?


 DEN 
                 They are gone.  That is all
                 that matters.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They probably went back to Earth.
                 Boy, will Mom be surprised.


Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.


 KATHERINE                     (looking down)

                 The Loc-Nar ... you could have the
                 power of Uluhtec.  You could be
                 ruler over all these people.


 DEN                     (looking over the throng)

                 Forget it.


In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up
onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.  The amazed troops
watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.


 CUT TO 

DEN'S FLYING LIZARD 
KATHERINE clings to DEN as they fly.


 KATHERINE 
                 Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar
                 you could have returned to Earth.


 DEN 
                 I like it better here.


The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the
distance.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here,
                 I am DEN.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,
which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  As
we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
ages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves
and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
the ground.

A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.
Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.

Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and
a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the
fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,
when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing
ball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.

Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,
placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the
Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.
As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched
Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.

Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and
clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
village.

A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with
his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself
a drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking
the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.

Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
transforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and
the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
lit village green.

A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
circles the green.

Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-
looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This
is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the
woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and
leaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo
and leans provocatively up against the well.

The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman
and propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We
pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's
body falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,
where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.

As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles
away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes
dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
sky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim
coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on
their way to work.

The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.
Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard
ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
and into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings
the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
load them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now
full of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become
deserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the
weight.

A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
glowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered
over by rubble.

The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
grows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.
As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but
desert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.


 CUT TO 

PEOPLE 
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying
futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by
a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As
he walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot
on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels.

One of the workers finds something.


 WORKER 
                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!


The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
driven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digs
in and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand has
sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.
It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman
plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.

As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,
then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's
entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.

The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.


 DISSOLVE TO 

NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 
The camera comes down from high above the city.  The general
shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get
closer we sense that something is different.  Fires are
burning in various locations below us, and intermittent
gunshots become audible as the narration begins.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre
                 of the world.


Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and
slummier.  We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline.
Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball
in the garbage-filled street.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 ... and now they're talking about
                 letting in low-lifes from other planets,
                 too.


Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down
through the roof of a parked taxicab.  It stops full frame on
the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan across
the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,
July 6, 2031

One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".
The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers
Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".

There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and
his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case
containing the Loc-Nar.

A knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws
down the newspaper.


 YOUNG MAN                     (from outside)

                 You free?


 HARRY 
                 Yeah.  Get in.
 (V.O.)                  My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive
                 a cab.

He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE CAB 
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door.
Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The
vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic
chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE CAB 
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from
his passenger.


 HARRY 
                 Where to, pal?


 YOUNG MAN 
                 The U.N. Building.


 HARRY 
                 The U.N. Building.  What a joke.
                 Used to be a nice place until they
                 turned it into low rent housing.
                 Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live
                 there if you paid me.


He switches on the car radio.  The music plays as Harry's
cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti
-covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a
decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live
Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech
buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office
buildings, garbage everywhere.

Inside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket,
sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield,
and holds the gun to Harry's head.


 YOUNG MAN 
                 Okay sucker, hand over your cash,
                 now!


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 This city is really going to the
                 dogs.


Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch.
A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly
dematerializes.  The gun which he held at Harry's head
falls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it
into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic
guns and weapons.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches
                 me unless I want 'em to.


CUT TO 

EXT. METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT 
The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main
entrance.  The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming
July 8th".

We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing
through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding.
It is the goateed professor from the desert.  His daughter
runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.


GIRL 
Father!


PROFESSOR 
Run!


The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser
guns come out and start firing.  A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK)
bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.


RUDNICK (to henchmen)

He's dead.  Get the girl!


The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as
Harry's cab comes cruising by.  She runs alongside, pounding
on the window.


GIRL (to Harry)

Help me, please!!


A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.
HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves
her in.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Normally my rule is "Don't
get involved", but something
about this dame got to me.


She dives in the back and HARRY floors it.  The cab screams
away as Laser-shots land all around.


GIRL (in shock, breathless)

The Loc-Nar ... they wanted
it ... but my father wouldn't
tell them ... now I'm the only
one ...


CUT TO 

HARRY 
HARRY (interupting)

Relax sister.  There's a cop
station up here.  You can ...


HARRY looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  The girl has fainted.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Just what I needed ... guess
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.


CUT TO 

POLICE STATION 
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows.
A plaque on thr front reads "N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION".

Harry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious
GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.


VOICE (over intercom)

Police.  Whaddya want?


HARRY 
I wanna report a murder.


VOICE (over intercom)

So what else is new?


HARRY 
You gonna let me in or what?


A buzzer sounds and the door slides open.  HARRY carries the
GIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk.  As
he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum
cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.  Piles
of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.


COP #1 
Okay, this guy's clean - next.


HARRY comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl
down in a chair.


DESK SERGEANT (to Harry)

Before you go any further pal, I
gotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A
thousand bucks a day for a full investigation.
Another thousand if the assailant is caught.
Got it?


HARRY 
Yeah thanks ...


He picks up the girl and turns to leave.


HARRY ... for nuthin'!


DESK SERGEANT (shouting after Harry)

You think you can do better?
Join one of the vigilante groups.
There's a list of 'em outside.


CUT TO 

EXT. POLICE STATION 
HARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes out of the police station, as
a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him.  Two cops
emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.


GREEN ALIEN 
I tell you I'm an American citizen.
I just lost my papers.


COP (to himself)

Goddamn illegal aliens.


HARRY heads toward his cab.


HARRY (V.O.) 
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful
girl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin'
but trouble ...


He looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood.  Every doorway
and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking.


HARRY (V.O.) 
... but I didn't feel right just
leaving her for the sickos.  I
dunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental
or something ...


DISSOLVE TO 

INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT 
This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly
coloured molden plastic.  Bowling trophies sit on a shelf
underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock.  The place is a mess.

HARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to "On",
and lays her down on the sofa.  As he takes off his jacket
he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn
in all the right places.  She moans and starts to come to.


GIRL 
Where am I?


HARRY 
My place ...


Walking over to a hi-tech plastic bar, HARRY pushes a button
and a machine pours and mixes a drink.  He hands the GIRL the
glass.  She sits up and drinks.


GIRL (looking at Harry)

They'd have killed me if it
wasn't for you.


HARRY 
What'd they want to snuff you
for?

               INT. DARKROOM - INTERVIEW 1

               In a photographic DARKROOM: old optical enlargers, porcelain 
               trays, timers, and stills hanging out to dry.

               GEORGE MATLIN, a slightly obese, nearsighted man in his 
               seventies.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         Is he real? Oh yeah -- Absolutely.

               Super: CPL. GEORGE MATLIN, combat photographer.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         I haven't talked about it for years, 
                         you know?
                              (looks at the camera)
                         Everyone called me crazy...

               Matlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         But I have the negative.

               Someone turns on the darkroom's red safety light for an eerie, 
               dramatic effect.

                                     TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
                         Get ready, 3-2-1... Roll tape.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         It all started back in ´44. I was a 
                         Corps photographer aboard an allied 
                         submarine...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUBMARINE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               YOUNG MATLIN's hands again paw through a bunch of negatives, 
               again under a red light. Now, at 21, he's wedged in a 
               submarine corridor, a crowded maze of pipes and gauges.

               35mm still cameras dangle from his neck. He shrinks back as 
               a squad of MARINES hustles past him, loading weapons.

                                     OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
                         ...off the coast of Scotland. 
                         Classified mission. I was 21...

               SGT. WHITMAN, 44, tough as nails, pushes through, his uniform 
               soaked in sweat.

                                     OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
                         We had an English civilian on board. 
                         Not much older than me but already 
                         an advisor to President Roosevelt. 
                         "Paranormal" advisor, I kid you not --

               Whitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a 
               small...

               INT. SUBMARINE STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Within, an incongruously proper young Englishman "reading" 
               an ancient set of Tarot cards.

                                     OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
                         His name was Trevor. Profesor Trevor --

                         -- Broom! Topside, now.

               TREVOR "BROOM" BRUTTENHOLM is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in 
               his late twenties. In his hands, a tarot deck. He turns the 
               cards face up: THE FOOL, THE MOON...

                                     WHITMAN
                         The sooner we're done, the better.

               Broom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets. 
               It has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much 
               like a carpenter's tool box.

                                     BROOM
                         This is an important mission, Sgt. 
                         Whitman. I hope you realize that.

                                     WHITMAN
                         Oh -- you don't wanna know what I 
                         think. Topside, now.

               He moves away. Broom takes a small box and a few amulets.

               Before exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last TAROT 
               CARD: THE DEVIL.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Super: OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND.

               It's raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short 
               tunnel carved into the mountain.

               Whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside 
               Broom.

                                     BROOM
                         Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I 
                         have a word??

                                     WHITMAN
                              (impatient)
                         What is it?

                         In private, if you don't mind...

               EXT. SCOTLAND CHAPEL REMAINS

               They enter the remains of a small chapel. Broom produces the 
               small box. It's full of rosaries.

                                     BROOM
                         Your men -- They'll need these --

               Whitman scowls and huffs. A life-sized wooden Christ 
               contemplates the scene from above.

                                     WHITMAN
                         You are a Catholic??

                                     BROOM
                         Amongst other things, yes -- but 
                         that's hardly the point.

               Whitman locks and loads an automatic.

                                     WHITMAN
                         Here. You'll need one of these.

                                     BROOM
                         I abhor violence.
                              (Whitman moves away)
                         Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't 
                         think me mad --

                                     WHITMAN
                         Three days too late for that one, 
                         "professor."

               He moves away. Broom looks up to the wooden Christ: It has 
               no eyes.

               EXT. DITCH

               MATLIN hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the 
               move. Broom catches up with Whitman.

                                     WHITMAN
                         You're wasting our time: There's 
                         nothing on this island but sheep and 
                         rocks.

                         Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of 
                         Trondham Abbey. Built on an 
                         intersection of Ley Lines, the 
                         boundaries between our world and the

                         What a load of crap. Hell, a week 
                         ago I hadn't even heard the word

                         Half transmission. Nonsense -- German 
                         ghost stories!

                         I have seen ghosts, Whitman.

                         Oh, I'll bet you have.

               Reaching a slope, Matlin sets down his camera. Turning, he 
               sees lights.

                                     MATLIN
                         Sweet Jesus.

               Drenched, Broom and Whitman look down upon an impressive 
               ROMANESQUE RUIN. Under worklights, dozens of NAZI SOLDIERS 
               swarm among thick stone walls and archways.

               A dozen German soldiers swiftly assemble a large steel 
               MACHINE. The work is monitored by a spindly Nazi in BLACK 
               LEATHER, his face covered by an odd gas mask: KROENEN.

               He lowers a pair of binoculars and passes them to Whitman.

               Kroenen throws a switch: On the machine, dozens of gears 
               respond!

               Steam pistons thrust copper rails upright, lifting two mighty 
               metal rings, not unlike a gyroscope. Kroenen grunts and 
               signals for more floodlights to be turned on.

               EXT. BEHIND THE ALTAR - NIGHT

               The lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone 
               saints. GRIGORY, tall and gaunt, stands naked, arms fully 
               extended.

                                     GRIGORY
                         No matter what happens to me, you 
                         must carry on with the work.

               ILSA, a severe, ageless Aryan beauty, reverentially drapes 
               an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders.

                                     ILSA
                         I will not leave you.

                         Yes, you will... Leave me. Deny me.

                         Never --

               He hands her a small LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. It contains hand-
               drawn notes and illustrations.

                                     GRIGORY
                         This will guide you back to me.

               He pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling.

                                     GRIGORY
                         I grant you everlasting life, youth 
                         and the power to serve me.

               He dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then 
               wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation 
               and a ritual.

               VON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET 
               glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket 
               watch. On the gold lid: a SWASTIKA.

               He strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella 
               to shield her master from the pouring rain.

                                     VON KRUPT
                         The furhrer doesn't look kindly on 
                         failure.

                                     GRIGORY
                         There will be no failure, General. I 
                         promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I'll 
                         deliver one.

               Kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box 
               containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE.

               Grigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with 
               the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses.

               EXT. THE HILLTOP - ALLIED SOLDIERS - NIGHT

               The Americans fan out, unseen.

               Broom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid 
               a German foot patrol.

               Other GI's take up positions below a machine gun nest.

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT 

               Grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind 
               him.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Tonight, We will open a portal and 
                         awaken the OGDRU JAHAD: The seven 
                         Gods of chaos.
                              (beat)
                         Our enemies will be destroyed. In an 
                         instant, all impurity in this world 
                         will be razed and from the ashes a 
                         new eden will arise.

               He looks down at the machine and whispers --

                                     GRIGORY
                         Ragnarok, Anung Ia Anung.

               He flexes his fingers and in response --

               -- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central 
               axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and 
               pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain 
               to swerve momentarily away from Grigory's body.

               Ilsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel.

                                     ILSA
                         More Power!! Don't let the level 
                         drop!!

               One of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the 
               machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it.

               A blade of light opens in the air!

               Burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.

               EXT. COSMIC SLIT - NIGHT

               The edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN 
               GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light 
               tears loose and flies in.

               EXT. COSMIC SLIT - FROM THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               The six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD: 
               seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin.

               Within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie 
               slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens 
               a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another...

               Fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT  

               Grigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck, 
               his face distorted by ecstasy and pain.

               CLICK. Someone shoots a photograph.

               EXT. RUINS - IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT

               It's Matlin, snapping for all he's worth. Whitman pulls him 
               down and pulls out a large bayonet blade.

                                     WHITMAN
                         Listen to me, you moron: you do that 
                         again, I'll carve you a new --

               Too late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them.

               EXT. RUINS, IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT

               The Nazi SCIENTIST approaches. Pauses next to the box with 
               the GOLD CYLINDERS.

                                     BROOM
                              (fierce whisper, to 
                              WHITMAN)
                         Listen to me!!! The portal is open!!! 
                         We have to stop them!!!

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

               Grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy.  
               Even the skeptical Von Krupt is in thrall.

               The NAZI SCIENTIST reaches for a second GOLD CYLINDER. But 
               something else lands next to him: A GRENADE!!!

               The explosion blows him to pieces. In a few seconds, the 
               squad of Allies storms the area.

               A hail of bullets cuts down a dozen Nazis. The Allies overrun 
               the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere.

               VON KRUPT shoots wildly, hitting Broom in the leg. But 
               Whitman's bullets rip into the old Nazi's chest.

               Leaving a trail of blood, Broom crawls to a dead G.I. and 
               grabs a grenade from his belt.

               TCHKKK!!! Kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel 
               bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers, 
               mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors. 
               The steel chops clean through their weapons.

               Broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator.

               CLICK-CLACK!! It wedges itself between two moving tie rods.

               Kroenen squeals and -- retracting his blades -- lunges after 
               it. The gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. As 
               his fingers reach the grenade, it EXPLODES!!!

               Kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where 
               two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect.

               Another rail plunges -- FFFFT!!, like a javelin -- into the 
               earth right next to MATLIN.

                                     ILSA
                         Grigory!

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

               Grigory's face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy, 
               his body contorting and breaking. The cosmic portal suddenly 
               implodes! Nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal 
               glove, empty and smoking.

               As the Allies approach, the fighting rages on.

               Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen. 
               Embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails, 
               nothing more.

               OMIT

               EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - NIGHT

               Allied SOLDIERS penetrate the ruins. Matlin helps Broom up.

                                     MATLIN
                         It's almost over!!

                         No. It's not.

               He picks up a sample of white, viscous goo from the outer 
               rings of the smoking machine. Whitman approaches.

                                     BROOM
                         Cordon off the area. Something came

                         From where??!!

               Broom glances at a 13th century FRESCO depicting heaven and 
               hell.

               EXT. INSIDE CHURCH RUINS - NIGHT

               Still raining. A group of soldiers spreads out, using 
               flashlights to scour through the rubble. Every one of them 
               has a rosary hanging from the bayonet.

               OMIT

               EXT. INSIDE CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT

               Broom hastily bandages his bleeding leg. Matlin and Whitman 
               roam over the debris. Rain POURS through the broken roof.

                                     MATLIN
                         Do you believe in hell?

                         return. From there it infects our 
                         dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave

                         he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, 
                         clubbed, drowned and castrated.

                                     MATLIN
                         That makes him more than a hundred --

               A rustling sound reaches their ears. Matlin readies a handgun 
               as Broom scans the walls with his flashlight. Something moves, 
               accompanied by a loud scrape.

               Matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling 
               statue. SCREEEECH!!!! A RED THING jumps into the air!! 
               Instinctively, Matlin shoots at it.

               The RED THING leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail 
               of bullet hits. Whitman and other soldiers join them --

                                     MATLIN
                              (to Broom)

                         No. It was red. Bright red.

                         It's-not-an-ape --

               They hear the labored breathing of a living creature.

                                     MATLIN
                         It's got a big stone -- in its hand --

                                     BROOM
                         I think that is its hand.

               Hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone 
               saint.

               WHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom 
               stops him from firing.

                                     BROOM
                         Wait --

               In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden 
               eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna.

               Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket. 
               Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED 
               THING shrinks back.

               Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his 
               lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark 
               comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons 
               around it.

               The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with 
               tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. 
               Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the 
               chocolate.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER

                         that whammer!

               Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows 
               the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms.

               Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers 
               snatch the candy. Broom smiles.

                                     BROOM

               The soldiers cluster around, curious to see it. Matlin 
               prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot. Broom 
               smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature, 
               patting him gently. CLICK!!!

                         want to set the record straight before 
                         I go.

               Matlin finally pulls an old 8x10 from a battered portfolio. 
               He smiles, full of memories.

               Inside the blanket, Hellboy blinks his bright golden eyes 
               and chews candy, his devilish red tail twitching happily.

                         of their beloved "Hellboy." And they 
                         claim that he works for the FBI-?

               SUPER ON TV:

                                   TOM MANNING, F.B.I.

                               HEAD OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS.

               Manning on a TV SHOW a la Regis Philbin.

                                     TV HOST
                         As the head of your division, you -- 
                         You have seen dozens of pictures 
                         like this!!!

                                     MANNING
                         Exactly -- so, why is it that they're 
                         all out of focus? C'mon!! God knows, 
                         people manage to get good pictures 
                         at a wedding!!

               He shows a blurry picture.

                                     MANNING
                         That's the alleged best man -- ?

               The audience applauds.

               EXT. HIGH MOUNTAINS, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

               In the thick of a snowstorm, THREE FIGURES climb the icy 
               steps of a massive rock formation.

               Super: BIRGAU PASS, MOLDAVIA, PRESENT DAY.

               EXT. HIGH MOUNTAINS (SET), EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

               The THREE FIGURES move through a narrow passage until they 
               reach a DEAD END.

               FIGURE 1 stops at a symbol carved in the rocky ground and 
               consults Grigory's LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The symbol matches an 
               illustration in the book.

               Before them, a thick wall of ice. Using a heavy steel hammer, 
               FIGURE 1 breaks through.

                                     PEASANT GUIDE
                         I will guide you no further.

               Figure 2 produces two small GOLD INGOTS. Hands one to the 
               guide. Keeps the other one.

               The Guide examines his pay greedily: engraved in it: a 
               SWASTIKA.

               INT. ICE CAVE - SMALL CORRIDOR - DAY

               The ice curtain collapses, revealing a rough-walled corridor. 
               FIGURE 1 spots a glowing firefly. They follow it into --

               INT. ICE CAVE - MAIN NAVE - DAY

               A cathedral-like vault that could easily hold a stadium. 
               From an opening somewhere above, eerie blue light streams 
               down on a magnificent labyrinth.

               A few more fireflies speckle the air, winking on and off.

               INT. ICE CAVE - LABYRINTH - DAY

               The THREE FIGURES move past cyclopean statues guarding the 
               inhuman architecture. The humans are dwarfed by the monumental 
               scale of the walkways and ramparts.

               INT. ICE CAVE - CENTRAL LABYRINTH AREA - DAY

               At the center of the labyrinth the stone floor is covered in 
               grooves radiating from a shallow stone basin.

               FIGURE 3 uncovers his face: he's a PEASANT GUIDE.

                                     PEASANT GUIDE
                              (in Romanian)
                         We shouldn't be here --

               FIGURE 1 exchanges a meaningful look with FIGURE 2. FIGURE 1 
               throws two solid gold pieces at the feet of the Sherpa. On 
               them, an embossed SWASTIKA. After a greedy moment of thought, 
               the Peasant kneels to pick up the gold.

               TCHKK!!! A long, shiny blade pierces the Peasant's chest 
               from behind. He blinks twice and slumps forward.

               FIGURE 2 steps out from behind him, a long, bloody blade in 
               his hand.

               The figures uncover their faces. ILSA has not aged and 
               KROENEN, still wears the same tight gas mask. He cleans his 
               blade in the snow and takes back the gold.

               Ilsa watches the Sherpa's blood as it runs in a steaming 
               rivulet, tracing a glyph in the grooves and filling the basin.

               A FIGURE RISES FROM THE BLOOD. A naked human shape, haloed 
               by fireflies.

                                     ILSA
                         Your eyes. What did they do to your 
                         eyes?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               Mechanized rollers transport X-Ray films over a backlit 
               screen. A group of 4 DOCTORS studies the pictures and 
               exchanges somber looks. Rain spatters the windows.

               Doctor 1 glances at the others.

                                     DOCTOR 1
                         Have you told him yet?

               Doctor 2 looks through a glass partition at an aged but 
               dignified BROOM, 72, who slowly buttons his shirt. Hanging 
               from his wrist, his rosary.

               INT. DOCTORS OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

                         the spine, liver...

                                     BROOM
                         Approximately... how long??

                                     DOCTOR 2
                         Maybe -- six weeks.

               Broom impassively takes in the information.

                                     DOCTOR 2
                         I can arrange for hospitalization, 
                         pain management. Make the time more 
                         bearable --

               Broom pensively shuffles his tarot cards.

                                     BROOM
                              (shakes his head)
                         I'd rather... stay home, you know. 
                         I'll be making arrangements --
                              (beat)
                         For my son.

                                     DOCTOR 2
                         You can always get a second opinion.

               Broom looks down: first card off the deck: DEATH.

                                     BROOM
                         That won't be necessary.

               EXT. N.Y. - MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

               Leaves stir on the pavement. All the stores are decorated 
               for Halloween. Two kids dressed as SKELETONS run in front of 
               Broom, carrying a JACK-O-LANTERN.

               Leaning on a cane, Broom exits the building and walks toward 
               a waiting black Mercedes. The DRIVER (Agent Lime) opens the 
               door.

               Broom pauses to buy a dozen BABY RUTH candy bars from a street 
               vendor.

               In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's. The image of a RED, 
               BLURRY SHAPE (HELLBOY) fills the screens.

                                     BROOM

                         Mister Manning, what about the "Bureau 
                         for Paranormal Research and Defense?" 
                         The FBI has been known to conceal --

                         the American public one thing -- 
                         this "Bureau for -- what was it?

                         to clear up this once and for all.
                              (he looks at the camera)
                         There-is-no-such-thing.

               Broom smiles.

               OMIT

               EXT. B.P.R.D. BUILDING COMPLEX - DAY

               On a wooded, new jersey hill, a low-slung, high-tech complex 
               rests at the edge of a bluff, its foundation fused with the 
               rock below.

               SUPER: BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE, NEWARK, 
               N.J.

               EXT. B.P.R.D. COMPLEX - GATE ENTRANCE - DAY

               A dolled-up MOD-STYLE moped stops at the massive gate. 
               Strapped to the luggage rack are two cheap suitcases. The 
               driver, a very wet YOUNG MAN named MYERS, touches an old 
               fashioned buzzer under a sign reading "WASTE MANAGEMENT"

               A crackling INTERCOM VOICE answers.

                                     INTERCOM VOICE
                         Yes?

                              (shivering)
                         John Myers, F.B.I. Transfer from 
                         Quantico.

               A beat, then -- WHIRRR!!! An EYEPIECE and an LCD screen 
               scanner pop out.

                                     INTERCOM VOICE
                         Look at the birdie, son.

               Myers looks into the eyepiece. On the screen, Myers' cornea 
               is scanned. TWO VIOLET FLASHES. His ID and badge numbers 
               appear. CLACK! The gate opens.

               EXT. UPHILL ROAD - THE MOPED - DAY

               The moped putt-putts towards the building in the distance.

               INT. B.P.R.D. LOBBY - DAY

               Seated at a dramatic circular desk is a solitary guard. Myers 
               approaches.

                                     MYERS
                         Hello, I'm --

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         -- Late. Five minutes late.

                                     MYERS
                         Yes, I --

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         -- Section fifty-one. Step back.

                                     MYERS
                         Pardon?

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         Two steps back, please.

               Confused, Myers picks up his suitcases and complies. He 
               realizes he's DEAD CENTER on a giant B.P.R.D. Logo: A HAND 
               HOLDING A SWORD.

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         Watch your hands and elbows.

               Immediately, the floor under Myers' feet starts down. He's 
               on a small elevator.

               INT./EXT. OPEN ELEVATOR - ON THE WAY DOWN - DAY

               The panel overhead slides shut. A row of safety lights comes 
               on.

               INT. OPEN ELEVATOR - DAY

               He's in a vast underground area with other elevators moving 
               up and down in the distance.

               INT. B.P.R.D. - CONCRETE CHAMBER 51 - DUSK

               The elevator stops in a narrow, dark space. Neon lights 
               flicker on, illuminating a circular chamber. PAINTED on the 
               floor is a huge number: 51.

               Right in front of Myers: a magnificent oak door.

               Myers knocks on it. No answer. Myers enters.

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE (FULL AQUARIUM)- DUSK

               Myers looks around, fascinated: books. An office made of 
               them. The soft glow of green-shaded reading lamps bathes 
               everything in an intimate, warm light.

               One entire wall is a thick pane of glass, the wall of a huge 
               tank of water. A VOICE crackles through an intercom next to 
               the tank.

                                     VOICE
                         Turn the pages, please.

               Myers jumps, then moves closer to the glass.

                                     VOICE
                         Over here... if you don't mind?

               In the tank, ABE SAPIEN, a FISH-MAN glides in and out view.

                                     MYERS
                         Jesus Christ!

               Myers looks at four BOOK STANDS facing the glass. Each 
               supports an open volume. He leans close to the glass, peering 
               intently.

               Abe reappears. He is slender, dolphin gray, with dark patterns 
               streaking his soft skin. Bright blue eyes shine with 
               intelligence. Behind a thin wound-like mouth, gills are 
               bubbling.

                                     MYERS
                              (points at the books)
                         These -- ? You're reading these -- ?

               Abe nods. Through a side door, Broom enters.

                         Four books at once. Every day -- as

                         Broom.

               Myers extends his hand in greeting --

                                     MYERS
                         Sir, I'm --

               BAM! Abe presses his webbed hand against the glass, closes 
               his eyes -- all three lids.

               Abe's voice surges from the speaker.

                                     ABE

                         away.

               Myers and Broom walk down a corridor. The walls are lined 
               with glass cases containing occult artifacts. Myers eyes a 
               MUMMIFIED HAND, a CLAY GOLEM, a sumptuous PAGAN ALTAR...

               He points to an ANCIENT, BROKEN LANCE.

                         invincible.

               He gestures at an ancient LANCE. Next to it: a silver and 
               gold reliquary.

                         born.

               Workmen are replacing two of the doors. Big dents from an 
               oversized fist have deformed the 2-inch thick metal plates. 
               Myers stares.

               They reach a FINAL DOOR. Stainless steel, like a BANK VAULT. 
               Waiting there is AGENT CLAY, a burly guy in a suit, with a 
               cartful of BEEF AND MASHED POTATOES. A dinner pile at least 
               4 feet high.

                         Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay. 
                         Follow his lead.

               Broom hands Myers two BABY RUTH bars and walks away.

                                     MYERS

               The door closes behind him.

                         They're not speaking. Professor Broom 
                         had him grounded.

                         of the family.

               Clay uses an odd-shaped ELECTRONIC KEY to unlock the door. 
               Three solenoid locks turn. Two steel vertical PISTONS open 
               up.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

               Clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless, 
               austere except for a few SAMURAI suits of ARMOR and WEAPONS. 
               Dozens of CATS wander around; others are curled up on the 
               furniture.

               There are Zippo's everywhere, from every era.

               On a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of 
               blankets and comic books. All in all, a MEGA BACHELOR PAD.

               Clay points at a torn comic book: HELLBOY, THE UNCANNY. Myers 
               picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows Hellboy -- in a 
               U.S. Uniform, fighting a monstrous ape.

               Myers watches, amazed, as a bright red TAIL waves in and out 
               of a pool of light about ten feet away. One of the cats 
               playfully paws at it.

                         think dog years: He's barely out of 
                         his teens.

               Myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows, 
               exercising with a 300 lb. Stainless steel DUMBBELL. Crimson 
               biceps like cooked hams. Chomping an unlit CIGAR stub.

                         got those implants??

               Agent Clay blushes as he hides his scalp.

                         your dinner, Red? By the couch?

               On a nearby pile of junked TV sets, a loop of Fleischer 
               cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. One subject appears 
               over and over: an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN with a pale face 
               and raven-black hair.

               BANG!!! Hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. Instinctively, Myers 
               jumps.

               In spite of himself, Myers is staring at the horn stumps.

               An imposing four-story structure, all pillars and pediments. 
               A HALLOWEEN BANNER advertises: MAGICK: THE ANCIENT POWER.

               Super: THE MACHEN LIBRARY, MANHATTAN 

               Chaos near the entrance: policemen, TV reporters, MOUNTED 
               POLICE.

               Loud protests from the reporters as a line of black sedan 
               cars are waved through.

                                     BLONDE REPORTER
                         The NYPD has yet to issue a statement. 
                         We've got SWAT vans, paramedics, you 
                         name it...  and now here's -- a 
                         garbage truck --
                              (double take)
                         -- a garbage truck?

               Trailing behind the cars, a GARBAGE TRUCK. On its side a 
               mirrored sign reads: SQUEAKY CLEAN INC. Waste Management 
               Services.

               INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK - LIBRARY STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               AN AGENT is driving the truck, with MYERS at his side.

               EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               The crowd parts like the Red Sea for the garbage truck. Dozens 
               of faces are reflected in the truck's mirrored logo. A MOUNTED 
               POLICEMAN rides past the mirrored sides of the truck.

               INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - LIBRARY CROWD - NIGHT

               The MOUNTED POLICEMAN is visible as he rides by. The mirrors 
               are see-through. The back of the truck is a fully-equipped 
               crime lab, crammed with hi-tech gear and low-tech talismans.

               ABE fits a respirator over his face. It looks like a 
               mechanized Elizabethan collar. Valves bubble and hiss as he 
               inhales liquid through his mouth and out his gills. 

               Hellboy looks out onto the CROWD.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One 
                         sheet of glass between them and us.

                                     ABE
                         Story of my life.

                         I break it, they see us, Happy 
                         Halloween. No more hiding.
                              (nostalgic)
                         Outside. I could be outside --

                                     ABE
                         You mean, outside... with her.

               Hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets, 
               rosaries, horseshoes. From an ashtray he grabs a handful of 
               stogie stubs. Lights one, puts the rest in a pouch.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't get psychic with me.

                                     ABE
                         Nothing psychic about it. You're 
                         easy.

               Hellboy unlocks a STEEL BOX (STENCILED ON ITS LID: "THE GOOD 
               SAMARITAN") and extracts the meanest-looking, custom-built, 
               double-barrel, blue-finished, handgun ever made. A veritable 
               cannon.

                         How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I 
                         drive around in a garbage truck

                                     ABE
                         Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.

                              (hefting the gun)
                         We don't take hints.

               EXT. COURTYARD / LOADING DOCK MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               The GARBAGE TRUCK pulls into an interior courtyard and stops.

               FBI/BPRD teams spread through the area, expelling uniformed 
               cops and securing the doors.

               THREE AGENTS -- QUARRY, STONE and MOSS -- close a gate, 
               sealing off the area.

                                     STONE
                         All areas secured.

               From a nearby roof, Agent Lime signals all clear.

                         Seal the doors. Red and Blue are 
                         coming in.

               The truck stops, Clay pulls a lever. Myers watches as the 
               dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge, revealing 
               HELLBOY and ABE.

                                     CLAY
                         Okay, boys, let's synch up our 
                         locators.

               Abe, Clay and Hellboy activate lights on their belts. They 
               BEEP and blink. Hellboy starts walking.

               OMIT

               INT. MACHEN LIBRARY, MAIN LOBBY - NIGHT

               As BPRD agents clear the area, Clay, Myers, Abe and Hellboy 
               march through the main lobby. On view, various display cases. 
               Two BANNERS flank the marble staircase.

                         checked this place. Fakes, and 
                         reproductions.

               Broom stands at the base of the marble staircase.

                         Father...?

               Myers observes as the red Goliath sheepishly averts his gaze 
               from that of the fragile old man.

               INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT

               They approach an oversize set of brass doors.

               Abe removes a leather glove from his hand. FWAP!! he spreads 
               his webbed fingers on the door. He closes his three eyelids 
               and concentrates.

               Two agents arrive with a rolling munitions case. Myers 
               observes as Hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of 
               bullets of all colors and shapes.

                         we hold a copy.

               Hellboy selects a clip full of bullets and a speed loader.

                                     HELLBOY

                         Evil, ancient and hungry.

               Abe quickly starts scanning a few leather-bound volumes of 
               ancient magic.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Oh, well. Lemme go in and say "hi".

               As HELLBOY opens the big doors, a flickering amber glow 
               illuminates him. He steps inside.

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT

               BLUE emergency lamps are on. The exhibits are destroyed; 
               piles of debris are burning. Hellboy walks past a fallen 
               display case.

               He moves around cautiously. A couple of large carvings and 
               statues startle him.

               On the floor: boots, half chewed. Bitten belts and shreds of 
               uniforms and hats.

                                     HELLBOY

               The sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches 
               his ears. Hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to 
               discover --

               A huge pale CREATURE hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly. 
               SAMMAEL: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles 
               and two well-muscled hind legs. Most of its face is hidden, 
               but the jaws are shiny with blood.

                                     HELLBOY

               Abe has found a small, medieval engraving of Sammael in one 
               of the books.

                                     ABE
                         There's not much here: the entity's 
                         name is Sammael, the desolate one, 
                         son of Nergal --

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT

               Sammael releases himself, lands on the floor. Part of the 
               neck is exposed: white, slimy skin, cracked like old marble 
               and criss- crossed with blue veins.

                         shot, but --

                         "The Samaritan" here, uses really

                         this out?

               Sammael stands and turns around -- CRACK-KKK!!! His waist 
               twists him 360 degrees!!

               Screeching, Sammael leaps away!!!

               Hellboy shoots. The high-caliber ammo rips a few columns 
               apart and finally catches Sammael. The bullet goes through 
               it and destroys a statue and a large window behind him. The 
               monster squeals and goes down. With a rattling cough, it 
               grows still.

               Hellboy looks up: standing in the alley, like an apparition, 
               is Grigory, in a black suit and overcoat, his eyes shielded 
               by pitch-black sunglasses

                                     GRIGORY
                         All grown up, I see.

               Hellboy's in shock, confused.

                                     HELLBOY
                         That voice --

                                     GRIGORY
                         I sang the first lullaby you ever 
                         heard, my child. I ushered you into 
                         this world.
                              (beat)
                         I alone know your true calling, your 
                         true name.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.

               Hellboy catches sight of his big gun, lying on the ground. 
               He goes for it but, BAMMM!!!! SAMMAEL lands before him.

                                     GRIGORY
                         I can see that you're still young 
                         and don't know your place.
                              (turns to Sammael)
                         Teach him.

               Before Hellboy can reach the weapon --

               WSHHHP!!! A 7-foot tongue lashes out from Sammael's mouth 
               like a whip. It's arm-thick, with yellow sacs billowing from 
               its sides. It wraps around Hellboy's right arm.

               Hellboy falls to the ground, writhing, grinding his teeth. 
               The tongue squeezes and pulls. Smoke pours from Hellboy's 
               skin.

               EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Then -- BANG! BANG! BANG! Myers appears at the end of the 
               alley, firing round after round into Sammael's tongue. AMBER 
               BLOOD explodes in the air. The tongue recoils with an infernal 
               SQUEAL!!

               Hellboy manages to roll away.

               Myers goes for HELLBOY's gun... and grabs it! He takes cover 
               behind the trash container. HELLBOY is there.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What do you think you're doing??

               Myers proudly shows him the gun.

                                     MYERS
                         Helping you -- I just --

                                     HELLBOY
                         No one ever helps me. It's my job.

               He grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too 
               much.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Damn -- Okay. Here --

               He hands him the gun and a fresh clip. Reaching into his 
               belt, Hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (throws it at Myers)
                         -- Then load this.

               In the packet: A SINGLE BULLET.

                                     HELLBOY
                         It's a tracking bullet. Crack the 
                         pin. Load it.

               KLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod. 
               Again and again... Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it.

               Myers cracks a safety pin. The glass head on the bullet glows 
               like a chemical flare.

                                     MYERS
                         Jeez... What the hell is that?

               He's looking at Hellboy's smoking arm. Inside a bloody gash, 
               a big, black stinger is gleaming.

               Hellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. It pops like a ripe 
               grape.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Lemme go ask --

               Hellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael's tongue 
               instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle.

               BAM! BAM! Hellboy shoots repeatedly. His face lit weirdly 
               green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. Then -- 
               BAM!!!!

               INSIDE GUN SHOT

               The glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards --

               EXT. ALLEY

               -- Sammael, still in mid-air.

               It hits him square in the chest: an explosion of green goo!!

               With a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles 
               after it.

               EXT. LOADING ALLEY - NIGHT

               On the empty sidewalk, Hellboy sees a trail of GLOWING GOOP.

               He hits full stride, following it around a corner. Myers 
               lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him.

                                     MYERS
                         Wait! No, what are you doing?

               LOADING DOCK / ALLEY

               Sammael dashes by, followed closely by Hellboy, running full 
               tilt.

               A ten-wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. A 
               few workers load pumpkin boxes in it.

                                     WORKER 1
                         What the hell is that??

               Without slowing down, Sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting 
               the roof then jumping off and into a CROWDED CARNIVAL area.

               A small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch.

               Full of curiosity, Sammael pauses a second to inspect a Trick-
               or-treater dressed as a GOLDEN DRAGON.

               Hellboy catapults himself onto the trailer's roof.

                                     3 WORKERS
                              (chorus)
                         Whoa-whoa-whoa-

               Hellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the driver's cab: 
               CRASH!!!

               The driver is almost crushed under the steel. He screams, 
               showered by thousands of glass shards.

               Myers is a few steps behind.

                                     MYERS
                              (into headset)
                         We'll hit the street in a minute. 
                         We're heading towards civilians...

               He squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall. The 
               vendors are yelling at him.

                                     MYERS
                         Yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? Trick 
                         or treat!!

               EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

               Sammael runs past a group of trick-or-treaters, and jumps 
               straight into the street. Cars swerve, avoiding a collision 
               as Sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. The TRICK OR 
               TREATERS scream.

               Hellboy appears. He too dives straight into the traffic as 
               Myers follows --

               He runs into the road... and a 4X4 speeds straight at him!

               Seeing this, Hellboy runs back, and lands next to Myers, 
               holds out his STONE HAND and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks.

               The impact somersaults the car over them both. It lands with 
               a thud on the street, air bags exploding. Myers almost faints.

               Other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. A major 
               traffic jam.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Are you okay?

               Myers opens his eyes, nods.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Good. Stay here.

               He moves after Sammael.

               OMIT

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               Hellboy follows the GLOWING GOOP into an adjacent alley. At 
               the far end he sees a metal grate has been moved. Sammael's 
               gone.

               He comes up to the opening, then jumps in.

               EXT./INT. STUNT TRACKS TUNNEL - NIGHT

               He lands on a subway track. Sammael is a few yards away. 
               Seated.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Waiting for me, Sammy?

               A train horn blares. A headlight approaches!! Hellboy smiles 
               and puts away his gun.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Uh-oh -- between a rock and a hard 
                         place --

               But Sammael sprints towards it!

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, crap --

               Sammael unhinges a long, scythe-like bone from his forearm, 
               then jumps at the front car --

               OMIT

               INT. STUNT TRACKS / FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT

               smashing through glass and steel and raining sparks. Landing 
               inside with a ROAR!!! --

               EXT./INT. THE SUBWAY - 2 TRAIN CAR SET - NIGHT

               SAMMAEL's tongue punches through the doors as he races through 
               one -- two -- passenger cars and out the --

               STUNT TRACK REAR 1/4 CAR

               -- rear of the train, back onto the tracks.

               INT. STUNT  TRACKS - NIGHT

               Landing there safely.

               INT. THE SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK) - NIGHT

               Now the train hurtles at Hellboy, who grimaces and does his 
               best --

               INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR

               He leaps, but HUMPF!! He's hit! His legs rattle over the 
               tracks.

               INT. UNDERCARRIAGE - STUNT TRACKS - FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT

               Inches from the wheels, he punches his stone hand through 
               the steel floor and grabs a handhold. Steam and sparks explode 
               everywhere.

               The TRAIN DRIVER grabs a fire extinguisher and starts slamming 
               it against Hellboy's head.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hey! Hey! I'm on your side!!

               BAMMM!!! He goes under!!!

               INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR

               The train whizzes overhead, grazing his horn stumps, making 
               sparks fly!! After the train passes, Hellboy sits up, forehead 
               smoking. Sammael is gone. A trail of GOOP is glowing. He 
               follows it, until it ends abruptly.

               He looks ahead: no trace of Sammael... Then a fat drop of 
               glowing goop hits his hand.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, I forgot --

               He looks up. Sammael hangs from the ceiling, then drops. 
               Then the creature lifts Hellboy in a ferocious bear hug.

               Hellboy twists around and cracks open the jaws of the 
               creature, like King Kong and the T-Rex.

               Sammael staggers back and -- in an impossible maneuver, re-
               knits his jaws together! Then he uses his bone scythe to 
               tackle Hellboy and -- TCHAKKKK!! -- pin his shoulder down. A 
               deep wound.

               Sammael's mouth starts to open! Hellboy looks at the sparking 
               THIRD RAIL a few feet away.

               Sammael's tongue rears back, a snake ready to strike.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Screw you.

               Hellboy grabs the rail. An electrical discharge consumes 
               both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. Hellboy 
               lets go, his hand and body smoking. Sammael -- very crispy -- 
               is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. He grows still.

               Wreathed in smoke, Hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a 
               flame on his arm to light a cigar.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I'm fireproof.
                              (puffs smoke, kicks 
                              the body)
                         You weren't.

               EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               A huge traffic jam clogs the highway. The totalled 4X4 is 
               being TOWED AWAY. Several TV CREWS interview witnesses.

               Myers -- his arm freshly bandaged -- signs a police form. 
               His radio beeps.

                                     HELLBOY (V.O.)

               He turns off his belt locator and moves away into the darkness 
               of the tunnel.

               In the foreground: BLACK light escapes from Sammael's charred

               INT. MAIN ABANDONED BATHS ALCOVE - NIGHT

               An abandoned shower room. A series of sinks and stalls, lined 
               with dirty white tile. A phonograph nearby plays Wagner. 
               Kroenen stands next to it.

               ILSA is nearby, a straight razor glinting in her hand. She 
               stands over Grigory -- his back to us -- lovingly shaving 
               her master's scalp. She grabs two GLASS EYES from a table. 
               Places them in Grigory's sockets -- his back to us -- as he 
               turns, a glass eye shifts lazily into position. He opens his 
               hand: in it the pale BLACK light that escaped from Sammael's 
               body. He cradles it like a precious stone.

                                     GRIGORY
                              (smiling)
                         Sammael has fulfilled his destiny... 
                         Die in peace and be reborn again and 
                         again...

               He closes his fist.

                                     ILSA
                         Only seven more days to the eclipse, 
                         Grishka...

               Rasputin stands, his neck and shoulders rising, engorged by 
               moving flesh beneath his human skin. Ilsa stares in 
               fascination.

                                     GRIGORY
                         The child will be there. And so will 
                         we all -- Won't we?

               Behind him, in the darkness of a tunnel: TWO SAMMAEL 
               silhouettes appear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               A sleek black limo drives past the crowd and stops outside. 
               FBI agent TOM MANNING emerges.

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - NIGHT

               Manning and Broom walk through the mess. A crew is cleaning 
               up. The dead guards are carried out.

                                     MANNING
                         Every time the media get a look at 
                         him, they come to me. I'm running 
                         out of lies, Trevor.

                         Your "guest" happens to be six foot 
                         five, bright red, and is government

               Manning moistens and lights a fine cigar, using a kitchen 
               match.

                                     MANNING
                         A "phase"? What do you think this 
                         is, "The Brady Bunch?" These... freaks --

               ABE SAPIEN listens while pacing the exhibition hall, palm 
               open.

                                     MANNING
                              (lowers his voice, 
                              tense)
                         These freaks, Trevor, they give me 
                         the creeps. And I'm not the only 
                         one. You're up for review. You and 
                         your petting zoo.

                         him back.

               Manning watches as Abe finds a sharp dagger embedded in the 
               floor.

                                     MANNING
                         Hey, fishstick -- don't touch anything --

               Abe silences him.

                                     ABE
                         I need to touch it to "see"...

                                     MANNING
                         See what??

                                     ABE
                         The past, the future, whatever this 
                         object holds.

                                     MANNING
                              (eyes Broom)
                         Is he serious??

                                     ABE
                         Don't worry about fingerprints. I 
                         never had any.

               Abe holds the dagger in his hand, turns to Broom.

                                     ABE
                         They were over here, Professor.

                                     MANNING
                         Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? 
                         You mind sharing your mystic insights?

               Broom examines the dagger: a RAGNAROK symbol crowns the hilt. 
               The dragon and swastika.

                         Show me, Abe... show me.

               He solemnly extends his hand. As soon as Abe takes it, the 
               room...

                                                                 MORPHS TO:

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - FLASHBACK

               Hours earlier: the place is intact. Both ABE and BROOM witness 
               spectrally as --

               A GUARD CHECKS AN ALARM MONITORING UNIT. HEARING A ticking 
               sound, he shines his light into a dark corner: no one's there. 
               But after the guard moves on, a spidery form emerges from 
               the pool of shadows on the floor.

               It's KROENEN, encased in shiny BLACK LATEX from head to toe. 
               On his chest, a close-fitting harness comprised of softly 
               ticking gears.

               He approaches a glass case which holds an ancient WOODEN 
               STATUE of an Eastern Orthodox SAINT.

               Then, on the glass, a reflection: ILSA.

                                     ILSA
                         Move.

               She uses her hammer to destroy the glass case.

               The ALARM shrieks. Warning lights come on.

               Kroenen pulls out a double-ended BLADE. It spins, like a 
               giant bone saw, slicing across the statue.

               No apparent damage until: CRACKKKKK!!! a diagonal line appears 
               and the top half falls.

               KROENEN reaches for a small crank embedded in his chest and 
               winds himself up.

               Ilsa reaches into a hollow portion in the wooden statue and 
               removes a large reliquary jar containing Golden sand.

               Six guards hurry in. They point their flashlights and guns 
               at Kroenen.

                                     GUARD 1
                         You! Don't move! Hands up!

               Kroenen starts shaking, as if in a seizure and readies two 
               TWIN BLADES.

               bullet tears into Kroenen's arm, spewing forth an explosion 
               of dust. He turns. The guards shoot again. Kroenen maneuvers 
               the steel, deflecting the bullets which --

               -- ricochet wildly -- and finally hit three of the guards. 
               They fall silently to the floor.

               Kroenen dispatches two more in a flurry of knives.

               The last guard raises his gun.

                                     GUARD 6
                         Don't --

               Something is clearly stopping him. His hand breaks, twisted 
               by an unseen force!!

               The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible 
               force. He starts floating in mid-air.

               The blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows 
               red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in 
               shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding 
               an imaginary doll.

               His arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing, 
               gaining strength.

               With a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts 
               of the guard's body in opposite directions.

               With a wet CRUNCH, the guard's shadow on the wall goes limp. 
               Grigory looks at Ilsa.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Ready the welcome, my love --

               Ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto 
               the floor.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Salt. Gathered from the tears of a 
                         thousand martyrs. Restraining the 
                         essence of Sammael, the hell hound, 
                         the seed of destruction.

               Grigory slices the air with his open hand, creating fleeting 
               glyphs... and a small BLACK flame dances on his open palm. 
               He deposits it in mid-air, at the center of the circle.

               Then, the sand begins to move, like liquid mercury. Lines 
               fuse into a pile. It melts and bubbles, growing and foaming. 
               Bones are formed, tendons and ligaments join together, 
               GROWING, GROWING, INTO SAMMAEL.

               It roars!!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMIT

               INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Abe snaps out of it. Broom is pale. He steps away, wincing, 
               enduring a bolt of pain in his side. Abe holds him. Motions 
               for the others to stay back.

               He extends his open palm and "feels" the air near the old 
               man's back.

                                     ABE

               Broom turns around, gently pushes Abe's hand away.

                                     BROOM
                         Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to

                         in my lifetime, they are back. To 
                         finish the job.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

               A small nighttime Halloween celebration. Lanterns hanging 
               from the trees, couples drinking and listening to Pop music 
               on picnic tables.

               On a bench, A YOUNG GUY pulls out a cold SIX PACK of beer 
               and passionately kisses his GIRLFRIEND. As he shuts his eyes, 
               a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack.

               Behind the bench, HELLBOY smiles.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               Dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. A small army of EMERGENCY 
               VEHICLES roars down the deserted streets, right past a...

               ...brick 1940's HOSPITAL, behind a high wall topped with 
               barbed wire. The mesh-covered windows are decorated with 
               paper skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns. A topiary garden 
               surrounds the building.

               Watching from atop the wall is HELLBOY. One sleeve of his 
               overcoat is soaked in blood. He keeps an eye on the SECOND 
               FLOOR windows. Hanging from his tail: THE SIX PACK OF BEER.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               DOCTOR MARSH, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line 
               patients, distributing pills.

               Behind her, a lithe young woman in a patient's gown carries 
               the medicine tray. This is LIZ SHERMAN, age 26, her pale 
               skin contrasting with her raven-black hair and piercing dark 
               eyes. A scar mars her forehead. Three thick rubber bands 
               circle her wrist.

               Near a window, a Down's Syndrome PATIENT senses something.

                                     DOWN'S PATIENT
                              (pointing)
                         There's a big red guy down there!

                                     DOCTOR MARSH
                              (readying more pills)
                         That's fine, darling, Santa's not 
                         here for another month.

                                     DOWN'S PATIENT
                         Not Santa. Big and red. With gold 
                         eyes. And he has beer!

               Hearing this, Liz stops. She closes her eyes, tugs at one of 
               the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her 
               skin. She winces and peers out the window. The garden below 
               seems empty.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA - NIGHT

               Liz steps out a side door into the hospital garden. Hanging 
               from her neck: an old POLAROID CAMERA. She follows a trail 
               of blood to a large, thorny bush. As she circles it...

                                     LIZ
                         Back so soon?

               Visible in the branches, a leg and part of Hellboy's overcoat. 
               His tail emerges, dangling the six-pack.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Uh, I brought beer.

               Liz shoots a Polaroid.

                                     LIZ
                         To wash down my lithium pills?
                              (beat)
                         I may get a few perks, H.B. But I'm 
                         still a patient.

               Shyly, he climbs out from the bush. She sees the bloody arm.

                                     LIZ
                         You better have that looked at.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Just a scratch.
                              (shrug)
                         I wanted to see you.

               Liz sighs.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA- NIGHT

               Hellboy's sitting on a bench, next to Liz.

                                     HELLBOY
                         We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's

                         mad at me --
                              (Liz smiles)
                         Come back, Liz. Come back. I --

                         No. Not this time, H.B. It's been 
                         months since I've had an episode. 
                         And you know what? I'm learning to 
                         control it.

               Around her right hand a faint BLUE AURA of fire blooms, 
               crawling over her fingers like a velvet haze. She stares at 
               the pale flame.

                                     LIZ
                         I'm learning where it comes from.

                         And for once in my life I'm not 
                         afraid.

               She clenches her fist and puts the flame out.

                                     LIZ
                         Looks like your ride is here.

               The garbage truck and the two black sedan cars have pulled 
               into the hospital grounds. A dozen agents climb out of the 
               vehicles.

               ANGLE - THE CARS - CONTINUOUS

               Clay starts towards Hellboy, but Myers stops him and turns 
               to Broom:

                                     MYERS
                         Sir, may I go first??

                         Not so fast. He barely knows him --

                                     BROOM
                              (cuts him off)
                         Then he should make it his business 
                         to change that.

               ANGLE - THE BENCH - CONTINUOUS

               Liz stands up, puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                     LIZ
                         Listen, H.B. I've got a chance out 
                         here. If you truly care about me, 
                         don't come back anymore.

               Hellboy smiles sadly. She walks away.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Goodnight, then.

                                     LIZ
                         Goodnight.

               She doesn't turn back.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Yeah, I gotta go, too. Lots to do --

               Feeling light-headed, he stands up. On the bench and at his 
               feet, a pool of his own blood.

               He sees Myers tentatively approaching.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What took you so long?

                                     MYERS
                         C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.

                         No. I never was.

                         Could've fooled me. Go away.

               Hellboy drops to his knees. Clay, Quarry and Moss reach him. 
               Help him up.

                                     CLAY
                         C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, 
                         there.

                                     HELLBOY
                         This -- ? This is nothing. You know 
                         what'll kill me?

               Liz stands at the hospital door and sees Hellboy keel over. 
               A few of the agents help him to the vehicles.

               Myers looks back at Liz. They hold each others' gaze, their 
               unfamiliar faces filled with curiosity. Eventually, she goes 
               inside.

               INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY "A" - NIGHT

               In the depths of the B.P.R.D infirmary, Hellboy lies flat on 
               a stainless steel table. Broom sits alongside him.

               Abe peers through a magnifier at Hellboy's wounded arm.

                                     ABE
                         You were burned by some organic acid.

                         I'm lucky that way.

               Using a scalpel, Abe probes the gash. Hellboy lets out a

               Broom moves to Abe's side of the table. Abe is poking at the 
               depths of the wound.

               Broom comes closer, eyes wide: inside the wound on Hellboy's 
               forearm, nestled like ticks, are 3 translucent EGGS.

               Hellboy jumps as Abe plucks the first one out. Abe deposits 
               it in a glass container.

               The computer beeps having finished an analysis. On a monitor, 
               an enlarged color image of one of the throbbing eggs.

                         The eggs are very sensitive to heat 
                         and light. They need a humid, dark 
                         environment to breed.

               Abe picks up an egg with a pair of tweezers, passes it on to 
               Hellboy, who sports a bandage on his arm.

                         moment, when I had a train on top of 
                         my head --

                         bottom.

               Myers observes, repelled, as inside the egg a small foetal 
               THING wiggles.

               At the last book stand, Broom glances at Abe, who is sitting 
               in the shadows near the door.

               Myers works at a computer workstation.

               He brings up a small photograph in an old issue of The

               Another clipping: young LIZ, 11, and a photo of a tenement 
               building burned to the ground: TRAGIC EXPLOSION.

               A QUICKTIME interview pops up. LIZ, in her early twenties. A

                         like psychosis or something. I dunno --

               A flashlight beam sweeps Liz's room. It illuminates a 
               CORKBOARD covered with hundreds of Polaroids depicting scenes 
               of everyday life.

               When the beam of light crosses her face, she turns slowly, 
               still asleep.

               As the light fades, the shadows in the room grow deeper. 
               Grigory emerges from a dark corner. He gazes down on the

                         my girl. We are all part of his plan. 
                         You must return to the child... So, 
                         once again...

               He gently caresses the scar on her forehead. Under his skin, 
               a hideous movement, a writhing rearrangement of muscles. His 
               fingers start to glow.

                                     GRIGORY
                         ...dream of fire.

               Liz convulses. A small ripple of heat rises from her forehead.

                                                             FLASH BACK TO:

               EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING COURTYARD - DAY

               Somewhere in a smokestack city, grown-ups and kids hang 
               banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement 
               courtyard.

               ANGLE - LIZ - CONTINUOUS

               Sitting on some tenement steps, LIZ, age 11. Sullen, alone, 
               a gold CRUCIFIX hanging on her chest.

               A WOMAN -- Liz's MOTHER -- comes down the courtyard steps, 
               carrying a basket of apples.

                                     MOTHER
                              (to Liz)
                         Liz!! Liz!! Come on, darling, give 
                         Mummy a hand.

               Nearby, under a balloon archway, munching candy-coated 
               apples... three KIDS giggle and point at her.

                                     BLONDE KID
                         Freak!

               Liz turns to see them.

                                     BLONDE KID
                              (to his friend)
                         See? She knows her name.

               Liz shies away from them.

                                     BLONDE KID
                         Go home, you freak. We don't want 
                         you here.

               They start throwing stones. One hits the steps. Another misses 
               her by inches. A third hits her in the shoulder.

               Scared, Liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face. 
               She falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering 
               the pavement. She starts sobbing. Another rock sails across, 
               but this time, in mid-air, it catches fire and turns to ash.

               A ripple of heat starts crawling up Liz's hands. Soon a pale 
               blue flame rings her entire arm.

                                     LIZ
                              (sobbing)
                         Not again, please, not again...

               Firelight glints off the crucifix.

               EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - DAY

               MOTHER is dunking the apples in a pot of caramel. A 
               heartbreaking cry reaches her ears.

                                     LIZ
                         Mommy! Mommy!

               Mother sees...

               EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - STEPS -  DAY

               Liz: outlined by licking flames!

                                     LIZ
                              (panicked)
                         Mommy! Help me! I'm burning!

               Mother screams, horrified.

                                     LIZ
                         Help meee!!!

               She then explodes. A white-hot supernova engulfs the 
               courtyard. Her mother's body burns like flash paper. Then 
               the rest of the people are --

               THE ENTIRE TENEMENT COURTYARD

               -- devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions. Benches, 
               people, trees. Everything. The four surrounding apartment 
               blocks collapse as a shock wave hits like a wrecking ball.

               The frame whites out. And at ground zero there is but one 
               figure left standing:

               Liz... a little girl, still crying.

                                                          FLASH FORWARD TO:

               INT. BELLAMIE HOSP. - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT

               Liz screams, her back arching, her body now in flames. Her 
               chest glows, silhouetting organs and ribs.

               The rubber bands on her wrist vaporize.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT

               The glow from Liz's room streams into the corridor.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

               In their glass kiosk, two ORDERLIES are listening to the 
               radio and sharing a pizza. A red light flashes repeatedly on 
               a panel.

               They silence the radio, grab their batons and get up. A low 
               rumble shakes the room.

               Through the VIBRATING glass window they see...

               CORRIDOR MINIATURE / COMPOSITE

               ...A BALL OF FLAME pushing inexorably through the corridor. 
               The inside of the glass booth is absolutely silent, making 
               the vision both terrifying and strangely serene.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Oh my --

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM (SET)- NIGHT

               As the glass explodes, the fire ROARS, drowning everything. 
               The orderlies hit the floor, taking cover under a shelf.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL (MINIATURE) - NIGHT

               The top floor blows up. Flame pours out of every window, 
               showering glass into the streets below.

               INT. B.P.R.D. - FREAK CORRIDOR "A" - DAY

               Myers pushes the breakfast cart. On it, three dozen pancakes 
               and a mound of bacon and toast.

               He opens the door to Hellboy´s den.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DAY

               Inside, Hellboy is leaning over Broom, glaring at the old 
               man.

                                     HELLBOY
                         How many buildings does she have to 
                         burn? She belongs here!

                                     BROOM
                         That's not how she feels. She may 
                         never feel it.

               Myers enters, deliberately clearing his throat. They ignore 
               him.

                                     BROOM
                         It's her choice --

               Broom grows silent.

               Hellboy stomps over to a mirror and -- using a hand-held 
               belt sander -- savagely shaves his horns. Sparks fly every 
               time he goes at the round stumps.

                                     HELLBOY

                         I can bring her back.

                              (chuckles)
                         What landed you this job, pushing 
                         "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was 
                         your area of expertise?

               Myers murmurs --

               Part of the building is demolished. Repair crews and firemen 
               are still hosing down smoldering piles of debris.

               Myers arrives in a taxi cab.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MAX. SECURITY WING - DAY

               Myers looks at LIZ through a see-through mirror. She sits on 
               a bench inside a padded cell. A security CAMERA AND MONITOR 
               records her constantly.

               A worried-looking Dr. Marsh stands alongside him.

                                     DOCTOR MARSH
                         She's been like this since it 
                         happened. There were no casualties. 
                         But it's put a big dent in our

                         Are you sure you want to go in?

               Myers nods, loosens his tie and enters.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - PADDED CELL - DAY

               Liz doesn't acknowledge Myers' presence. He kneels and looks 
               up at her.

               She looks at him. He offers his hand. She looks away.

               Liz turns to the 2-way mirror. Both their reflections are 
               there.

               lidless eyes glitter over a skull-like grin, made of raw 
               gums and taut skin.

               As Hellboy's pounding reaches his ears, he rises, like a 
               spider whose web has twitched. The mechanical hand rattles 
               blindly on the table.

               He opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving 
               depicting Sammael. Carefully places it on the table. Then he 
               opens a drawer and, from an envelope, takes two torn pieces 
               of paper. He puts them in a pouch in his belt.

               INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

               The wall collapses under Hellboy's attack.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Are you coming or not?

               Clay smiles uncertainly back. Hellboy moves in.

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

               A large oval room of rusting metal, with pipes spilling water 
               through a large GRATE on the floor.

               Abe studies it, senses something, and nods. With superhuman 
               effort, Hellboy lifts it. Hundreds of roaches pour out.

                                     ABE
                         I'm glad I'm not human. This place 
                         would be an embarrassment.

               Below, a vast cistern. Abe drops in two CHEMICAL FLARES.

               INT. UNDERWATER - CHAMBER (SET TANK) - DAY

               The flares sink, illuminating floating office furniture and 
               torn paper...

               INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION: R. WAREHOUSE CELLAR)

               In the lower depths, they pass shadowy industrial ruins. 
               Settling on the bottom they reveal the hulk of a waiting 
               SAMMAEL.

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

               Abe pulls off his breathing apparatus. Activates the locator 
               on his utility belt. Hellboy does likewise. BEEEP! The devices 
               synchronize.

               Hellboy extends a metal reliquary containing a small bone.

                                     HELLBOY
                         There you go, Doctor. This should 
                         cover your tailfin -- On loan from 
                         the Vatican, a bone from Saint 
                         Dionysius. Ugh. Looks like a pinky.

               Abe ties the reliquary around his hand.

                                     ABE
                         Remind me why I keep doing this.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.

                                     ABE
                         Oh, right --

               As transparent nictomembrane lids cover his eyes, Abe dives.

               INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 - (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY

               Underwater, ABE finds an entire control room. 1940's magazines 
               float by, like paper jellyfish. The amber light of the 
               chemical flares gives the room an eerie other-worldly feel.

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

               Waiting above, Hellboy chews a Baby Ruth and pokes around. 
               Finds a pile of children's shoes covering some yellowing 
               albums. In the albums, a myriad of sad faces, the orphans 
               from the past.

               Some of the faces have been cut out. There's an unfinished 
               letter to Father Christmas, dated 1866.

               Clay stands below a grate, admiring his hair implants with a 
               hand mirror.

                                     CLAY
                         See? It's thicker. Isn't it? It's 
                         not that doll-hair thing --

               Suddenly, something moves. Hellboy shines his light into an 
               adjoining tunnel. Kroenen is standing there, like a deer 
               caught in headlights.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Son of a -- !

               The figure darts away. Hellboy tears after it, gun in hand.

                         Red, wait!

                         Red's on the move!! I'll cover him!!

               He pulls out his gun and runs after Hellboy.

               INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY

               Clay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels. The glow 
               of Hellboy's flashlight is visible somewhere ahead, his 
               booming footsteps rapidly receding. A veritable labyrinth.

                                     CLAY
                         Damn it, Red.

               INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R. WAREHOUSE) - DAY

               Abe nears the bottom of the cistern. As his feet touch bottom, 
               a cloud of silt fogs the water. He picks out a translucent 
               egg!

               Suddenly, something big glides by. Abe turns: sees nothing.

               He places the egg in a glass canister. Now eggs are floating 
               everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies. 
               Abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one.

               Some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines.

               Abe's reliquary gets caught in a lever and snaps loose!! It 
               lands --

               on a grate on the floor. Abe swims down and tries to grab 
               it, but it falls through. Abe curses and stands up --

               -- only to find himself FACE TO FACE with Sammael!!

               The monster rakes Abe across the chest; dark blue blood begins 
               to flow. Abe shoves himself into a long, concrete fissure.

               Sammael can't fit through, but the tongue darts out, missing 
               Abe by inches. Sammael scratches at the walls, trying to 
               reach deeper, screaming in rage.

               Abe screams too, emitting a trail of bubbles.

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM - DAY

               The bubbles burst on the surface. Watching them is a SECOND 
               SAMMAEL.

               INT. INTERSECTION (LOCATION /BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) - DAY

               Hellboy stops, disoriented. No trace of KROENEN. He sniffs 
               the air, then steps through a non-descript portal.

               INT. (LOCATION/BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY

               Hellboy stands in Kroenen's quarters. An array of gas masks 
               dangle from ducts overhead. Glued next to the walls are dozens 
               of old photos of children.

               He discovers the Sammael engraving.

                                     HELLBOY
                         "Sammael: seed of destruction. Death 
                         becomes the fertile ground."

               Suddenly: drool drops from above: Sammael hangs from a beam.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (turning)
                         Didn't I kill you already?

               Sammael lunges, hurling Hellboy through an open service 
               shaft...

               ...and it's a long way down.

               When Sammael leaps, Hellboy throws him over the edge. Sammael, 
               however, grabs Hellboy's tail and pulls him over the side.

               another passage. There they bounce off of dripping water 
               pipes and jutting steel I beams, until they finally break 
               through a mesh/insulation ceiling and directly onto --

               INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM STATION - DAY

               A subway platform. Full of people.

               The two fighting creatures land on the ticket booth -- in an 
               explosion of coins, glass and steel!!! Some bold New Yorker 
               in the crowd start picking up handfuls of change.

               The dust clears, revealing a large crater in the platform 
               floor.

               Sammael hits Hellboy. The Red Giant lands on a line of 
               turnstiles, uprooting them all.

               Sammael flies through the air, unfolds its bone scythe. 
               Hellboy rolls away. Sammael misses: the tip imbeds itself in 
               the floor and then -- TCHAKKK!!! -- in a concrete column. 
               Sammael pulls, bringing down part of the ceiling. More SCREAMS 
               from the fleeing public.

               A mezzanine above Hellboy collapses, bringing the ceiling, 
               steel cables and office furniture down onto the Red Giant.

               Sammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars --

               Then, BAMMMMMM!!! A desk flies up into the air. Hellboy's 
               stone hand emerges, triumphant.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hey, Chunk-face!

               He climbs out of the crater. Sammael growls.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You can do better than that. Big 
                         monster like you.

               Hellboy rips off one of the turnstile bars and hits Sammael 
               again and again.

                                     HELLBOY
                         See? It hurts! You shouldn't hit 
                         people!

               Sammael blocks the last hit and throws the bar away. It embeds 
               itself in the tile wall.

               Sammael punches Hellboy, a hard uppercut.

               Hellboy flies up, crashing through the plate glass of a second  
               mezzanine above the platform. He skids on the tile floor, 
               scraping a jagged line with his stone hand.

               He slides past a group of BYSTANDERS and into a row of backlit 
               subway ads. He lands in a shower of glass and debris on a 
               wooden bench, breaking it in two.

               Sammael climbs up into the mezzanine.

               Hellboy gets up -- his back bristling with glass shards -- 
               and hears a WAIL: a YOUNG GIRL is pointing at A BOX OF KITTENS 
               abandoned on a bench.

                                     YOUND GIRL
                         My kittens!! My kittens!!!

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, crap.

               Sammael charges!!! Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!! 
               Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench.

               Next, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking 
               citizens.

               Illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances, 
               blood dripping from his forehead and nose.

               Hellboy starts to reload, but -- Sammael's tongue shoots 
               out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and -- traps 
               the tongue with his stone hand --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Second date. No tongue!!

               -- while catching the box with his tail. The kittens are 
               fine.

               Using the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window.

               Sammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself 
               and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel. 
               From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged 
               glass.

               Sammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel.

               Hellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is 
               millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems 
               lost, when...

               WHAAAAA!!!!!! A train appears out of nowhere heading straight 
               for Sammael.

               It splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on. 
               Sammael's body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks.

               Hellboy approaches Sammael, whose remains are wreathed in 
               BLACK flame. A huge CROWD looks on from the end of the 
               platform.

               He moves away. The BLACK flame flickers out.

               Under the water, BLACK light blooms within TWO OF SAMMAEL'S 
               EGGS as a fantastic methamorphosis starts. The embryos burst 
               out, gyrating in the water, swelling and distending.

               Badly wounded, Abe peers from his hiding spot. Sammael's not 
               there.

               He quickly swims to the surface, his weird blue blood trailing 
               behind him. The water boils with energy and BLACK LIGHT.

               Shaking, Abe pushes his belt locator and collapses.

               Back in the tunnel, Quarry and moss move filing cabinets and 
               rotten bozes full of files. One of them gives out and papers 
               spill all over.

                         Moss, what the hell was that?

               Then, TWO SILHOUETTES cast long shadows. Powerful footfalls 
               boom like thunderclaps.

               Agent Quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes. 
               Useless: the things plow on.

               Moss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower. After a few 
               seconds, a green light beeps, READY.

               The muzzle of the flamethrower vomits a 30 feet long gout of  
               fire into the blackness.

               The men pause: silence!

               Quarry turns on his flashlight, hand trembling.

               BAM!!! SAMMAEL'S TONGUE uncurls from the shadows and lands 
               on Quarry's face, pulling him into the dark. His flashlight 
               bobbles and strobes, lighting up a nightmare:

               TWO SAMMAELS stand in the tunnel. One of them gleefully 
               squeezes Quarry. The man's screams are muffled by the 
               creature's fleshy lips wrapping around his head.

               Moss runs as fast as he can, jumping and tumbling through an 
               obstacle course of beams. Turning, he readies the 
               flamethrower. The SECOND SAMMAEL lands on Moss's back, 
               breaking his spine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

               Hellboy enters to find Abe, bleeding but alive, leaning 
               against the tile, blue blood all around him. Hellboy tries 
               his walkie-talkie. Turns on his locator. It sparks. It's 
               damaged and broken.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (into his walkie-talkie)
                         We need an ambulance. Now!! Over!!

               INT. CENTER OF THE TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY

               Clay stumbles around, lost. He stops under a grate.

                                     HELLBOY'S VOICE
                              (on the walkie-talkie)
                         Who's there? Clay? Come in, someone.

                                     CLAY
                         Clay, Code 30, this is Clay, over...

               Behind Clay, Kroenen drops down from an overhead pipe, through 
               shafts of gray light. He brings forth his customary long 
               blade. Clay turns in time to see Kroenen coming at him. He 
               fires. Kroenen stabs.

               Twin rivulets of blood run from Clay's nostrils. 

               INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH - CONNECTING SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

               Hellboy hears the gunfire, starts running.

               INT. CENTER OF THE TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET)

               Clay falls to the floor.

               Kroenen stands there, unfazed by Clay's bullets in his chest. 
               Dust pours from his wounds and piles up neatly at his feet. 
               He hears Hellboy coming.He places the knife on the floor, 
               then lies down and plays dead.

               Hellboy appears at the end of the tunnel. He glances at 
               Kroenen's body, then quickly checks for a pulse on Clay.

               Hellboy looks demolished.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. TAXI CAB (MOVING) / EXT. BPRD ADJACENT AVENUE - DAY

               An ethnic pop song blasts from the taxi radio. Liz pokes her 
               head out of the window and shoots a Polaroid snapshot. She 
               passes it to Myers:

                                     LIZ
                         It feels good to be outside!! It's 
                         been so long...

               He can't hear her over the music. Myers knocks on the 
               bulletproof acrylic divider.

                                     MYERS
                         Hey!! The music!! Turn down the 
                         music!!

                                     DRIVER
                         Yeah, yeah, music!!

               He merely changes the radio station; the music stays at the 
               same volume. Myers looks back at Liz.

               She is halfway out the window, sitting on the door.

                                     MYERS
                         Jesus! That's not -- That's not safe, 
                         Miss Sherman -- Miss Sherman?

               She takes another Polaroid and passes it down to him. Myers 
               looks at the Polaroid, then smiles. He climbs out of the 
               other window, hands her the photograph.

                                     MYERS
                         Nice view --

               He waves at her. For the first time, she smiles.

                                     MYERS
                         A smile, huh? That's good.

               She takes his picture. With the cold morning wind blowing 
               Liz's hair and the sun on her face, she looks beautiful.

                                     LIZ
                         Don't get used to it.

               Myers taps his fingers on the roof, to the beat of the music. 
               He can't take his eyes off her. They drive towards the BPRD.

               INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - DAY

               Unconscious, Abe floats in a special tank. LED strips read 
               water temperature, pH level, etc. He's encased in a bio-cast: 
               a cybernetic healing unit wrapped around his thorax and right 
               arm. A web of tubes and hoses keeps him in place.

               SHIRTLESS and bandaged, Hellboy sits and studies him, as if 
               in a trance.

                                     MANNING'S VOICE
                         He'll make it --

               Hellboy turns, Manning is there:

                                     MANNING
                         But not everyone was so lucky.
                              (beat)
                         Two agents died today. Clay probably 
                         won't survive the night. You're 
                         reckless.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I knew those men better than you did --

                                     MANNING
                         Ah, I see. That makes it all alright 
                         then.

               He turns to leave. Hellboy gets up.

                                     HELLBOY
                         No, it doesn't make it right, but I 
                         stopped that creature, didn't I?

                                     MANNING
                         That's what you do. That's why we 
                         need you. You have an insight.
                              (beat)
                         You know monsters.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What are you trying to say?

                                     MANNING
                         In the end, after you've killed and 
                         captured every freak out there -- 
                         there's still one left: you.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (a deep sigh)
                         I wish I could be more gracious but --

               BAMMMMM!!!! He smashes a metal LOCKER with his stone hand 
               and raises it above his head.

               Manning cowers, realizing that Hellboy's rage is a dangerous 
               thing.

               INT. B.P.R.D. - MAIN HALL AREA - DAY

               A new space. Office corridors radiate out from a brass 
               B.P.R.D. logo on the floor. A few agents monitor computer 
               stations and tactical glass boards.

               Liz and Myers walk in, carrying her suitcases. She looks 
               around and sees BROOM coming down the hall.

                                     BROOM
                         Welcome back.

                                     LIZ
                         It's only for the weekend, Professor 
                         Broom. Then I'll be on my way --

                                     BROOM
                              (impeccable courtesy)
                         Come and go as you please.
                              (beat)
                         Find your way back. We've made quite 
                         a few changes --

               CRASH!!! Liz screams and Myers draws his gun. Smashing through 
               a glass partition, the mangled steel LOCKER lands in the 
               middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs.

               Next, Manning appears, retreating but unharmed.

                                     MANNING
                              (gasping)
                         I want that thing locked up, starting 
                         now -- Now!!! You hear me??!!

               He flees.

                                     LIZ
                              (to Broom)
                         Nothing's changed. Home, sweet home.

               Mortified, Broom hurries after Manning. Hellboy calmly steps 
               through the hole in the wall.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (seeing her)
                         Liz? Liz!!

               She spins on her heel and walks off. Hellboy turns to Myers.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You!!! You did it, buddy --

               Myers holsters his gun and follows Liz. Hellboy is all alone 
               now.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (oblivious)
                         Woo hoo!!

               INT. B.P.R.D. - LIZ'S ROOM - DAY

               A familiar cell. Fireproof insulation covers the walls. Liz 
               throws her bags on the bed. Myers lingers in the doorway.

               She reflexively pulls on one of the rubber bands on her wrist, 
               then lets it snap.

                                     LIZ
                         A little something I learned in 
                         therapy. I'm depressed --
                              (snaps a rubber band)
                         One rubber band. I'm impatient: two 
                         rubber bands...

               He sits by her side on the bed.

                                     MYERS
                         I'll get you a fresh pack.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DUSK

               A cat bats at a ball of paper. On it, two words are visible: 
               DEAR LIZ. Hellboy's tail scoops up the paper and throws it 
               in a brimming wastebasket.

               He's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration, 
               writing with evident difficulty. The floor around him is 
               covered with more crumpled pages. In the background, the 
               projector is showing DUCK SOUP. Myers pushes in a cartload 
               of CHILI.

                                     MYERS
                         Where do you --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Shh! Just a second.

               Myers sets the tray on the table.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Myers, you're a talker. What's a 
                         good word -- a solid word for "need" --

                                     MYERS
                         "Need" is a good, solid word.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Nah, sounds too "needy."

                                     MYERS
                         Start in, you got nachos coming.

               As he goes out, Liz appears in the doorway. Hellboy quickly 
               stops writing.

                                     LIZ
                              (notices the small 
                              feline army)
                         Oh, my God... Look at them all! Who 
                         had babies? C'mere, Tiger...!

               Liz plays with a cat. Hellboy lifts the piece of paper, which 
               looks like a postage stamp in his stone hand.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Um... Liz -- I -- there's something 
                         I'd like you to -- something I need 
                         you to hear.

                                     LIZ
                         Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, 
                         but --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Out? Out out?

                                     LIZ
                         For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, 
                         read.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You're going alone?

                                     LIZ
                         No. Myers is taking me.

               Hellboy stands up, walks towards her.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Him!! Why him? Why not me?

               Myers walks back in pushing a tray of nachos.

                                     MYERS
                              (to Hellboy)
                         Hey, your chili's getting cold --

                                     HELLBOY
                              (sits back down)
                         Not hungry.

                                     LIZ
                         What did you want me to hear -- ?

               Hellboy folds the paper.

                                     HELLBOY
                         It's nothing. Just a list -- It's 
                         not finished --

                                     LIZ
                         Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.

               She leaves. Myers smiles.

                                     MYERS
                         Anything else you --

                                     HELLBOY

               Under a sheet, Kroenen's cold, naked body lies on a slab. 
               Broom talks into a tape recorder.

                         The subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen --

               The visible areas of the body make us grateful for the sheet 
               covering the rest.

                         Both eyelids were surgically removed 
                         along with his upper and lower lips, 
                         making speech impossible. The blood 
                         in his veins dried up decades ago. 
                         Only dust remains.

                         Four pulverized vertebrae. A steel 
                         rod inserted into his pelvis held 
                         him up.

               He finds the small pieces of paper Kroenen planted in his 
               pouch.

               Under the gaze of high-security cameras, AGENT LIME rolls 
               Hellboy's food cart down the corridor and into the domed 
               intersection. He whistles a happy tune. Opens the high 
               security door.

               Lime's jaw drops.

               Across the room, one of the walls has been completely 
               demolished, revealing a SERVICE SHAFT.

               No sign of Hellboy.

               Myers and Liz leave a coffee shop, strolling down the street. 
               Myers hands Liz her coffee. They chat and laugh. He pushes 
               his Moped. She has her Polaroid with her.

                         so fascinating?? So important?? 

               EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREETS - NIGHT

               Liz and Myers pause at a corner, waiting for the light. The 
               shops are closing.

                         for their defects.

               Liz half-smiles, sips her coffee.

                         Don't know. Really. I grew up with 
                         him.
                              (beat)
                         I've missed him too, but now, every 
                         time I see him, I get confused. Hardly 
                         a day goes by he's not in my mind. 
                         Even now, I feel he's here --

               As they walk down the street. A red streak jumps over roof 
               tops.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Hellboy lands neatly on the adjacent roof. He looks down at 
               Myers and Liz --

               Myers offers her cream and sugar.

                                     HELLBOY
                         No cream and sugar, moron. She takes 
                         it black.

               She takes the coffee, waves off the half and half.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Toldya.

               Trying to feel superior, Hellboy chuckles. As they walk, Liz 
               gestures vigorously. His smile fades.

                         Coffee's warming me up.

               By now, all the shops are closed. They approach a small park 
               near a train track.

                         entertainment capital of the world.

               She cleans off a wet, dirty bench, sits down.

                                     LIZ
                         You offered me a cup of coffee. I've 
                         got one, so just sit down.

               Myers is falling for her.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

               Hellboy leaps off a building.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Two red hands appear over the rooftop parapet. Cursing, 
               Hellboy hauls himself up. He finds himself next to a pigeon 
               coop where a YOUNG KID is feeding the birds.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hi...

               The kid stares at him.

                                     KID
                         You're Hellboy.

                         Shh. I'm... on a mission.

               He watches as Liz and Myers sit on the bench.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't tell anyone, huh?

               Broom examines the damage to the wall. He turns to see 
               Hellboy's locator belt hanging on the wall. Broom shakes his 
               head.

                         No. Enough. He will never change --

               INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT

               Kroenen's body lies on the table. Slowly, his chest starts 
               to rise and fall. He sits up.

               His arm stump docks into the prosthetic hand -- Click! He 
               flexes the shiny fingers.

               Kroenen's hideous cranium is visible for an instant before 
               he zips up his mask. He takes the sharp Ragnarok knives and 
               turns one over. It reflects a figure standing behind him: 
               Grigory.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               The pigeon kid walks towards Hellboy, carrying two glasses 
               of milk and a plate of cookies.

                                     KID
                         My Mom baked 'em.

               He sits by Hellboy's side as he watches Liz and Myers chatting 
               and laughing.

                                     HELLBOY
                         That's it: she's laughing. I'm done.

               Hellboy grabs three cookies off the plate and scarfs them 
               down.

                                     KID

                         Come on! Look at him, those shifty 
                         eyes, that -- phony grin...!!
                              (seeing the last cookie)
                         You gonna eat that?

               Below, Myers yawns. Hellboy slaps his forehead.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Oh, the yawning trick. That's so 
                         1950's! Watch his arm --

               He looks around, picks up a pebble, hefts it.

               Myers stretches and places his hand and arm behind her back. 
               Something hits him in the head.

                                     MYERS
                         Hey! What the hell?

               He gets up, annoyed. No one in sight.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Hellboy snickers, hiding and chewing a cookie. The Kid "gives 
               him five".

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Kroenen's two pieces of paper are joined together under a 
               MICRO-SCANNER. Broom watches as computer enhancement fills 
               out a couple of missing areas.

               Cyrillic letters are now legible.

               Broom pulls out a few old photos. Finds one of Grigory in 
               German uniform, and in a book, another of Grigory in an 
               Orthodox priest's black cassock.

               He pulls out his old wooden box, pulls out a dusty book from 
               it. His fingers scan the text, finding Rasputin's date of 
               birth, date of death. They pause at a particular line: "His 
               mausoleum is at SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16".

               TCHK!! A noise -- Broom turns in time to see Kroenen 
               delicately descending a spiral staircase, blade in hand. In 
               spite of all his experience, Broom is shaken.

               In the dark, a voice hisses --

                         Very good, Professor Broom.

               Broom turns. Grigory steps from the shadows.

               The ruins of New York, charred, smoldering. Human remains 
               litter the landscape. Monstrous shapes lumber in the 
               distance... an army of apocalyptic beasts outlined against 
               the blood-red sky.

               Dominating the horror is a mountain of festering skeletons 
               and skulls. At the top, a figure: HELLBOY, transformed. His 
               horns are in full bloom, his eyes and mouth stream unearthly 
               fire.

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Startled, Broom snaps out of it --

                         If only you had him destroyed sixty 
                         years ago, none of this would come 
                         to pass. But, then, how could you 
                         have known?

               Broom is speechless.

                         Your God chooses to remain silent. 
                         Mine lives within me.

               Rasputin stands, the flesh of his neck and shoulders heaving 
               and twitching beneath his human skin.

                                     GRIGORY
                         In the frozen waters of the Malaya 
                         Nevka, in the darkness of the void: 
                         every time I died and crossed over, 
                         a little more of the Master came 
                         back with me. He disclosed to me the 
                         child's true name... Would you like 
                         to know it??

                                     BROOM
                         I know what to call him. Nothing you 
                         can say or do will change that. I 
                         call him son.

               Discreetly, Broom removes his rosary and places it on the 
               book. Kroenen settles in behind him.

                                     BROOM
                         I am ready.

                         Good. Now, I'll add two crumbs more:
                              (Kroenen displays his 
                              knives)
                         Grief and revenge...

               Kroenen's knife goes in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               The pigeons flutter on the rooftop.

               The pigeon kid sits by Hellboy's side.

                                     KID
                         Just go down there and tell her how 
                         you feel!
                              (Hellboy shakes his 
                              head: no)
                         My mom says --

                                     HELLBOY
                         It's not that easy, okay?
                              (beat)
                         Plus, you're nine. You're not old 
                         enough to give me advice.

                         Who are those guys??

               Hellboy turns and sees --

               TWO of the black B.P.R.D. Sedan cars rounds the corner.

               Agent Lime bounds out of one of the vehicles, grabbing Myers, 
               talking rapidly. Liz screams, covers her ears.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Something's wrong --

               OMIT

               INT. B.P.R.D. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Agents and Bureau employees are crammed into Broom's office 
               doorway. Hellboy, face contorted by grief, pushes through.

               INT. BROOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The room is full of forensics people taking pictures, picking 
               up evidence, etc. Tom Manning is there. Seeing Hellboy, he 
               respectfully steps back.

               Broom's fragile body lies slumped in his chair. At his feet, 
               a pool of blood. Liz enters, then stifles a whimper.

               With tears in his eyes, a disbelieving Hellboy looks at Liz, 
               then at his dead father. He holds Broom's body close to his 
               chest.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Father -- I'm back. I'm back. I'm 
                         back.

               Manning herds everybody out. From the door, Liz blinks back 
               tears as the red giant kneels by the body: a dog with a lost 
               master.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I wasn't here. You died alone --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BPRD BUILDING - DAY

               It's raining like hell.

               The PALLBEARERS, Manning and Myers among them, load Broom's 
               casket into a HEARSE. Flanking it are two rows of BPRD agents.

               The hearse doors close and the vehicle pulls away.

               Watching like a gargoyle from a distant roof: Hellboy. Rain 
               bounces off his wet overcoat.

               Liz observes him, worried.

                                     LIZ'S VOICE
                         He hasn't spoken to anyone in three 
                         days. Not a word. He doesn't eat, he 
                         doesn't sleep...

               INT. MEDICAL BAY - DAY

               Abe, conscious now, but still in the cast, floats upside 
               down, solving a RUBIK'S CUBE. Liz stands by the tank.

                                     LIZ
                         I've never seen him like this. Never.

                         Should I stay? With him, I mean?

               She smiles faintly.

                         Listen -- I'm not much of a problem 
                         solver...
                              (displays the cube)
                         Three decades and I've only gotten 
                         two sides.
                              (beat)
                         But I know this much: if there's 
                         trouble -- all we have is each other. 
                         And I'm stuck here.
                              (beat)
                         So -- Take care of the big monkey 
                         for me, will you?

               Their hands almost touch, separated only by the glass.

               Myers spots Liz walking past the conference room.

               INT. BROOM'S OFFICE - DUSK 

               Hellboy stands before Broom's desk, pensive, his naked chest 
               bandaged.

               Liz watches him from across the room. He finds Broom's rosary 
               on top of the book. Reads the underlined phrase on the page.

                                     LIZ
                         Hi --

               He turns to her. She slowly comes towards him.

                         I've changed my mind. I'll come to 
                         Moscow. If you -- are still going --

               Hellboy nods, then clears his throat.

                         about me. I do. What I am makes you

               decay. Rotting warehouses line the street like dead steel 
               watchdogs. No one's around but a few lonely sentries.

               A limo and motorcycle caravan are waved through the security 
               gates.

               A metal door trundles back and the limo and escort motorcycles  
               enter.

               Fleshy Russian General -- LAPIKOV -- gets out of the limo. 
               Then Ilsa and Grigory.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         I have accumulated many objects of 
                         great interest. Preserving our 
                         heritage.

               The warehouse contains a world of bric-a-brac: a towering 
               marble LENIN HEAD, Old Master paintings, tanks, warheads, 
               missiles, etc.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         Many -- like me -- believe Mother 
                         Russia to be very close to a historic 
                         rebirth.

               They stop before a cargo container. With a butane torch, a 
               soldier melts away the lead Kremlin seal, then open the doors.

                         June 30th, 1908. It burned hundreds 
                         of square miles of forest. The 
                         Romanovs took possession of it 
                         immediately. The Czar guarded it 
                         jealously -- I have wanted it for 
                         ages.

               Grigory's fingers brush over its smooth, perfect surface. At 
               the center --

               -- TWO CIRCULAR IMPRINTS that match Hellboy's four-fingered 
               stone hand.

                         You are aware, of course, there's no 
                         way you'll get it out of Russian 
                         territory.

                         He is aware.

               Ilsa brings out a chrome box, full of gold.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         It's a pleasure doing business with 
                         you. Perhaps you have other interests.

               Grigory's voice drips with serene brutality.

                         you pop one, two come out. You kill 
                         two, you get four. You kill four, 
                         you're in trouble. We have to nail 
                         'em all at once. And the eggs.

                         We've installed a very handy timer.

                         I won't take 'em. They never work.

               Manning looks at Hellboy, irate.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Two gleaming black vans and a truck move through snow-covered 
               Soviet roads.

               Super:  VOLOKOLAMSK FIELDS, MOSCOW.

               EXT./INT. COUNTRYSIDE - IN THE TRUCK CAB - DAY

               Myers and LIZ struggle with a Moscow map.

                         Sparky to Big Red...

               Popping her head out of the window, Liz looks back at the 
               truck bed.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK BED - DAY

               Fastened to it, the crate labelled: LIVE CARGO. Small 
               breathing holes have been drilled in the sides.

                                     HELLBOY'S VOICE
                         Sparky?? Who came up with that? Myers?

               EXT./INT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK CAB- DAY

               Liz snickers.

                         We're almost there.

               INT. INSIDE THE CARGO BOX - DAY

               Hellboy, sitting on the floor, in the dark.

                                     LIZ'S VOICE
                              (on radio)
                         We're leaving the main road, so hang 
                         on --

               They hit a series of bumps. The box rattles and shakes. 
               Hellboy bangs his head. The vehicle lurches to a halt.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (on the radio)
                         This better be the place or I'll 
                         puke.

               Motors are turned off. The crate is opened. Liz peeks in.

                         Come out and see.

               EXT. 19TH CENTURY CEMETERY - DAY

               Hellboy steps out. Takes a moment to adjust his eyes to the 
               light.

               19TH CENTURY CEMETERY (MATTE SHOT / COMPOSITE)

               Broken spiked fences succumb to rust and dead vines. Endless 
               rows of crypts and tombstones poke through wild foliage.

               Our group plus TWO AGENTS (Lime and Stone) venture into the 
               labyrinthine lanes of the dead. Each carries a backpack, a 
               flashlight and a gun.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY - MAUSOLEUM SECTION (LOCATION) - DAY

               Later. The group gathers in frustration in an area of baroque 
               funerary monuments. Myers -- carrying the explosive belts -- 
               looks around.

                                     MANNING
                         Forget it. This is practically a 
                         city. And it stinks, and it's muddy. 
                         We'll go back, check into a hotel, 
                         regroup after breakfast. We'll have 
                         to make a grid, go by quadrants. 
                         Maybe satellite photography.

               He gestures and all the agents head for the vans.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Let me ask for directions.

               EXT. OPEN GRAVE - DAY

               The group surrounds a grave. Hellboy raises the broken stone 
               cover and then jumps in.

               EXT. OPEN GRAVE (SET) - DAY

               -- and lands on a rotten coffin. In it, a mummified corpse 
               lies in a miserable black suit.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (whispers)
                         Animam edere, animus corpus...

               He presses the amulet on the cadaver's forehead. For a moment, 
               nothing, and then...

               ...a brutal spasm!! The corpse gasps, breathes... and mutters 
               something in tongueless Russian. SUBTITLE: WHAT DO YOU WANT?

               EXT. MOSCOW CEMETERY (LOCATION) - DAY

               The group gawks as Hellboy climbs out, carrying the CORPSE 
               on his back. With an ear-to-ear grin, he approaches the team.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Sixty feet further, comrades, and 
                         three rows in...

               The corpse fidgets on Hellboy's back. Its bony hand weakly 
               points, as if in confirmation.

                                     HELLBOY
                         This here is Ivan Klimentovich: Say 
                         "hi" Ivan.

               The corpse mutters again. SUBTITLED: GO THAT WAY, RED MONKEY.

               EXT. CEMETERY - YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM (LOCATION) - DAY

               A miniature black marble castle. Using a crowbar, Myers pries 
               open the ancient steel door. Hellboy, still carrying the 
               desiccated abomination on his back, walks in.

               OMIT

               INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM STAIRS - LATER - DAY

               Two agents stand guard in the mausoleum, while the group 
               descends carefully. The walls are dotted with yellowed skulls.

               INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM - UNDERGROUND - STAIRCASE

               Myers' flashlight flickers. He shakes it back to life.

               INT. UNDERGROUND - UNDERGROUND INTERSECTION

               They reach the bottom of the staircase: three corridors branch 
               off in different directions. Hellboy deposits the CORPSE 
               attop a pile of coffins.

                                     HELLBOY
                         We'll be alright... as long as we 
                         don't separate --

               INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR AND INTERSECTION - DAY

               TCHKANGGG!!!!! large spiked metal plates shoot up from below, 
               blocking both their way out, demolishing the staircase and 
               ramming Stone: he's gone.

               Wicked spikes cover the metal surface. Hellboy still bangs 
               on it, but to no avail: it's at least six inches thick. Liz 
               and Myers are on the other side.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (into his walkie-talkie)
                         Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn 
                         on your locators -- Anyone sees

                         ...Polo.

               On the other side of the panel, Myers takes the radio from 
               Liz.

                                     MYERS
                              (into radio)
                         Are you sure about this?

                                     HELLBOY
                         On a scale of one to ten: two. But --
                              (beat)
                         -- she'll take care of you, Myers. 
                         She's a tough one.

               Liz and Myers move off. Hellboy shines his light down the 
               tunnel on the left. Agent Lime picks up the corpse and 
               follows.

               INT. TUNNEL "A" / CHAMBER - DAY

               Hellboy and Manning come into a vast chamber: Slavic motifs 
               crown the rugged stone pillars and archways. Water runs down 
               the walls.

               Across a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal 
               structure.

               They step onto the bridge. KLANGGG!!! two gears release a 
               steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead.

               Somewhere, a  massive clockwork is TICKING.

                                     MANNING
                         What's that --

               Hellboy motions for silence. The CORPSE mutters: "IT'S 
               SOMETHING BIG"

               They stare into the darkness.

                                     MANNING
                         We should go back -- you -- you could 
                         tear that door apart --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't move. We --

                                     MANNING
                         -- should go back. Now!

                                     HELLBOY
                         No. Don't --

                                     MANNING
                         I'm in charge. We go back!

               Hellboy yanks Manning just in time. BAMMM!!!! A gigantic 
               metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the 
               bridge a few feet from their feet. It takes Lime and the 
               CORPSE with it.

               Another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Son of a --

               Whoosh! The PENDULUM swings back. It destroys more of the 
               bridge. Manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under 
               the door.

               Hellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his 
               feet.

               The pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the 
               bridge just as Hellboy rolls under the door --

               -- and makes it into the hexagonal building.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Hellboy and Manning find themselves in a very narrow, arched 
               stone corridor. Its walls are lined with endless rows of 
               rusty steel blades.

               Faint traces of WAGNER can be heard. They cautiously 
               proceed...

               INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               There. In yellow gaslight, Kroenen nods attentively as a 
               phonograph plays the love duet from TRISTAN UND ISOLDE.

               Above him, ropes, hooks and pulleys.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Manning rest his hand too close to a blade.

                                     MANNING
                         Ouch!!

               INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               Kroenen comes alert. He scans the room, quietly winds himself 
               up.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Hellboy shoots a dirty look at Manning and then looks back 
               into the chamber --

               -- Kroenen is gone.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (to Manning)
                         Crap. This guy moves like a cockroach --

               Hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab.

               INT.  HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               Hellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor. 
               Manning moves along behind him.

               The record finishes playing. Silence --

               SWISH!!! Kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping 
               into Manning's arm. As Kroenen goes in for the kill -- 

               -- Hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. Kroenen 
               bears down but Hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate 
               blocks.

               Kroenen hauls out one of his long swords.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Screw that.

               Hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. BAMMMM!!!! 
               He punches Kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask, 
               smashing its lenses.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You killed my father --

               BAMMM!!!! another hit.

               Kroenen staggers back with each blow. Finally, the mask falls 
               off.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Give your soul to God, Your ass is 
                         mine.

               An asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face. Kroenen is 
               laughing.

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               BAM!!! Under his feet, a huge trapdoor falls open. He and 
               Manning drop through, along with the phonograph.

               Hellboy grabs a rope. It spins through a copper pulley, but 
               a large knot jerks him to a stop. Hellboy snatches Manning's 
               hand, but loses his backpack.

               He looks down. The phonograph hits the ground with a crash.

                                     MANNING
                              (panting, whispers)
                         Well, it's not that big a fall...

               KLANGGGG!!!!! The entire bottom bristles with six-foot, 
               sparkling steel blades.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Kroenen cautiously leans over the pit. He can't hear a sound.

               As he peeks -- SWISH!! A loop of the rope wraps around his 
               neck and yanks him forward! Before he goes over, he 
               frantically digs his blades into the floor, anchoring himself.

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy has used the rope hanging below him as a lasso. 
               MANNING clings to his powerful back as he climbs up, hand 
               over hand.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Kroenen goes to cut the rope...

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

                                     HELLBOY
                              (reaching the top)
                         Oh, no you don't --

               Hellboy wraps the rope around his stone fist and, with a 
               brutal stone-fist yank, pulls KROENEN into the pit!

               With a horrible scream, Kroenen drops headfirst past them 
               and onto the spikes. He wriggles like a fish caught on a 
               hook, only making it worse, as he slides further down the 
               blades.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy climbs out and sits. Sees Kroenen's blade embedded 
               in the floor. Holding it: the prosthetic hand, still ticking.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy peers down. Still alive, Kroenen frees one arm, 
               slicing through his own ropy bicep.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You like playing possum, you Nazi 
                         pinhead?
                              (beat)
                         Then try playing dead.

               INT. BOTTOM OF HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy tips a massive cogwheel over the edge. Kroenen emits 
               a horrid scream as it crushes him.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Manning sits down, bandaging his injuries. Hellboy kneels 
               down.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Are you okay?

               Manning nods weakly. Hellboy brings out a cigar and fires up 
               his Zippo.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You'd better stay here. I'll find a 
                         way out. We'll come back for you.

                                     MANNING
                         You call that thing a cigar??

                                     HELLBOY
                         Yup.

                                     MANNING
                         You never, ever light a cigar that 
                         way.

               He digs out one of his fine cigars, cuts it and hands it to 
               HELLBOY.

                                     MANNING
                         Use a wooden match. It preserves the 
                         flavor.

               He lights it for him. Hellboy grins.

                                     MANNING
                         Thank you.

                                     HELLBOY

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND NARROW TUNNEL - DAY

               A narrow tunnel. Liz and Myers advance carefully.

               Just ahead, a cave-in. Pieces of ceiling, timber, coffins 
               and corpses form a chaotic barrier. As they squeeze past...

                                     MYERS
                         So, he thinks that you and I... That's 
                         why he's mad at me --

               A few bones roll by. Wet earth drops onto their shoulders. 
               They draw their arms close to their bodies, pointing their 
               flashlight beams straight down. A moment of strange intimacy.

                                     MYERS
                         But it's not true, is it?

                                     LIZ
                         What -- ?

                                     MYERS
                         That you feel that way about me.

                                     LIZ
                         You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? 
                         Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all 
                         the same.

               INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY

               Hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for 
               handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath.

               Light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly 
               hear Liz and Myers.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY

               Liz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel "B". They find 
               themselves calf-deep in brown water.

               Myers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone.

                                     MYERS
                         Watch out. It's slippery...

               His light shorts out. She shines her light past him.

                                     LIZ
                         Oh, my God...

               Myers turns. His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex 
               natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent 
               eggs.

               SAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand 
               still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils 
               constrict. A snarl...

               A SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself 
               off. A THIRD ONE raise its head.

               Myers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right 
               behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!!

               Myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up 
               the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers 
               falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured.

                                     LIZ
                              (into the radio)
                         Marco, Marco, Marco... Get your Big 
                         Red butt over here!

               Something stomps on the ceiling directly above them. Again 
               and again.

               INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY

               Hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!!

               The rocks below him start to crumble.

               EXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY

               In an "ANT FARM" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above, 
               pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY

               Dust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures 
               move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three 
               times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with 
               pebbles.

               One of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy 
               crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along 
               with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed.

               Two eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels 
               are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two 
               new ones. Liz sprints to safety.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two 
                         alone.

               Hellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz.

               Lit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One 
               clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy 
               howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a 
               zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back.

               Hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest 
               of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born. 
               They're FIVE.

               Hellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground. 
               A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy 
               is in trouble.

               Liz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her 
               body.

                                     LIZ
                              (at Myers)
                         Hit me.

                                     MYERS
                         What?

               Liz is desperate, crying.

                                     LIZ
                         Hit me --
                              (beat)
                         All of my life I've run away from 
                         it... Now I want it to happen! Do 
                         it.

               Hellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies. 
               Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers.

                                     MYERS
                         I can't, I --

               Liz slaps him.

                                     LIZ
                         I know now: I love him. I've always 
                         loved him.

               A beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face, 
               once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around 
               her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's.

                                     LIZ
                         Go now.

               Myers ducks behind a rock as Liz's arms blaze with fire.

               The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce.

               On top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion 
               hearing the hunter's gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees 
               Liz's body shake in a surge of white-hot energy.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (weak)
                         Liz...

               The water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of 
               fire expands.

               The fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA -  DAY

               The screen FADES TO WHITE and then...

               Silence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat.

               Hellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels. 
               The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He 
               stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried 
               in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground, 
               on her side, unconscious.

               Myers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly, 
               Hellboy turns around: In the eerie silence of his deafness, 
               he sees Grigory -- LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd 
               comedy.

               Ilsa approaches. And -- in a simple, brutal move -- hits him 
               with a hammer --

               FADE OUT / FADE IN

               OMIT

               INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden 
               yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church-
               like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding 
               swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR 
               SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar.

               Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on 
               the explosive belts.

               Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under 
               his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab 
               bought from Lapikov.

               Liz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial 
               robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy, 
               he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key.

                                     GRIGORY
                         "And I looked and beheld an Angel, 
                         and in his hand the key to the 
                         bottomless pit..."

               Hellboy tenses, rage building. The yoke creaks, but doesn't 
               bend.

                                     GRIGORY

                         These were the words I heard as a 
                         peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the 
                         door -- Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so 
                         that they might at long last enter 
                         our world.

                         doom!

               Hellboy studies the stone sculpture, its three HAND IMPRINTS --

                                     ILSA
                              (triumphant)

                         Open the locks.

               Hellboy stares at his huge right arm, as if for the first 
               time.

                                     MYERS
                         Don't do it!! Don't do it!!

               Ilsa kicks Myers in the face.

                         Silence!!

               The open dome above reveals the moon. An eclipse is beginning. 
               The altar's clockworks monitors its progress.

                                     ILSA

                         No.

               Grigory turns to Hellboy.

                                     GRIGORY
                         No?
                              (reasonable)
                         In exchange for her life then, open 
                         the door.

               In torment, Hellboy, shakes his head: no.

                                     GRIGORY
                         As you wish.

               He leans over Liz, whispers in her ear: Her body arches, her 
               mouth emits a plume of energy. Grigory greedily inhales it. 
               Then she goes limp.

                                     GRIGORY
                         She's dead.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Noooo! Noooo!!!

               He struggles again. One of the cuffs snaps. He swats Ilsa 
               with his free hand. She stumbles backwards. Now Hellboy fights 
               to free his other hand. Indifferent, Grigory watches the 
               eclipse.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Her soul awaits on the other side. 
                         If you want her back...
                              (beat)
                         Open the door and claim her.

               His head and heart racing, Hellboy struggles for an answer. 
               Can't find one... the moon is almost totally eclipsed.

               He drops his gaze. His voice a hoarse whisper.

                                     HELLBOY
                         For her.

               Grigory moves close to Hellboy. Rips the rosary off his wrist. 
               It lands near Myers.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Names hold the power and nature of 
                         things. Mine for example. Rasputin: 
                         "The crossroads."
                              (beat)
                         And crossroads I have become.
                              (beat)
                         Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat 
                         it. Become the key.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (closing his eyes)
                         Anung-un-Rama...

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy's stone arm glows. Ancient symbols of fire burn the 
               stone. Flames momentarily engulf his body.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy roars as his HORNS majestically burst forth! Out of 
               his mouth, energy and light boil like condensing breath on a 
               winter's night.

               Inebriated with power, the new PRINCE OF HELL smiles with 
               supreme arrogance. His shadow falls on the white marble of 
               the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone 
               turns black as obsidian.

                                     MYERS
                         No!! Don't do it!! Listen to me!!

               HELLBOY inserts his enormous paw into the FIRST IMPRINT on 
               the stone slab -- CLACK!! He turns it, like a lock.

               A beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky.

               EXT. VIEW FROM THE CITY - NIGHT

               Visible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon! 
               The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's 
               more intense, with ripples and haloes.

               INT. THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               Again, the infinite, starry space. Again, the OGDRU JAHAD. 
               The ruby beam pierces the darkness.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy watches as the FIRST IMPRINT disappears. In its place: 
               a burning glyph.

               Myers struggles with his bindings. The rough hemp cuts his 
               skin, but he manages to free one hand.

               EXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs 
               uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the 
               frame.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He 
               turns it.

               Myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it --

               INT. THE SKY - NIGHT

               IN THE STORM CLOUDS, LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES GARGANTUAN 
               TENTACLES REACHING INTO THE EARTHLY PLANE.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs.

                                     GRIGORY
                         The final seal. Open it!

               Hellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn 
               it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers 
               her full in the face. She staggers back and down.

                                     MYERS
                              (to Hellboy)
                         Remember who you are!!!

               He throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy 
               catches it. It smokes in his hand.

               He tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts.

               Hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint 
               of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory.

               With a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with 
               both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the 
               stumps.

               He stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees, 
               holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn.

               The final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers 
               and the connection with the moon is broken.

               Ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent. 
               The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended.

               Grigory crumples in agony.

               The burning glyphs in Hellboy's stone hand dim down, his 
               features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet.

                                     GRIGORY
                         You will never fulfill your destiny. 
                         You will never understand the power 
                         inside you.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I can live with that.

               He breaks Myers' chains, helps him up.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy painfully takes Liz's limp body in his arms. Myers 
               stands by his side.

               He kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down 
               the steps.

               Myers steps on something. He looks under his foot: A smashed 
               GLASS EYE. Then... out of the silence, a WHISPER.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Child...

               Hellboy turns. Grigory, on his knees, smiles.

                                     GRIGORY
                              (dying)
                         Look what you've done --

               He looks up. In his empty eye socket, fleshy tendrils shift 
               lazily.

                                     GRIGORY
                         You've killed me -- an insignificant 
                         man... but you have brought forth a 
                         God.

               He uncovers his abdomen. Long, fleshy pseudopods spill out 
               of the wound, like intestines.

               A large entity erupts from Grigory's torso and claws the 
               air.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Behold, my master, Behemoth. Guardian 
                         of thresholds, destroyer of worlds.

               Covered in steamy slime, a seven foot, multi-tentacled shape --
               BABY BEHEMOTH -- lands on the stone slab. The squirming flesh 
               surges up like greasy pink foam. Growing exponentially by 
               the second.

               Ilsa kneels and embraces Grigory's corpse. Kisses him on the 
               mouth. A gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them.

                                     ILSA
                         Hell will hold no surprises for us.

               A tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both.

               INT. CATACOMBS - ADJACENT TUNNEL - NIGHT

               In a passageway, Hellboy carefully hands Liz's body over to 
               Myers.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll 
                         deal with whatever's back there.

                                     MYERS
                         Alone?

                                     HELLBOY
                         How big can it be?

               As if in response, a massive tentacle fills the tunnel, 
               reaching for him. Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash 
               onto HELLBOY´S head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed, 
               finally confronting --

               INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               BEHEMOTH!!! The size of a house --

               Hellboy -- head smoking -- writhes in the grip of the 
               tentacle. It suddenly throws him toward the ceiling.

               As he arcs back down, ABM!! -- he cracks the floor wide open. 
               Next to him: the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS. He tries to 
               grab them. The tentacle slams down, blocking his way.

               The vibration sends the belts down into the crack. They bounce 
               off a small ledge and land further down. Far below, grinding 
               cogwheels and gears.

               Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble 
               statue.

               Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he's worth. 
               FWAP! He cuts clean through the tentacle. The tip hits the 
               floor, rolling into the crack.

               From out of Behemoth's stump... a mass of wriggling tentacles 
               replaces the cut-off section! They squirm around Hellboy's 
               face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward.

               He leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to 
               grab the belts. A few inches short. He jumps into the crevice, 
               onto the first ledge. It crumbles!!

               The gears below grind a few falling bricks. The belts slide 
               away.

               A tentacle captures Hellboy, pulls him up. At the last second, 
               he grabs the belts with his tail.

               The beast raises Hellboy high. A multi-layered mouth opens 
               in the body of BEHEMOTH. The most horrible proboscis ever 
               seen.

               Hellboy's tail passes him the belts.

               The timers on them are crushed. A spark spurts: Useless.

                                     HELLBOY
                         They never work --

               He wraps them around his stone arm.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Ugh -- Now, this is gonna hurt --

               He pulls the pin on all the explosives. BEHEMOTH drops him 
               into a squid-like beak and gulps him down.

               After a moment, a weird gurgle emanates from the creature's 
               innards. Then --

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               A surge of light roils within the thing, outlining the pulpy 
               organs. The creature starts to burn.

               OMIT

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               A chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as Behemoth 
               is enveloped in a cloud of fire, goo and soft flesh.

               Hellboy lands with a sickening, bone-crunching THUD!!!

               With a bellow, Behemoth goes down, the limp tentacles missing 
               Hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light. 
               Finally, just a few cinders of flesh float in the air.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy stands, covered in goo. Two final shockwaves of light 
               ripple over the ground.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Ouch -- It did hurt.

               INT. ADJACENT TUNNEL

               Hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots Myers. Painfully 
               drags himself over. Liz's body is on the floor.

               Manning limps in from an adjacent room. Hellboy cradles Liz's 
               head in his huge hand. Holds her against his powerful chest 
               and whispers in her ear.

               A beat or two, then a moan.

                                     LIZ
                         In the dark -- I heard your voice -- 
                         What -- did you say -- ?

               He looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.

                                     HELLBOY
                         "You, on the other side: let her go. 
                         Because for her, for her -- I'll 
                         die. I'll cross over."
                              (beat)
                         "And you'll be sorry I did."

               Myers smiles. Liz looks at Hellboy for the first time as 
               what he is: the man she loves. A warm, gentle fire rims her 
               body.

               Manning watches. Agent Myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated 
               by the flames.

               Hellboy and Liz kiss. The fire haloes them and builds as Tom 
               Waits' CINNY'S WALTZ fills the air.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS - NIGHT 1


          SUPERIMPOSURE:

          MANHATTAN. 10.30 P.M.
          Park Avenue in mid-December. On the lampposts, Xmas lights
          sparkle over streets slick with slush and rain. Limousines
          line up for a public function.

          2 EXT. BLACKWOOD BUILDING - NIGHT 2


          SUPERIMPOSURE:

          BLACKWOOD'S AUCTION HOUSE
          Under black umbrellas, wealthy men and women exit the limos
          and enter a stately ten-story building. On the facade, a
          sign reads: TONIGHT - TREASURES OF PRE-CHRISTIAN EUROPE.
          A SHADOWY FIGURE lurks in an alley near the corner. His
          features are hidden by a broad-brimmed hat. He watches as-
          The guests present gleaming, golden invitations to the
          security people at the door.

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          (in Elvish, subtitled)
          I'll go up first. You'll enter from below-
          He addresses WINK, an eight-foot tall TROLL with grey skin
          and a huge scar over his left, empty, eye socket. His right
          hand is missing and he sports a heavy IRON MACE instead. A
          plume of breath escapes from his brutish mouth.

          SHADOWY FIGURE (CONT'D)
          And remember Wink-

          (BEAT)

          He extends his arms and with a swoop, he climbs the wall,

          Like the guests, the AUCTIONEER is dressed in formal wear.
          TV MONITORS display the image of the statue so the bidders
          can have a closer look.

          We'll open the bidding at two hundred

          -a darkened corridor where other STEWARDS wheel auction lots
          to and from the sales room.
          The STEWARD notices an open window at the end of the
          corridor. He leans out and looks down. Ten stories below - a
          snow-covered alley.
          Suddenly, he sees the SHADOWY FIGURE above the window frame,
          clinging to the smooth granite wall!!

          Quick as lightning, the SHADOWY FIGURE covers the steward's
          mouth. When he withdraws his hand, the steward's mouth has

          The Shadowy Figure grabs the hapless man by the lapels,
          hauling him outside and dangling him over the void.

          gold.

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          A once-in-lifetime opportunity. For the
          first time in auction. A piece of the
          Royal Crown of Bethmoora... A precious
          artifact dating from the Atrebatean
          period. Exquisite workmanship in 24 carat
          gold.
          The lights flicker briefly, provoking MURMURS from the
          audience.

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Please- please- ladies and gentlemen...
          may I have your attention. As I was
          saying, observe the fanciful creatures
          adorning the outer surface, figures from
          a lost mythology...
          The lights go out completely. From the sudden darkness, the
          Shadowy Figure speaks up.

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          Lost- ? Not at all. Forgotten by you
          perhaps, but very much alive.

          A few emergency lights come on, revealing The Shadowy
          Figure, who walks down the aisle to confront the auctioneer.

          Shall we just say that I am the rightful
          owner of this piece?
          He seizes the artifact. The auctioneer grabs a phone and
          hits a button.

          KRRRRR-K the seeds sprout into massive, thick branches and
          roots and instantly engulfing the Auctioneer amidst coils of
          wooden branches, crushing him. They grow and grow until they
          crack the ceiling!!
          Soon the Auctioneer disappears, and in its place stands a
          compact, twisted tree. Tiny creatures emerge from its
          branches and crawl around the trunk.
          CRASH!!!!! Four SECURITY GUARDS come flying through the side
          doors and land in the aisles with a THUD!!! The spectators
          scream.
          WINK walks in. He carries two large IRON BOXES on his back.
          On the sides of the boxes A ROYAL SEAL, embossed in the
          metal.
          People cower in the corners, SCREAMING in terror and
          disbelief.
          WINK shrugs the iron boxes to the floor with a CLANG!!!!
          Inside them, little clawed THINGS are scrabbling - mewling,
          fast and hungry!!
          At the Shadowy Figure's signal, the troll opens the cages...
          and the people's SCREAMS redouble.

          A Christmas tree glows next to the fireplace; Mozart is
          playing on the aquarium's underwater speakers. Floating in
          warm water on a cloud of bubbles is ABE SAPIEN, lost in the
          music.
          A blurry figure approaches and raps a ring finger against
          the tank: It's TOM MANNING, chief FBI liaison to the BPRD.
          Looking dyspeptic, he presses a folder against the glass:

          TOP SECRET.

          Look at that- Each photo costs a fortune
          to suppress. And then, naturally, they
          pop up on the net.
          CAMERA moves in on Abe's breathing apparatus. It's sleek,
          more modern, fitting snugly to his gills and neck. His
          goggles are new, too.
          He examines a photo of Hellboy bounding down a city street,
          brandishing his mighty, high-caliber Samaritan. He's looking
          straight at the camera lens.

          I know- It's not just the money. It's the
          provocation. This is asking for trouble.

          Manning leans close to a voice-recognition security mike.

          MANNING
          "Man-ning..."
          He enunciates each syllable perfectly, then turns to Abe.

          MANNING (CONT'D)
          -is out of control. And I think it's all
          deliberate on his part.

          He hates me.
          Layers of steel doors trundle open in sequence.

          How are things between him and Liz?

          ABE
          Oh, you know. The usual. Since they moved
          in together- Good days and bad.
          On cue, the concrete wall explodes!'.! A massive BALL OF FIRE
          swings the final steel door open, almost tearing it off its
          hinges.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Then again, there are the really bad days-
          Manning and Abe cower behind a pillar. Once the explosion
          dies away- Hellboy's revealed, lying on the floor, his back
          smoking and in flames.

          There- there- with the cat food!!
          Wrinkling her nose in disgust, Liz plucks a toothbrush from

          they eat and then need to eat some more.

          ABE
          Alright, but-

          LIZ
          Damn it Abe, just tell us!

          ABE
          Okay, then- They're- um- tooth fairies.

          LIZ
          Abe, c'mon- cut the crap.
          She checks her boots, sticky with poo-

          ABE
          Third century, the Teutoburg forest.
          Famished. They feed on calcium-

          (BEAT)
          And they do go for the teeth first. How
          do you think they got that name "Tooth
          Fairies"??
          Liz senses movement in the darkness. She holds out her hand
          and starts a small fire on her palm.
          She pans it like a torch, firelight sweeping the darkness-

          NOTHING-

          23 INT. CORRIDOR - SAME 23

          Agent MARBLE comes upon a lonely little creature peeping out
          from a crack in the wall. It's about 9 inches high, with
          olive skin and almond-shaped eyes gleaming in the half-
          light. It whimpers softly.

          AGENT MARBLE
          Hey, this guy is cute -i.
          He reaches out to touch it.

          AGENT MARBLE
          Are you scared, buddy?
          Across the room Hellboy sees the Agent nearing the Fairy.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 14

          HELLBOY
          No, don't-
          The thing SNARLS, leaps and sinks its tiny teeth into
          MARBLE's finger. Then it dives under MARBLE's shirt and goes
          to work.
          MARBLE gasps and drops his gun. Dozens of creatures emerge
          from the crack on the wall and crawl into Marble's clothing.
          Gasping, he tears open his shirt as claws and teeth dig
          in.. ribs crack... blood spurts. The agent falls.

          24 INT. SALES ROOM - SAME 24

          Liz lights up both hands, illuminating a surging tidal wave
          of hungry critters that engulfs the room, gnawing at the
          wallpaper, the furniture!
          The things sweep over Agent Mudd, ripping into him like
          wriggling piranhas.

          ABE
          (backing away)
          Oh, my-

          25 INT. CORRIDOR - SAME 25

          Hellboy protects the other agent, but he feels the things
          swarming over him, reaching for his lips and ears...
          Bellowing in disgust, he fires his shotguns, splattering
          dozens of creatures onto the walls.
          Every blast, however, reveals a buzzing, hungry mass pouring
          from the walls. HB claws at dozens more, which cling to him
          like baby monkeys.

          26 INT. SALES ROOM - CONTINUOUS 26

          The room is awash with hissing creatures, crawling over the
          iron cages. For an awful moment, no sign of Liz or Abe.

          HELLBOY
          (sudden panic)

          LIZ!!
          In reply, he hears a faint scream. He bats at the things
          with the SHOTGUN, wading further into the room.

          He sees a horde of little beasts gnawing at the metal bars
          of a cage...
          .Liz cowering inside. Hellboy just has time to look deep
          into her eyes. A quick moment of silent communion.

          HELLBOY
          Do it, Liz, do it!!!
          And Liz obeys. Closing her eyes she-

          The fire's not my enemy. It is part of me-
          -gets covered by a gentle film of blue flame.

          UH-OH-
          He takes refuge as-

          LIZ
          It is mine-
          -the gentle flame blooms into a cloud of fire. Liz goes
          supernova. BAMMM!!!

          27 EXT. AUCTION HOUSE - NIGHT 27

          A ball of fire erupts from an upstairs balcony. The crowd
          and reporters look up, amazed.

          MANNING

          Evidently we have a- gas pocket-

          The reporters stampede towards the explosion, leaving
          Manning alone and fuming.

          Hellboy stomps down hard, popping some creatures, bashing
          others with the butt of his shotgun. As flames leap up, the
          things regroup and renew their attack.
          Liz and Abe run for the stairs.

          LIZ
          Red, Red, this way-
          Hellboy kicks the critters away, shooting again and again.

          HELLBOY
          No- I'll deal with them- NOW.
          He dumps his backpack and pulls out a belt full of VULCAN 66
          grenades. Holds it high.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          Vulcan 66, boys! Come and get 'em-
          Liz and Abe take cover on the stairs. They see Hellboy
          luring the tooth fairies toward the windows overlooking the
          street.

          10
          As the creatures climb onto him, he pulls the pins on all
          grenades. Soon he's a mass of swarming, gnarly fairies and

          29 TNT / EXT - AUCTION HOUSE 29
          Like a cannonball, HB flies out the upper floor window.
          A ball of flame, he arcs downward, covered in fighting,
          writhing fairies.
          Below, the onlookers scatter as the massive Red Giant lands
          in their midst, cracking the pavement.

          31 EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT 31

          The crowd is screaming. Half a dozen smoldering fairies
          climb out of the smoking crater and snarl at the crowd.
          People shrink back in horror. One of the hungry critters
          jumps at a woman but-
          BLAM!! Hellboy shoots it in mid-air, then calmly and
          efficiently shoots its fellows.
          Finally, he plucks one last creature off his coat. He holds
          it up by the tail, like a rodent.
          Manning hurries forward, witness to his worst nightmare. A
          sea of camera flashes explodes on a grinning Hellboy.

          HELLBOY
          (looks at Manning)
          Gee whiz, Manning-

          34 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT 34

          Guard 1 watches TV. HB is on the screen, surrounded by press
          and TV.

          GUARD 1
          Check it out. That guy's make-up is so
          fake. I mean, come on, solid red-
          Guard 2 is cleaning his gun.

          GUARD 2
          And what's with his forehead? Is that
          goggles?
          He looks out the window and sees the THE SHADOWY FIGURE
          standing by the gates.

           GUARD 2 (CONT'D)
           Hey, we got us a wino.
           He grabs his nightstick and steps outside.

           35

          35 EXT. RAILYARD - NIGHT

           Waving his nightstick, Guard 2 approaches the intruder.
          Their elongated shadows loom up above them on a brick wall.

          GUARD 2
          Hey- buddy- get the-
          The THE SHADOWY FIGURE whirls and drops his coat. He
          unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the air around the
          guard.
          The guard's shadow in the background is cut into three parts
          and collapses.

          36

          36 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT

          Guard 1 tunes in a game show. Looks outside-
          -no sign of his buddy. Behind him, at the window, WINK
          appears. Its MASSIVE ARM punches through the wall and hauls
          off the GUARD and then slams his massive IRON MACE down!!!

          BAMMKM ! ! ! !
          THE SHADOWY FIGURE wipes off his sword over the crumpled
          remains of Guard 2. Screams and bone crunching can be heard.
          WINK emerges from behind the shack.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 19
          Effortlessly, the SHADOWY FIGURE vaults the chainlink fence
          and walks into the roundhouse. WINK smashes the fence and
          follows him through.

          37 INT. ROUNDHOUSE - NIGHT 37

          A few pigeons flutter through a forest of steel pillars.
          Radiant fingers of moonlight shine on the old train tracks.
          THE SHADOWY FIGURE and WINK stop as a dozen ROYAL GUARDS in
          helmets and light armor march out from a tunnel.
          After a pause, a CHAMBERLAIN joins them. He bows low in a
          show of respect for the Shadowy Figure.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          Prince Nuada- He awaits you- Please,
          follow me, Sire.

          38 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 38

          The Chamberlain leads the way down a tunnel lined with more
          guards. The armed men surround the Prince as they stop at an
          intersection.
          The Prince prepares to unsheathe his sword- WINK growls.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          I beg you, your majesty. Before entering
          the chamber you surrender your sword.

          PRINCE
          I will not.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          Then, I regret to say, you may not see
          your father. It is the protocol, sire.
          For peasant and prince alike. Please- for
          the last time- surrender your sword.
          A tense beat and then the Prince relents.
          The guards accept his weapon, carefully pat him down-

          PRINCE
          Mr. Wink however- cannot dispose of his
          weapon. He will wait here-
          WINK snorts as the Prince is finally escorted through a
          huge, rusting iron door.

          39 INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT 39

          An abandoned machine shop functions as a council chamber.
          High-ranking heads of outlandish MAGICK FAMILIES are there:
          goblins, trolls, dwarves and elves.
          At the center sits KING BALOR The One-armed King of Elfland
          and, behind him, the willowy, beautiful PRINCESS NUALA, the
          Prince's sister.
          Both on the King's chest and her own, a large golden piece
          dangles from a chain.
          Nuala's resemblance to the Prince is uncanny, down to the
          fine scars marring their perfect faces. They're YING and
          YANG, almost the same being.
          The Prince eyes the doors closing behind him. The armed
          guards watch his every move.
          He bows his head and kneels.

          PRINCE
          Father.
          (eyes the Princess)

          SISTER-
          The KING gestures for him to rise.

          KING
          Why have you done this??
          His voice trembles with anger.

          KING (CONT'D)
          Why? !
          The Prince looks at him, defiant.

          PRINCE
          I have returned from exile to set us
          free. All of us, Father- And to reclaim
          what has been taken from our people. The
          land and the freedom that is rightfully
          ours.

          KING
          No- You have broken a truce that has
          lasted for centuries.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 21

          PRINCE
          A shameful truce, worth nothing. How can
          you abide it? How- ? They have no respect
          for themselves, their Gods or the earth-

          (BEAT)
          And they scorn us- every time they raise
          a dead, cold building, destroy a forest,
          or take more land-
          The PRINCESS then steps forward.

          PRINCESS
          What they do is in their nature. We must
          honor our side of the agreement-

          PRINCE
          Honor-?

          (BEAT)
          Look at this place. Is this where you
          hold court??

          (BEAT )
          Is this how we are to live?? Amidst their
          filth, in their rubble??? Picking at
          scraps from their table??? Where is the
          honor in that??

          KING
          And what would your solution be-? War?
          Why?

          (PAUSE)
          It may just be that our days are ended...

          PRINCE
          It may be- but we will not go quiet. We
          will not fade like this. Better to burn
          than fade away... And for this...
          Prince Nuada looks around, locking eyes with the heads of
          the clans.

          PRINCE
          .we'll need the help of the Good... the
          Bad... and the Worst-
          He brings out the gold artifact from the auction. Holds it
          high.
          The crowds GASPS. The King instinctively covers the
          companion piece hanging from his chest as a medallion.

          KING
          No- you cannot be that mad-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 22

          PRINCE
          Yes. I am.

          KING
          This is the path you wish to take?
          Knowing the cost?

          PRINCE
          Yes, Father- it is.
          The King takes the Princess' hand and mournfully lowers his
          head.

          KING
          Then, I am sorry my son- you leave me no
          choice.
          (looks at his guards)
          Death.
          His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords.

          PRINCE

          (GRIM)
          I agree. Death it is-
          And the guards turn toward the king and stab him. The
          Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch
          tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to
          flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards.

          PRINCE
          Hear me all!!! There are some amongst you
          that have already seen the light-
          (he nears the guards)
          Seen the future...
          The PRAETORIAN GUARDS cover his back as he leans forward to
          his Father"s corpse and snatches the medallion.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          As for you- You may join us in our quest
          or die now-
          His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together,
          they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of
          NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces
          seamlessly into an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raises

          IT-

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          All of those in favor, make it known.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 23
          All of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads, then
          kneel.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          Good- I see the council is as brave as
          it's always been...

          (BEAT)
          And now, my sister-
          The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone.
          He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door.

           PRINCE (CONT'D)
           Find her- Find her-
           His minions surge into the tunnels.

          40 TNT. TUNNEL MAZE - NIGHT 40
           Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs
          down a tunnel. A CROWD gathers behind her, chasing her as
          she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel.
          With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down
          a chute.
          She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves.

          41 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - DAY 41

          The Princess rushes to a small cabinet. She grabs an
          ancient, leather-bound tome.
          She turns to leave, but a horde of TROLLS rushes and quickly
          surrounds her. One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty
          sword.
          It opens a gash in the princess' left arm-

          42 INT. TUNNEL 1 - DAY 42

          The Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the PRAETORIAN
          GUARDS, suddenly doubles over, cursing. Blood pours from a
          wound in his left arm.

          PRINCE
          No- no- you fools-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 24

          43 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 43

           As another troll lifts his sword high-

           PRINCESS
           (calling out)
           Yrdrig!!
          YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an
          alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious. In
          seconds, he's upon the TROLLS.
          Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and
          shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls.
          The Princess slips through a secret door.

          44 INT. TUNNEL 2 -- SAME 44

          The Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll
          screams echo off the walls.
          When they finally-

          45 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 45

          -reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late.
          Dead and dying TROLLS lie in a heap on the floor.
          The Prince finds no sign of his sister. He clutches his
          bleeding arm.

          CUT TO:

          46 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - DAY 46

          Liz sprawls on a sofa, watching the 20-odd TV monitors in
          Hellboy's room. All the news channels feature footage of
          Heliboy's "outing" the night before.
          HB is grinning at the camera. Now he's signing an autograph!

          HELLBOY ON TV
          Yes- yes- I'd say I am that strong- I've
          fought many creatures over the years but
          none as strong as me-
          He winks at camera. Liz rolls her eyes.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 25
          Hellboy plunks himself down next to her, popping a can of
          beer.

          HELLBOY
          I think I did good. And I looked good,
          don't you think, Liz?
          Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote controls.

          ABE
          Look- there's Manning...
          He raises the volume as Manning is shown, surrounded by
          microphones.

          MANNING ON TV
          Evidently we have a- gas pocket-
          somewhere in-

          HELLBOY
          A gas pocket??!! Ha-! I love it.
          The door opens. Manning is there, holding a plastic box
          overflowing with mail.

          MANNING

          PLEASE-
          Disgusted, Manning turns off the TV's.

          MANNING
          Aw- this is a disaster! A disaster- you
          hear?? Worse than Cheney with a shotgun.
          Only Liz-

          (BEAT)
          Only Liz handled herself with any
          dignity.

          LIZ
          (glancing at HB)
          No one asked me anything.
          Manning pulls a fistful of mail out and tosses it on a
          table.

          MANNING
          Don't bother starting a fan club. It's
          trending five to one against us.

          HELLBOY
          Against?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 26

          LIZ
          (glances at some letters)
          Polls- protests- hate mail-
          Liz grabs a few letters and scans them.

          LIZ

          (READING)
          "Unwelcome species... mongrelizing...
          lower orders... ungodly freaks..."
          She glares at Hellboy.

          HELLBOY
          Ungodly freaks-? Us?

          MANNING
          You really did it this time- I'm under
          review.
          (to Hellboy)
          But so are you- As of today, there's a
          new team leader.

          HELLBOY
          New - ? What?

           MANNING
           Yes- You heard me. A new team leader.
           We're to meet him at the conference room
          at 0900-
           (looks at his watch)
          Now.

          47 INT. SECURITY POUND BPRD - SAME 47

          The SECURITY POUND is row after row of stacked cages, each
          one imprisoning a different CREATURE. BPRD AGENTS patrol the
          pens, feeding the occupants, cleaning the pans-
          HB looks at Manning, who is edgy and nervous.

          HELLBOY
          What's the matter, Manning?? Don't you
          trust me anymore?

          MANNING
          Oh- I never did- But after last night,
          Washington wants a new public face for
          the BPRD-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 27

          HELLBOY
          What about me? What's wrong with my
          face???

          MANNING
          Or mine??? The press loves me!! But now
          you've ruined it all-

          HELLBOY
          But, who-? Who is this guy?

          MANNING
          How would I know? Evidently, he's quite
          the big shot-
          (he reads a file)
          His name is Johann Kraus-

          HELLBOY
          Akkk- Kraus??? He's German-

          MANNING

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -a physical medium, head of the European
          branch of the BPRD-

          HELLBOY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          You know I have a problem with Germans-

          MANNING

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -a Doctor in Philosophy and Occult
          Practice from the University of Munich
          and a very eloquent speaker-

          HELLBOY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -Germans make me nervous-

          MANNING
          I guess they need a nice open face- A
          face people can trust.
          Finally, next to steel cage, they meet-
          JOHANN KRAUS: about 6' tall, dressed in a canvas containment
          suit full of tubes and taps. His hands are encased in thick
          latex gloves with exit valves at the fingertips and his
          head...

          MANNING
          . Oh, my God-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 28
          .is a translucent glass bubble, full of gas!
          He is studying a drawing of the royal seal we saw on the
          Fairy Cages.
          Johann approaches Liz. He takes her hand and bows.

          JOHANN
          Johann Kraus, at your service.
          His unearthly voice is velvety and warm. Almost soothing.
          Liz smiles. Hellboy glowers as Kraus' fishbowl head turns
          toward them.

          HELLBOY
          (whispers to manning)
          That's an open face for you...

          48 INT. CONTAINMENT AREA - DAY 48

          Johann pulls out one of the dead, singed Fairies. Hellboy
          and the others gather around him.

          JOHANN
          Poor things, bought and sold on the black
          market. Smuggled in tight, cramped cages.
          Let's see what they can remember-

          HELLBOY
          Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die-
          (nudges Abe)
          -but maybe I can be of help-
          Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an amulet.

          JOHANN
          Oh, no, no- No amulets are required.
          He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and
          approaches the lock.

          HELLBOY
          What are you doing?

          JOHANN
          I can inhabit inanimate things: organic,

          MECHANICAL-

          HELLBOY

          INHABIT-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 29

          ABE

          TELEPLASTY-

          JOHANN
          Exactly.
          A PROTOPLASMIC emanation seeps out from his fingertips,
          slightly deflating his body. The tendrils enter the-
          -"Dead" Fairy.

          JOHANN
          I can briefly take control of entities,
          both mechanical and organic and
          reactivate their neural system-
          The "dead" Fairy snarls and bares its teeth at Hellboy. Two
          more do the same from another pen.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          (points at Hellboy)
          You scare him-
          The fairy blabbers furiously while glaring at HB.

          HELLBOY
          (leering at it)
          Whaddayawant??? You chewed off the tip of
          my tail- Yes, you-

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          Rough translation: He says you are rude,
          brutish and not too bright-

          ABE
          Touche.
          More high-pitched jabbering...
          Johann replaces the little fairy in the holding pen.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          Enough. it seems our little friend here
          remembers a noise. A very peculiar noise
          in the last place where his cage was
          traded: market sounds-

          (BEAT)
          Troll language-

          LIZ
          The troll market- ?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 30

          JOHANN
          Exactly, Miss Sherman.
          The Fairy starts babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and
          weak.

          HELLBOY
          Jeez- your buddy there doesn't look too
          good.

          JOHANN
          I'm losing my grip on its limbic system-
          He feels nauseous. I'm afraid he's about
          to die-

          HELLBOY
          Wow- You have that effect on me too.
          The Fairy's cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses.
          Ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at Johan's
          fingertips.

          ABE
          How can we find the Troll market??? Its
          location has been a source of speculation
          for centuries

          JOHANN
          Yes, well- Trolls dwell under bridges-
          And Vladimir Vanya 18th century occultist-
          places it under Washington Bridge

          ABE
          We've looked there before-- Staked it out
          for weeks-

          JOHANN
          Yes, but this time I have asked for a
          very special piece of equipment-
          He moves in to a large crate marked "Lot 336"

          ABE
          "336" The schufftein glasses??

          JOHANN
          (smiles knowingly)
          On loan from the Smithsonian. Plus we
          have this clue-
          He produces the sketch of the ROYAL SEAL.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 31

          JOHANN
          In my mind we have enough to go by- Any
          questions??
          Abe is about to ask something when, abruptly, Hellboy raises
          his hand-

          JOHANN
          Yes- what is it?

          HELLBOY
          If you're really German- how come you
          don't have a funny accent?

          JOHANN

          (SIGHS)
          Get ready. We are on the move.

          49

          49 INT. GARAGE AREA / DRESSING LOCKER ROOMS

          Hellboy is suiting up. Liz and Abe do the same.

          HELLBOY
          What a moron!! "We are on the move" He
          thinks he's so hot!! We've been looking
          for that place for years and we've never
          found it-
          (looks at Abe)
          You said so-
          Abe pulls out TWO headsets of COMPOSITE GOGGLES, made of
          copper and glass, full of buzzing and whirring pieces. He
          tries it on.

          LIZ
          Get used to it. He might be here for good-

          HELLBOY
          For good?!

          LIZ
          He has a nice voice.

          ABE
          Yes, very commanding, very soothing.

          HELLBOY
          I think he's a jerk.

          ABE
          I like him.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 32

          HELLBOY
          Well, then you're a jerk, too. "The
          brains of the operation-" give me a
          break!

          JOHANN
          They head towards the garbage truck. Manning, Abe and
          are waiting there.

          LIZ
          I think you feel threatened...
           Hellboy stays behind- thinking- thinking real hard.

           CUT TO:

          50 EXT. WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NIGHT 50

           The Garbage truck and a few other BPRD vehicles crossthe
          Washington Bridge on the way to CHINATOWN.

          SIGN: WASHINGTON BRIDGE 21.00 HOURS

          51 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - NIGHT 51

          Hellboy rides in silence- still thinking hard- then.

          HELLBOY
          Ha! Me? Threatened??
          Glaring, at Liz:

          HELLBOY
          By whom? By him??

          LIZ
          Not just him- this whole thing you did.
          The TV- the reporters-

          HELLBOY
          I did that?

          LIZ
          Yes, Red- absolutely. 'Cause you did it
          without thinking- You just wanted to be
          in the public's eye- well- you're there-
          but so are we.

          HELLBOY
          Hey- We got some hate mail.

          (SHRUGS)
          We'll deal with it. Together.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 33
          He comes closer to her.

          HELLBOY
          Something else bothering you-?
          Liz nods quietly.

          HELLBOY
          So- Tell me about it-

          LIZ
          I will, but not now- I'm sorry if- I-

          (BEAT)
          I don't like being watched. I never have.
          I feel like a freak only if someone's
          watching me.
          Suddenly: Angry YELLS... then fists pounding the walls and
          fenders.
          The doors open and they are inundated by reporters and TV
          CREWS and cameras and flashes. There are, literally,
          hundreds of them. This time from all over the world: Japan,
          UK, Germany...

          CUT TO:

          52 EXT. WATERFRONT, BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 52

          Agents cordon off the street with yellow tape, holding the
          press at bay. As the truck rolls by, hordes of bystanders
          push forward, hoping for a glimpse of Hellboy.
          Some of them chase run alongside the vehicle, carrying
          support/hatred signs.

          MANNING
          May I suggest that tonight you refrain
          from signing autographs.

          HELLBOY
          It's the garbage truck. It makes the
          wrong statement. About who we are.

          MANNING
          You think that's what this is about?
          Transportation???

          53 EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS - NIGHT 53

          The truck stops near other official vehicles. Overhead, the
          soaring roadbed of the Brooklyn Bridge.
          At the sight of the BPRD team, some protestors throw eggs.
          Hellboy shields Liz from the barrage.

          REPORTER 2
          C'mon- show us your powers-

          ABE
          Oh- No, no, no, it's not a parlor trick.

          REPORTER 1
          What are you, a mermaid??

          ABE
          Oh, goodness, no- I-

          REPORTER 2
          You say you can read things- things about
          people- so read me- c'mon- read me-
          The crowd of reporters and onlookers laughs and applauds.

          REPORTER 2 (CONT'D)
          What do you see?

          ABE
          Very well, if you insist.
          (webbed hand on reporter's chest)
          You... keep... a large, battery-operated
          vibrating egg by your bedside...
          A shrieking CAMERA CREW runs up loaded with video equipment.

          REPORTER
          You! Demon-man! Will you take a DNA test?

          HELLBOY
          It's "Hellboy" not "Demon-man"-
          One of the projectiles hits him. The crowd roars. Hellboy
          gazes back at them- seething.

          JOHANN
          Let me take care of this.
          Johann bravely confronts the news teams and the crowd.

          -Please, we need space to work- please-

          WE-
          The REPORTERS bombard him with questions. He signals for
          silence.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          In due time- very soon- we will provide
          all the answers you require, all the
          whos, whys and wherefors- But for now-
          An egg hits him in the face- hard. The crowd roars-

          Great P.R...
          He gets ready to pummel the crowd. Liz stops him.

          LIZ
          Shh! Give him a chance...

          JOHANN
          -it's been a long... long time... for
          many decades really, that the BPRD has
          served you- all of you... in silence. We
          have waged an unknown war - but a very
          real one. Heroes have died unrewarded and
          unrecognized so that you might go about
          your daily life. To work, to marry, to
          bid your children goodnight.
          Little by little, the crowd grows quiet.

          JOHANN
          In exchange, we have been consigned to
          the lies and racist innuendo of the
          tabloids. And there we have lived without
          complaint - until now.

          54

          54 MONTAGE
          Johann's speech is replayed in broadcast TV VANS, HOMES,
          PUBS and BARS all over the world to a fascinated human
          population. All colors and creeds.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          But perhaps soon- after learning of our
          hardships and sacrifices, you may decide
          that our humble lives may, in some way,
          have a value... and a meaning-

          - DOCKS - NIGHT 55

          55 EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE

          The camera lights reflect off Johann's glass head.

          JOHANN
          I pray that you will allow us to defend
          your good fortune- to guarantee the
          blessing that is a peaceful night's
          sleep. A night free from monsters and
          nightmares. And if so-
          (chokes back tears)
          If so- then all we ask in return... from
          you... is a little respect and the
          chance, remote as it may be, to prove
          ourselves worthy of a tiny, tiny place in
          this- God's Earth.

          HELLBOY
          (rolls his eyes)
          This is sooo corny-
          A moment of silence ensues--
          Then, the wet-eyed reporters applaud- the crowd applauds-
          Liz applauds, Abe applauds. Hellboy is agog!!

          HELLBOY
          What-?? What-??

          ABE

          (DAZZLED)
          He has a nice voice.
          All business now, Johann steps over to the group.

          JOHANN
          Come on. We have work to do-

          56

          56 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

          Hellboy, Abe and Johann peer over the cornice of a bowling
          alley rooftop. The CROWDS are visible in the distance.
          Hellboy looks through THE SCHUFFTEN GLASSES.

          57 EXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          The BPRD truck is parked behind the bowling alley, directly
          under the bridge. Its back door is open; Liz and manning are
          at the communications center.

          LIZ
          I read you, Red. Keep looking-
          Manning is bored, looks at his watch.

          MANNING
          Looking at what, for goodness sake-?
          (looks at the Schufften glasses)
          What do these things do-?
          Liz starts locking and unlocking a series of lenses and
          prisms. Both Abe and Johan wear similar gear.

          ABE
          In 1778 Emil Schufften, a Good friend of
          Benjamin Franklin, designed these optical
          sets with the intent of photographing
          fairies in England...

          MANNING
          Let's get out of here- We're never going
          to find it-

          HELLBOY'S VOICE
          Hey- Sparky, I think we got one.
          Manning studies the image on the monitor: a bag lady pushing
          a shopping cart full of cats-

          MANNING
          That? Oh, please, she looks as sweet as
          she can-

          LIZ
          Red, turn on the "antiglamour" filter...
          (to Manning)
          Fairy folk use a spell called "glamour"
          to seem human and nice-

          (BEAT)
          These lenses allow you to see their real
          appearance...

          59 POV GOGGLES.
          As a series filters enter the visual field, the bag lady
          transforms into an ugly, muscle-bound troll.

          MANNING
          Oh, dear Lord.

          (PAUSE)
          What about the cats?

          LIZ
          She eats them.

          MANNING
          "She??" That's a "she"?????

          HELLBOY
          We're moving in, Sparky-

          61 BOWLING ALLEY / BACK ALLEY/ UNDER THE BRIDGE 61
          HE, Johann and Abe follow the Bag Lady. She opens a service

          DOOR-

          / SERVICE CORRIDOR. 62

          62 INT. BOWLING ALLEY

          The bag lady goes through the rear of the bowling alley and
          through a basement door. The room RUMBLES with the sound of
          rolling balls and toppling pins.

          HELLBOY

          (WHISPERS)
          Maybe we can bowl a few frames, uh?

          ABE
          (splays his webbed fingers)
          Bowling balls- they give me trouble.

          HELLBOY
          How about a beer, then? Now that we're
          "out"- Whaddya say, Mein Herr?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 39

          JOHANN
          Sorry. I don't drink.

          HELLBOY

          SHEESH-

          63 INT. BOWLING ALLEY BASEMENT 63

          Hellboy and Abe enter the basement: no sign of the old
          woman. Just a Warehouse-

          JOHANN'
          Adjust the prisms to "2"
          Abe moves his glasses, Hellboy fumbles his own-
          unsuccessfully.
          Now the WHOLE ROOM transforms under the new optical
          elements: Its geometry remains somewhat unchanged, but
          instead of a pile of boxes a tree trunk and a large, mossy
          rock are visible, where there were iron beams now tree
          trunks and stone columns are visible...

          ABE

          THERE-
          Where a large banner hung, now a huge, rusty mechanical
          lock.

          HELLBOY
          What the heck is that?

          ABE
          A locking mechanism-

          HELLBOY
          Mmh- I'll take care of it-
          He clenches his stone fist, rears back...

          JOHANN
          No- You destroy it. We'll never get in-
          He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and
          approaches the lock.

          HELLBOY
          Ah, of course- the Fishbowl touch-

          JOHANN
          Johann's s ecto-tendrils enter the-

          Opens and the floor drops away, revealing a stone staircase.
          Johann withdraws his protoplasmic tendrils and closes off
          the valves.

          JOHANN
          Gentlemen: welcome to Troll Market.

          66 INT. TROLL MARKET - NIGHT 66

          Troll Market is a steamy, medieval nightmare. A labyrinth of
          narrow alleys and foetid vapour.
          Trolls scavenge the crumbling, marble shoreline, picking
          through garbage, scattering vermin.
          Muddy water trickles down from above, forming cloudy
          puddles.
          Roaming vendors hawk exotic objects from every culture and
          century.
          At kiosks and shops, Trolls peddle cats (skinned or alive)
          cadres of Lovecraftian entities stroll about: Mer-men,
          Goblins and a few select species unknown to any cosmology.
          A dogfight of sorts is taking place in a small ring. Instead
          of pitbulls, multi-limbed creatures leap at one another
          while violent bettors laugh and shout.
          At the rail, Abe watches in horror, then sees a woman in
          rags making her way through the crowd. He catches a glimpse
          of her slippered feet...
          .which flash with pearls and gold embroidery. His
          curiosity aroused, he follows her.

          67

          67 MARKET STALL
          The woman inspects a pile of ancient bric-a-brac at a market
          stall; her cowl swings aside, briefly revealing her face.
          It's the PRINCESS. In these grotesque surroundings, her
          beauty is transcendent.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 41
          Abe is thunderstruck.
          As she turns to leave, they briefly make eye contact. On her
          bandaged arm: a bracelet adorned with the seal's coat of
          arms!

          ABE
          (into microphone)
          Brother Red!!

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Not now, Abe.
          As the Princess disappears into the mob, Abe hurries after
          her.

          68

          68 EXT. SHOP - SAME

          Hellboy and Johann show a picture of a tooth fairy to a
          surly SHOP OWNER.

          SHOP OWNER
          Never seen anything like it. No one sells
          `em down here - over in Jersey, maybe.
          Behind him, there's a faceless CAVE BERSERKER: a tall and
          gnarly ogre, his naked chest crisscrossed with scars, his
          feet encased in iron shoes.
          Growling, it bares its teeth at HE. HB smiles back-

          HELLBOY
          Hiya, Chuck-

           - SAME 69

          69 EXT. TROLL MARKET NARROW PASSAGES

          Abe follows the Princess down an alley - and then another
          one, narrow and dark. Panhandlers pull at his belt; he bats
          them away.

          70

          70 EXT. SHOP - SAME

          Now Johann shows a drawing of the royal seal to the shop
          owner.

          JOHANN
          What about this?? Do you recognize this
          seal?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 42
          The shop owner's face suddenly grows pale.

          SHOP OWNER
          You'd better go. Now.

          JOHANN
          Please. We'll make it worth your while.
          The shop owner claps his hands. BERSERKER takes two steps
          forward, ROARING. Its iron shoes go CLOMP-CLOMP!!

          SHOP OWNER (CONT'D)
          He's not friendly-
          Hellboy huffs and walks up to the creature.

          HELLBOY
          Well, neither am I-
          BAMMMM!!!!! With a single uppercut, he sends it flying
          toward the ceiling, shoeless. The shop keeper watches in awe
          until it lands, about thirty feet away in the middle of the
          dogfight.
          The crowd scatters as the mongrel creatures attack the thing
          with blind instinct.
          Hellboy grabs the shop owner by the lapels and pulls him
          close. The shop owner's head rockets back and forth like a
          boxer's speed bag as HB "gently" slaps him around. Teeth fly
          everywhere.

          HELLBOY
          Feeling more chatty now??

          SHOP OWNER
          It's rumors! ... just- No- don't hit me,
          all right? There's talk of a revolt- a
          revolt against the human world-
          Hellboy releases him, then looks around.

          HELLBOY
          Where the hell is Abe??
          He pushes his belt locator-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 43
          1.,,,d 71 INT. TROLL MARKET ALLEY MAZE - NIGHT 71
          The Princess has entered a shop selling MAPS and PRINTS. Abe
          stays outside, watching through a window as she negotiates
          to purchase a silver and crystal CYLINDER contained in a
          safety holding case.
          The SALESMAN denies it at first but after the Princess hands
          him a gold bracelet he finally acquiesces while vowing to
          her. He extracts the cylinder from its holding case and
          hands it to her.
          A red locator light flashes on Abe's utility belt.

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Hey, Abe, gimme me your twenty-

          ABE
          I'm following a lead, Red. Keep your
          locator -.
          A large TROLL cuts him off-

          ABE
          Excuse me- What do you think you're
          doing?

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Are you in trouble? Talk to me, Abe.
          Another TROLL comes up behind Abe.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          I don't think you-
          The TROLL opens a small wooden box and extracts a nasty
          looking Insect: A NARCOTIC BUG.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Oh, my-
          The second TROLL loads the buzzing bug - like a bullet -
          into a blowpipe. Abe turns just as he blows. The bug lands
          on Abe's chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh. He
          groans.

          HELLBOY
          Abe? What's wrong?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 44
          Abe tears it loose and crushes it underfoot. But his vision
          blurs, he staggers forward and falls, face first, onto the
          cobblestones.

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Abe? Come in - Abe? Dammit -

          72 EXT. SHOP - SAME 72

          The locator's blue light dims; concerned, Hellboy and Johann
          look at each other.
          Seeing his chance, the shop keeper melts away into the
          crowd.

          73 INT. MAP SHOP - LATER 73

          Abe opens his eyes and slowly gets up. He looks around: he's
          surrounded by racks of ancient scrolls and musty books. The
          door is locked. Instinctively he looks for his belt-
          It's not there.

          PRINCESS
          If you are looking for your weapons, my
          guards took them.
          Abe turns to face the Princess, who stands only a few feet
          away. She has cast off her dingy cloak and is radiant in
          fine silk robes.
          She is feeding slices of fruit to a cage of large,
          featherless REPTILE/BIRDS.

          ABE
          I - I carry no weapons, madam- I assure
          you...

          PRINCESS
          Why were you following me?
          Abe is ashamed to realize the real answer. He's utterly
          beguiled by her.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Are you seeking to join my brother?

          ABE
          Your brother-??

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 45

          PRINCESS
          In his revolt against the humans?

          ABE
          A revolt? No, no, no, I- You are sorely
          mistaken...
          He takes a step forward but the YRDRIG comes out of nowhere,
          barking and growling.

          PRINCESS
          Then answer me truthfully- Why were you
          following me?

          ABE
          My name is Abe Sapien -

          PRINCESS

          (LAUGHING)
          There is no such name!

          ABE
          Horrible- I know- but- Please, hear me, I
          beg you. I am an agent of the Bureau for
          Paranormal Research and Defense. If we
          can assist you-

          PRINCESS
          Give me your hand.
          Abe complies, thrilled as she runs her fingers over his
          palm.
          The Princess' face brightens. She smiles and gestures for
          the YRDRIG to yield.

          PRINCESS
          Down Yrdrig - he's a friend.
          The YRDRIG jumps on Abe and starts licking him with all
          three tongues.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Yrdrig's really just a puppy.
          The drooling beast pins Abe to the floor with one paw.

          ABE

          (WHEEZING)
          Nice puppy...

          A
          The YRDRIG lifts Abe with one of its mouths and gives him
          playful shake.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 46

          PRINCESS
          My father gave him to me. Yrdrig, leave
          our guest alone-
          The Yrdrig drops Abe onto the floor.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Out! Out! Bad Yrdrig!
          As the animal skulks away, she helps Abe up-

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          (bows her head)
          My name is Princess Nuala.

          ABE
          (bows his head)
          Your highness, the honor is all mine.

          PRINCESS
          May I apologize, Mr. Sapien, for the
          manner in which we brought you here...
          couldn't be too sure.
          She offers him the locator belt.

          ABE
          Please, it was nothing. Love the puppy,

          TOO-

          PRINCESS
          And under diplomatic immunity - may I
          seek asylum??

          ABE
          We would be... honored, I'm sure. But,
          may I ask: from whom do you seek asylum?
          Suddenly, a COMMOTION outside. The door flies off its
          hinges. Hellboy and Johann burst in, leaping over a pile
          fallen guards outside.

          ABE
          Red, no! I'm all right!
          The Princess shrinks back, but Abe motions for calm.

          ABE
          Gentlemen! Some respect, please!
          The Princess looks with dismay at her vanquished bodyguards.
          The NARCOTIC BUGS buzz around HB, who swats them like
          mosquitoes.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 47

          PRINCESS
          And that was my royal guard.

          ABE
          Red, apologize at once! We are in the
          presence of... royalty!
          Hellboy's never heard Abe sound like this- giddy as a
          schoolboy.

          JOHANN
          (to Abe)
          You're vouching for her, I take it. Mr
          Sapien?

          ABE
          Oh, most definitely. She's from an
          ancient, noble line -

          JOHANN
          - of warriors. The Children of the Earth.
          (to the Princess)
          I'm sorry, Princess Nuala. With such a
          fierce bloodline, we cannot take your
          claim of allegiance at face value.
          He produces the ANCIENT SEAL.

          74 INT. MAPMAKERS VESTIBULE - LATER 74

          Standing at a long deal table, the Princess lights a candle
          and examines the ancient seal.

          PRINCESS
          Where did you get this?

          HELLBOY
          Human side, two nights ago-
          The Princess studies their faces.

          PRINCESS
          In ancient times a seal like this was
          delivered to the enemy as a declaration
          of war. A signal from the underground
          realm to the entire world. It prefaced
          the awakening of the Golden Army-
          Johann sits down heavily.

          JOHANN
          I feared as much.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 48

          HELLBOY
          (to Johann)
          What-? What-? A goblin army-?
          Johann shakes his glass head, overcome with worry.

          JOHANN
          Golden Army. The unstoppable tide. There
          has been nothing to substantiate such a

          TALE-

          PRINCESS
          Not a tale- At the dawn of time... Even
          before the great flood, man and the
          Children of the Earth shared this
          planet...
          (she sighs)
          But as man in his greed expanded his
          dominion, there ensued a bitter war...

          DISSOLVE:

          75 EXT. MYTHICAL BATTLEFIELD - DUSK 75

          Silhouetted against a crimson sky, the shadows of thousands
          upon thousands of goblins, elves and fairies do battle with
          hordes of men.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          In those days, my people were led by my
          Father, King BALOR, the one-armed king of
          Elfland.
          KING BALOR fights valiantly at the side of his son, the
          tall, pale elf knight: PRINCE NUADA.

          PRINCESS (V. 0.) (CONT'D)
          The bloodshed went on year after year.
          Many lives were lost.
          An overview of the battlefield fades as the sun sinks below
          the horizon.

          76 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 76

          Seated in an 'opulent throne room, KING BALOR addresses a
          wretched guild of deformed goblins.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 49

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          It was then that the King ordered the
          Sigri to build him a new, invincible
          army.

          77 INT. BLACKSMITH FURNACES - DUSK 77

          Lit by the fires of a hundred furnaces, stoked by scores of
          goblins, a MECHANICAL ARMY is born. Metal plates and moving
          parts are hammered into shape on enormous anvils and bolted
          onto tall, ornate, golden figures.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          This was an army that would not eat,
          drink or grow tired. A heartless,
          ruthless force made of the purest metal,
          mined from the depths of the earth.

          78 INT. COURTYARD, CASTLE - DUSK 78

          In perfect ranks, in eerie unison, the golden soldiers line
          up, filling the entire courtyard, awaiting the King's
          command.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          The Sigri worked until the winter moon
          was high in the sky -
          The CHIEF GOBLIN BLACKSMITH displays three curved segments
          of gold. He fits them together and holds a completed CROWN
          directly over the King's head.

          KING
          I am King Balor, leader of the Golden
          Army. Is there anyone here who disputes
          my right???
          Silence. Prince NUADA kneels next to his father. The Goblin
          crowns the King, who lifts his sword. In response-
          TCHANKKKKK!!!! The new army raises its lances, hailing him.

          79 EXT. HUMAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHTFALL 79

          As the humans make ready for battle, a tremor shakes the
          earth. They turn their gaze to the horizon, which bristles
          with the arms of the approaching troops.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 50

          80 EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS 80

          The fight is brutal. The mechanical soldiers mow down the
          humans by the hundreds, their swords replaced as needed by
          battle axes, bludgeons and lances.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          But this army knew no bounds, had no
          remorse, felt no loyalty, engaging in
          blind battle with man, woman or child.
          The horde crushes everything, with swords slicing through
          armor as if it were paper. Every blow is deadly, precise.
          The army marches ever onward, like a grinding machine
          devouring tender flesh.
          At length, there is no sign of life in the human camp.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And as the king gazed upon the earth
          awash in blood and at the impassive metal
          faces of the army he had created, his
          heart grew heavy. Victory was gained at
          too high a price. This war should never
          have been waged.
          The King surveys the carnage. The mechanical soldiers stand
          in symmetrical ranks awaiting further instructions.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And so he arranged a truce: the surviving
          men would keep to their cities and we
          children of the Earth would dwell within
          the forests. This pact, he declared,
          would be honored by our sons and the sons
          of their sons until the end of time.
          Listening to his father, Prince Nuada reacts with anguish.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          But my brother did not believe in the
          promises of men. He marched off into
          exile, vowing to return if the Sons of
          the Earth ever needed him.
          Prince Nuada walks away towards a dying sunset.

          81

          81 INT. STORAGE CHAMBER - NIGHT

          The goblins lock the golden army into a huge cavern, under
          the light of ten thousand flickering torches.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 51

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          And the golden army was ordered to lie
          dormant, locked inside the earth itself -
          and there it is to this day, waiting for
          the wearer of the crown to command it
          again.

          82 INT. MAPMAKER'S SHOP - NIGHT 82

          The Princess finishes her tale. Hellboy and Johann look at
          each other.

          HELLBOY
          Where is that crown??

          PRINCESS
          My father had it destroyed. Cut into
          three pieces. One for mankind...
          She holds up her piece of the puzzle, which dangles from a
          chain around her neck.

          PRINCESS
          .Two for the sons of the Earth.

          ABE
          So, you do need our help..?

          PRINCESS
          I'm afraid it's the other way around.
          She holds the CYLINDER she purchased.

          PRINCESS
          The location of the Golden Army is
          contained within this cylinder--
          She opens it and produces a parchment hidden inside. She
          extends it: the map just shows three coordinates.

          ABE
          Just a global chart, Edo - that's the old
          name for Tokyo - Moscow, and Renvyle here-

          PRINCESS
          But nothing else-
          She rolls back the map into the cylinder.

          PRINCESS
          So far, this is a family matter. To
          intervene will bring nothing but trouble.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 52

          HELLBOY
          Good, I like trouble.

          83 INT. TROLL MARKET NARROW PASSAGES - NIGHT 83

          The Princess leads the group through the surging, noisy
          crowd of bizarre creatures. Hellboy, Johann and Abe bring up
          the rear.

          PRINCESS
          No- not that way. Too risky-
          They're lost in unfamiliar alleys and byways. Until-

          JOHANN
          (finally, pointing)
          There. Stairs to the street...

          BUT-

          PRINCE
          Hold!
          The Prince appears at the top of the stairs, dressed in
          black. He's surrounded by his elite guard. Stepping to the
          rail, he points at his sister and addresses the crowd:

          PRINCE
          Hear me, o creatures of the forest! Can
          you recognize a traitor? She's here to
          betray her own!
          He casts a disdainful look at Hellboy.

          PRINCE
          I'm here to recruit all of you against
          the humans. Make your decision now. Those
          who join me will be rewarded. The rest...
          will be killed.
          A sudden silence falls over the throng. Then, the sound of
          CRACKING KNUCKLES. Everyone looks at Hellboy, who is
          unclenching his fists and stretching his neck.
          He starts up the stairs, but a couple of the GUARDS leap
          down to block his path.

          HELLBOY
          I'm gonna put this as delicately as I
          can.

          CUT TO:

          84

          84 INT. BOWLING ALLEY - SAME

          A crowded BOWLING ALLEY is full of serious-looking players
          in colorful shirts and shoes.
          Someone rolls a ball down the center lane, and as it speeds
          right at the pins...

          BOWLER
          Look out, Manny! Strike city..!
          CRASH! Hellboy erupts from under the floorboards, fighting
          the clawing monsters right behind him!
          As the bowlers freeze in shock, dozens of creatures pour out
          into the human world. Grunting, Hellboy punches his way
          free, only to be dragged back by the tail by WINK.
          Abe, shielding the Princess, demonstrates the way of the
          water, a fluid martial arts display. He ducks and parries
          the blows, leaping like Nureyev.
          Abe scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at
          the Prince's guards. He manages to knock a couple off their
          feet.
          As they get back up, he uses the available bowling pins as
          clubs. The screaming PATRONS rush for the doors.

          85

          85 EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

          Outside, the civilians flee, but the news crews come
          is back. He
          running. As their lights blaze up, REPORTER 2
          gapes in disgust:
          Hellboy's massive hands are wrapped around the neck of a
          sweet little OLD LADY! He beats her mercilessly!

          OLD LADY
          Help me...! Please, somebody..!

          REPORTER 2
          (to his cameraman)
          Oh, my God!! Oh, my- Roll! Roll on this!

          BELLBOY
          It's not what you think -!

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 54

          REPORTER
          (pointing at HB)
          He's lost his mind! He's worse than any
          of them..!
          CUT BACK to Hellboy, revealing that the old lady is actually

          WINK.
          Liz runs over with a prism from the SCHUFFTEIN GOGGLES and
          sticks it in front of the camera lens, revealing the truth.
          The reporter checks his monitor.

          REPORTER

          OH-

          86 STREET FIGHT 86
          ALL the BPRD team, including Liz, is swept up in this fight.
          The denizens of the troll market overturn parked cars and
          knock down lamp posts, ROARING with excitement.

          LIZ

          (MUTTERING)
          The fire is not my enemy-- it is a part
          of me--
          Liz yells out a warning... and then throws a barrage of
          flaming bolts. A pair of crab-like THINGS shrivel and burn.
          Johann melds with a heavy steel dumpster, until only his
          legs are visible beneath it. Bending at the waist - SPLAT -
          he brings it down on the head of the nearest creature!
          WINK and HB duke it out for a few beats and then HB finally
          vanquishes the Troll, Ripping his Iron Mace off and throwing
          it away.
          As the other monsters retreat...
          .the PRINCE appears: in his hand a complex mechanical
          GRENADE. Immediately worried, Abe hustles the Princess over
          to the BPRD truck.
          The Prince twists a timer. His bloodied trolls disperse,
          screaming, renewing the panic.

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          I will find you, young daemon -
          (to Nuala)
          - and you, too, my sister. Meanwhile,
          here's a taste of what lies in store.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 55
          He throws the grenade. Hellboy dives, just in time to catch
          it. He's about to throw it down a sewer, when he listens to
          its clockwork innards then: PING!!!!

          HELLBOY
          It's a dud, your royal assness - !
          The Prince has disappeared, along with his horde.

          HELLBOY
          How do you like that? Just when I was
          loosening up.
          Then... CLACKK!!!.
          Hellboy scrutinizes the grenade as it opens up like a
          beans.
          flower... and spews out a handful of Brightly colored

          ABE
          Pick them up!!

          HELLBOY
          Abe. relax- It's jumping beans...
          Abe is scrambling to retrieve them.

          ABE
          Do as I say!
          With a sigh, Hellboy scoops up a few.

          ABE
          How many do you have?

          HELLBOY
          Three, how about you?

          ABE
          Three! There's always seven! Find the
          last one!!!

          TO
          The seventh bean is next to a manhole. It hops closer
          edge...

          ABE
          Quick, it's going for water!
          Hellboy reaches for it... but it's too late. The thing hops
          into the manhole and lands somewhere below with a SPLASH.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Oh, my God, evacuate the area!

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 56

          HELLBOY
          Abe, please, get a grip.
          A RUMBLE from below their feet. WHAMMMM!
          A HUGE TREE punches up through the pavement, overturning
          cars, knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping
          up through the Bridge overpass!!
          Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into
          the moonlit clouds.
          Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in
          fascination. Birds and creatures emerge from the inside and
          flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a moment
          Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          Whoa. Just like the story books.
          Manning and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING
          climbs on Liz's shoulder and a couple of IRIDESCENT
          HUMMINGBIRDS fly around her "ala" SNOW WHITE. A small crowd
          starts wandering into this idyllic scenario.

          LIZ
          This is so beautiful-

          MANNING
          So- perfect- so peaceful-

          HELLBOY
          Hey!!!
          He spots. the prince, at the base of the tree. Knocking on it-

          HELLBOY
          Hey- Jhonny Apleseed- What are you-?? Oh-
          Jeez did you have to do that??
          Liz starts pulling Manning away and yelling at the crowd-

          LIZ
          Back- Go back- right now!!!

          MANNING
          What? What? What is he doing-?

          LIZ
          He's knocking on wood- summoning an

          ELEMENTAL-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 57

          MANNING
          An elem-

          LIZ
          A forest spirit that lives in that tree.
          He's releasing it-

          MANNING
          Oh, and is it that bad??
          KKKRRRRCHTCH!!!!! The tree trunk rumbles and shakes under
          some enormous force. Huge LEAVES tumble to the street. Even
          the ever-present NEWS CREWS back away as a huge shape
          descends.
          BOOM!! the trunk rips in two, revealing a curled, dormant

          ELEMENTAL.
          Five stories high- Fierce as nature. THE ELEMENTAL steps out
          of the tree and stares at Hellboy.
          Uttering a weird, guttural SOUND, the Giant raises an arm
          and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK!
          WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight,
          turning his baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks
          back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling. In a
          single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel.

          HELLBOY
          Good dog.
          (to Elemental)
          Now, Woody... You want to fight someone,
          you fight with me.
          Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee.
          The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his
          limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off.

          ABE
          (to the Princess)
          This may not be the best place for you,
          your majesty. With your permission...
          He offers the Princess his arm. She takes it and allows Abe
          to lead her away. A moment later, the Elemental smashes the
          ground where they had been standing!
          Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and
          branches. The roots connecting to its feet and leading to
          the original tree trunk, like an umbilical cord.
          Johann sees this-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 58

          JOHANN
          I have a plan-
          He looks at Abe-

          87 STANDING AT THE GARBAGE TRUCK 87
          -as the fishman helps the Princess up into the rear of the
          BPRD garbage truck.
          Up front, behind the wheel, Liz starts the engine.

          88 ABANDONED BUILDING

          88
          Hellboy climbs a fire escape as the Elemental's arm/branches
          extend and grow over the ladder, pulling it down below his
          feet. Hellboy ducks into one of the open windows as the
          Elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding. Growing
          and discarding branches and roots.

          89 INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 89

          Hellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated KITCHEN.
          Behind him, the Elemental's massive BRANCH/FIST crashes
          through the wall, then pursues him as he runs down a
          corridor littered with debris.
          Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section
          of the corridor as Hellboy runs.

          90 EXT. LEDGE - CONTINUOUS 90

          Hellboy steps out onto a ledge ten stories up, just out of
          reach of the Elemental.

          HELLBOY
          (to the Elemental)
          What now, Big Boy? You get a ladder?
          The Elemental jumps up and down, trying to reach him,
          barking in frustration.
          Hellboy's RADIO crackles:

          ABE
          (on the radio)
          HB? This is Blue. The Princess is fine.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 59

          HELLBOY
          So what?

          JOHANN
          So, lead him to the bridge.
          Hellboy looks over the buildings and sees the Brooklyn
          Bridge in the distance.

          HELLBOY
          That's nine blocks from here, Fishbowl!

          ABE
          You'll figure it out.

          HELLBOY
          What's at the bridge? Abe - ? Liz?
          Hello???
          No answer. Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing
          neon sign reading "Hotel".
          The Elemental smashes the letters "tel"... so Hellboy climbs
          the "0" to the roof.

          91 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - SAME 91

          Liz drives the garbage truck toward the Brooklyn Bridge.
          Johann is sitting next to her.

          92 EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 92

          Hellboy makes a running start and leaps off the building. He
          sails over the alley, reaches for the approaching cornice...
          and almost loses his grip! He hangs on for dear life.
          Behind him, the Elemental appears, climbing onto an adjacent
          roof. As his feet smash through the skylights, the Elemental
          pulls down a WATER TOWER. A wall of water rolls toward
          Hellboy, like an ocean wave!
          Hellboy leaps to the next roof... and the water shoots over
          the edge of the building, cascading onto the street below.

          93 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME 93

          Liz parks the truck near the Brooklyn Bridge. Using
          binoculars, Abe peers out the back doors to see Hellboy
          bringing the Elemental closer.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 60

          ABE
          Johann - they're almost here.
          Johann moves among massive construction machinery. He stops
          at a stack of heavy SPOOLS OF CABLE.
          Abe comes running, pointing at the cable.

          ABE
          Yes. I had the very same idea...
          He gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine
          which holds a half mile of steel cable.

          ABE
          (gazing at the controls)
          .but how do you operate this??

          JOHANN
          If you'll permit me...
          Johann opens his fingers, and plunges both arms deep into
          the mechanism! Instantly, the diesel engine STARTS UP.

          JOHANN
          (to Abe)
          Stand back, Abe.
          A hydraulic strut lifts the spool, then pitches it through
          the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable. It splashes down
          near the far shore of the East River.

          JOHANN
          Now, tie it onto the pontoons on the
          other side.
          (seeing Hellboy coming)
          Quickly, Abe!

          94 IN THE WATER 94
          Abe races down a pier and dives smartly into the dark water.
          Then he surfaces, surging dolphin-like toward the Manhattan
          shore.

          95 BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS 95
          Hellboy makes it to the bridge... as, behind him, the
          Elemental wades into the river, pushing aside boats and
          barges.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 61

          96

          96 IN THE RIVER
          Abe makes it to the other side, surfacing with the cable,
          towing it to a half-submerged pontoon.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          (on the radio)
          Macht schnell! Abe - make it fast!
          The cable is a yard short of the anchor point! Abe tugs on

          IT-

          ABE
          I need more!

          JOHANN
          No more available!
          The Elemental's feet stomp through the river; he stumbles as
          he encounters the submerged cable.

          97

          97 UNDERWATER
          Clinging to the cable, Abe is dragged down, down down...
          past rusting cars, oil drums... and a couple of rotting
          CORPSES, their feet in tubs of cement!
          Suddenly, Abe's head strikes a sunken truck, knocking him
          unconscious. Blood seeps from his wound.

          98

          98 AT THE BRIDGE
          As Hellboy climbs one of the bridge towers, he hears someone
          calling out from above:

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          Haven't you managed to kill it yet? You,
          who were so eager for a fight?
          The Prince is standing on top of the tower. He points at
          Hellboy, then yells at the Elemental.

          PRINCE
          (to the Elemental)
          Over here, dear friend...
          SNATCH! The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy
          wriggles in the massive wooden finger-like appendages.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 62
          The Prince walks to the edge of the tower, near a steel
          spire, his coat flapping in the night wind.

          PRINCE
          This might be a good chance for you to
          come to your senses. Help us.

          HELLBOY
          I've been all through this! The answer's
          still no!
          Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable,
          bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a
          steel snake!
          The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the
          Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cable

          TENSES-

          JOHANN
          (to Liz)
          Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i
          He points at the roots trailing into the river. Liz
          concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out
          of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet.
          Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the
          river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he
          tosses Hellboy high into the air.
          On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings
          back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the
          Elemental's back, right behind his head.

          HELLBOY
          Nap time, Big guy-
          He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back
          of the neck.
          The cable tenses-
          -The Elemental pitches forward-
          The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at
          him; his mouth opens as if to scream...
          The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop
          the bridge... exactly where the Prince had been standing.
          Putting an end, it seems, to both of them.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 63
          The Creature dies, but even as it does, its branches embrace
          the steel structure and grow, Ultimately, blocks and blocks
          of the city are now covered in trees and grass and mossy
          leaves... A strangely beatific and precious change.
          Liz runs up, looking out at the river as Abe emerges,
          bleeding, but alive. Abe, Liz and Johann embrace firmly,
          laughing and happy to be together.
          Abe eyes the Princess standing nearby, smiling back at
          him...
          Hellboy meanwhile observes the group from a distance,
          jealous, alone.

          CUT TO:

          99 INT. FIRING RANGE - LATER 99

          BLAM! BLAM! Deafening shots as Hellboy blasts the Samaritan
          again and again at a target in the dark firing range. Hits a
          button, brings the paper close for inspection.
          Result: a very ragged, loose pattern around the bull's eye.
          Suddenly, from the next alley, RAPID GUNFIRE. Johann leans
          over, and to address Hellboy through a cloud of gunsmoke.

          JOHANN
          You'll permit a small criticism? You take
          too much time to aim, to think. Nein.
          Just point- like afinger- as if you wish
          for something.

          HELLBOY
          Oh, I wish for something.
          Johann brings his target close: a beautiful, tight cluster
          of shots, dead center.

          JOHANN
          Speed is of the essence. You must work on
          it. I'm willing to spend some -
          Johann reaches for his loader, accidentally knocks Heliboy's
          onto the floor.

          HELLBOY
          Hey, watch it! You're winding me up, I
          don't like it.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 64

          JOHANN
          On the contrary.

          100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 100

          Hellboy's in the shower, glaring across the room, where
          Johann stands at a mirror, polishing his glass head with a
          terry cloth towel.

          HELLBOY
          You keep wiping that thing like she's
          gonna care.

          JOHANN
          She- Who-??

          HELLBOY
          You know who- She-

          (BEAT)
          She's not gonna care.

          JOHANN
          (long beat)
          You think I'm after Liz, don't you?
          (Hellboy walks out)
          Well, I'm not.

          HELLBOY
          Why not?

          (BEAT)
          Not good enough for you?
          Hellboy wraps a towel around his waist and comes up behind
          Johann.

          HELLBOY
          Well- From now on, you don't come near
          her. You don't talk to her-

          JOHANN
          You forget. I'm part of the team now,
          such interactions are inev-

          HELLBOY
          Well- you better start making them
          "evitable"-

          JOHANN
          That's not a word-

          HELLBOY
          Yes, it is-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 65

          JOHANN
          No, it isn't-
          Hellboy raises his stone fist.

          HELLBOY
          Now it is-

          JOHANN
          Oh, I see- you want to punch me- That's
          how you win an argument.

          HELLBOY
          I try.

          JOHANN
          Well, you're big, I'll give you that much-

          HELLBOY
          "Give me???"- You don't give me sh-

          JOHANN
          -and you're strong- but you're slow.

          HELLBOY
          Slo-??

          JOHANN
          Very- slow- I've seen your fighting
          style. Very slow-
          WHAM-! Hellboy cracks Johann over the head with his massive
          fist. To his surprise, the Johann's glass ball cranium
          shatters!

          HELLBOY
          Slow enough for ya-??
          With a loud HISSS, Johann's odd suit sags to the floor!

          HELLBOY
          Ow- Johann... buddy. Sorry- I- I- got
          carried away...
          (leaning over the empty suit)
          Johann? You still hear me?
          An ectoplasmic TENDRIL reaches out from the suit and
          penetrates the closest locker.

          HELLBOY
          It was an accident, okay? I'll get you
          some help-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 66
          With a CLANG! -- the bank of lockers comes to life! Metal
          doors smack Hellboy's head repeatedly, like a pinball
          machine! his face imprinted in the metal.

          JOHANN
          See? Speed is the key.
          The vaporous form of Johann's body emerges from the lockers
          and wanders away. The locker room doors open and close as he
          goes by.
          Hellboy tries to stand, wobbles and sits.

          HELLBOY
          Chicken shit!

          101 INT. THE LIBRARY

          Abe floats in his tank, smiling at the Princess, who's at
          one of the book stands, reading to him.

          PRINCESS
          "I sometimes have a queer feeling -
          especially when you are near me, as
          now: it is as if I had a string somewhere
          under my left ribs, tightly and
          inextricably knotted to a similar string
          situated in the corresponding quarter of
          your little frame."

          ABE
          I love this part. Keep going.

          PRINCESS
          "I am afraid that cord of communion will
          be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion
          I should take to bleeding inwardly."
          She closes the book, looking troubled.

          ABE
          Charlotte Bronte died shortly before I
          was born. It would have been a great
          privilege to have known her...

          PRINCESS
          This "Jane Eyre"... I understand it's
          only a story, but such a tie that binds,
          it exists between me and my brother. I
          assure you: my brother, he's not dead-

          How can you know? We all saw-

          PRINCESS
          We are twins. Even now, I can sense his
          presence. This has been our way since we
          were young children, in Renvyle-

          PRINCESS

          (NODS)
          A magical place in the West. A different
          time. Long gone. Now, he's near and he's
          looking for me. I can feel and even
          understand his. hatred for mankind.

          ABE
          Men... usually mean well, I believe that.
          But they need our help and patience.

          PRINCESS
          You were very brave, vouching for me. How
          do you know I'm not the enemy, bringing
          me here?

          ABE
          It's as you were saying, I suppose. From
          intuition, feeling. I've never met anyone
          like you... but that's my instinct.
          They gaze fondly at each other through the glass, as bubbles
          swirl out of Abe's gills.

          102 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Liz is patching Hellboy's injured head. In the background
          the TV's are playing up: CITY LIGHTS, WHITE HEAT and some TV
          programming.

          HELLBOY
          He caught me off-guard- but I'll get him
          next time.
          He's examining a few letters, contract forms, etc.

          LIZ
          There shouldn't be a "next time" we're
          all part of the same team.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 68

          HELLBOY
          We are- he's not- The guy's an egomaniac.
          You can see right through him.

          (PAUSE)
          That's a joke, Liz.
          Liz remains silent.

          HELLBOY
          (raises a letter)
          Look!! They wanna do a cartoon series,
          based on me? And this:
          (he holds up a box of cereal)
          Product endorsement - breakfast of
          demons. And a videogame!!!
          As CITY LIGHTS ends, Liz lifts the remote to turn the volume
          up.

          LIZ
          Gosh, that was so sweet, so sad- It
          always gets me- Red- There's something I
          need to-

          HELLBOY
          (taking the remote)
          No, wait.
          (switching to Leno)
          Look that's us-
          Jay is showing some footage from the giant incident.

          LENO
          So- this "Hellboy" what is he?? Is he
          really on our side?? I mean, he's red,
          has a tail and shaves his horns- horns,
          Ladies and Gentleman. Horns are never a
          good sign.

          HELLBOY

          (CHUCKLES)
          Ha- He's funny.

          LENO
          Maybe we should have him come over and
          talk to us a little, uh? Whaddayathink??
          The crowd roars.

          HELLBOY
          That's a great idea, don't you think??

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 69

          LIZ
          No, I don't-

          HELLBOY
          Did you know that during the commercial
          breaks the orchestra keeps playing so the
          guest can't talk to Jay... keeps the
          conversation fresh.

          LIZ
          How do you know these things?

          HELLBOY
          I read it in TV Guide.

          LIZ
          You're really liking this, aren't you?

          HELLBOY
          We should do this-

          LIZ
          It's a bad idea. All of it- Do you really
          need everybody to like you?? What's in it
          for you?? Are we not enough???
          She leaves. Hellboy glances at Leno on TV: a dog outfitted
          in a ballerina costume is jumping around with a red ball
          balanced on its nose. Hellboy chuckles.

          HELLBOY
          That's funny.

          CUT TO:

          103 EXT. BALCONY BPRD - NIGHT 103

          Liz is looking out into Trenton NJ's light landscape. Johann
          approaches her.

          JOHANN
          Are you alright-?
          Liz nods weakly.

          JOHANN
          May I be of assistance??

          LIZ
          Maybe.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 70

          JOHANN
          He's a big brute, isn't he??
          Liz chuckles.

          JOHANN
          But he has a good heart. I know it. He
          means well.

          LIZ
          I think I may have made a mistake.

          JOHANN
          In what way, Mein Frau??

          LIZ
          Just a mistake- nothing important.

          (SIGHS)
          But sometimes being with him is not easy-

          JOHANN
          It never is. I know.
          Lis looks at him with renewed interest.

          JOHANN
          I was married once. A long, long time
          ago... And only after I lost her- I
          realized that my life would never be
          quite the same- And my loss lead me to
          become what I am today...
          Johann's human face materializes inside his glass helmet.

          JOHANN
          I- I tried constantly to make contact
          with her-

          DISSOLVE STARTS :

           - SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT 104

          104 FLASHBACK - CIRCA 2001
          Johann's mouth opens and out of it emerges a large tendril
          of ectoplasm. His neck engorges and the substance continues
          to flow freely out of his mouth and fingertips--

          JOHANN
          It was only there- in the Ethereal plane
          that I ever gazed upon her again...
          CAMERA close in on several ceremonial candles burning in the
          room. Their flame illuminating the eerie scene.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 71
          Out of the mouths of the other guests, emerge other, equally
          large ectoplasmic shapes.
          They cross to-

          105 THE ETHEREAL PLANE 105
          Once there- they reform into humanoid shapes, vaguely
          reminiscent of their mortal bodies.
          JOHANN floats freely, approaching another humanoid form in
          the void: That of a woman, his wife.

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          But it was there, while he was partially
          on the ethereal plane, that disaster

          STRUCK-
          He is about to embrace his wife's form when a horrible
          rumble occurs and the void bursts in flames, destroying and
          distorting everything around him-
          His wife's shape screams and evaporates.

          106 INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT 106

          BPRD agents break in on the scene. Smoke and flames billow
          in the room, wax puddles stand where the CEREMONIAL CANDLES
          were and seated around the seance table, charred corpses
          hold hands in eternal contact. As the Agents move around a
          pale, vaporous shape emerges from the soot-stained darkness:
          It's Johann.

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          All the seance attendees were
          incinerated. The only survivor -and only
          to some extent- was me- Why? I'll never

          KNOW--
          The form moves towards its body and attempts to climb back
          and reanimate it, but the CHARRED CORPSE is barely amble to
          amble a few steps forward before collapsing into ash and
          bone... The shape of Ectoplasm stands there, alone and lost-
          Then, Professor TREVOR BROOM wanders into the scene and
          approaches the form-

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          It was then that Professor Broom and the
          B.P.R.D. devised a containment suit for
          me. A new body-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 72
          CAMERA pulls back to reveal-

          107 BALCONY BPRD - NIGHT 107
          Johann, back in the balcony, talking to Liz.

          JOHANN
          I owe Professor Broom everything that
          I've become. He brought me back to life-
          He grows silent for a brief moment.

          JOHANN
          But I've never been able to see her
          again. My reach became limited- My loss,
          infinite...
          Liz puts her hand on his shoulder. Johann takes it...

          JOHANN
          Loss- the very threat of it makes us
          vulnerable... makes us care- You can see
          that, don't you?? Without her I became
          but an empty shell...
          Liz leans her head on his shoulder.

          JOHANN
          Don't give up on him. Not yet.
          Liz chuckles.

          LIZ
          No. Not yet.
          CAMERA discovers HELLBOY, watching them from behind a glass
          door, a six-pack in his hand. He steps away.

          108 INT. CORRIDOR - LATER 108

          Heliboy walks down a deserted corridor carrying his six
          pack.
          He stops, puzzled. Strains of Barry Manilow are emanating
          from the library.

          109 INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 109

          Hellboy enters the library and goes over to the tank. Abe is
          there, listening to Vivaldi.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 73

          ABE
          Ah, hello Red. You're up late.

          HELLBOY
          Liz and I- we had a fight-

          ABE

          OH-
          Hellboy eyes the CD player.

          HELLBOY
          Did I hear Barry Manilow just now?

          ABE
          (smiles hypocritical)
          Barry M- oh, Gosh- no- no-
          (fast, stammering)
          It was er- urm- Vivaldi. Il cimento
          dell'armonia I believe I particularly
          admire the passage...
          Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe's CD player. The music
          stops and he pulls out a different CD from the changer.

          HELLBOY
          What's happening to you??

          ABE
          Ooh- Ooh-

          (SIGHS)
          All my life I thought I was alone, a made-
          up name and a random pasted on a
          cylinder. But then I saw her- She's like
          me. A creature from another world...
          Alone... Brother Red- I think I'm in
          love.

          HELLBOY
          You say that like it's a good thing.
          (looks at the CD)
          What track?

          ABE

          (ASHAMED)
          Track eight-

          HELLBOY

          (READS)
          Oh, God- you're disgusting-

          ABE
          I know-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 74

          HELLBOY
          "Can't smile without you"

          ABE
          I'd cry, but I don't have the glands for
          it..

          (DESPERATE)
          What am I going to do, Red????
          Hellboy sighs and pops a beer, presses play and sighs
          heavily, looks around-

          ABE
          I miss him- Father- don't you??

          HELLBOY

          (NODS)
          Everyday.

          ABE
          He would tell what to do- He would tell
          what's right- what's wrong-

          HELLBOY
          He did that for all of us...
          The opening strings of "Can't Smile Without You."

          ABE
          (sips beer)
          You know? I- I never much appreciated
          Manilow's artistry that much- until now-
          Now it seems to be a grand poet and
          speaks directly to my innermost feelings.

          HELLBOY
          Jeez- You need to get out more-
          The two of them sit there, growing quiet, listening to the
          syrupy music. Then, slowly, the two of them start singing:
          low at first and then at the top of their voices, moved and
          teary-eyed.

          110 INT. PRINCESS ROOM AT BPRD - NIGHT

          The Princess hears the distant music and smiles, but then
          feels a chill down her spine. She shudders and moves to the
          panoramic window and gazes outside, to the woods and the
          distant city lights below...

          The music can be heard at a distance.
          A dark figure stands on a hill, amid the trees, listening
          and watching... CAMERA MOVES IN: the Prince gazes at the
          building.

          112 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - DAY

          Manning strides down the corridor, followed by the BPRD
          team. All of them dressed in BLACK LEATHER OUTFITS.

          MANNING
          This is a whole new ballgame and I want
          you to take my lead.

          ABE
          I find these leather outfits very

          UNCOMFORTABLE-

          MANNING
          Maybe so, maybe so- but they look- hip.

          (BEAT)
          When it comes to dealing with reporters
          or the public, I set the tone. You all
          know the old saying: the perception is
          the reality.

          HELLBOY
          Correctamundo, chief. For one thing, we
          can ditch the garbage truck, right?

          ABE
          Wait, Red, the lab's in it-

          HELLBOY
          Screw the lab. I want new wheels.

          MANNING

          (SMIRKING)

          The round a corner and enter -

          Three gleaming Hummers await them.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 76

          MANNING
          A gift from General Motors. One for each
          of you.
          Each Hummer has custom paint: Hellboy's with scenes of
          Dante's inferno, Liz's with flames and Abe's with an
          underwater vista.

          HELLBOY
          This is more like it!

          LIZ
          I'm not driving that-
          Abe has opened the hood on his Hummer.

          ABE
          This is a most unfortunate vehicle. The
          sheer waste of precious fossil fuels...

          MANNING
          An American custom, it's called product
          placement! What's the harm?

          CUT TO:

          114 EXT. NEW YORK STREET

          A mob of SCREAMING FANS outside the TV studio. The frenzy
          intensifies when they see the Hummers pulling up.
          As the BPRD team exits the cars, autograph seekers break
          through the POLICE LINE and swarm around the heroes.

          MANNING
          Every agent on the field is on the case.
          They will solve it--
          Hellboy signs a color photo of himself with a flourish.

          HELLBOY
          There you go, pal. "To Jason, best
          wishes, Hellboy."

          FAN
          (squints at the signature)
          How am I supposed to read that?

          BELLBOY
          You don't like it?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 77
          Irritated, he scowls at the fan. Manning takes him by the
          elbow and leads him away.

          HELLBOY
          (to the fan)
          That turns up on e-Bay, I'm gonna find
          you, "Jason"...

          115 INT. GREEN ROOM - LATER

          A row of makeup chairs. Manning sits in the first one,
          looking at himself in the mirror.

          MANNING
          Can you do anything about this... uh...
          (lowers his voice)
          -double chin?

          MAKEUP GIRL
          No, you're not being made up.

          MANNING
          Why not?

          MAKEUP GIRL
          They said, you're too normal. You don't
          need anything.

          MANNING
          But- Believe me- I'm not normal at
          all...

          2
          CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where Makeup Girl
          holds a camelhair brush and stares dubiously at Abe.

          MAKEUP GIRL 2
          So, what color is that- green?

          ABE
          Carribbean Blue, actually.
          CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where the very sexy
          Makeup Girl 3 gingerly touches Hellboy's chest.

          MAKEUP GIRL 3
          Are these really scars?

          HELLBOY
          Well, yeah. Each one tells a story-
          His grin fades as he sees Johann talking to Liz. He abruptly
          gets up and goes to them.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 78

          HELLBOY
          That about you, glass-man? A few squirts
          of Windex?

          JOHANN
          I'm not going on. And if I may- a word of

          ADVICE-
          (long beat, then sotto voce)
          -it's not a good idea to hint that you
          two have... a relationship.

          HELLBOY
          Thanks a bunch. I'll decide that.

          JOHANN
          You don't know how people may react.

          HELLBOY
          It's a love story. They'll lap it up.

          JOHANN
          I know you don't like me, but trust me on
          this one.

          (BEAT)
          I knew your father- he was a friend-
          Hellboy blinks, taking the information in.

          JOHANN
          Do as you may- But know this- he wouldn't
          have approved of your behaviour.
          A P.A. opens the door.

          P.A.
          You're on-!

          JOHANN
          I'll be watching from the truck lab,
          where I belong- Go, enjoy your fifteen
          minutes...

          One of them, a puppet vendor, showcases his product. He
          manipulates a wooden marionette: A KNIGHT in SHINING ARMOR.
          In the distance- lights, bright lights and the train ROAR!!!
          The Puppeteer readies his merchandise bag and quickly moves
          to the edge of the platform alongside other passengers. The
          lights grow in intensity and the ROAR becomes deafening. But
          something's wrong, really, wrong-

          PUPPETEER
          Hooy na ny!
          The lights are in reality, the eyes of a giant dragon and it
          roars into the platfrom, demolishing pillars, crushing
          people and eating the puppeteer in a matter of second.
          Pandemonium ensues.

          The Princess smiles as the camera singles out Abe for a
          closeup.

          ABE
          Actually, Mr. Leno, my lungs are more
          like gills. I need to convert the air's

          Alone with her thoughts, she examines the curved gold piece
          hanging from a chain around her neck. She closes her eyes

          126 TNT. LIBRARY -- CONTINUOUS 126
          A VIDEO surveillance camera in the BPRD library records the
          Princess as she crosses to Abe's tank.

          She hides the gold segment within the pages of "Jane Eyre."
          At that moment, the Yrdrig GROWLS -

          PRINCESS
          Shhh, it's all right -
          BOOM-! A jolt shakes the room. A-moment later, a wall
          collapses as warty, heavily muscled ARMS and FINGERS tear at
          the masonry!
          in seconds, a squad of TROLLS pulls itself into view! WINK
          leers at the Princess. From her waistband, she produces a
          long, thin DAGGER and wields it timidly.
          Somewhere in the building, ALARMS start clanging.
          The Yrdrig shakes himself into action and springs.
          With a SNARL, it attaches its several jaws onto the nearest
          trolls. As the fighting creatures crash into the spiral
          staircase, the Princess hears a familiar voice:

          PRINCE
          Hold.
          The Prince steps into the room, carrying a long spear.
          The trolls are on top of the Yrdrig, ready to kill him.

          PRINCE
          Come-!
          The trolls release the Yrdrig and bound over to the Prince.
          The last troll, however, grabs the Yrdrig by the neck and
          brutally twists -!

          Hellboy, Abe, Liz and Johann race past him, disappearing
          into the building. The alarm bells are deafening.

          128 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR 128

          Hellboy leads the way down the corridors, which are alive
          with scrambling personnel. Several BPRD employees are lying
          on the floor, wounded and confused.

          129 INT. LOBBY 129

          The top-level human agents are clustered in the lobby, their
          guns drawn, all of them aiming at the Prince and his
          drooling bodyguards. Standoff.
          As Hellboy and the team arrive, Abe sees the Princess, her
          arms tied. Her brother holds her by the hair.

          ABE
          Princess!
          Without thinking, he darts forward. Instantly, one of the
          trolls swipes at him, its claws just missing his chest-

          HELLBOY
          Abe! No, get back!!
          Abe regains his balance and tries again, his eyes glued to
          the desperate features of the beautiful young woman. Hellboy
          manages to restrain him.

          PRINCESS
          Mr. Sapien, don't! He'll kill you!

          PRINCE
          I'll kill you all, if that's what you
          want.

          HELLBOY
          No. Why don't you just start with me?
          Hellboy strolls up to the Prince.

          Five-fingered Mary.
          In the background, Manning arrives, wide-eyed. Just in time
          to see the Prince hand off his captive to one of the trolls.
          He drops back, flips his spear to horizontal and waits for
          Hellboy's attack.

          130 FIGHT
          Hellboy feints left, goes right and whips around, swinging
          his tail at the Prince. The Prince leaps and jabs with the
          spear, poking a hole in Hellboy's coat.
          The surrounding crowd backs away as the combatants circle
          each other. The Prince is nimble. The Prince is quick. He
          thrusts the spear again and again, driving Hellboy into a
          display case full of antique weapons.
          The glass breaks and a number of swords and axes fall to the
          floor.

          JOHANN
          (to Hellboy)
          Arm yourself! Use the flail!.

          HELLBOY
          Not my style. Watch and learn, fish bowl.
          He punches the Prince, hard. The blow knocks the Prince to
          his knees; as he rises, Hellboy connects with a brutal
          combination.
          In the arms of the troll, the Princess' head rockets back
          and forth, as if struck. A moan of pain escapes from her
          lips.

          ABE
          (seeing this)
          H.B., no! Stop - you mustn't harm him!
          As the Prince totters, Hellboy turns to look at Abe,
          momentarily distracted- Then-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 87
          Hellboy grimaces and looks down: the Prince's SPEAR TIP is
          half-buried in his chest...!
          The Prince sneers and gives the spear a savage yank,
          breaking off the blade! Hellboy's eyes roll upward; Liz
          SCREAMS. She and Johann manage to catch Hellboy as he
          collapses.
          The Prince reclaims the Princess and turns to the humans.
          His eyes seek out Abe, who has rushed to Hellboy's side.

          PRINCE
          (showing off the Princess)
          If you want to see her again, you'll give
          me what's rightfully mine. Many people
          died for that crown. Bring it to me.

          He goes directly to one of the book stands, which lies in
          pieces on the floor. He comes up with his copy of "Jane

          (FIERCE)
          Fire and water, me and you, Abe. We'll
          kick his ass.
          Abe looks supremely troubled.

          LIZ
          Abe, let's do this for Red!
          Abe nods, unable to find a good answer. He manages to tuck
          the gold piece into his belt.

          CUT TO:

          136 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER 136

          Abe stands at a lectern. Behind him, a projected image of
          the Princess' map from the troll market. His finger traces
          the strange, elvish text.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 90

          ABE
          The map contained within the cylinder
          seems useless-

          (BEAT)
          Now the case itself proves very useful-
          He moistens the holding cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat
          and imprints the surface pattern on the paper map. Glyphs
          and coordinates become visible.
          A silhouette of a twisted, gnarly tree is visible too.

          ABE
          Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her
          brother were born there. They hold it
          sacred.

          MANNING
          Even if you're right, we sit tight and
          locate the gold piece, make sure he never
          ever gets his hands on it. If there's any
          truth to this legend, the fate of the
          world depends on it.

          LIZ
          What about Red?? Don't you care about
          him???
          A moment of silence. Nobody knows what to say. Finally:

          JOHANN
          Liz. That may be his destiny. Manning is
          right: we can't take the chance.
          Liz glares at him.

          LIZ
          I see. Red was right about you. Welcome
          to the team, Johann. And goodbye.
          She leaves the room.

          CUT TO:

          137 INT. HB'S ROOM - LATER 137

          Hellboy leans weakly against the doorway to his room. His
          cats purr all around him, oblivious to his pain. He sits by
          the bed. Liz enters the room. He smiles weakly at her-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 91

          HELLBOY
          Don't worry, Sparky- It's all going to be

          ALRIGHT-
          Abe stands nearby, in silence. Liz looks at him, teary-eyed.

          ABE
          We'll make it alright. Screw Manning- You
          are right, Liz- We should just do this
          together: the three of us.
          Liz smiles.

          CUT TO:

          138 INT. PLANE - NIGHT 138

          The BPRD airplane sits quietly in its hangar. In the
          passenger compartment, Hellboy climbs up. He looks up to see
          Liz smiling down at him.

          139 INT. COCKPIT - SAME 139

          Abe's sitting in the pilot's seat, leafing through the
          massive airplane manual.

          ABE
          Engine, starting- refer to NA-7488-BD...
          Liz climbs in behind him.

          LIZ
          We stay here much longer, we're gonna get
          caught...

          ABE
          Just a few more minutes. Here's an easy
          way to remember that "port" means "left."
          They each have four-
          A NOISE from the door: it's Johann.

          JOHANN
          Good evening, friends.

          LIZ
          Don't try to stop us, Johann.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 92

          JOHANN
          On the contrary. I've been giving it some
          thought, and we should be able to save
          Hellboy. After all, the Prince lacks the
          gold crown. Without it, his army poses no
          threat. None at all.
          Abe is very quiet.

          ABE
          (in despair)
          Its useless- I- I- can't- I can't pilot
          this thing...
          Johann sits down in the co-pilot seat and melds with the
          controls...

          JOHANN
          I'll give it a try-
           Abe smiles at the sound of the engines starting up.

           140

          140 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - SAME

          Manning bangs on a vending machine in one of the BPRD
          corridors. As a dribble of hot coffee splatters into his
          cup, a couple of AGENTS run up.

          AGENT
          Sir - you'd better come, fast -

          MANNING
          Got it - ow!
          He burns his fingers on the coffee as he hurries after the
          agents.

          141

          141 INT. HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER

          The BPRD airplane is ROARING, amid clouds of exhaust fumes.
          The plane spins around and around in tight circles, its wing
          tips knocking into ladders, lights and shelves.
          A bunch of agents are cowering in the doorway as Manning
          arrives.

          MANNING
          Not ALL of them, it's not possible!

          AGENT
          Isn't that Johann at the controls?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 93
          Sure enough, they get a glimpse of the transparent head
          through the cockpit window. Abe's there, too. He raises a
          webbed hand to wave goodbye.
          The plane taxis outside onto the runway...

          142 EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT 142

          .and takes off, barely under control, just missing the New
          Jersey treetops.

          CUT TO:

          143 UNDERGROUND 143
          The Prince pulls the Princess through fractured, roaring
          tunnels. Here and there, the walls are pierced, allowing
          light and ocean waves to enter.
          Rounding a few corners, the Prince stops near a wall
          decorated with a large, elaborate FRESCO. It shows a
          stylized family tree, hunting scenes and naive renderings of
          trolls, faeries and ogres.

          PRINCE
          Maybe this will help you remember who we
          are, who you are... What our destiny is-
          The Prince pushes his sister through a low doorway, out onto

          A-

          144 LEDGE 144
          -overlooking a vast cavern, big as a stadium, lit by a
          thousand torches. The mechanical ARMY stands knee-deep in
          heaving seawater and foam.

          PRINCE
          They - they - will be mine to command,
          whether you like it or not. Only after
          our victory will you appreciate my
          sacrifice... and yours.

          145 EXT. BPRD PLANE - DAY 145

          The BPRD plane exits a bank of clouds and starts its descent
          upon an Irish island surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 94
          Massive granite mountains encircle an impossibly green
          valley.

          146 TNT. BPRD PLANE COCKPIT - DAY 146
          Early sunlight washes over Hellboy's body, who weakly groans
          in Liz's arms.

          HELLBOY
          (to Liz)
          Where are we, Liz..?

          LIZ
          Near the ocean, Red.We'regonna make you
          well here.

          147 EXT.OPEN FIELD,IRELAND - DAY 147


          148 SIGN:REYNVILLE,IRELAND. 148
          The back doors of the cargo plane opens and out come Abe and

          JOHANN-

          149 EXT. GREEN FIELD - DAY 149

          Liz and Abe help Hellboy up to a gnarled TREE, twisted by
          eons of wind.
          Abe unfurls the map and points at a drawing of a similar,
          weird tree.

          ABE
          This should be the portal. By all rights-
          Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully.

          JOHANN
          Abe, bring the mapcase over here.
          He's found a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest
          branch joins the trunk. Abe slips the map back into its
          crystal cylinder and holds it alongside: it looks to be a
          perfect fit.

          LIZ
          Yes! Try it, Abe-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 95

          JOHANN
          Before you do anything... remember what
          we're in for. A world unlike anything
          we've ever known. Dangerous, deceptive...

          LIZ
          You're wasting time!
          Abe inserts and twists the cylinder.
          The tree comes to life, hauling its roots out of the ground,
          bending them into a swaying arch.

          JOHANN
          Dangerous, deceptive... and hard to
          leave.
           They walk under the tree roots, into...

           150

          150 FAIRY WORLD
          A transformed landscape. A perpetual nightland- Still
          overlooking the same ocean, but now throbbing with pale
          colors and twisted, Rackahm-esque contours.
          The men start down the hill, into a valley bordered by a
          rugged coastline.

          CUT TO:

          151 EXT. INLET - DAY 151

          The team reaches the stony shore of a mile-wide inlet. Abe
          brings out the map.

          ABE
          (pointing to the opposite shore)
          Renvyle is over there.
          They glance up and down the beach, looking for a boat.
          Hellboy blinks and sniffs the air.
          A GOBLIN speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the
          shallows directly in front of them. By his side, sitting
          atop of a tree: A SATYR and a CROW observe the group.

          GOBLIN
          I bid you welcome, strangers. Would you
          be seeking safe passage to Renvyle?

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 96

          LIZ
          Yes! Can you help us?

          JOHANN

          (QUIET)
          Careful, Liz.

          SATYR
          I'm sure you can come to an
          understanding!
          The Goblin heaves on an oar and emerges from behind the
          rocks. He's standing in the stern of a sturdy little
          coracle. Its wooden hull is painted in Celtic patterns.

          GOBLIN
          Room enough for all of you!
          (looks at Hellboy)
          Even your weary friend.

          JOHANN
          What will it cost, boatman?
          The Goblin smiles, displaying a disconcerting row of
          triangular teeth.

          GOBLIN
          Ah, next to nothing! Make me an offer.
          Abe, Johann and Liz confer among themselves:

          LIZ
          How much?

          CROW
          He won't want money.

          JOHANN
          (to the goblin)
          I have a... belt!

          OF
          Johann removes his equipment belt, dangling it in front
          the creature's bat-like face.

          GOBLIN
          I have no use for such a thing.
          Liz shows him her binoculars.

          LIZ
          Here... is a wonderful set of eyes, magic
          eyes that will bring the world-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 97

          GOBLIN
          I already have binoculars! No, I see
          something special.
          He points toward Hellboy's chest.

          SATYR
          Under his bandage - !
          Quick as a squirrel, the creature hops to Hellboy's side and
          brings out a KNIFE! SWISH! In one sweep of the blade, he
          reveals HB's terrible wound, and the speartip protruding
          from it.

          GOBLIN
          That!
          (points at the steel)
          That - in exchange for your crossing!

          LIZ
          Don't you touch it - !
          She rushes to Hellboy's side, pushing the Goblin back, ready
          for a fight. The Goblin shrugs.

          GOBLIN
          Is it so precious to you? Let me pull it
          out.

          ABE
          You mustn't. One touch can kill him.
          The Goblin's eyes grow wide with understanding.

          GOBLIN
          Ah. I see. We must go to the Angel of

          DEATH-

          CROW
          He'll know what to do.

          152 EXT. INLET - DAY 152

          The tiny boat is a dot on the golden waves of the inlet as
          the Goblin rows them to the opposite shore and docks near a
          cove.
          The Goblin leads the way as Liz, Abe and Johann arrive and
          help Hellboy up.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 98
          Strange BIRDS hang upside down form the Cave's roof. A
          MASSIVE CHIMNEY has been carved out of the cave's rock at
          the other end. A Black, ancient figure is hunched there,
          warming its skeletal hands by the fire.
          A raspy voice utters something in an ancient language. The
          Goblin replies, gesturing at Hellboy, who collapses on the
          floor.
          In a deep coma, Hellboy lies on the floor, near the
          crackling fireplace. The ANGEL OF DEATH extends its FOUR
          BLACK WINGS and a thin, jagged smile appears in its pale,
          eyeless face.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          So. This one... The boy- I remember him
          well! Anung-un-Rama!

          LIZ
          Oh, my God. She knows - ?!

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          I helped bring him into this world - in
          my fashion.
          It pulls a set of a glowing, red-hot TONGS out of the fire.
          It studies the speartip, which has buried itself deep in
          Hellboy's flesh.

          ANGEL OF DEATH (CONT'D)
          I warn you: it is his destiny to rule
          over the destruction of the Earth. Not
          now, not tomorrow - but some day. You are
          sure you want him to live?

          LIZ
          Yes, I say yes-!
          Abe and Johann exchange a silent, worried look.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Very well, then- but let it be said: The
          day will come when you will pay the price
          fire girl: This will bring you and the
          world much sorrow.

          LIZ
          And I'll deal with it when that time
          comes. Now save him.
          The creature cackles and then grips the spear tip with the
          tongs. A cry of pain from Hellboy as it withdraws the bloody
          point from his chest.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 99
          The ANGEL OF DEATH holds up the speartip and looks at it
          with distaste.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Harmless now.
          (looking at Hellboy)
          See - ?
          Hellboy's eyes flutter open.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          (to Hellboy)
          Sleep now, child. Your strength, it will
          return.
          A guttural HISS from the corner: the Goblin is jumping up
          and down, pointing at the speartip.

          JOHANN
          Our ferry captain - he wants his
          payment...

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Ach, outside with you!
          She tosses the speartip to the creature, who scoops it up
          and bounds out the door.
          instantly, the goblins and birds leap down and crowd around
          him, chattering in excitement over the latest prize.
          She gazes down at Hellboy, whose yellow eyes are fixed on
          her. He smiles wanly.

          CUT TO:

          153 EXT.. HILLTOP - DAY 153

          Alone on a hilltop, Abe surveys the coastline. Through the
          binoculars, he discerns a SECOND CAVE half-hidden behind
          wild, breaking waves.
          Glancing back at ANGEL OF DEATH's cave, Johann strikes off
          on his own, headed for the cave.

          154 EXT. HUT - DAY 154

          Outside ANGEL OF DEATH's hut, a bandaged HB is sitting up,
          blinking in the sunlight. He sips some tea and gazes at Liz,
          who is happy now.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 100

          LIZ
          I almost lost you-
          Hellboy smiles and grabs her hand-

          HELLBOY
          I thought you were mad at me.

          LIZ
          Well, no one can stay mad forever.

          HELLBOY
          I'm sorry for all the attention, I
          thought it would be good for us.

          LIZ
          We're never going to make them all happy,
          Red. What we have is ours and no one

          ELSE'S-

          BELLBOY
          I can turn my back on the world. I don't
          care anymore I don't- as long as you stay
          with me- as long as you think I'm still a
          good man.

          (BEAT )
          Am I a good man, Liz?? Am I??

          LIZ
          Yes you are. You are the best man I've
          ever met.

          HELLBOY
          You still seem sad. Is there anything you
          want to tell me-??

          LIZ
          Yes, there is-

          HELLBOY
          Say it now, then. Whatever it is, I'm
          ready.

          (SIGHS)
          Is it about Johann-

          LIZ
          No- no- what are you talking about??
          Before she can go on, Johann appears. He carries a poultice
          and fresh rags.

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 101

          JOHANN
          Abe and I have found the entrance to the
          Golden Army's resting place- Liz come
          with us-
          (looks at Hellboy)
          You should stay behind and get some rest-

          HELLBOY
          And call you in the morning, right?? Like
          Hell I will. I'm keeping an eye on you,

          GLASSHOLE-

          CUT TO:

          155

          155 EXT. HILLS - DAY

          Johann, Liz and Hellboy follow a rugged trail along a bluff
          high over the sea. Johann refers to the map, then points to
          the cave opening a half-mile ahead. Abe is standing there,

          WAVING-

          JOHANN
          There.
          Abe points at the violent sea below-

          ABE
          The only way in- I'm afraid we'll have to
          jump in-
          (looks at Hellboy)
          Can you make it-?
          Hellboy nods.

          BELLBOY
          Strange. If this is the entrance-

          ABE
          I know- Why isn't there more security??
          With a ROAR, WINK!!!!! - jumps out and throws a CHAIN around
          Bellboy's neck!
          The chain is connected to his IRON MACE which now dangles
          around Hellboy's neck.
          The two creatures battle each other fiercely. WINK's MACE
          destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects
          twice with Hellboy's head.
          But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the chain in
          two and twirling the mace like a boleador.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 102
          He hits Wink again and again-

          HELLBOY
          See?? It hurts!!! It hurts!!!
          Hellboy grips the chain, pulls the creature close, then,
          like a weightlifter, raises him high overhead. With a mighty
          GRUNT, Hellboy tosses him overboard. WINK hits the jagged
          rocks once- twice- thrice-

          HELLBOY
          Ouch- ouch- ouch-
          (looking around)
          We better go swimming before any more
          ugly fellas show up-
          He stares down into the swirling waters and discreetly takes
          his hand to his bandaged side: He's bleeding. The wound has
          re-opened.

          ABE
          Red, are you-?

          HELLBOY
          Don't say a word, Blue- Let's move on-

          156

          156 UNDERWATER
          Johann plunges in from above, his body quickly tumbled by
          the rough seas. A moment later, Liz and Hellboy are in the
          water, too.
          Johann swims down, leading them into the darkness of the
          cave entrance.

          157 INT. CAVE ENTRANCE - SAME 157

          As they bob up for air, they find there's only a few inches
          of breathing room between the sea and the rocky ceiling. Liz
          starts coughing.

          JOHANN
          Hang on, people. I'll be right back.

          158

          158 UNDERWATER
          Johann dives down to find a rusting, iron LOCK six feet
          under the surface. He tries to turn the control wheel, but
          can't make it budge.

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 103
          Seconds later, Hellboy is at his side, gripping the wheel in
          his huge hands. Using all his strength, Hellboy finally
          manages to turn it.
          His bandage, however, floats free... and his wound opens up,
          emitting a plume of blood.
          Lungs bursting, he shoots to the surface. Johann stays
          behind and swings open the lock, revealing...

          159 A STAIRWELL 159
          .carved from the living rock, leading upward into the
          depths of the cliff.

          CUT TO:

          160 STAIRS - LATER 160
          The trio cautiously climbs the stairs, finding their way
          with light sticks. Hellboy stops to lean against the wall.
          He dabs at his chest with a rag.

          LIZ
          (to Johann)
          Hold up. We need to rest.

          HELLBOY
          Says who? I'm fine, I tell ya.
          He lurches forward, pushing past the others, fighting off
          his pain.

          LIZ
          (to Johann)
          This was a mistake. He's -

          JOHANN
          Mein Gott--
          The stairs lead to-

          161 INT. CAVERN 161

          -a vast underground arena where a thousand torches are
          flickering.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal rank upon rank of GOLDEN
          SOLDIERS. Immobile. Silent. Waiting.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 104

          162 AMONG THE SOLDIERS 162
          Hellboy leads the way down a row of gleaming statues,
          pausing to gaze up at the blank face of one of the
          infantrymen.

          HELLBOY
          Hey, amigo. You got some gum?
          Two rows away, Johann examines the lethal weaponry that
          terminates the arms of each soldier.

          JOHANN
          Most ingenious. A versatile, highly
          mobile killing machine.

          LIZ
          Make that machines, Johann. I see more
          than one.
          Hellboy taps on a soldier's mechanical chest, which booms
          faintly, sending ECHOES up into the dark cavern.

          HELLBOY
          Wow. You hear that? Listen -
          He thumps it, harder. The mechanical thing rocks
          backwards...

          HELLBOY
          Uh oh.
          CRASH!!! The thing falls onto the soldier behind it! Then,

          -
          the ear-shattering noise of a hundred car wrecks builds as
          - a toppling LINE OF SOLDIERS races away like falling
          dominoes!!

          HELLBOY
          Whoops.
          The sound dwindles, then builds again as ANOTHER LINE of
          falling soldiers bears down on them!!
           Liz screams and Hellboy pulls her aside. The soldiers crash
          past them until -
          - the din suddenly stops. The PRINCE stands revealed at the
          head of the column.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 105

          PRINCE
          As a boy, they say I enjoyed toy
          soldiers. So do you, I see.
          He strolls past the mechanical figures, pausing to kick
          aside some of the weapons.

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          You're bleeding. Most unfortunate.
          Hellboy wipes at his oozing chest wound.

          HELLBOY
          Yeah. Now it's your turn.

          PRINCE
          Do you envy these contraptions? They
          never bleed. They feel nothing. Not even
          the zest of combat.
          The Prince circles them, keeping an eye on Johann.

          PRINCE
          These fighting men are the very model of
          patience... merely awaiting word from
          their lawful commander.

          AS
          From his tunic, he brings forth two of the gold segments.
          he fits them together...

          PRINCE
          You have the remaining piece, I presume.

          JOHANN
          We do not -

          PRINCE

          (SURPRISED)
          Then you are most foolish.
          He gestures to some troll GUARDS near a tunnel entrance.
          They lead the Princess out in chains.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          You came here expecting what? Mercy?

          JOHANN
          The death you would unleash will never
          happen! What you need is far from here
          and will stay out of your reach forever.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 106
          A VOICE reaches their ears from the tunnel entrance behind
          them.

          ABE
          Stop - I have it.
          Abe, dripping wet, stands there, the last gold segment in
          the palm of his hand.

          ABE

          (APPROACHING)
          Here... For her... Take it...

          JOHANN
          Oh, my God. What has he done?
          Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece
          to the Prince.
          Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed.

          HELLBOY
          Abe -

          ABE
          (to Hellboy)
          You cannot fight him- not without hurting
          her...

          (BEAT )
          What would you do if it was Liz??
          CLICK! The Prince fits the gold parts together and places
          the resulting crown on his head!

          PRINCE
          I am Prince Nuada and I command my army
          to life once more. Does anyone dispute my
          right?
          With the deep sound of gears, ratchets and springs, the army
          comes to life. Up comes the lances and shields.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          (points at the team)
          Kill them.
          Abe is now aghast, seeing the Prince drag his sister back.

          ABE
          (to the Prince)
          That was your price!! A ransom, you said -
          paid in good faith!!

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

           HELLBOY 2 107
          ABE(continued)
           (to Hellboy)
          Why, he lied to us!

          HELLBOY
          Abe old buddy. If we survive this, we
          need to talk.
          The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four
          friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls.

          ABE
          He - he's a cad! Can you imagine, a
          highborn heir to the throne, last in a
          noble line of-

          BELLBOY
          Not now, Abe, okay?
          The first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them, their
          terrifying weapons slashing in unison. Hellboy brings out
          his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and
          swings it like a club.
          A couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop
          back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms.

          LIZ
          Let me -
          Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each
          hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the
          oncoming fighters.
          The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening
          scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains
          hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming,
          marching on and over their scorched comrades.
          Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it
          his best. His wound is running with fresh blood.
          He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against
          his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy
          groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect.
          At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the
          wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on.

          JOHANN
          Invincibility!? So - the only one thing
          may stop them -
          Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self
          flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier!

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 108
          Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts
          chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as
          Johann rips into the enemy!!
          But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen. As
          the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell
          is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically
          dismember it like marauding insects!
          As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless,
          Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit.

          JOHANN
          Ach. They are too many. Anyone have
          another idea?
          Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his
          feet.

          HELLBOY
          (a bellow)
          Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to
          command this army!
          With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All
          the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a
          ledge with his sister.

          ABE
          (follows HB)
          No= please- no-
          Hellboy moves away from him.

          HELLBOY
          A challenge must be answered! Raise your
          sword!

          PRINCE
          A challenge from you? A nobody?? You are
          no one.

          PRINCESS
          No!! He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the
          Fallen one- He has the right!
          Her eyes lock with Abe's: there's no other way.
          The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks
          up his sword.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 10 9

          PRINCE
          Very well.
          (to the BPRD team)
          May his fate show you the cost of pride
          and blindness.
          As the hall rings with their first blows of their swords-

          JOHANN
          Hellboy's too weak-
          Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to
          drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where
          they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army.
          Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe
          looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep
          parrying off his enemy.
          Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in
          dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond.
          The Prince is ready to kill him.

          LIZ
          (witness to a nightmare)
          No!! NO! !
          A sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps
          forward and...
          Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right
          arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger.
          Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away
          red with blood. He looks over at his sister.
          They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and
          hatred.
          Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly
          raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has
          the advantage.
          He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the
          Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest.

          HELLBOY
          I- have- won-

          PRINCE
          No. You have not-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 110
          He impales himself on HELLBOY's sword. The blade goes
          through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side. Hellboy
          pulls it out, but it's too late. Both the Prince and the
          Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded.

          ABE

          (GASPS)

          NO-
          Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his arms,
          blinking in despair.
          The pale young creature is now a ghostly white. She lifts
          her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face.

          PRINCESS
          We'll find each other again, somewhere.
          And she dies in his arms.
          In the center of the arena:

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          You... think you're any different from
          me? The humans - they will tire of you.
          They will disappoint you. And in the end,
          they will betray you. You... are living a
          lie. Your time will come again. May you
          make a better choice.
          Then, he, too, is dead. Both him and his sister turn to
          fine, pale dust. And the wind carries away the ashes from
          Abe's hands...
          Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the Prince's head.
          Looks at it carefully, as if considering the possibilities.
          Suddenly, he rips it into pieces. As he crushes the first
          segement...
          . an entire division of the golden army collapses into a
          heap of scrap metal!
          Hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown and
          another massive division of the army tumbles into junk!
          HB is about the tear up the last segment of the crown, when
          it explodes in his hands!
          WHUMP! The last of the army disintegrates.
          Hellboy confronts the Prince's frightened troll guards:

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 111

          HELLBOY
          (to the trolls)
          You - and your kind! Leave here. And stay
          in the shadows - where you belong.
          As the ogres slink back into the tunnels, Liz looks at
          Hellboy. He seems angry, stung by the Prince's last words.

          DISSOLVE:

          163

          163 EXT. HILLS - DAY

          The BPRD team crosses waterfalls and stone bridges, through
          the magical hills.
          Liz walks at Hellboy's side, but he avoids her glance.

          164

          164 EXT. TREE -- DAY

          They reach the strange, twisted tree. Johann takes the map
          cylinder and fits it into the slot.

          JOHANN
          Any last minute requests?

          ABE
          (very quiet)
          Do it, please. I - I'm ready for the real
          world now.
          Johann turns the cylinder. The tree roots form their arch...
          and the BPRD team walks through.

          165 EXT. RENVYLE - DAY

          On the other side of the tree: Manning and a bunch of agents
          have set up spotter scopes and are gazing out over the
          countryside, looking for them.
          Suddenly, the team appears, literally from out of nowhere.

          MANNING

          (STARTLED)
          Whoa! Where'd you come from? We were just-

          BELLBOY
          I know, here to help. Well, I appreciate
          that Manning.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 112
          Abe steps past Hellboy and removes his gunbelt and equipment
          pack.

          ABE
          Yes, Mr. Manning. I want to thank you,
          too. For all you've done for us over the
          years.
          He gives his stuff to the astonished agent.

          MANNING
          What? What, exactly is this?

          ABE
          (walking away)
          I quit.
          Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out the Samaritan and
          shrugs off his pack, too.

          MANNING
          Come on. You're resigning?

          HELLBOY
          Looks that way, doesn't it?
          Hellboy starts to leave, but spins around and takes his gun
          back.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          I think I'll keep this.
          He finally meets Liz's gaze. She crosses to him and takes
          him by the arm. She walks off with Hellboy and Abe, clinging
          tightly to the big, red daemon.

          MANNING
          Liz -- not you, too!?
          (to Johann)
          They can't do this. Stop them, Johann-

          JOHANN
          Manning, you're an asshole.

          166 EXT. COASTLINE - DAY 166

          Miles down the road, Abe stands on a promontory, staring off
          at the ocean, which blazes with golden reflections.
          Liz and HB sit next to each other on some mossy rocks.
          Overhead: blue sky, puffy white clouds.

          What you said before - about us living

          ANYWHERE-

          HELLBOY
          I mean it! `Course, I'm thinking USA...
           but, hey - you decide.

           LIZ
           (breathing deep)
           Let's find a place in the country. Clean
          air - green hills - fresh milk from the
          farm.

          HELLBOY
          Milk? Yech.

          LIZ
          A yard... With lots of room to grow in.

          HELLBOY
          (he looks blank)
          Grow? who gonna grow- ?

          LIZ
          Our baby, that's who!

          5 ZINCO ENTERPRISES helicopters land on the hard, icy
          surface of Amundsen's glacier. A row of GUARDS in black
          garb flank each helicopter.
          Out of one of them exits RODERICK ZINCO, billionare, madman.
          He carries a mechanized container, a little larger than a

          Light shines through the ice walls and into rows and rows of
          machinery.

1  EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                               1

   Garish purple light spills out of side-street porno houses,
   illuminating a silhouette, and little else, of a MAN leaning
   against an alley wall.

   He is waiting.

   Another silhouetted FIGURE appears and approaches the first.
   They size each other up as best they can.

                                FIRST MAN
                          MacLeod.

   The second nods.

   The first without hesitation raises a sword, the intended
   thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash
   of metal severs the agressor's head.


2  INT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              2

   A 15th century Scottish home.

   A haggard WOMAN, her small CHILD clinging to a tattered apron,
   stands hunched over a glowing hearth.  Her veined hands drag
   a wooden spoon around and around through a soot-covered pot
   of grey soup.

   From an adjoining room CONOR MACLEOD, a young man dressed up
   in his best traditional Celtic tartan, enters.

                                MOTHER
                          My, but are you the
                          picture.

                                CONOR
                          (surveying himself)
                          It's a bit tight.

   His FATHER enters with a pail of milk.

                                FATHER
                          Ah, Conor, how you look
                          a man.

                                MOTHER
                          Have you time for some-
                          thing to eat?

                                CONOR
                          No, Mother.  They'll be
                          here shortly.

   Conor's father looks him over with pride.

                                FATHER
                          Your grandfather wore
                          that in his service to
                          the King, and I to fight
                          for the Duke.

                                MOTHER
                          Must he go?

                                FATHER
                          Aye.  It is his duty.  All
                          of ours.

                                MOTHER
                          But Ian, he's still but a boy.

                                FATHER
                          He's a MacLeod.

                                CONOR
                          I'll be fine Mother.


3  EXT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              3

   Several HORSEMEN gallop up through the early morning fog to
   the cottage door.

   Conor's father steps out to meet them.


4  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            4

   A massive KNIGHT sits astride his horse, moorish dew cling-
   ing to his helmet and breastplate.  A CLANSMAN hikes up the
   heather-carpeted slope to him.

                                CLANSMAN
                          They march.

                                KNIGHT
                          Is the boy among them?

                                CLANSMAN
                          Aye.


5  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                5

   The second kneels to examine the headless body of the first.

   With a CLACK a window, high on the alley wall, closes.


6  EXT. HIGHLAND PLAIN - MORNING                                     6

   The DUKE is leading a brigade of CLANSMEN out onto the plain.
   Mounted VASSALS ride back and forth inspecting the line.  The
   low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards.  There
   is an erie, smothering silence.

                                VASSAL #1
                          Is a bad day for this.

                                VASSAL #2
                          The Duke has been compro-
                          mised.  He will have his due.

                                VASSAL #1
                          By day's end he will have
                          our heads.

                                VASSAL #2
                          We ride against the Suther-
                          lands.  That is all that
                          matters.

                                VASSAL #1
                          This makes no sense to me.

   CONOR

   And a friend are marching through the moist heather.

                                FRIEND
                          The fog is bad.  We cannot
                          even see the sides of our
                          own ranks.

   Conor's nervousness is showing.

                                FRIEND
                          Is this your first?

                                CONOR
                          Aye.

  SHOUTING is heard on the plain.

                                FRIEND
                          It's begun.

7  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            7

   The Knight, above the fog, hears the battle commence below.
   He spurs his horse and starts down into the mist.

8  EXT. PLAIN - MORNING                                              8

   The two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan
   and clashing swords.  The air is charged with SHOUTS of ex-
   citement, agony, and the SHRILL of bag pipes.

   The fog has made each man's battle his own, each isolated with
   his opponent.

   THE KNIGHT

   Rides calmly through the fracas.  He strikes and kills those
   that assault him, but appears disinterested in battle.

   He is looking.

   CONOR

   Is standing above the twitching body of his friend.
   Alone and confused, Conor has become seperated from the clan.
   He stumbles through the fog, seeking help.

   Suddenly he is alone with the Knight.

   The face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy.  His fear turned
   to panic, Conor turns and flees.

   The Knight, his resolve steeled in a raised sword, kicks his
   horse into persuit.

   Conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the Knight
   brings his blade down hard into Conor's shoulder, slicing
   open most of the boy's back and knocking him face-first into
   the heather.

   As Conor watches his own blood spew forth, he rolls over in
   time to see the Knight dismount and start for him.

   THE KNIGHT

   Leans down next to Conor, his metal face nearly against the
   boy's.  His voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper.

                                KNIGHT
                          There can be but one.

   A CLANSMAN

   Charges out of the fog and attacks the Knight, who cuts him
   nearly in half.  ANOTHER wanders in and meets the same fate.

   The battle is shifting to where they are.

   Not finished yet with Conor, the Knight is finding himself
   forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail-
   ants.

   A VASSAL

   Sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now-mounted
   Knight.

                                VASSAL #1
                          Leave him!

   The clansmen obey.

   With the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed, the
   Knight disappears into the fog.

   The Vassal surveys the carnage before him.  His eyes fall a
   moment on the moaning, gurgling Conor.

   The Vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead.


9  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                9

   A patrol car pauses at the mouth of the alley.

   The figure considers his situation, then quickly shoves his
   sword into a near-by drain.  He straightens up and waits.

   AN OFFICER

   Steps out of his unit and cautiously walks forward.  His PARTNER
   switches on the patrol car's side lamps, bathing the alley
   in a harsh glare.

   MAN IN ALLEY

   For the first time we can see his face.  RICHARD TAUPIN, clad
   in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor.

   The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively
   for his pistol.  He yells to his partner now coming into the
   alley.

                                OFFICER #1
                          Kevin!  Get is a backup.

                                TAUPIN
                          I was merely walking by
                          when-

                                OFFICER #1
                          Don't move.

   The officer has his pistol out and leveled.
   His partner runs up, shotgun in hand.

                                OFFICER #2
                          They're on their way.

   His voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe.

                                OFFICER #2

                          Christ.


10  INT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              10

    Conor lies moaning on a cot.  Makeshift bandages wrap his
    body, stained and pasted by thick, dried blood.

    The family surrounds their dying son.

    A PRIEST is delivering the last rites.

                                PRIEST
                          ...Libera Domine Animan

                          David de manu regis Saul...

    His sobbing mother holds a compress to Conor's forehead.

                                PRIEST
                          ...In mamus tuas domine

11  EXT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              11

    A Vassal rides up to the hutch, dismounts, and approaches a
    CLANSMAN standing in the open doorway.

                                VASSAL #1
                          Has the boy died?

                                CLANSMAN
                          He is having the last rites
                          now.  It should be over by
                          morning.

                                VASSAL #1
                          Never seen anybody cut as
                          bad live so long.  He should
                          have died on the field.

                                CLANSMAN
                          Tonight or tomorrow, it's
                          all the same.

    The Vassal peers inside at the priest administering the
    sacraments.

                                PRIEST
                          ...Auditorium nostrum in

                                VASSAL #1
                          This has been a dark day.

                                PRIEST
                          ...Requiescant in pace...


12  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                              12

    There is a bustle of activity.  Setting up barricades, uni-
    formed OFFICERS are trying to keep NEW CREWS and curious
    ONLOOKERS at a distance.

    DETECTIVE LT. MORAN

    Lean, fortyish, and comfortable with the gore in front of him,
    is inspecting the corpse with a MEDICAL EXAMINER.

                                EXAMINER
                             (studying body)
                          Real clean.  No sawing
                          action at all.  Whatever
                          it was did it in one
                          swipe.
                           (looks up at Moran)
                          Like the other one.

    Moran gestures to a sword, wrapped in plastic, lying nearby.

                                MORAN
                          What about that?

                                EXAMINER
                          Hasn't any blood on it.

                                MORAN
                             (looking around)
                          About the only thing
                          that doesn't.

                                EXAMINER
                          I'll give it a closer
                          look when I get back.

    BRENNA CARTWRIGHT

    Pretty but not beautiful, thirtyish, she exudes a sort of
    insolent intelligence.

    An OFFICER sees her duck under a police barricade.

                                OFFICER #3
                          Come on Brenna, you know
                          better than that.

                                BRENNA
                          I'm invited.

    She walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his
    equipment.

                                BRENNA
                              (greeting)
                          Mr. Levine...

    The examiner turns and smiles.

                                EXAMINER
                          Hope this isn't past your
                          bedtime.

    Brenna looks to the now-sheeted corpse, blood flowing from
    where the head should be.

                                BRENNA
                          Doesn't have a head,
                          does he?

                                EXAMINER
                          This one came unassembled.

    Lt. Moran is standing near.

                                MORAN
                             (no warmth)
                          Just show her what she came
                          for, Tom.

                                EXAMINER
                        (stands, taps Brenna's arm)
                          Come on, this is more
                          your line of work.

    Brenna and the examiner walk the few yards from the corpse
    to the sword.

                                EXAMINER
                          How's your uncle?  I hardly
                          ever see him anymore.

                                BRENNA
                          Fine.

    The examiner stops and gestures to the weapon clothed in
    forensic plastic.

                                EXAMINER
                          There you go.

    Brenna's expression changes to interest as she kneels down
    beside it.

                                EXAMINER
                          Didn't look like it came from
                          "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I
                          called you.

                                BRENNA
                        (looks up in Moran's direction)
                          Didn't think it was my
                          buddy over there.

                                EXAMINER
                          Figured you knew more about
                          swords than I did.

                                BRENNA
                          Claymore.

                                EXAMINER
                          Huh?

                                BRENNA
                          Scottish claymore.  Take
                          a French epee, add twenty
                          pounds of ballast so it
                          means business, and you've
                          got a claymore.

                                EXAMINER
                          You're the expert.

                                BRENNA
                        (runs hand along hilt, slightly
                               confused)
                          It's in good condition.

    RICHARD TAUPIN

    Is being put in the rear of a patrol car.  Brenna studies his
    face in the half-gloom.  There's something different about him.
    A steadiness.


13  INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM                                  13

    Richard Taupin is seated at a graffitti scrawled table in a
    room otherwise bare of furnishings.  He seems unphased by his
    surroundings.

    The door opens and Moran enters with bag and notebook.  He
    picks up Taupin's wallet on the table top and checks the
    driver's license.

                                MORAN
                          This your present address?

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

                                MORAN
                          Mr.-
                          (looks at license)
                          Taupin, what were you
                          doing in that alley?

                                TAUPIN
                          I was walking by when I
                          heard a shout.  Your men
                          came right after.

                                MORAN
                          Did you know the victim?

                                TAUPIN
                          No.

                                MORAN
                          His name was Iman Fasil
                          if that jogs your memory.

                                TAUPIN
                          It doesn't.

                                MORAN
                          He was carrying a Syrian
                          passport and had been in
                          the country less than a week.

    Taupin's face is stoic and controlled.

                                MORAN
                          Two days ago a Bulgarian
                          national was murdered the
                          same way.  He'd also been
                          in the country less than a
                          week.
                                (beat)
                          What is your citizenship?

                                TAUPIN
                          American.

    Moran paces to a corner of the room.

                                MORAN
                          Do you make a habit of
                          hanging out in that neigh-
                          borhood at night?

                                TAUPIN
                          What are you getting at?

                                MORAN
                          Let's just say that in my
                          years with this department
                          I've seen more than one well
                          dressed business man look for
                          a hand job on 14th Street.

    Moran places both hands on the table and leans across it.

                                MORAN
                          What were _you_ looking for?

                                TAUPIN
                          That's none of your business.

                                MORAN
                          You're wrong.

    Moran reaches into a bag on the table and removes a large
    broad sword; old, but in mint condition.

                                MORAN
                          Do you know what this is?

                                TAUPIN
                          I presume it's a sword.

                                MORAN
                          A claymore to be exact.  You
                          wouldn't know anything about
                          it would you?

                                TAUPIN
                          Your murder weapon?

                                MORAN
                          It was covered with Mr.
                          Fasil's fingerprints, but
                          none of his blood.

                                TAUPIN
                          A mystery.

                                MORAN
                          For the moment.

    Moran turns the sword over in his hand then sets it down.
    He rises and opens the door.

                                MORAN
                          All right Mr. Taupin, we'll be in
                          touch.

    Taupin passes through the doorway without comment.


14  EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT                                     14

    Taupin out into the crisp night air.  His eyes search out the
    darkness.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

15  EXT. CONOR'S FAMILY HUTCH - DAY                                 15

    A medieval sun beats down on an OLD TRAVELER making his way up
    the MacLeod home.  Conor's mother, scrubbing clothes in a
    bucket, smiles in recognition.

                                MOTHER
                          Ah Steven, it is good to see you.

                                TRAVELLER
                          I only just heard of Conor.  I came
                          up from Catroch as soon as I could.

                                MOTHER
                          You're a kind man to be sure.

                                TRAVELLER
                          I thought it only proper to pay
                          me last respects to the family.

                                MOTHER
                          Steven, Conor didn't die.

                                TRAVELLER
                          But I had heard his wounds were
                          mortal.

                                MOTHER
                          They were Steven, they were.  It's
                          been a miracle it has.  He lasted
                          right through and healed.  No one
                          in the village has ever seen anything
                          like it.  Ever.


16  EXT. MEADOW - DAY                                               16

    Perched on a heather-carpeted rise above the village a young
    woman, MARA, sits contemplating the intricaces of a daffodil.

    Balancing on a shepard's staff, Conor limps over and puts
    his lips to her ear.

                                CONOR
                          You're pretty today.

    Mara is silent.  Distant.

                                CONOR
                          I'm your future husband, remember?

                                MARA
                          I have no future husband.

                                CONOR
                          I don't understand.  Not a week
                          ago your father gave us his blessing.

    This is difficult for her.  Tears well in her eyes.

                                MARA
                          My future husband died in battle
                          against the Sutherlands.

                                CONOR
                          What are you saying?  I'm standing
                          here as real as you.

                                MARA
                          You cannot be real, Conor.  You had
                          the last rites.  No man has been cut
                          half as bad and lived.

                                CONOR
                          But I did live.

                                MARA
                          Live?  In less than a week you're
                          prancing about the country like a
                          squirrel.

                                CONOR
                          So why the crazy talk?  It's a
                          miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has
                          smiled on me.  On us.

                                MARA
                          Some think not.

                                CONOR
                          Who?

                                MARA
                          There's rumor in the village.
                          Some call it magic.

                                CONOR
                          That's mad.  Surely you don't
                          take their word?

                                MARA
                          I don't know, Conor.  It's not
                          natural.  Maybe something has
                          touched you.

                                CONOR
                          You're sounding like that mad
                          woman, Widow Baggins.

                                MARA
                          Me father has taken back my
                          hand.

    He puts a hand to her cheek.

                                CONOR
                          Ah, Lassie...

    She steps back.

                                MARA
                          Please not be touching me, Conor.

                                CONOR
                          I'll not take that kind of talk
                          from you.  From those others
                          below, maybe.  But not from you.

                                MARA
                          Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.

                                CONOR
                          You're not talking sense, Mara!

    Anger tumbles into exasperation.

                                CONOR

                          I'm sorry.

    He steps for her.  She moves away.  Conor's face hardens with
    resentment.

                                CONOR
                          If you send me away now, Mara,
                          I'll not come looking for you.

                                MARA
                             (crying)
                          Do what you must.

    Resigned, Conor turns and limps away.

    Taupin is hardly in the mood.


18  INT. TAUPIN'S OFFICE                                            18

    Brenna Cartwright stands in Taupin's cluttered surroundings
    admiring a bagpipe set neatly on a shelf.

                                BRENNA
                          Do you play?

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

                                BRENNA
                          Very traditional.

    Taupin sits down and begins sorting through a stack of papers
    on his desk.

                                TAUPIN
                             (impatient)
                          Miss Cartwright, what is it I can
                          do for you?

                                BRENNA
                          I'd like to ask you about the
                          claymore.

                                TAUPIN
                          It's not mine.

                                BRENNA
                          It's quite rare you know, some-
                          thing so common in its time so
                          well looked after all these years.

                                TAUPIN
                          Miss Cartwright, unless you have
                          come here to sell the sword,
                          there's very little I can help
                          you with.  Now if you will excuse
                          me, I have a great deal of work
                          to do.

    Brenna has taken a carving from the shelf.

                                BRENNA
                          Byzantine?

                          Charming guy, Basil.  Once after
                          beating an army of Serbians he
                          blinded all but-

                          -All but one out of a hundred, I
                          know.  All left to be led like
                          donkeys back home.  Now if you will
                          please-

    Brenna suddenly tosses the carving at him.  Taupin snatches it
    out of the air with lightning precision.

                                BRENNA
                          Good reflexes.

                                TAUPIN
                          Good day, Miss Cartwright.


19  INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM DEPARTMENT OFFICE                       19

    A lonely, ancient room full of equal parts dust and oaken
    study tables.

    The department SUPERVISOR sits at his desk surrounded by a
    handful of his staff RESEARCHERS - Brenna included.  A faded,
    stern portrait of some forgotten curator presides over propped
    up feet, cold coffee, and half eaten sack lunches.

                                BRENNA
                          I don't believe him.

                                SUPERVISOR
                          Why?

                                BRENNA
                          He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I
                          think he's got something to
                          do with it.

                                RESEARCHER #1
                          Oh, has your penetrating research
                          on 9th Century Lithuanian dildos
                          suddenly made you an expert on the
                          criminal mentality?

                                BRENNA
                          Screw off, Larry.

    The men, LAUGH.  They delight in baiting her.
    Researcher #2 opens a Budweiser and pours the beer into a medieval
    mug he's borrowed from the collection.

                                RESEARCHER #2
                          The cops bought it.  They let him
                          go.

                                BRENNA
                          What could they hold him for?  I
                          think they're just waiting for
                          something concrete before they
                          haul him in for real.  We should
                          look into it.  He had to have
                          gotten that sword from somewhere.

                                SUPERVISOR
                          Hang on a sec, you did your little
                          favor for the boys downtown, I'm
                          sure your uncle and the rest are
                          perfectly capable of taking it
                          from here.

                                BRENNA
                          I've seen nobleman swords that
                          weren't as well preserved.  It's
                          just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why
                          would he be carrying it around
                          in an alley?

                                RESEARCHER #1
                          Here we go.  Everytime there's a
                          murder in town we have to put up
                          with junior D.A.

                                RESEARCHER #2
                          Must be genetic.

                                BRENNA
                          Someone should check him out.
                          Maybe a collection somewhere
                          got knocked over.  He has one,
                          he might have two.

                                SUPERVISOR
                          You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see
                          the crap piled up on it?

                                BRENNA
                          Give it a rest Ned, huh?

                                RESEARCHER #2
                          Might be interesting to see what
                          his family connections are.  That's
                          a hell of a piece to be just chuck-
                          ing around in an alley.

                                SUPERVISOR
                                  (sighs)
                          I swear to God Brenna, between you
                          and Thompson's novels I'm going to
                          get a bloody ulcer.

    Researcher #2 lifts the mug of beer to his mouth.

                                                                CUT TO:

    An empty mug is set on the counter of a medieval drinking
    establishment.

    CLANSMEN, their faces and clothes smudged with a day's work in
    the fields, relax and enjoy the company of their fellow VILLAGERS.

    No longer requiring the use of a cane, Conor enters.

                                CONOR
                              (to owner)
                          Evening, Douglas.

                                DOUGLAS
                          Conor.

    The tavern goes silent.  Wary.  The attention is on Conor.

                                CONOR
                          Ale suits me.

    The owner unenthusiastically fills Conor a mug.  Conor takes
    it and walks to where four other VILLAGERS sit.

                                TAVERN MAN #1
                          We rather you not be sitting with
                          us, Conor.

    Conor looks to the next table.

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          We be drinking alone as well.

    The entire tavern spells the same sentiments.

                                CONOR
                          What's wrong with you all?

    Silence.

    Angered, Conor approaches the second man.  As he looms above
    his chair the man in genuine fear pulls out a cross and thrusts
    it forward.

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          Requiem acer'nam donaei-

                                CONOR
                          What are you doing man?

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          -Et lux perpetua-

                                CONOR
                          You'll not be bringing the church
                          into this.

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          -Luceat ei-

    The weird display frightens Conor.

                                CONOR
                          Be quiet.

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          -Auditorium nostrum-

                                CONOR
                          Stop.

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          -In nomine sanctus esperitu-

                                CONOR
                          Stop!

    Conor HURLES his mug against the wall.
    His nerves shattered, he rushes out.


21  INT. MACLEOD HUTCH                                              21

    Conor packs a satchel with his few clothes and belongings.
    He walks to the doorway where his mother and father wait.

    His mother, tears on her cheek, hugs him tightly.

                                MOTHER
                          Please take care of yourself.

                                CONOR
                          Aye.

    Conor turns to his father.

                                FATHER
                          I wish there was some other way.

    They clasp hands.

                                FATHER
                          Goodbye, Conor.

                                CONOR
                          Goodbye.

    Without looking back he passes through the doorway and down the
    empty path, his figure quickly fading in the moorish fog.

    Amongst the dinge of CLANGING phones and CLACKING typewriters,
    a uniformed OFFICER enters something into a computer terminal.
    Brenna sits perched on a desk nearby.

    Taupin steps out of a Metro station and walks the few blocks
    to his brick townhouse.  Climbing the front stairs, he fishes
    his keys out of a coat pocket.  About to insert the key he stops,
    sensing something.

    Backing down the steps, Taupin slips around to the rear of the
    building.

24  INT. TAUPIN HOME                                                24

    Like a spider Taupin pries open a window and slips silently
    inside.

    The home is dark and still.

    Taupin creeps down the hallway and peers into the entryway.
    There a MAN, dressed in a tuxedo jacket and nearly imperceptible
    in the dim light, is crouched at the front door.

    He is holding a sword.

    Taupin removes a knife from his pocket and JUMPS the intruder.
    The two STRUGGLE fiercely.

    Taupin pins the intruder against the carpet and shoves his
    knife firmly against the man's throat.

                                TAUPIN
                          Where is he?

    Bulging eyes stare at him.

                                TAUPIN
                          Where!

                                INTRUDER
                          I don't know.

                                TAUPIN
                          What name is he using?

    Taupin presses the blade.  A trickle of blood rolls down the
    throat.

                                INTRUDER
                          Smith.  Carl Smith.

                                TAUPIN
                          How many came?

                                INTRUDER
                          The last four.

                                TAUPIN
                          And the Bulgarian?

                                INTRUDER
                          He got him.
                             (hoarse chuckle)
                          He always does.  Eventually.

                                TAUPIN
                          He knows I'm here.  How?

                                INTRUDER
                          None of this would be happening
                          if you hadn't run...

    The knife is pressed deeper.

                                TAUPIN
                          _Answer_ me.

                                INTRUDER
                               (gasping)
                          We learned he'd found the immigration
                          notaries in Liverpool and traced them
                          to New York.  Then he figured out the
                          birth records in Church Hill...


25  EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY                                        25

    A city limit sign announcing the small community of Church
    Hill is overtaken by Brenna's sedan.


26  EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY                        26

    Brenna looks through a telephone book.

                                BRENNA
                          Taupin...Taupin...

    Nothing.  She closes the book and drums her fingers on the cover.


27  EXT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE - DAY                                27

    An 1860s stone columned affair, far more impressive than the
    low-lying town that surrounds it.

    Brenna enters.


28  INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE                                      28

    Brenna sits sifting through a large cloth-bound book entitled
    _Certificates of Birth: 1941-1948_.

                                BRENNA
                              (reading)
                          Tarmin...Tatum...Taupin, Richard
                          Marshall.  Born to William and
                          Karen Taupin, no address.  Attend-
                          ing physician, Dr. Willis Kidell.

29  INT. DR. KIDELL'S HOME                                          29

    Dr. Kidell stands at his bookcase leafing through a binder.

                                KIDELL
                          1945, that strains the memory.
                               (after a fashion)
                          Here we are, Richard Taupin.

    He carries the binder to the table where Brenna sits.

                                KIDELL
                          Would you like more tea?

                                BRENNA
                          No thank you, I'm fine.

    Kidell sips his own and looks over the binder page.

                                KIDELL
                          He was unsual.

                                BRENNA
                          Why?

                                KIDELL
                          Well, this is a small town, and
                          it was even smaller then.  Most
                          all the babies I delivered were
                          from local families.  Richard's
                          parents were just passing through
                          when his mother's time came.  I
                          did it right here at the house.

                                BRENNA
                          Then you didn't know Richard
                          later on.

                                KIDELL
                          No.

                                BRENNA
                          I've been trying to find somebody
                          who knew him and any connections
                          his family might have had with
                          museums or historical societies.

                                KIDELL
                          Don't know about any of that.
                          Suppose nobody does.

                                BRENNA
                          I don't follow you.

                                KIDELL
                          Poor little tyke didn't have a
                          chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He
                          died a few days after he was born.

                                BRENNA
                          The boy _died_?

                                KIDELL
                          Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The
                          young lady just couldn't make it
                          through labor.  Never even saw her
                          son.

    Dr. Kidell removes from the binder a tattered newspaper clipping.

                                KIDELL
                          My brother worked for the town
                          paper at the time.  He took this
                          picture of the funeral.

    Something in the clipping sparks Brenna's interest.

                                BRENNA
                          Have you spoken to anyone else
                          about this?

                                KIDELL
                          There was this one fella.  Asked
                          a lot of questions.  I was out
                          of town but I heard he spent near
                          a full day in the records office.

                                BRENNA
                          Would you remember his name?

                                KIDELL
                               (thinks)
                          Carl Smith.


30  INT. POLICE STATION                                             30

    A police line-up.

    Seven MEN, all dressed in Santa Claus outfits with bare legs,
    are paraded for a small, old LADY.

                                OFFICER
                          Just tell us when you see the one.

    Several rows back in the dark sits Brenna's UNCLE JOE, the
    district attorney, and another man, his ASSISTANT.

                                UNCLE JOE
                          Forget it.

                                BRENNA
                          I'm just curious.

                                UNCLE JOE
                          You're never "just curious".
                               (to assistant)
                          You've met my neice, Brenna.

                                ASSISTANT
                          Hi Brenna.

                                OFFICER
                              (to line-up)
                          Number 5, lift your coat up more.

                                UNCLE JOE
                          Aren't you getting a little old for
                          this?  You flunked out of law school.

                                BRENNA
                             (rolls her eyes)
                          Now there's a new topic.

                                UNCLE JOE
                          Don't they have enough for you to
                          do at the castle?

    Brenna puts on her best little-girl angelic smile, a smile her
    uncle can never refuse.

                                UNCLE JOE
                                  (sighs)
                          Forgers do it all the time.  They
                          take the birth certificate of some-
                          one who died young and use it to
                          get legit I.D.  Usually they carry
                          it long enough to pass some bad
                          checks then dump it.

                                BRENNA
                          Thanks.

                                UNCLE JOE
                          Call your mother.  You never call her.

                                OFFICER
                              (to old lady)
                          Well?

                                OLD LADY
                          I don't know.  I'd have to see his
                          thing.


31  INT. BRENNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   31

    A swath of moonlight shines in across a carafe-turned-vase,
    a New England college diploma, and a police uniform hanging
    from the bedpost where Brenna lies with another man, DENNIS.

                                BRENNA
                          I can't figure out why he's doing it.
                          He's been Richard Taupin at least
                          since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You
                          should see the stuff he has in that shop.

                                DENNIS
                          Maybe he's hiding from something.

                                BRENNA
                          Some guy named Smith was asking
                          about him in Church Hill.  I passed
                          his name around with your buddies
                          downtown but they drew a blank.  So
                          he isn't a cop.  District anyway.

    Dennis gets out of bed and begins putting on his uniform.

                                DENNIS
                          Probably just some exec ducking
                          an ex-wife.

                                BRENNA
                          Dr. Kidell had a picture in his
                          file of the funeral.  The father
                          looked just like Richard.  Even had
                          a mark on his cheek.

                                DENNIS
                          How old is Richard?

                                BRENNA
                          P.D. says 41, but he barely looks
                          30.

                                DENNIS
                          Find the father.  That should clear
                          things up.

    He buttons his shirt.  Something occurs to him.

                                DENNIS
                          Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran
                          picked up the other night?

                                BRENNA
                          Yeah.

                                DENNIS
                          He'd want to know about all this.

                                BRENNA
                          Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his
                          own clues.  There's a journal article
                          in this somewhere.

                                DENNIS
                              (shakes head)
                          Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't
                          get the taste out of her mouth.

    Dennis puts on his police cap.

                                DENNIS
                          Well, the cream of society awaits.
                              (cocks hat to one side)
                          If you're ever in the neighborhood...

                                BRENNA
                          Sure.


32  EXT. RIVER EMBANKMENT - NIGHT                                   32

    POLICE OFFICERS, their flashlights cutting the darkness, search
    the mud shores of a Potomac tidal basin.  The glowing Jefferson
    Memorial can be seen in the distance.

    DETECTIVE MORAN

    Is supervising.  An OFFICER climbs up the embankment to him.

                                OFFICER
                          They found it.

    The officer leads him down to the river where a headless BODY
    wearing a tuxedo jacket is being put into a plastic bag.

                                OFFICER
                          It was about fifty yards down-
                          stream from the head.

    Moran looks down at the body bag, its dark plastic reflecting
    the rythmic rotation of squad car beacons.

                                OFFICER
                          Both were cut real clean.  Like the
                          other ones...


33  EXT. EQUESTRIAN RIDING GROUNDS - DAY                            33

    A steeple-chase course lies shrouded in an Arlington fog.

    Across the damp grass a lone horse, heaving clouds of warm
    breath, leaps gracefully over a hurdle.  Driving the steed
    hard through the course, Taupin pulls firm on the reins,
    bringing horse and rider to a shuddering stop where Detective
    Moran waits.

                                MORAN
                          There's been another murder.

    Taupin lifts his eyes to the suburban treeline.

                                TAUPIN
                          My condolences.

                                MORAN
                          Where were you Tuesday night?

                                TAUPIN
                          Home.

                                MORAN
                          A neighbor saw your car leave.

                                TAUPIN
                          He's mistaken.

    Taupin climbs down from his horse.  Moran moves close.

                                MORAN
                          Look, I don't know what the hell
                          you're up to, but I think I've got
                          a pretty good idea.

                                TAUPIN
                          Do you?

                                MORAN
                          All I need is time.

                                TAUPIN
                          I've got all the time in the world.
                             (looks at watch)
                          Except right now.  If you will excuse
                          me, Lieutenant.

    In no hurry, Taupin leads his horse away.


34  INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH DEPARTMENT                                 34

    Brenna sits surrounded by books of old English law, colorful
    family banner plates, and a medieval caltrap sitting on her
    desk corner.

    Boring quickly, she shuts the book and sighs.  From another
    folder she pulls out a computer sheet.

    INSERT COMPUTER SHEET

    The police sheet has Taupin's name and motor vehicle record.
    Below are listed four WILLIAM TAUPINS, their hometowns and
    driving records.  Richard Taupin's first driver permit was in
    1967.

    Brenna looks down the list to a WILLIAM TAUPIN of Felton,
    Delaware, who stopped filling for driver permits in 1967, the
    year Richard started.


35  EXT. GAS STATION - DAY                                          35

    Dropping a couple of quarters into a vending machine, Brenna
    removes and opens up a map of the State of Delaware.


36  EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY                                            36

    Brenna steps out of her car at a small town cemetary.

    Holding a slip of paper, she weaves her way through the shade
    covered tombs of revolutionary heroes and their descendants.

    On a small rise fresh dirt lies in careless piles around an
    open grave.

    Richard Taupin stands at the mouth of the pit.

    A coffin has been brutally pulled from the dirt and lies open
    and propped diagonally beside a marker that reads: "WILLIAM
    MICHAEL TAUPIN".

    The casket is empty.

                                BRENNA
                          Someone beat you.

                                TAUPIN
                          Have you taken to touring small
                          town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?

                                BRENNA
                          Grave robbers?

                                TAUPIN
                          Probably.

                                BRENNA
                          Who?

                                TAUPIN
                          People like that rarely leave
                          business cards.

                                BRENNA
                          Does Carl Smith?

    A flash of interest, quickly suppressed.

                                TAUPIN
                          I don't know what you're talking
                          about.

                                BRENNA
                          I think you do.  Better yet, I don't
                          think anything was stolen because
                          nothing was there in the first place.
                          And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is,
                          now knows that.

                                TAUPIN
                          You have an active imagination.

                                BRENNA
                          I've been to Church Hill.

                                TAUPIN
                          Miss Cartwright, you are
                          involving yourself in
                          matters that do not concern
                          you.  I strongly suggest you
                          return to Washington and stay
                          out of small town cemetaries.

    He starts for the gate.

                                BRENNA
                          I could find him.

    Taupin stops.

                                BRENNA
                          I have friends.

                                TAUPIN
                          I doubt that.
                                 (beat)
                          Good day, Miss Cartwright.

    He walks on.

    After only a few paces Taupin suddenly shudders to an abrupt
    stop.

                                BRENNA
                          What's wrong?

    He holds up an open palm to silence her.

                                TAUPIN
                          Your help may be unneccessary.

    The air is still.

    Taupin's face is expressionless.  He listens intently.  Sensing.

    An unseen voice rides seemingly on the wind.

                                VOICE
                                (o.s.)
                          Good afternoon, "Mr. Taupin".

    Taupin whirls around to see a large man standing with broad
    sword in hand.  We have never seen the knight out of his armor
    before, but this man certainly seems to fit the bill.  Wearing
    Levis and leather jacket in contrast to Taupin's expensive
    business suit, he speaks with icy evenness from a face of stone.

    Taupin, naked without his own sword, is trapped against a
    marble wall.

                                KNIGHT
                          Long time.

                                TAUPIN
                          Not so long.

    The Knight is closing in on him, sword gripped in both hands.

                                TAUPIN
                          You've been here from the
                          start.

                                KNIGHT
                          My quarry grows clever with
                          age.  And the others, incompetent.

    The Knight throws Brenna a glance.

                                KNIGHT
                          Friend of yours?

                                TAUPIN
                          Of sorts.

                                KNIGHT
                          I do hope she enjoys a good
                          show.


    The Knight leans his whole body into a two-fisted swing,
    clanging out a chunk of marble as Taupin ducks.

    A second swipe also imbeds itself in stone.

                                KNIGHT
                          So now it ends.

    A thrust cuts only air.

                                KNIGHT
                          Generation upon generation.
                          Tens of thousands of miles.

    Taupin leaps behind a tree.  The Knight cuts it nearly in half.

                                KNIGHT
                          You're the last, MacLeod.
                          Romirez, Lacroux, Neuvich,
                          those fools that followed
                          me, their heads all line my
                          shelf.  All but yours.

    Taupin drops to the ground in a shoulder roll to avoid a swipe.

                                KNIGHT
                          Can you feel it, MacLeod?
                          Can you _feel_ it!

    Taupin grabs a tree branch and raps the Knight on the knee,
    knocking him over.

    The Knight quickly rights himself and cuts the branch from
    Taupin.

                                KNIGHT
                          There can be but one.

    He raises his blade.

    An elderly WATCHMAN, shotgun cradled in his arms, stands in
    the clearing.

                                WATCHMAN
                          Hey!  What's going on here?

    The Knight pauses a split second then with decision launches
    his sword spear-style firmly into the watchman's chest.

    Taupin pushes past him to Brenna.

                                TAUPIN
                          Run!

    Brenna is frozen in shock.
    Taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate.

                                TAUPIN
                          Run!

                                KNIGHT
                          MACLEOD!

    The Knight retrieves his sword from the watchman's body and
    lumbers after them.

    Taupin and Brenna bolt from the cemetary and into the surround-
    ing residential area.


37  EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY                                   37

    Taupin leads an exhausted Brenna in a gallop down the side-
    walk.

    They have apparently lost the Knight.  Taupin pauses at a
    corner.  He sees a church across the street.


38  INT. CHURCH                                                     38

    Brenna enters and collapses into a pew, her labored breathing
    echoing off the high ceiling.

    Taupin walks the length of an aisle to see that they are alone.
    Satisfied, he leans against a banister and considers his sit-
    uation.

    Trying to recover her wind, Brenna has her eyes closed and
    head against the back of the pew.

                                BRENNA
                          Jesus Christ.

                                TAUPIN
                          You'll be safe here.  He won't
                          kill in a church.

                                BRENNA
                          Why not?

                                TAUPIN
                              (distracted)
                          Tradition.

                                BRENNA
                          What the hell is going on?

    Taupin stares out the window, stained glass shining orange on
    his face.  He looks at Brenna briefly, then passes through the
    Church's doorway without a word.


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


39  INT. MEDIEVAL BLACKSMITH SHOP                                   39

    A glowing horseshoe HISSES wildly as it slips into a wooden
    cooling bucket.  Pulling it out with iron tongs, Conor lays
    it on a counter and pounds it even with a mallet.

    Sweaty and streaked with dirt, he tosses the mallet aside
    and walks out into the late afternoon sunshine.


40  EXT. SHOP FRONTAGE - DAY                                        40

    Conor leans over a water barrel and dunks his head and arms,
    cleaning off a day's worth of sweat and grime.

    JUAN ROMIREZ

    Stirring up dust with his travelling boots, this Spanish acc-
    ented man stops at Conor's shop.  He wears a large broad sword
    strapped to his waist.

                                CONOR
                          Afternoon.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Your name is Conor?

                                CONOR
                          Aye.

                                ROMIREZ
                             (bows slightly)
                          Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief
                          surveyor and alchemist.

                                CONOR
                             (notices accent)
                          You're not from these
                          parts.

                                ROMIREZ
                          I am from Spain.  And I
                          would like a moment of
                          your time.


41  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               41

    Romirez is seated at a table.  His back to the Spaniard,
    Conor is preparing some food.

                                CONOR
                          I haven't much to offer,
                          Mr. Romirez from Spain,
                          but you're welcome to what's
                          here.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Please go to no trouble.

    Romirez is looking at the faint, pale hint of a scar that
    runs from Conor's shoulder blade to his waist.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Your back, it would seem
                          perhaps you were injured
                          in battle?

                                CONOR
                          Five years past me clan
                          fought another over some-
                          thing I cannot even re-
                          member.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Your marks would suggest
                          great injury.

                                CONOR
                          I was nearly killed.

                                ROMIREZ
                          But you lived.

    Conor looks up from his work in pained memory.

                                CONOR
                          I did at that.

                                ROMIREZ
                          And but for a mark you are
                          well as any man, no?

                                CONOR
                          Aye.

                                ROMIREZ
                          I should imagine that your
                          recovery must have alarmed
                          your fellow villagers, perhaps
                          giving them reason to invent
                          an explanation.  And a solution.

    Something isn't right.
    Conor turns and faces him.

                                CONOR
                          I was driven out.

                                ROMIREZ
                          And now you live in a small
                          village miles away from all
                          you knew.

                                CONOR
                          How can you know this?

                                ROMIREZ
                             (tone lightens)
                          First food, no?  A good meal
                          makes conversation so much
                          easier.

    Stunned with the implications of what Romirez has said, like
    a robot Conor serves the meal.  His eyes never leave Romirez,
    who digs hungrily into the food.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Hmm, que rico.  What is it you
                          call this?

                                CONOR
                          Pheasant.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You Scots have a way with
                          game.  It still has life in it.
                          Spirit.  Back home the food
                          is so...domestic.

                                CONOR
                          Why are you here?

                                ROMIREZ
                          I was sent by his majesty of
                          Spain to Inverness as a con-
                          sultant on matters of metal.

                                CONOR
                          You're a long way from Inverness.

                                ROMIREZ
                          In my travels I heard the story of
                          the MacLeod boy struck down and
                          brought from the hand of
                          death by powers not of this Earth.

                                CONOR
                          You know me home.  Me name.

                                ROMIREZ
                          It was time for our paths to cross.

    Romirez pulls back the sleeve on his cloak.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You see this?

    He traces some discoloration on his arm.

                                ROMIREZ
                          When I was a boy a cart driven
                          by a drunken fool crushed me.  All
                          thought I would die or be maimed
                          for life.  But I healed quickly.
                          And like you I paid the price
                          for being different.

                                CONOR
                          You are the same?

                                ROMIREZ
                          Do you ever feel a flow, as if some-
                          thing were pushing against you?

                                CONOR
                          Yes.  Always.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Does it change with me in the room?

                                CONOR
                          It is less.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You feel you know me.

                                CONOR
                          I don't know why.

                                ROMIREZ
                          We are brothers.


42  EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

    Romirez and Conor walk alone amongst torch-lit hutches.

                                CONOR
                          He told me there could be only
                          one.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Some cling to sanity through time
                          with the one continuity and trad0
                          ition their lives have known: The
                          Game.
                               (Conor confused)
                          You and I Conor, we are different
                          from all others around us.  You
                          know this, you can feel it.  We are
                          flesh and bone like any man, but
                          unlike our neighbors we are rather
                          difficult to injure,
                               (looks away)
                          permanently.

                                CONOR
                          I don't understand.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You are still so very young.

                                CONOR
                          I'm twenty-two.

                                ROMIREZ
                              (shakes head)
                          Not even a single lifetime.

    Romirez chooses his words very carefully.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Conor, you and I, we cannot be
                          killed.

                                CONOR
                          What?

                                ROMIREZ
                          We are immortal.

    Stunned, Conor backs away from Romirez.

                                CONOR
                          No, that can't be.

    Romirez grasps Conor's shoulder.

                                ROMIREZ
                          It is as you are.

                                CONOR
                             (pushes away)
                          No!

    This is all too much for Conor.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Listen to me.  Hear the words.

                                CONOR
                          This is madness!

                                ROMIREZ
                          It is the truth.

                                CONOR
                          No!

    Romirez suddenly draws his sword and thrusts it into Conor's
    heart.  The boy's mouth drops open in shocked terror as his
    eyes roll up into his head.

    A shudder, then Conor slides off the blade and crashes to the
    ground.

    Brenna stops her car in front of the Washington Police Depart-

    After a moment of indecision she changes her mind and returns

    Brenna lowers herself wearily into a chair, rubs her eyes,
    and stares absently out the window.

    Reaching across to an end table, she plays back her answering

     This HISS of Brenna's answering machine becomes the HISS of
     cooking.  Bandaged about the chest, Conor asleep on his
     cot.

     Suddenly he sits up.  Sweating.  He looks about the room in
     confusion as Romirez enters with a plate of food.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Three days you've laid there.

                          hell for all eternity.

                          What is to become of me?  Am I to

                          live, The Knight can never have
                          it all.

                                CONOR
                          But we cannot be killed.

                                ROMIREZ
                          There is an imperfection.  For all
                          your healing, if your head ever
                          leaves your neck, you are dead.
                          You can survive anything but steel
                          against your threat.  Then it is
                          over.  The end.

                                CONOR
                          How can I stop such a man?

                                ROMIREZ
                          Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth
                          till you learn.  You must learn to
                          defend yourself.  In this I can help.

                                CONOR
                          Why?

                                ROMIREZ
                          We are brothers.  And you are a
                          defense-
                                 (beat)
                          -of sorts.


47  EXT. PENNSYLVANIA FARMHOUSE - DAY                               47

    An old man, MR. NORTH, leads Taupin up the drive of a rural
    farmhouse somewhere in the hinterland of Pennsylvania.

                                MR. NORTH
                          When your father died I saw to
                          it that the grounds were kept up.

                                TAUPIN
                          The money in the estate was
                          enough to cover your costs?

                                MR. NORTH
                          Oh yes, more than enough.


48  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                  48

    Furniture clad in white sheets.  Dust everywhere.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Most of the furniture was put
                          into protective storage.  I'll
                          have some boys come up and clean
                          the place out for you.

    Taupin drags a finger across a dusty window pane.

                                MR. NORTH
                               (fascinated)
                          You're one of William's kids,
                          huh?

                                TAUPIN
                          His only kid.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Sure take after him.  Never seen
                          a father and son look more alike.

                                TAUPIN
                          We were very close.

                                MR. NORTH
                          The resemblance is amazing.

                                TAUPIN
                          When may I expect the cleaners?

                                MR. NORTH
                          I'll send them right up.


49  INT. "O'REILY'S" - NIGHT                                        49

    Coupled strangers gyrate under colored lights and recorded music.

    Brenna sits alone.  Whatever nervousness she brought through the
    door with her has been turned into a comfortable cynicism by
    the three empty glasses in front of her.

    A MAN

    With something less than perfect coordination, sits down beside
    her.

                                MAN
                          That stuff'll put you away if
                          you're not careful.

                                BRENNA
                          There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He
                          would invite the local peasants to
                          his chateau, fill them full of wine,
                          then slice their bellies so he
                          could reuse it.
                                (smiles)
                          The symmetry of that somehow always
                          appealed to me.

                                MAN
                          You're very macabre.

                                BRENNA
                          It's my birthday.

                                MAN
                          Happy birthday.

                                BRENNA
                          Thanks.

    Brenna drains her glass and sets it down with a sigh.

                                BRENNA
                          Buy a birthday girl a drink?


50  INT. PUB - NIGHT                                                50

    A small neighborhood tavern.  Regulars chat amicably with the
    BARTENDER-OWNER.

    TAUPIN

    Sits alone at a corner table.  A WAITRESS hovers over him.

                                TAUPIN
                          Lager and lime.

    LATER

    Taupin's lager is drained.  Lost in thought, he drags a finger
    around and around the lip of the mug.

    He hand stops.  It twitches.  Shakes.

    Taupin pulls his hand from the glass and watches it shake slightly
    out of control.  A warning.

    He WHIRLS around suddenly to see LING KAHN, Asian, standing
    over him.

                                KAHN
                          MacLeod.

    Taupin is anxious, poised for attack.

    Kahn breaks into a broad smile.

                                KAHN
                          Spare a chair?

                                TAUPIN
                          Kahn?

                                KAHN
                          Are you going to offer me a chair
                          or leave me standing here all night?

                                TAUPIN
                          Sit.

    Kahn takes his place across the table.

                                TAUPIN
                               (unsure)
                          How are you?

                                KAHN
                          Head still secure to the neck.

                                TAUPIN
                          How did you find me?

                                KAHN
                          How many places this side of the
                          Atlantic serve lager and lime?

    Taupin looks to his own glass.

                                KAHN
                          Old habits die hard.
                              (to waitress)
                          Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!
                                 (beat)
                          Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the
                          closest thing they stock to my side
                          of the fence.

                                TAUPIN
                          What are you doing here?

                                KAHN
                          It is the gathering, my friend.  The
                          settling of old scores.

    Taupin tenses.

                                TAUPIN
                          And have you something to settle
                          with me?

                                KAHN
                               (smiles)
                          Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink
                          with an old friend.

                                TAUPIN
                          It's good to see you, Kahn.

    The waitress sets down two glasses.

                                KAHN
                          Come, toast with me the past.
                              (raises glass)
                          To old conquests, old loves, and to a
                          time when we cared about either.

    Kahn drains his glass.

                                KAHN
                          Waitress!


51  EXT. THE WASHINGTON MALL - NIGHT                                51

    Kahn and Taupin sit drunkedly on the marble steps of a closed
    government building.

                                KAHN
                          I'll never forget the look on that
                          Papal commander's face when his
                          "heretic stronghold" turned out to
                          be a rock full of whores climbing
                          all over Neuvich.

                                TAUPIN
                          Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.

                                KAHN
                          But then rides up Pope Pius who
                          calmly brushes the dust from his
                          papal cross, climbs off his papal
                          horse, draws his papal sword and
                          asks just what the hell is going
                          on.  And what did Neuvich, dear
                          dear drunken Neuvich do?

                                TAUPIN
                          Offered the Pope one of his whores.

    They LAUGH.

    A JOGGER stops on the gravel and listens to the strange conversation.

                                TAUPIN
                          Had a great swing with his blade.
                          For a Pope.

                                KAHN
                                (sighs)
                          Good times then.  A man could
                          stretch his legs without bring-
                          ing half the world down around
                          his ears.  Not like now.

    The jogger shakes his head and runs on.

                                TAUPIN
                               (serious)
                          He found us even there.

                                KAHN
                          He always did.


52  EXT. ZOO - NIGHT                                                52

    A CLINKING of chain link as Taupin and Kahn climb a fence and
    tumble into the Washington Zoo.

                                TAUPIN
                          I haven't drunk this much since-

                                KAHN
                          -Since you last saw me.

    Kahn chucks an empty wine bottle.  An unspecified animal GROWLS
    sleepily somewhere in the darkness.

                                KAHN
                          Come on.

53  EXT. DISPLAY AREA - NIGHT                                       53

    Taupin and Kahn stumble through an open-air display of Asian
    animals.  Their VOICES seem to echo everywhere.

                                KAHN
                          I love zoos.  Ever since I was
                          a kid.

                                TAUPIN
                          You were never a kid.

    Kahn leans on the wall of a water buffalo pen.

                                KAHN
                             (points at one)
                          I knew his great-grandfather.

                                TAUPIN
                          You're insane.

                                KAHN
                          No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool
                          together in Rangoon.

                                TAUPIN
                          How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you
                          live so full of life for so long?

                                KAHN
                          Tasting and enjoying life is the
                          only thing of value we have.  All
                          else is just marking time.
                               (beat)
                          You're marking time.

                                TAUPIN
                          I've had a few more concerns.

    Kahn jams his hands into his overcoat and starts down the footpath.

                                KAHN
                          The pressure only comes when you
                          let the taste slip into your mouth.

                                TAUPIN
                          You're wrong.

                                KAHN
                          You don't run as hard, MacLeod.
                          You just don't run as hard anymore.


54  INT. O'REILY'S - NIGHT                                          54

    Late.  The bar is nearly empty.

    No sign of the Knight.  Brenna looks at her watch, sighs, and
    drops a bill onto the counter.


55  EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                             55

    Brenna has left the bar and is now walking down a dimly lit
    street.

    She hears something and turns.

    -Nothing.  A breeze rustles the trees above.

    After only a few more paces she hears something again.
    Brenna abruptly turns.

    -Right into the face of THE KNIGHT.

    Brenna SCREAMS.  The Knight reaches into his leather carrying bag.

    A GROUP OF NOISY TEENAGERS

    Exit a facing townhouse.  The Knight removes his hand from the
    bag as they spill onto the sidewalk LAUGHING and YELLING.

    Brenna moves close to the group as they walk to the corner.
    The Knight follows at a measured distance.

    At the corner the teenagers climb into a pickup and drive off.
    Brenna bolts into the intersection.  Weaving through SCREECHING
    brakes, she disappears into a pair of lighted glass doors.


56  INT. BUILDING                                                   56

    40 well dressed PATRONS, numbered cards pinned to their lapels,
    sit in velvetly plush surroundings.  At the front of the room
    stands a thin moustached art AUCTIONEER.

    Brenna BUSTLES in from outside.

                                AUCTIONEER
                          I apoligize for the lateness of the
                          hour, but I'm sure you will all agree
                          the quality of this year's collection
                          is well worth the time.

    The Knight BURSTS in with his leather carrying bag.  Brenna
    slides along the draped back wall to avoid him.

                                AUCTIONEER
                             (holding statuette)
                          For this fine example of medieval
                          religious art, let us open the bid
                          at 4,000 dollars.

    The Knight closes in on Brenna casually, without hurry.

                                AUCTIONEER
                          10,500 once, 10,500 twice...

    Brenna raises her arm to attract the attention of a SECURITY
    GUARD..

                                AUCTIONEER
                             (points at Brenna)
                          11,000.  A bid at 11,000.

                                BRENNA
                          No, I-

    The guard notices she has no lapel number and starts for her
    very officially.

    Being closed in on from both sides, Brenna suddenly runs across
    the room to a fire exit, setting off an ALARM as she flies open
    the door.

    The Knight leaps after her, knocking over an OLD WOMAN in the
    front row.


57  EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT                                           57

    Brenna runs the sidewalk and disappears into a Metro station.


58  INT. METRO STATION                                              58

    Brenna runs down the platform and jumps into a subway car
    just as the doors shut.

    THE KNIGHT

    is also now on the platform but can only watch Brenna through
    a window as the train pulls away.


59  EXT. TAUPIN'S TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                   59

    Brenna KNOCKS at the front door.  No answer.

    She KNOCKS harder.  The unlatched door pushes open.


60  INT. TOWNHOUSE                                                  60

    Brenna stands in the doorway.

    Before her is a disaster.  Furniture has been smashed like
    matchsticks.  A desk drawer's contents lie strewn in piles on
    the floor.

    Brenna enters slowly.

                                BRENNA
                          Mr. Taupin?  I have to talk to
                          you.

    Nothing has been left unturned or unbroken.

    Brenna kneels and sifts through a pile of crumpled papers.
    She comes across an old black and white photograph.  Badly
    streaked and faded, it shows Taupin standing beside a farm-
    house.  Written in the corner is "Worstick, 1928".

    Brenna slips the photo into her pocket.  Standing, she turns
    smack into Taupin.

                                TAUPIN
                          Finished?

    He looks past her to the destruction of his living room.  It
    doesn't seem to surprise him.

                                BRENNA
                          He tried to kill me last night.

                                TAUPIN
                          Where?

                                BRENNA
                          Dupont Circle.

    Taupin sifts through the debris, selecting articles from it.

                                BRENNA
                          Who is he?

                                TAUPIN
                          At the moment?  Carl Smith.

                                BRENNA
                          And you?

    He ignores the question.

                                BRENNA
                          What will you do now?

                                TAUPIN
                          You needn't worry Miss Cartwright.
                          I've been at this a very long time.

                                BRENNA
                          He called you "MacLeod".

                                TAUPIN
                          Not your concern.

                                BRENNA
                          I left a man dead in
                          Felton.  But you don't
                          really care, do you?

                                TAUPIN
                          That bothers you?

                                BRENNA
                          He was innocent.

                                TAUPIN
                          He's dead.  Whatever I may
                          or may not feel means
                          exceedingly little to him
                          now.

                                BRENNA
                          What about me?

                                TAUPIN
                          You?

                                BRENNA
                          I'm a witness to a murder.  That
                          seems to put me pretty high
                          on your friend's chop list.

                                TAUPIN
                          Have you gone to the
                          police?

                                BRENNA
                          No.

                                TAUPIN
                          Why not?  I'm sure they'd
                          love to hear your story.

                                BRENNA
                          I'd rather hear yours.

                                TAUPIN
                                (beat)
                          You are being foolish.

                                BRENNA
                          I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin.
                          Only once in a lifetime do you
                          stare history in the face.

                                TAUPIN
                          Go home.

    He walks to the doorway.

                                BRENNA
                          Why does he want to kill you?

    Taupin stops, his back to her.

                                TAUPIN
                          He sees me as a threat.

                                BRENNA
                          Are you?

    Taupin walks out the door.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


61  EXT. GRASSY KNOLL - DAY                                         61

    On a clear rise above the village Romirez and Conor spar with
    swords covered in heavy cloth.  Conor is having difficulty.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Concentrate!

    Conor thrusts.  Romirez blocks.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Harder.  Concentrate harder.

                                CONOR
                          Me arm hurts.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Again.  Try again.

    Conor strikes.  Romirez easily blocks.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Harder!  You swing like an impotent
                          cow!

                                CONOR
                          Go to hell.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Oh, the boy has a mouth,
                          now if only he had an arm.

    Ticked off, Conor leans himself into a two-fisted swing.
    Romirez knocks it aside, but Conor recovers faster than he,
    knocking Romirez flat on his back.

                                CONOR
                          Impotent cow.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Muy Bien!

    Conor drops the sword and wipes the sweat from his face.

    Romirez pours wine from a leather bag into a goblet pulled
    from his belt.  He offers it to Conor.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Here my boy, from vineyards
                          as sweet and smooth as a young
                          girl's thigh.

    Conor accepts the cup.  Romirez pulls himself to his feet.

                                ROMIREZ
                          It will take less effort
                          as you learn.

                                CONOR
                          It's like to kill me first.

    Romirez puts his arm around Conor and refills his cup.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You have a gift.  One you
                          must protect.

                                CONOR
                          And what is this great
                          gift that cannot be seen
                          or smelt?

                                ROMIREZ
                          The Fabric of life.  The spark
                          that allows the passing of
                          existence from one generation
                          to another.

                                CONOR
                              (shakes head)
                          If that was meant to be an ex-
                          planation Mr. Romirez from Spain,
                          I'm afraid you've failed.

    Romirez put his arm around Conor and leads him away.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Come.  Enough sword play for an
                          afternoon.


62  EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                          62

    A friendly horse race.  Their reflections bouncing off a clear
    glen, Conor and Romirez dodge moss-laiden ruts and leap fallen
    tree trunks.

    Beaming, Conor pushes through a last turn and stops to wait
    for Romirez, several lengths behind.

                                CONOR
                           (as Romirez rides up)
                          You're no match for Scot, Mr.
                          Romirez.  We're raised as riders.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.

    Both their eyes turn to the beauty in view.  Romirez pulls a
    leaf from a tree and studies it closely.

                                CONOR
                          What is the fascinatioon?  It is only
                          a leaf.

                                ROMIREZ
                          All living things pay dues,
                          Conor.  They must be respected
                          for that.

    He pulls the leaf's points from the stalk, one by one.

                                ROMIREZ
                          As they age they contribute to a
                          sum that is the kindling from which
                          all future life comes.  To feel it,
                          to know it, is to be in touch with
                          the will of every living thing.

                                CONOR
                          I do not think I like the sound
                          of that.

                                ROMIREZ
                          It does not feel nearly as frightening
                          as it sounds.  But the consequences of
                          such feelings can be very frightening.
                          For it gives you great strength.  The
                          strength of _knowledge_.  The ability
                          to stand between the giving of what
                          has always been to what will always
                          be.

                                CONOR
                          I feel hardly nothing.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You have not been fully trained.
                          But you will learn.  And you will be
                          good, I can feel that.  You have apt-
                          itude.  This is why our friend is
                          so concerned.

                                CONOR
                          But why be so concerned about me?

                                ROMIREZ
                          This power is divided amongst you,
                          me, and others like cuts in a pie.
                          But the cuts are not equal.  Some,
                          like you and he, have more.  Much
                          more.

                                CONOR
                          And you?

                                ROMIREZ
                          I am a small player.  But if by
                          helping you I can keep that monster
                          from being the last, then perhaps
                          my life has meant something.

                                CONOR
                          I am not ready for this.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You must be.  You have responsibilities.
                          You must learn the rules.  You can never
                          attract attention to yourself, never
                          show the side that will draw others to
                          you.  You will always know when you are
                          in the presence of another.  Beware.
                          But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will
                          be your battle against time.  In the
                          coming years you will see kingdoms rise
                          then rot like wheat.  People will
                          become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The
                          only constant you will know will be
                          the others and the tradition their
                          greed and quest represent.  But life
                          without morality, without the ability
                          to truly taste the sweetness of wine
                          and love, is no life at all.  That is
                          how the others exist.  Nothing more
                          than walking corpses living only to
                          slaughter each other in an insane quest
                          to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed
                          to the earth.  Do not become one of them.

                                CONOR
                          Of course.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You are young, inexperienced.  You
                          do not know what time can do.  How
                          it can sap all pity, all love.

                                CONOR
                          That is not me.

                                ROMIREZ
                          With the proper tools, Conor, a
                          naive man can be much more dangerous
                          than an evil one.

                                VILLAGER
                          Conor!

    A VILLAGER approaches from across the pasture.

                                CONOR
                          Yes, Darin.

                                VILLAGER
                          Hate to be bothering you like this,
                          but me mare threw a shoe.

    Conor looks to Romirez.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Go ahead, Senor.
                              (gestures to wine)
                          I have my friend to keep me company.

                                CONOR
                          I'll be back when I can.

    Conor sets off across the pasture.


64  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               64

    Romirez enters and flops onto a cot.
    Settling down for a nap, he sets his sword beneath the bed
    and closes his eyes to the distant sound of CHILDREN playing.

    The room is still.
    Romirez begins to drowse.

    Suddenly his eyes leap open with full alertness.
    His hand moves under the cot.

    With an EXPLOSION the front door is lifted from its hinges
    and splintered into fragments.  Passing through a cloud of
    sawdust enters the Knight.  Without pause he topples a kitchen
    shelf onto a supine Romirez.

                                KNIGHT
                          Romirez.  What a surprise.

    Romirez is struggling under the debris.
    The Knight thrusts hard onto an exposed leg.
    The limb is severed.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Madonna!

    The Knight begins casting aside the shelving.
    With lightning speed Romirez pulls the sword from beneath the
    bed and hammers it deep into the Knight's side.

                                KNIGHT
                          Bastard!

    He crashes back against the wall.

    Romirez tries to lift himself from the bed using his sword
    as a crutch.

    The Knight has regained a meager balance on his knees.
    Blood pours from the slice in his stomach,

    Romirez pushes himself across the bed, plants his sword into
    the floor and hobbles a few paces before collapsing.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Oh, Santa Maria!

    The Knight crawls across the bed and drops to his knees
    beside Romirez.

                                KNIGHT
                          Why run?

                                ROMIREZ
                          Demonio!

    The Knight's trembling hands raise his shaking sword high.

                                KNIGHT
                          To hell with you.


65  EXT. BARNYARD - DAY                                             65

    Conor pounds at a horseshoe.

    The hammer slips from his grasp as he slumps forward as if
    pushed.


66  EXT. CONOR'S HOME - DAY                                         66

    Badly wounded, the Knight staggers through the shattered
    doorway and tumbles into the street.

    A CHILD SCREAMS.

    Pulling himself up, the Knight hobbles away.


67  EXT. - DAY                                                      67

    Conor is running through the village.


67  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               67

    Conor rushes in and shudders to a stop.

    An entire wall is showered with blood.
    Conor walks slowly forward.  Dazed.

    As he looks down something takes his attention.

    It is Romirez's severed head.

    Conor moans in anguish and drops to his knees on the blood-
    stained floor.

    His head sinks to his chest as he begins sobbing.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


68  INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH LIBRARY                                    68

    Somewhere in the bowels of the museum, the RESEARCH
    LIBRARIAN, a wiry young man, sits at his cluttered desk.
    Brenna looms above him.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          Come on Brenna, your ass
                          is already in a sling, don't
                          drag me into it.

                                BRENNA
                          All I need is for you
                          to check the name.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          You talked to your supervisor
                          lately?  He's burning up the
                          place about you just dropping
                          out of sight.  That on top of
                          the cops bugging him.

                                BRENNA
                          I'll take care of that
                          Corey, but I need this now.

    The librarian looks her over skeptically.

                                BRENNA
                          Corey, you _owe_ me.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          It's that important?

                                BRENNA
                          Yeah.

    The librarian reluctantly reaches for his keys.


69  INT. STORAGE AREA                                               69

    Holding Brenna's photograph, the research librarian is comb-
    ing through stained binders.  The room is old, disorganized,
    and gives the impression that every fact worth knowing must
    be in it somewhere.

                                RESEARCHER
                          Wilson know about this?

                                BRENNA
                          I'm doing it on my own.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          Good way to lose your job.

                                BRENNA
                          Some job.  Card filing and
                          cabinet dusting.  Four years
                          in this dump and I haven't
                          written anything for Wilson
                          that a wounded yak couldn't
                          do.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          I liked the bit you did
                          about Baltic chastity belts.
                          Too bad no one else did.

                                BRENNA
                          It's bullshit.  Everything.
                          My job, the people I get
                          involved with, I'm up to here
                          with it.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          You always were hard to
                          impress.

    The librarian pulls a binder and opens it.

                                BRENNA
                          Who is it?

                                LIBRARIAN
                          Not who.  What.  Worstick's
                          a town in Pennsylvania.


70  INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH OFFICE                                     70

    Brenna enters and sits at her desk.  She is looking for
    something.

                                BRENNA
                              (confused)
                          Chris, have you seen my
                          notebook?

    Chris is seated at the desk next to her.  He points at the
    supervisor's door.

                                BRENNA
                          Why, that son of a bitch.


71  INT. MUSEUM SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE                                 71

    The high backed office chair is spun away from an angry,
    entering Brenna.

                                BRENNA
                          What's wrong Wilson, huh?  Not enough
                          excitement in your own desk?  What the
                          hell were you looking for in mine?

    The chair turns.  Detective Moran, not her supervisor, leafs
    through her notebook.

                                MORAN
                          A murder.

                                BRENNA
                          You better have a warrant.  That's
                          my notebook, you've got no right
                          to be sticking your fingers into it.

                                MORAN
                          I've got a morgue filling up with
                          bodies.  That's my right.

                                BRENNA
                          What do you want from me?

                                MORAN
                          Well, the man of the hour that we
                          all would like to talk to about now
                          has apparently skipped town.
                             (looks at notebook)
                          And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's
                          ambulence chaser is an expert on
                          missing persons.

    Brenna lifts the telephone receiver.

                                BRENNA
                          I'm calling an attorney.

                                MORAN
                          You and I should talk first.

                                BRENNA
                          We've got nothing to say.

    Moran presses the post on the phone.

                                MORAN
                          What are you going to tell them?  That
                          you're protecting a man who's
                          killed four people?

                                BRENNA
                          Four?

                                MORAN
                          All fashionably without heads.

                                BRENNA
                          Spare me the details.

                                MORAN
                          But there's more.  Wednesday someone
                          played javelin with the cemetary
                          curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some
                          locals spotted two cars with D.C.
                          plates and surprise surprise, they
                          turn out to be registered to our
                          own Brenna Cartwright and the ever
                          popular Richard Taupin.

                                BRENNA
                          What are you getting at, Moran?

                                MORAN
                          You've been a busy little beaver.
                          Especially with that records mess
                          up in Church Hill.
                             (looks at notebook)
                          Your notes are very complete.
                          Naturally my feelings were crushed
                          when you didn't rush right over
                          and tell us what you knew.
                             (looks up)
                          In fact, we're considering book-
                          ing the ambulence chaser as an
                          accessory to murder.

                                BRENNA
                          It'll never stick.

                                MORAN
                          But we might just give it the
                          'ole college try.  What with the
                          court back ups, it could be days
                          before you got an arraignment.
                          But then, I'm sure the flunk-out
                          neice of the D.A. knows all about
                          that.

                                BRENNA
                          You're an asshole, Moran.

                                MORAN
                          I want Taupin.

                                BRENNA
                          What makes you so sure he's
                          the one?

                                MORAN
                          Just for laughs we raided wonder
                          boy's house.  There was a gallon
                          of one of the corpse's blood in
                          his carpet.  I think it was about
                          then I withdrew his name for
                          humanitarian of the year.

                                BRENNA
                          What's all of this got to do
                          with me?

                                MORAN
                          What were you doing in Felton?

                                BRENNA
                          Research.  If your pal was there
                          I never saw him.

                                MORAN
                          I have witnesses that can put
                          the two of you together.

                                BRENNA
                            (knows he's bluffing)
                          Never take up poker, Detective.

                                MORAN
                          Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck
                          can be sliced as fast as anyone
                          else's.

    Brenna reaches across and lifts her notebook.

                                BRENNA
                          Why don't you wait until it comes
                          out in paperback?

    Moran watches her leave.  He lifts the telephone receiver.

    RESEARCH OFFICE

    Striding out into the corridor, Brenna passes Dennis, the cop
    from her bedroom, leaning against the doorway.

                                DENNIS
                          I warned you.

                                BRENNA
                          Go to hell.


72  INT. CHURCH (WASHINGTON D.C.)                                   72

    A PRIEST celebrates mass in a present-day cathedral.

    In the rear of the church apart from the other PARISHIONERS
    sits the Knight.  As the priest leads the parishioners through
    the procession of faith, the Knight alone repeats it quietly
    to himself in Latin, the ancient language of the church.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


73  EXT. ABANDONED GRAVEYARD - DAY                                  73

    Crooked tombstones strewn across the bleached ground of a place
    not beloning to reality.

    In full medieval tartan, Conor stands against a forceful wind.

    CRACKS

    Run the length plain, spewing forth steam and staggering
    SKELETONS.  There are dozens of them, all carrying their skulls
    under one arm.

    The skeletons press forward and trap Conor against the trunk
    of a dead oak.  The heads break into harsh, demonic LAUGHTER.
    Conor puts his hands over his ears in pain as the bodies push
    forward.

    SCREAMING, he disappears under a mass of gleaming bones.

                                                        CUT TO:


74  INT. TAUPIN'S WORSTICK HOME                                     74

    Taupin wakes from the dream with a SHOUT.
    He has fallen asleep in a desk chair.

    Taupin walks to a window and looks out to the green hills.  To
    the distance.


75  EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                           75

    Brenna's sedan shoots down a country highway.


76  INT. SEDAN - DAY                                                76

    Checking her rear view mirror, Brenna notices two suspicious
    FIGURES in a car behind her.


77  EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                           77

    Brenna pulls to the side.  The car from behind passes without
    incident.


78  INT. SEDAN - DAY                                                78

    Brenna is driving again.  Listening now to the RADIO, she
    casts a glance in the mirror.  The same car is behind her.


79  EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                           79

    Passing over a rise in the highway, Brenna turns abruptly
    onto a service road and behind a group of trees.

    THE OTHER CAR

    Pauses a moment at the intersection, then drives on.


80  EXT. STOREFRONT - DAY                                           80

    Brenna shows the PROPRIETOR the photograph.  He explains
    something to her.

    Brenna steps outside the store onto the Main Street of the
    very small community of Worstick.

    AT A STREET CORNER

    Brenna passes a small monument settled in a flower bed.  It has
    a plaque memorializing five locals murdered in 1931.


81  INT. SEDAN                                                      81

    A mile out of town Brenna stops at a farmhouse.  She checks
    it against the photo she found at Taupin's townhouse.  They
    match.


82  EXT. FARMHOUSE DOOR - DAY                                       82

    Brenna KNOCKS.

                                TAUPIN
                          You shouldn't have come.

    Brenna whirls around and sees Taupin behind her.

                                TAUPIN
                          We're you followed?

    He looks to the road.

                                BRENNA
                          No.

                                TAUPIN
                          No one knows you're here?

                                BRENNA
                          No.  I had to talk to you.

                                TAUPIN
                          You had to do _nothing_!

                                BRENNA
                          You're wrong.

                                TAUPIN
                          You're a fool.

                                BRENNA
                          Maybe.

    Pause.  Taupin strides through the doorway.

                                TAUPIN
                          Come inside.


83  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                  83

    Brenna and Taupin enter.  A heavy broad sword sits on the
    coffee table.

                                BRENNA
                          Is this what you killed them with?

                                TAUPIN
                          You've been listening to rumors.

                                BRENNA
                          Our cars were seen together in
                          Felton.  They're calling me an
                          accessory to murder.

                                TAUPIN
                          You are.  Now.

    Beat.  They're stuck with each other.

                                TAUPIN
                          There's several bedrooms down the
                          hall.  Take your pick.


84  INT. BEDROOM                                                    84

    The room is a strange decor.  18th century paintings hang
    beside grotesque medieval carvings.

    Brenna's face softens with worry.  What is she doing?


85  EXT. RURAL PAY PHONE - DAY                                      85

    A plain-clothed POLICE OFFICER is in mid conversation.

                                OFFICER
                          No, that's the last place we saw
                          her.  Okay, will do.

    He hangs up.

                                PARTNER
                          Well?

                                OFFICER
                                (shrugs)
                          We keep looking.

                                PARTNER
                          Wonderful.


86  INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                            86

    Taupin sits at his desk.  Before him is spread out blank birth
    certificates, driver licenses and title deeds.  His eyes lift
    to the corridor where Brenna is.  An idea has come to him.

    Brenna enters.

                                BRENNA
                          What's all that?

                                TAUPIN
                          Richard Taupin has become
                          cumbersome.  It would be best
                          if he just disappeared.

    Brenna walks to the window.

                                BRENNA
                          You did kill those men.

                                TAUPIN
                          Not all of them.

                                BRENNA
                          When you finish, what then?

                                TAUPIN
                          I go my way and you can write
                          all you want about the big bad
                          Mr. Taupin.

                                BRENNA
                          You make it all sound so simple.

                                TAUPIN
                          The only real difficulty comes
                          in changing over the ownership
                          of property I've aquired.  That
                          requires certain records and
                          most importantly a personal
                          appearance at the county seat in
                          Gettysburg.  But that's where
                          you come in.

                                BRENNA
                          You want me to front for you.

                                TAUPIN
                          The less exposure I recieve
                          around government buildings the
                          better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin,
                          will attract considerably less
                          attention than I.

    Brenna is unsure.

                                TAUPIN
                          Not such a bad trade.  The story
                          of a lifetime for a few days
                          work?


87  INT. TAUPIN'S WASHINGTON TOWNHOUSE                              87

    Detective Moran looks through the broken remains of the living
    room.

    An INSPECTOR enters.

                                INSPECTOR
                          They lost her outside of Thurmont.

    Moran sighs and tosses a piece of wood on the pile of debris.

                                MORAN
                          I want people in here to check
                          over every piece of this stuff.

                                INSPECTOR
                          Figure she's with him?

                                MORAN
                          Yeah.

                                INSPECTOR
                          We ran down that Church Hill info.
                          She's right.  There is no Richard
                          Taupin.

                                MORAN
                          Any other I.D.s come up?

                                INSPECTOR
                          Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday.
                          Thompson's going to try CIA
                          this afternoon.
                                 (shrugs)
                          Y'never know.

    Moran rises and dons his coat.

                                MORAN
                          Should have seen him the first
                          night.  Son of a bitch stood there
                          with a quart of blood on his
                          pant leg and didn't even blink.

                                INSPECTOR
                          You'd think he'd had practice.

    Moran walks to the door.

                                MORAN
                          I think he has.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


88  EXT. FRENCE MILITARY CAMP - DAY                                 88

    Conor, now MAJOR DUPONT of the French infantry, pours over
    battle plans.

    An AIDE, dressed as Conor-Dupont in 18th century European
    military garb, enters the command area.

                                AIDE
                          The men are assembled, Major.

    A GENERAL stands beside the major.

                                GENERAL
                          See that they are indeed ready,
                          Dupont.

                                DUPONT (CONOR)
                          Yes General.


89  EXT. PARADE GROUND - DAY                                        89

    A regiment of INFANTRYMEN, pale blue coat tails tossing in
    the light breeze, stand at attention.

    A STAFF SARGEANT presents the men to Dupont.

                                STAFF SARGEANT
                          Regiment ready for review, sir.

    Dupont walks past the sargeant to the line.

                                DUPONT
                              (to soldier)
                          Stand straight, you are a soldier
                          of the King.

                                SOLDIER #1
                          Yes sir.

    Dupont continues down the line.  Another soldier's infantry
    jacket is almost hilariously mis-buttoned, one collar sticking
    up four inches higher than the other.

    Dupont with both hands rips open the soldier's coat, spraying
    brass buttons onto the ground.

    He moves on.

                                DUPONT
                              (to soldier)
                          Where is your bayonet?

                                SOLIDER #3
                          Lost it sir.

                                DUPONT
                          Where?

    The soldier hedges.

                                STAFF SARGEANT
                          You heard the Major!  Where!

                                SOLDIER #3
                          Whorehouse sir.

    Dupont's face softens in exasperation, then toughens.

                                DUPONT
                          Your rifle.  Hand it to me.

    The soldier obeys.  Dupont inspects the firing mechanism.

                                DUPONT
                          The flint is cracked.  No spark
                          will reach your powder.  You will
                          die tomorrow.

    He throws the rifle roughly back into the soldier's hands.

                                DUPONT
                          Tomorrow you go to _battle_!  And
                          you look like children!
                                (beat)
                          The General has charged me with
                          seeing that you are prepared, and
                          prepared you will be!  If necessary
                          you stand here all night!  Sargeant!

    The sargeant leaps to attention.

                                SARGEANT
                          Yes sir.

                                DUPONT
                          See to it.

                                SARGEANT
                          Yes sir.

    Dupont turns briskly, then stops abruptly as if alerted by some-
    thing.  He whirls around and faces the young infantrymen.

    His expression is quizzical as he walks the line, checking
    each face carefully.

    One PRIVATE seizes his attention.  The private is cautious.

                                DUPONT
                          Your name?

                                MULET
                          Mulet.

    It is as if Dupont knows him.  The two stare at each other.
    Dupont turns and leaves.


90  INT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                          90

    Inside a small farmhouse commandeered for officer's quarters,
    Dupont (Conor) and several others eat their evening meal.

    A CAPTAIN finishes his story.

                                CAPTAIN
                                (amused)
                          ...And what a sight!  That old
                          mare just kept falling over her
                          own guts till someone finally
                          shot her.

    The OFFICERS LAUGH.  All but Dupont.

                                MAJOR
                              (beside Dupont)
                          Complete your inspection?

                                DUPONT
                          They're nothing but boys.  It
                          will be a slaughter tomorrow.

                                MAJOR
                                (laughs)
                          I doubt much can change that.
                          The enemy has five brigades
                          waiting for us.

                                DUPONT
                          We need more time.

                                MAJOR
                          Won't get it.
                               (shrugs)
                          We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.

    Dupont pokes unenthusiastically at his plate.

                                MAJOR
                          Eat up Dupont.  It will probably
                          be your last.

                                DUPONT
                                (rises)
                          Not likely.

    Dupont goes to the window.  Dusk shines orange on his face.

    In the foreground the man Dupont encountered at the line-up,
    Mulet, is chopping firewood.


91  EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                            91

    Several hours later.
    Most are asleep.  Mulet continues his wood splitting.

    From out of the dark cottage steps Dupont.

                                DUPONT (CONOR)
                          I thought I gave orders the
                          regiment was to drill.

                                MULET
                          Staff sargeant detailed me to
                          prepare firewood for the break-
                          fast cooking.

                                DUPONT
                          What is your position?

                                MULET
                          Second musketeer.

                                DUPONT
                          I understand you joined up in
                          Bremen.

                                MULET
                          You seem to understand a great
                          deal.

                                DUPONT
                          I am a Major, Private.  You would
                          do well remembering that when
                          addressing me.

                                MULET
                          Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we
                          spoke as equals.

                                DUPONT
                          Equals?

                                MULET
                               (shrugs)
                          If you wish to play games, Major.

    Mulet returns to his chore.

                                DUPONT
                          Wait.  I think we understand each
                          other.

                                MULET
                          We have no understanding.

                                DUPONT
                          Then it is time two of us did.
                          You are very young.  I was once
                          young.  I can help.

    Mulet LAUGHS.

                                MULET
                          Help?  I've seen others "help".
                          Somehow a head always ended up
                          on the counter.

                                DUPONT
                          It can be different.  It must be.

                                MULET
                          It never changes, Major.

    Mulet turns to his chore.  Dupont grabs his arm.

                                DUPONT
                          We must talk.

                                MULET
                             (shakes him off)
                          Stay out of it.

                                DUPONT
                                (angry)
                          Don't threaten me, Private.

                                MULET
                                (disgust)
                          Who do you think I am?  One of your
                          freckle faced children waiting to
                          die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You
                          and I just living will always be a
                          threat.  Forever.  Look at your life,
                          Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there
                          but threat.  Threats and nothingness.
                          It's what we live for.

    Mulet turns his back on Dupont.
    Dupont draws his cutlass.

                                DUPONT
                          Do not turn your back on me.

                                MULET
                          You are really going to force this,
                          aren't you?

                                DUPONT
                          Either you are with me or against me.

    Mulet turns slowly, axe in hand.

                                MULET
                          Have I a choice?

    The two stare into eyes empty of emotion.

    Mulet's hand flinches.  An attack?

    Dupont CUTS quickly, slicing open both of Mulet's arms.
    The axe drops to the ground.

    Mulet seems strangely calm.

                                MULET
                          You see Major?  You are not so
                          different.

    Dupont cuts off Mulet's head where he stands.


92  EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT                                           92

    Dupont drags the corpse across the meadow and dumps it into
    a swamp.


93  INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT                                          93

    It is very late.  Only a few OFFICERS are seated in the pews.
    Dupont tries to concentrate on prayer, but is distracted.

                                MULET
                             (voice flashback)
                          You see Major?  You are not so
                          different...

                                DUPONT
                          I had no choice.

    Dupont sighs and looks to the altar.

                                DUPONT
                          Who am I deceiving?

                                KNIGHT
                          Certainly not me.

    Dupont whirls around to see the Knight, dressed as he in uniform,
    sitting one row behind.

    Dupont leaps to his feet.

                                KNIGHT
                          You needn't look so flushed,
                          Major.  You are quite safe in
                          church.

    Dupont eases his breathing.

                                KNIGHT
                          State of grace and all that.

                                DUPONT
                          Tradition.

                                KNIGHT
                          It's all we have.

    Dupont has backed up a few paces.

                                KNIGHT
                          All this time and still a scared
                          little boy.

    Dupont sits down.

                                DUPONT
                          Not so scared.

                                KNIGHT
                          Perhaps not.
                               (smiles)
                          You seem to have misplaced a
                          private.  No doubt by now his
                          head is stranger to his neck.

                                DUPONT
                          No doubt.

                                KNIGHT
                          You surprise me.  Eliminating a
                          rival like that.  Such are the
                          actions of a man of conquest.  I
                          was mistaken.  300 years have
                          turned the boy's fear into ambit-
                          ion.

                                DUPONT
                          You're wrong.

                                KNIGHT
                          I know you very well, Conor MacLeod.
                          And I can see the truth beginning
                          to make itself clear to you.  Mulet,
                          Romirez, they were fools without
                          vision.  It was destined that the
                          board would be cleared for the real
                          players.

    The Knight almost seems proud of Dupont.

                                DUPONT
                          Romirez understood.  Not you.

                                KNIGHT
                          Romirez is dust.

    The Knight looks to the altar.

                                KNIGHT
                          Finish your prayers?

                                DUPONT
                          Finish yours?

                                KNIGHT
                                (smiles)
                          Our common heritage.
                                (beat)
                          I am your only real friend, you
                          know.  The only one who truly
                          understands you.
                                (rises)
                          I look forward to the day we
                          meet again.  And I kill you.

                                DUPONT
                          So sure?

    The Knight leans forward and puts his face very near.

                                KNIGHT
                          You can't stay in church forever.

    The Knight moves into the aisle.

                                KNIGHT
                          Good night, Major.

    He exits.

    Conor sits in the dim church alone.  Very alone.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


94  EXT. WORSTICK CHURCH (PRESENT DAY)                              94

    Richard Taupin sits against the stone of an old Catholic church.
    Taupin sighs.  A long, weary sigh.


95  INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE                                         95

    Taupin and Brenna sit at a table working on forms.

    Taupin looks up from his work and studies Brenna's face without
    malice.


95  EXT. CREEK - DAY                                                95

    Brenna and Taupin are taking a walk along the township's
    outskirts.

    Crossing a small bridge over a smaller creek, they encounter
    the elderly caretaker Mr. North and his eight year old GRANDSON.
    Both with fishing poles.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Morning Mr. North

                                TAUPIN
                          Same.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Such a pretty day.  If I live
                          to be 90 I'll never tire of
                          mornings like this.  Mind you
                          I'm 74 now.

                                TAUPIN
                          No.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Yes sir.  When you get older your
                          priorities change.  It's the simple
                          things that count.  Without them
                          growing old can be a very lonely
                          thing.

                                TAUPIN
                          I'm sure that's true.

    The grandson is having difficulty baiting his line.  Taupin bends
    down beside the young fisherman.

                                TAUPIN
                              (takes worm)
                          Here.  The hook should go just below
                          the head, where the meat is toughest.

                                GRANDSON
                          Thanks.

    Taupin's show of affection surprises Brenna.

                                TAUPIN
                          Show you a trick.

    Taupin takes a clump of leaves from the bridge and winds them
    around the hook.

                                TAUPIN
                          Fish are creatures of habit.  They
                          like their food where they're used
                          to it.  At the top, hiding in old
                          leaves.

                                GRANDSON
                          Where did you learn that?

                                TAUPIN
                          My father taught me.

                                GRANDSON
                          Your father must be smart.

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes, he was.

    Brenna is touched.


96  INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                 96

    Brenna lies on her bed thinking.  She puts on a robe and walks
    into the living room.

    LIVING ROOM

    Taupin sits before the fireplace, its flames reflecting on his
    brandy glass.  Brenna moves quietly to a seat beside him.

                                TAUPIN
                            (eyes on the fireplace)
                          There was a man once.  Just a simple
                          woodcarver.  But he understood.  More
                          than anyone he could see to the heart
                          of it.
                                (beat)
                          It never ends.  Today is the same as
                          the first.  Tomorrow will be the
                          same as today.  So much time.  And all
                          of it wasted.
                                (beat)
                          You love history?

                                BRENNA
                          Yes.

                                TAUPIN
                          I wish I could.


97  INT. CITY HALL                                                  97

    Brenna looks through a property zoning book.


98  EXT. WORSTICK MAIN STREET - DAY                                 98

    Walking past small town stores, Brenna allows herself a moment
    to window shop.

    IN A SHOP WINDOW

    Is a small poster advertising a community get-together.  Brenna
    peels it off the glass and slips it into her notebook.


99  INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE                                         99

    Brenna and Taupin go over various forms and documents.

                                BRENNA
                          The estate stuff is pretty straight
                          forward.  Just lots of forms and an
                          appearance at the county seat.

                                TAUPIN
                          It will take some time for the
                          forms to clear before you go to
                          Gettysburg.

    Brenna is silent.

                                TAUPIN
                          Second thoughts?

    Pause.

                                BRENNA
                          No.
                                (beat)
                          So what now?  We just wait?

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

                                BRENNA
                          Well, as long as we're stuck here.

    She hands him the poster from earlier.

                                BRENNA
                          It's some sort of party the
                          town is throwing.

                                TAUPIN
                          They do it each year.

                                BRENNA
                          I thought it might be a nice break
                          from all of this.

    Taupin stacks the documents into a folder.

                                TAUPIN
                          Maybe it would do us both good.

                                BRENNA
                          There's a catch.  You're supposed
                          to wear 19th century clothing.


100  INT. FARMHOUSE CELLAR                                         100

     Taupin is going through an old trunk.

                                TAUPIN
                          My father was something of a
                          junk collector.

     He comes across a long period dress and offers it to Brenna.

                                TAUPIN
                          Here, try this.  I suppose they're
                          still making women the same as back
                          then.

                                BRENNA
                          It's beautiful.

                                TAUPIN
                          A little dusty.

     Taupin fishes through the trunk and comes up with an old top
     hat.  He turns it over in his hand with stoic memory.

101  EXT. COLONIAL STYLE HOME - DUSK                               101

     Conor and a beautiful young woman, KATHERINE, sit on the porch
     steps in 1800s period dress.  Other young COUPLES relax nearby
     enjoying the warm summer's twilight.  Katherine's MOTHER shuffles
     between the couples offering lemonade, cakes, and the like.

                                KATHERINE
                          Do it again.

     She is thoroughly charmed by Conor.

                                CONOR
                          All right.

     Conor wraps a length of yarn about his fingers.  By turning his
     hand over and bending his knuckles just so, the web becomes the
     outline of a lion..

                                CONOR
                          A lion.
                                (growls)

     Katherine is delighted.

     Conor starts to remove the yarn.  Katherine touches his arm.

                                KATHERINE
                          Oh please.  Another one.

                                CONOR
                          What would you like?

                                KATHERINE
                          Something pretty.

                                CONOR
                          Like you.

     Conor cups his hands, bends his fingers, and comes up with a
     four leaf clover.

                                KATHERINE
                          That's wonderful.  Where did you
                          ever learn it?

                                CONOR
                          Far away.

                                KATHERINE
                          Kiss me.

     Conor shoots a glance for the mother, then kisses Katherine
     softly.

                                YOUNG MAN
                                (o.s.)
                          You'll be leaving the girl alone.

     A YOUNG MAN stands a few yards from the stairs.

                                KATHERINE
                          David.

                                CONOR
                          Do you have cause to bothering
                          us?

                                YOUNG MAN
                          That's my girl.

                                KATHERINE
                          David, we've already spoken of this.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          He's not what he pretends to be.

     Conor climbs to his feet.

                                CONOR
                          You best leave, son.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          You think you're so high and
                          mighty, coming into town and
                          taking a man's woman.  Well I
                          know about you.  I know about
                          the things you do.

                                CONOR
                             (moving closer)
                          I said you best leave.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          You'd like that, wouldn't you?
                              (to Katherine)
                          Ask him about his friends.  The
                          ones he meets in the town square.
                          Ask him about the blade he keeps
                          beneath his bed.

     Conor grabs the youth's collar and pulls him close.

                                CONOR
                             (like ice)
                          Leave.  While you still can.

     The youth pushes away from the grasp.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          You don't frighten me.

                                CONOR
                          I should.

     The young man throws a fist at Conor.  It is easily blocked.
     Conor returns with a savage blow to the chest that knocks
     the young man gasping onto the ground.

     Katherine runs up behind and grabs Conor's outstretched arm.

                                KATHERINE
                          No!  Leave him.  Please don't hurt him.
                          Please.

     COUGHING painfully, the youth climbs to his feet and staggers
     away.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          He's not what you think.

     He turns and runs down the road.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          He's not what you think!

     Katherine turns to Conor, his face still locked in ice.

                                KATHERINE
                          I don't care who you are or where
                          you come from.

     She hugs him tightly.

                                KATHERINE
                          I love you.

     Conor's face softens as he brings up an arm to hold her.

102  INT. WORSTICK TOWN HALL (PRESENT DAY)                         102

     An auditorium has been transformed with colored lights and
     strung paper into a small town party.

     TEENAGERS in period dress control the floor, dancing to a
     decidedly un-period ROCK BAND.

     The OLDER GUESTS are gathered around the punch bowl talking
     crops or Pennsylvania politics.

     BRENNA

     Fitted as well as can be expected in her lace dress, enters
     with Taupin, himself dressed in a formal suit complete with cape.

     His clothes fit perfectly.

     Mr. North, comically dressed as a pirate, greets them.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Mr. Taupin!  Glad you could make it.
                          Best get some punch before it's
                          gone.  Near the whole valley showed
                          up.

     They go to the table.

     Taupin pours a glass of punch.  An ELDERLY WOMAN approaches him.

                                WOMAN
                          If I didn't know better I'd say
                          William Taupin.

                                TAUPIN
                          His son.  Richard.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Mr. Taupin is up from Washington
                          to look over his father's estate.

                                WOMAN
                          Your father died some years ago.
                          This is your first visit?

     The tone is snide.

                                TAUPIN
                          Of sorts.

                                WOMAN
                          I suppose a Taupin had to show
                          up eventually.
                               (walks away)

                                TAUPIN
                          Good evening, Mrs. Butler.

     She turns in surprise at his knowing her name, then walks on.

                                BRENNA
                          What was all that about?

                                MR. NORTH
                          Sorry Mr. Taupin.  That's not meant
                          for you.  Just some didn't take
                          much to your father.

                                BRENNA
                          Why?

                                TAUPIN
                          My father was never one for social
                          whirls.

                                MR. TAUPIN
                          Kept to himself for sure.  Then with
                          all that business in '31.

                                BRENNA
                          What business?

                                MR. NORTH
                          Family down the road from the
                          Taupin place was murdered.  All
                          cut up they were.  Horrible.  Two
                          strangers were also found with
                          the bodies.  No one ever accused
                          William, but with his reputation
                          as a loner and the rumors about
                          him and some of the wives in town,
                          folks just never forgot.  Most
                          were relieved when they heard he'd
                          died.  Sorry Mr. Taupin.

                                TAUPIN
                          Nothing to be sorry about.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Just your pappy scared some.

     The rock band finished as a PORTLY MAN in a union soldier's
     uniform takes the microphone.

                                PORTLY
                          All right, the kids have had their
                          fun.  Now it's time for a little
                          more traditional dancing.

     The rock band gives ground to a group of older MUSICIANS.  With
     a nod from the union soldier they begin a folk tune with fiddles
     and hammer dulcimer.

     The costumed guests take to the floor.

                                BRENNA
                          I don't know any of these.  I'll
                          make a fool of myself.

                                TAUPIN
                          Follow me.

     Taupin starts into it with perfect grace.  A faltering Brenna
     tries to keep up.

                                BRENNA
                          William Taupin seems to have left
                          his mark.

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

                                BRENNA
                          And you are William
                          Taupin, aren't you?

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

     They do a final turn and finish.  The other DANCERS applaud.

                                BRENNA
                          You're using your son's
                          name.

                                TAUPIN
                          No.  Just the child of
                          some lonely girl I gave
                          a ride to.  When they
                          died I put them in a
                          grave with my name on it.
                          Twenty years later I
                          became the son.

     Brenna is staring at him.

                                TAUPIN
                          More punch?

     He leads her to a table.

                                BRENNA
                          Then you must be at least
                          70 years old.

                                TAUPIN
                          At least.

                                BRENNA
                          That's impossible.

     Several of the ELDERLY WOMEN are watching Taupin from across
     the room.


103  EXT. BUS STATION - NIGHT                                      103

     A bus with "Gettysburg" across the front pulls to a stop at
     a dark terminal.  A lone passenger steps off into the mist.
     It is the Knight, bound up in a leather jacket and carrying
     only a long, narrow case.


104  EXT. - NIGHT                                                  104

     Brenna and Taupin walk alone in the night outside the hall.

                                BRENNA
                          It's frightening sometimes the
                          way you talk about other people's
                          lives.

                                TAUPIN
                          A factor of age.

                                BRENNA
                          I hope I never get that old.

                                TAUPIN
                          You won't.

     Brenna pulls away.

                                BRENNA
                          I must be insane.  Leaving work,
                          ditching cops.  All to follow a
                          murderer.  A very old murderer,
                          but a murderer just the same.

                                TAUPIN
                          Why are you here?

                                BRENNA
                          I've been telling myself it's the
                          award winning journal article I'm
                          going to write.  But it's not.
                              (looks at him squarely)
                          It's you.

                                TAUPIN
                          I see.

                                BRENNA
                          I'm not even sure why.

                                TAUPIN
                          Hardly a reason to run off with
                          a murderer.

                                BRENNA
                          My life has been chock full of
                          people with complications and weak-
                          nesses.  I can't stand it.  But
                          you're different.  It's in your
                          hands.  A clarity.

                                TAUPIN
                          You are a very perceptive young
                          woman.

                                BRENNA
                          Just a little crazy.

     A thoughtful pause.

                                TAUPIN
                          Miss Cartwright, it's time I
                          showed you something.


105  INT. FARMHOUSE CELLAR                                         105

     Taupin and Brenna descend the stairs to a seemingly flush wall.

     Taupin reaches behind a bookcase and pulls something.  A press
     from his hand and the wall becomes a doorway.

                                TAUPIN
                              (gestures to interior)
                          Miss Cartwright?

     Brenna steps uneasily into the darkness.  Taupin follows and
     switches on the light.


106  INT. HIDDEN ROOM                                              106

     Brenna's expression changes to awe.

     The room is massive, a cross between a museum and an old attic.
     Suits of armor, Italian statuettes, Czech ironworks, Persian
     fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras
     crowd the shelving and floor space.

     The room has the look of ownership, as if civilization had
     taken the time to keep a scrapbook.

                                BRENNA
                          My God.

     The sight is overwhelming.

                                TAUPIN
                          I had this room built some
                          time ago.

     Brenna picks up a Carolingian tapestry and runs her hand along
     its intricate weaving.

                                BRENNA
                          Who are you?

                                TAUPIN
                          That would be difficult to explain.

                                BRENNA
                          I'd like you to try.

     Taupin picks up a Byzantine icon, brushing the dust from its
     shoulders.

                                TAUPIN
                          I was born Conor MacLeod in the
                          village of Ardvrek on the High-
                          land plain of Strathnaver in the
                          clan of MacLeod under the King
                          of Scotland.  On the eleventh of
                          December, 1408.

     He replaces the icon.

                                TAUPIN
                          I have served in the armies of
                          twelve nations, married nine
                          women, fathered thirty-eight
                          children and buried them all.

     Taupin walks along the cases.

                                TAUPIN
                          I carried that rifle in World
                          War I.  This book is a 16th Century
                          policy report for the King of
                          Austria.  The diploma is my con-
                          ference of degree in Latin from
                          Trinity College.  Class of 1672.
                                 (beat)
                          It goes on.

                                BRENNA
                          That's why Smith called you
                          MacLeod.

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

                                BRENNA
                          He knows about you.

                                TAUPIN
                          He is older than I.

                                BRENNA
                          What could possibly be worth all
                          this murder and distruction.

                                TAUPIN
                          Sometimes I think it's just for
                          something to do.  A conquest to
                          be the last.  Something to hold
                          onto while everything else around
                          you withers and blows away.  Some-
                          thing to replace the love that can
                          never work.

                                BRENNA
                          That's insane.

                                TAUPIN
                          Perhaps.  There is something more.
                          An inheritance.

                                BRENNA
                          Of bodies.

                                TAUPIN
                          I didn't kill the watchman.

                                BRENNA
                          You killed those other two.

                                TAUPIN
                          Not the same.

                                BRENNA
                          What about that family in '31?

                                TAUPIN
                          Sometimes innocents become involved.

                                BRENNA
                          You and your buddy make a real
                          team, don't you?  Exchanging
                          eloquent threats in iambic pen-
                          tameter while hacking up all
                          the innocents in between.

                                TAUPIN
                          There are differences.

                                BRENNA
                          You kill with your left hand?

                                TAUPIN
                          I haven't killed _you_.

                                BRENNA
                          Is that a threat?

     Taupin moves very close.

                                TAUPIN
                          No.

     Brenna's face softens.  She turns away.

                                BRENNA
                          Don't.

                                TAUPIN
                          Come here, Brenna.

                                BRENNA
                          Damn you.

     He kisses her.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


107  EXT. TURN OF THE CENTURY CEMETARY - DAY                       107

     RELATIVES in period dress watch as a family member is lowered
     into the ground.

     A very OLD WOMAN stands stoically, supported on both sides by
     her middle aged SONS.

                                MINISTER
                          May God commend into his kingdom
                          the soul of our dear departed
                          Jason, son of Katherine-

     The old woman.

                                MINISTER
                          And brother to Howard and James-

     The two middle aged sons.

     CONOR

     Watches the funeral quietly at a distance.

     THE OLD WOMAN

     As the minister continues allows her gaze to wander.  She sees
     Conor standing at the treeline.  Her eyes crinkle in disbelief.

     Releasing herself from her sons, she hobbles toward Conor.
     Confused, the brothers watch their mother leave the ceremony.

     CONOR

     Watches the woman approach but decides against moving.
     She stops a few paces away and looks over him.

                                OLD WOMAN
                          You.

                                CONOR
                          Katherine.

                                OLD WOMAN
                          What are you doing here?

                                CONOR
                          I owe him this.

                                OLD WOMAN
                          He never knew you.

     The two sons come up behind.  The three stand there: an old
     woman who could be 60 years Conor's senior and her two sons
     old enough to be his father.

                                SON #1
                          Is something wrong, Mother?

                                OLD WOMAN
                          Howard.  James.  This is your
                          father...

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


108  INT. BEDROOM                                                  108

     Taupin and Brenna lie together.

     Running her hands along the contours of his body she sees the
     countless faint scars of bullet and sword wounds.

     Taupin strokes her softly.

                                TAUPIN
                          "Brenna".  In Celtic is means
                          "woman with raven hair".  Only
                          chieftan's daughters were allowed
                          it.

     Brenna is lost in Taupin's scars.

                                BRENNA
                          What is it like?  Being you?

                                TAUPIN
                          Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that
                          would kill you and fear of those that
                          would love you.  It can never last, and
                          in the end you always end up destroying
                          both.

                                BRENNA
                          But you're known so much.
                          History I'll only read about.

                                TAUPIN
                          It's all the same.  Half lives that
                          never go away.

                                BRENNA
                          What is it you want?

                                TAUPIN
                          All of it finished.


109  EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING                                      109

     Taupin and Brenna stand beside her car.  She has an armload
     of documents.

                                TAUPIN
                          Gettysburg's an hour's drive
                          at most.  You should be back
                          by nightfall.

                                BRENNA
                          Will I see you again?

                                TAUPIN
                          Be careful.  Don't stay any
                          longer than you have to.

     Pause.  Brenna considers touching him but instead climbs briskly
     into the car.

                                TAUPIN
                          Good luck.

110  EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY                      110

     Detective Moran and his Inspector walk among parked squad cars.

                                MORAN
                          Are you sure?

                                INSPECTOR
                          Won't know till the
                          records department comes
                          back with it this after-
                          noon.  Looks good though.
                          They found the receipt
                          in his townhouse.  It was
                          pretty smeared but had
                          Taupin's father listed
                          as a signatory.

                                MORAN
                          Round up who you can
                          and put them on standby.

                                INSPECTOR
                          Think we should call the
                          local P.D. out there
                          first?

                                MORAN
                          No.  I want this to be
                          all ours.


111  INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE                                    111

     Brenna is standing at a counter signing the last of a stack.

                                CLERK
                          O.K. Mrs. Taupin, that's
                          all I need.

     The clerk fills out a small sheet and hands it to her.

                                CLERK
                          Just take this down
                          the hall to the regis-
                          trar.  Hurry up though,
                          it's near closing time.
                          Most everyone's gone
                          home already.

     A pair of Levis follow Brenna at a distance down the corridor.


112  INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE                                       112

     Sealed from the corridor by a pair of doors, two CLERKS
     sit in an office mostly cleared of employees.

     Brenna hands the slip to a clerk.

                                CLERK #2
                          I'll be right back.

     She disappears into the rear area.

                                BRENNA
                             (to other clerk)
                          Do you have a drinking
                          fountain?

                                CLERK #3
                          Around the corner.

     Brenna steps around and takes a drink.  She looks into her
     reflection on the stainless steel and spends a moment fiddling
     with her hair.

     THE CLERK

     Still hasn't returned.  Brenna drums her fingers on the
     counter top and looks around the office.

     The second clerk is also gone.

     Brenna sees something unfamiliar on the second clerk's desk.
     She steps over to it.

     It is a large blood stain.

     Brenna shoots a glance to the double doors.
     They're closed.

     Brenna rushes to the doors.  Someone's locked them.
     She struggles with the handles, then turns to see the Knight
     walking to her with his stained sword.

     With a SCREAM she kicks a rolling office chair into him and
     runs down an opposite corridor.

     THE KNIGHT

     Flings the chair aside and knocks open the door with a SLAM
     of his palm.

     BRENNA

     Has run out of corridor.  She looks back at the Knight closing
     the distance.  CRYING in fear, she frantically searches for
     a way out.

     The Knight is nearly upon her.

     In desperation she runs into a janitorial closet, closing
     its heavy door.

     THE CLOSET

     Is dark and full of old paint cans and mops.  Her BREATHING
     is at a PANIC.

     THE KNIGHT

     Tries the door handle.
     Stepping back, he lifts his sword and HAMMERS it deep into
     the wood.

                                BRENNA
                                (crying)
                          Oh God...

     He STRIKES again.  And again.  Splinters smack against surround-
     ing walls.

                                BRENNA
                          Go away!  Oh God, go
                          away!

     CRYING hysterically, Brenna presses herself against the far
     wall, sliding to the floor in a crouch.

     THE KNIGHT

     Steps back and gives the door a last two-fisted swing.
     Brenna SCREAMS.
     The door collapses.


113  EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING                                        113

     A group of unmarked police cars race by with the last light
     of day.


114  INT. CAR                                                      114

     At the wheel is Moran's assistant, the inspector.


114  INT. HOME - NIGHT                                             114

     Taupin stands at his fireplace, the only light in the room,
     poking at it with a tong.

     His gaze goes to a mantle clock.
     It is 10:30 PM.

     The phone RINGS.
     He looks to it.
     It RINGS again.
     He picks up the receiver slowly and places it against his ear.

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE
                          We have some unfinished
                          business.

                                TAUPIN
                          Are you here?

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE
                          I want you to come to
                          me.

                                TAUPIN
                          And if I refuse?

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE
                          Give me an address where
                          I can forward Miss Cart-
                          wright's head.

     This affects him.

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE
                          Yes laddie, I have her.

                                TAUPIN
                          Should I care?

                                KNIGHT
                          You have three hours.


115  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT                                       115

     The unmarked cars shoot by.


116  INT. HOME                                                     116

     Taupin hangs up the phone.
     He looks to the sword on the table, reflecting the firelight.


117  EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                        117

     POLICE OFFICERS, placed around Taupin's house, are COCKING
     shotguns and CHAMBERING pistols.

     Two officers take positions on either side of the door.  A
     third, after getting the signal, kicks the door open.


118  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                118

     The officers drop to firing positions in the doorway.  The
     room is empty.


119  INT. FARMHOUSE BEDROOM                                        119

     An officer BURSTS in.  It's empty.


120  INT. MAIN ROOM                                                120

     The Inspector is on the phone.

                                INSPECTOR
                          He's not here.


121  EXT. THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                           121

     Spotlights seperate the whitemarble from the surrounding
     blackness.

     Taupin's face moves into frame.


122  EXT. MONUMENT STAIRS - NIGHT                                  122

     Sword firmly in one hand, Taupin climb's the monument's steps.


123  INT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                               123

     A twenty-five foot bronze of Thomas Jefferson flanked by his
     quotations.

     A sword in one hand and Brenna in the other, the Knight stands
     at the statue's base.

                                KNIGHT
                          Welcome.

     Taupin stands at the entrance.

                                KNIGHT
                          Kahn sends his best.

     In a corner the Asian's head lies on its side, the horror of
     death still pressed into the face.  Taupin's eyes return slowly
     to the Knight and Brenna.

                                TAUPIN
                          Let her go.

    The Knight throws Brenna roughly against a wall.

                                KNIGHT
                          You disappoint me.
                             (looks at Brenna)
                          I thought you'd finally gotten over
                          that sort of thing.

                                TAUPIN
                          Leave her out of this.

                                KNIGHT
                          As you wish.

    The Knight holds his sword out at a ceremonial angle.  Taupin
    does the same.  The weapons are CLANKED together twice, then
    pulled back into battle position.

    The two begin walking a circle, poised swords waiting for an
    opening.

    The Knight leaps first, his clash of steel RINGING off the high
    walls.

    Another ATTACK without result.

                                KNIGHT
                          You can do better than that.

    Taupin swings.  The Knight jumps back.  Sweat gleams from their
    brows.


124 EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                124

    Two LOVERS enjoy a late night walk along the tidal basin.
    There is a distant CLANKING of metal.

                                BOY
                          It's from over near the memorial.

    He jumps up on a rock.  Several yards away can be seen two figures
    attacking each other.

                                BOY
                          Shit.


125 INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT                                 125

    Standing at a map of the city, Moran nurses a cup of coffee.

    The phone RINGS.

                                MORAN
                          Moran.  All right, get a patrol
                          unit out there right away.  I'll
                          meet them.


126 INT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                126

    The Knight and Taupin are PANTING heavily.

    The Knight goes low.  Taupin blocks.  The Knight comes overhead
    quickly.  Taupin misjudges and the blade slices deep into his
    shoulder and chest.  The impact knocks him flat on his back.

    The Knight looks down on his wounded prey.

    A SCREECH of brakes from outside the monument.  Two OFFICERS
    are coming up the steps.

                                KNIGHT
                          No.  Not now.


127 EXT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          127

    The officers reach the top and enter.

    INSIDE

    One of the officers is Dennis, who sees only a CRYING Brenna
    and Taupin lying wounded on the floor.

                                DENNIS
                          Brenna?

    The Knight rushes up from behind, his sword in full swing.


128 EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT                                      128

    Moran's car blows through a cross street.


129 INT. CAR                                                       129

    Moran is at the wheel.


130 INT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          130

    The Knight walks from the two officers spread out like rag
    dolls on the floor.

                                KNIGHT
                              (to Taupin)
                          Get up.

    Taupin looks at Brenna and the dead policemen.  A resignation
    sweeps over him.

                                TAUPIN
                          What's the point?

                                KNIGHT
                          This isn't done.  Get up.

                                TAUPIN
                          What's the point!  You have me,
                          finish it!

                                KNIGHT
                          I have waited forever for this.
                          You will not cheapen it, little
                          boy.

                                TAUPIN
                                (irony)
                          Tradition.

                                KNIGHT
                          It's all we have.

                                TAUPIN
                          Go to hell.

    The Knight looks to Brenna.

                                KNIGHT
                          Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like
                          to play.

                                TAUPIN
                          Leave her alone.

                                KNIGHT
                          Get up.

    Taupin struggles to his feet.  Blood pouring from his shirt, he
    stands uneasily with his sword at ready.

    The Knight swings.  Taupin blocks.


131 EXT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          131

    Moran drives up.  There is an empty police car, the door still
    ajar.


132 INT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          132

    Taupin is badly outclassed.

    He feebly fends off an attack, but the Knight returns quickly
    with a savage SLICE that rips open Taupin's stomach and throws
    him again to the floor.

                                BRENNA
                          You bastard!

                                KNIGHT
                          Be silent.

                                BRENNA
                          Leave him alone.

                                KNIGHT
                          You will be silent!!

    The voice is THUNDERING.

    Taupin kneels with his forehead pressed against the floor.  His
    teeth grind in pain.

    The Knight smiles.

                                KNIGHT
                          I do hope you're enjoying this
                          as much as me.

    MORAN

    Stands in the entryway.  The Knight sees him.

                                KNIGHT
                          Get out.

    Moran draws his pistol.
    The Knight walks toward him,

                                KNIGHT
                          This is nothing that concerns you.

    Moran levels his gun.
    The Knight raises his sword.

                                KNIGHT
                          You will leave!

    Two EXPLOSIONS as Moran FIRES.  The slugs slam into the Knight,
    blowing him off his feet.

    He lies still.

    Moran looks to Brenna.  To Taupin.  Then he walks closer to the
    Knight.

                                TAUPIN
                               (hoarse)
                          Don't.

    Taupin curls in a spasm of pain.
    Moran moves closer.

    The Knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over
    his heart.  He isn't breathing.

    Moran bends over slowly to see the Knight's face.

                                TAUPIN
                          Stop.  You don't understand.

    The Knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into Moran's
    chest.  The pistol DISCHARGES against a far wall.

    Taupin crawls for the Knight.

    Moran's mouth opens but no sound escapes.  The Knight, blood
    pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts
    quickly.

    Moran slides off the sword dead.

    Taupin CUTS hard against the Knight's chest.  The Knight GAGS
    in surprise and crumples.  Taupin CUTS again, then puts the
    blade against the Knight's GURGLING throat.

                                TAUPIN
                          In mamus tuas Domine commendo
                          spiritum meum.  Auditorium nostrum
                          in nomine Domine.

    He raises the sword.

                                TAUPIN
                          Requiescant in pace.

    And CUTS the Knight's head off.

    Taupin drops his sword.
    His breathing quickens.
    A sensation sweeps over him.

    Taupin drops to the floor WHIMPERING.  He sucks in painful gulps
    of air.

                                BRENNA
                          My God.

    Taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing.

                                BRENNA
                          Conor.

    Taupin is looking past her.

    A blood-stained hand suddenly GRABS Brenna's shoulder.  She
    SCREAMS.  The headless body of the Knight stands beside her.

    THE KNIGHT'S HEAD

    Lies on the floor.
    The eyes open.  The face pulls into a smile.

                                KNIGHT
                          And now you know.

    The eyes roll up into the skull.  The face slackens.

    The hulking mass standing beside Brenna sways, the collapses
    to the ground.

    TAUPIN

    Is CRYING.  Not from wounds he no longer feels, but from something
    else.

                                BRENNA
                          What's wrong?

                                TAUPIN
                          I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't
                          stand it!

    Brenna kneels beside him.

                                TAUPIN
                          The scream of your blood.  The
                          shriek of trees.  Stop it!  Stop it!

    Brenna SOBS.

                                BRENNA
                          What is it?

                                TAUPIN
                          I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the
                          _last one_!

    Taupin doubles over in pain.  The pain of the whole world trying
    to force itself into him.

    Brenna tries to hold him.  He pushes her savagely away.

                                TAUPIN
                          Get out.

                                BRENNA
                          No!

                                TAUPIN
                          I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed
                          everything I've ever touched!  Oh
                          God...

    He doubles over in pain.

                                BRENNA
                          Conor...

    He grabs his sword and threatens her.

                                TAUPIN
                          _Get out_!

    SOBBING, Brenna runs from the memorial.  Taupin is alone.
    Bleeding.  Crying.  In agony.

    FADE OUT

    FADE UP:


133 INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM                                        133

    Brenna at work in the research area.  She's silent.  Distant.
    Something is missing from her.


134 EXT. GEORGETOWN STREET - DAY                                   134

    Brenna stands in the street before Taupin's townhouse.
    A boarded up window.  A for-sale sign.  Taupin is gone forever.
    As if he never was.


135 INT. BRENNA'S APARTMENT                                        135

    A desk.  A single light.  A cup of coffee.

    A typewriter.

    Brenna tries to force thoughts to the surface.  CLACK-CLACK.
    It is at last her journal article.  She types a line, then rips
    it from the carriage and tears it to pieces.

    The thoughts won't come.


136 EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     136

    Brenna sits on the expanse of grass throwing scraps to a group
    of wild park cats.

    A shadow covers her face.  She looks up.

    It is Taupin.

    Something has changed him.  His face is less cynical.  More
    vulnerable.  More human.

    He sits down on the grass beside her.

                                BRENNA
                             (after a moment)
                          What are we supposed to say?

    The cat's eyes are all fixed in Taupin.  They cautiously shrink
    away, frightened.

                                TAUPIN
                          The emptyness.  The years and years
                          of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only
                          by the quest for ultimate nothingness.
                          Who would have guessed?

                                BRENNA
                          The inheritance.

                                TAUPIN
                          Not power.  Not control.

    Taupin holds a blade of grass as if it was speaking to him.

                                TAUPIN
                          Life.  It is the gift and the under-
                          standing of life.

                                BRENNA
                          You have lived forever.

                                TAUPIN
                          Life is only life when it is bounded
                          by death.  The inheritance is death.
                          The gift is the finality of life.
                          To be part of the fabric.  The inside.
                              (turns to Brenna)
                          I love you Brenna.

    Brenna's chin quivers.

                                TAUPIN
                          It will be horrible.  The future.  I
                          may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows.
                          I can promise you nothing.  Nothing
                          but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment
                          of love, is that not worth a lifetime?

                                BRENNA
                               (crying)
                          Yes.

    He holds her.  They hold each other.

                                TAUPIN
                          It's taken me so long.  So very
                          long.

    A jogger runs by, unaware of any life but his own.

 HIGHLANDER IV WORLD WITHOUT END OVER BLACK, A VOICE: VOICE IN THE DAYS BEFORE MEMORY, THERE WERE THE IMMORTALS. WE WERE WITH YOU THEN, AND WE ARE WITH YOU NOW. SWEEP LOW through CLINGING HIGHLAND MISTS that shroud a land still in its infancy. Cathedral spires of granite. Cradled lakes. A solitary vastness. VOICE (cont'd) WE HAVE BEEN WORSHIPPED AS GODS MISTAKEN FOR DEMONS AND REVILED'AS WITCHES. WE ARE THE SEEDS OF A MILLION LEGENDS BUT OUR TRUE ORIGINS ARE UNKNOWN. WE SIMPLY ARE. ANCIENT CASTLES dot the landscape, whisper of battles long forgotton. VOICE (cont'd) WE ARE DRIVEN BY THE CEASELESS FIGHT TO ENDURE. NO LIMIT, IT IS A BATTLE THAT KNOWS NO BOUNDRY OF TIME OR PLACE. TWO FIGURES clash with broadswords atop the tallest promontory. VOICE (cont'd) TO THE WINNER COMES AN UNKNOWABLE PRIZE. YET AN IMMORTAL CAN FIND NO COMFORT IN VICTORY. MATCH MOVE to the top of an ULTRA-MODERN SKYSCRAPER. Swordsmen continue to battle. VOICE (cont'd) BECAUSE IN THE END, THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE. Loser falls to the other's sword as the HEAVENS CLEAVE in a TITANIC RUPTURE OF SIGHT AND SOUND. Like the birth of a brand new universe. BEGIN/END TITLES: EXT - MANHATTAN, PRESENT-DAY ESTABLISHING - DAWN Teeming millions. Yawning concrete spires. Blare of traffic. EXT - ANTIQUE STORE - DAWN Engraved into a brass plaque: MACLEOD & ELLENSTEIN ANTIQUES (FORMERLY RUSSELL NASH LTD) A FACE reflects in the window glass. It's RACHEL ELLENSTEIN, early 60's now, a graying, maternal beauty. She moves to the front door, reaches out to unlock i.t. It falls open at her touch. Even though the hanging placard is still flipped to "WERE CLOSED" Rachel hesitates. Draws a shallow breath and steps inside. INT - ANTIQUE STORE All those sublime European antiquities now drip with menace. Celtic harp. Scottish targe. Brooding statuary. She moves deeper into the shadowed recesses, flicks on a lamp. Her gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of things. An open wooden case, empty. Just the felt impression of a missing broadsword. RACHEL (icy dread) Connor...? She crosses to the foot of the staircase. Listens. A MUSIC BOX spools a faint, tinny madrigal. She climbs the stairs, padding softly upward. The music grinds EVER LOUDER in its maddening repetitions. Every so often, it's punctuated by a CHILD'S GIGGLE. AT THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING Rachel edges around the corner. Her breath catches in her throat. BEFORE HER stands a locked wooden cabinet. It's been cleaved nearly in half by the BROADSWORD that still juts hilt-first from the base of the splintered front panel. PHOTO ALBUMS and leather-bound DIARIES have been shredded and scattered across the floor-- --except for several selected PHOTOGRAPHS, skewered onto the sword tip like a Medieval message spike. Rachel struggles to breathe. Like she's taken that sword in her own gut. INSIDE THE CABINET A TELEVISION flickers with videotape of GRAINY HOME MOVIES. A LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL) is entranced by a PORCELAIN MUSIC BOX held out by an AGELESS CONNOR MACLEOD. YOUNG RACHEL Let me see, Connor! Let me see! Rachel stands frozen, watching her life with Connor flash by in RAGGED FILM CLIPS. CONNOR teaching RACHEL to ride a horse. CONNOR with RACHEL outside an English boarding school. In a train station. At her college graduation. CONNOR and RACHEL in a laughing embrace that only hints at something deeper. In each new clip, Rachel has aged further. Connor has not. Rachel steps up to the broadsword, wraps both hands around the grip and jerks it clean of the cabinet. THE SKEWERED PHOTOGRAPHS (flutterd to the floor like dead leaves) THE VIDEOTAPE ENDS, CLICKS OFF... and a NEW IMAGE burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital clarity. Rachel. Staring back at herself, terror-stricken. She hadn't even noticed it before now. The tiny CAMCORDER on the shelf above the TV with the glowing red light. MOVE IN ON THE TV as Rachel SLOWLY BACKS AWAY. Keep moving in on the TV until the PIXELS SWIM... THE PHONE RINGS shattering the stillness. The old rotary phone on the little Louis XIV stand. It's not just beckoning her. It's taunting her. Gathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast, Rachel slowly approaches the phone. Any second now, you'd expect it to stop ringing, nobody home. But whoever's on the other end knows better. It keeps right on RINGING. Insistant. Trembling fingers reach out for the receiver. Slowly lift it off the hook. RACHEL Hello? EXTREME CLOSE ON PHONE: A TINY ELECTRIC CLICK is the last thing Rachel hears before-- EXT - ANTIQUE STORE - WIDE --a BLISTERING EXPLOSION blows out the entire second floor. Rachel Ellenstein is obliterated right along with her own treasured history. Linger on the FLAMES as we TRANSITION TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS (1565) - DAY A MOUND OF BURNING CORPSES They crackle and twist in the fire that feeds off them. It takes a moment to realize they're LIVESTOCK-- oxen, pigs, goats, sheep-- piled like burning refuse. A CRUDE, WOVEN-STRAW HUMAN EFFIGY stands astride the pile, engulfed in flame. BEYOND THE FIRE Connor MacLeod and his young wife, HEATHER, watch from the steps of their simple, isolated home. Connor betrays no emotion. Heather looks on in horror. HEATHER My God, what are they? CONNOR Farm animals. Dead of the plague. HEATHER Why do they torment us with their dead cattle? (no response) Connor...? CONNOR They think I've brought this upon them. It's a warning. A deeper fear now grips Heather. HEATHER A warning?! They drove you from your home! They cut you off from your own people! What else could they want?! Connor turns away from the flaming heap. CONNOR Someone to blame. CUT TO: CONNOR swinging astride his horse. HEATHER (dread) Don't go back there. THUNDER RUMBLES in the distance. CONNOR I have no choice. HEATHER Please-- CONNOR They can't hurt me. And they know it. But they can still hurt the ones I care about. Heather looks off. Shivers. HEATHER I'm afraid. Connor leans forward, takes her face in his hands. CONNOR I love you, Heather. More than anything in this world. She grips his hands. Desperately. CONNOR (cont'd) Do you believe me? HEATHER Yes. CONNOR Then you needn't be afraid. (kisses her) Nothing can ever keep us apart. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, VARIOUS - DAWN Connor travels a primeval landscape of jagged peaks and fog-shrouded valleys. CONNOR'S VOICE Nothing... CUT TO: EXT - RIDGE ABOVE GLENFINNAN - TWILIGHT He gazes down at the tiny hamlet of Glenfinnan, nestled between castle and shimmering loch. Breathes deep the forgotten smell of home. INT - HUT - EVENING CAIOLIN MACLEOD, ravaged by neglect and despair, strokes her son's face as if confirming his reality. CAIOLIN I thought you might be the water horse come to take me on his back and drown me in the loch. CONNOR (smiles) Maybe I am, Mother. CAIOLIN (touches his hair) Then come, let me grab hold of your golden mane and off we go. Connor lifts her from the tattered bed, spins her around several giddy times and sits her upright in a chair. CONNOR Not before we put some meat on those bones. He rummages through her shelves looking for food. Finds painfully little. CONNOR (cont'd) No one comes to look after you? CAIOLIN They're all afraid of me. They think I bedevil their children because I've lost my own. CONNOR I'm sorry. I'm so sorry... CAIOLIN Tiny minds and sour dispositions. I don't need them, Connor. Any of them. Connor crouches at her feet. CONNOR Then it's settled. You're coming with me. There's somebody I want you to meet. She's nearly as beautiful as you. Caiolin blinks back her disbelief. CAIOLIN You're sure? CONNOR (cont'd) We leave tonight. Let's start packing. CAIOLIN (lifts up her shoes) I'm already packed. THE SLATTED WOODEN DOOR swings OPEN. A YOUNG MAN stands in the doorway. He's strong and severe, dressed in clergyman's black. But that's not what draws the eye. Even though it's cold enough to fog his breath-- he's sweatinq. Connor looks up, guarded. CONNOR Jacob-- KASE You shouldna come back, Connor. Connor feels the tension in Kase's voice. CONNOR Surely as a friend you can look the other way just this once... For old times' sake... KASE You knew. You knew what would happen if you came back. I am not to blame for this. CONNOR What? (beat) What have you done? KASE God help you. FATHER ALASDAIR RAINEY, the local priest and inquisitor, steps inside, bent over a silver cane. He's gross, corpulent and perpetually short of breath. A nasty NOSE BOIL figures prominently in his overall appearance. VILLAGERS of varying stripe crowd nervously behind them. FATHER RAINEY In the name of the Holy See and the rule of law, you are hereby charged, Connor MacLeod, with heresy and the practice of black magic. (turns to the villagers) Take him. The townsmen jostle in place, each trying to squeeze backward behind the other. FATHER RAINEY (cont'd) (squints) Heresy is not contagious. Two of the bolder men move forward, gripping Connor by the elbows. Once its clear they haven't sucked up any demons, the others SWARM HIM. EXT - STONE HUT - NIGHT Caiolin SCREAMS as Connor's dragged outside and driven to the ground by a relentless battery of sticks and clubs. CUT TO: INT - STONE CELL - NIGHT Connor stirs awake in a centuries-old dungeon, a dark hole, crumbling and damp. VOICES seem to drip through the porous mortar. Taunting, vengeful, expectant. He crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow, ground-level view of THE TOWN COMMONS where a well-attended EXECUTION is now underway. Connor squints, craning to make out the identity of the condemned. TOWNSPEOPLE mingle and mill in front of him, obstructing his line-of-sight. Even as A FAMILIAR VOICE rises above the surrounding chatter. JACOB KASE'S VOICE The curse that afflicts one generation will invariably pass its mark onto the next. The ties of blood cannot be severed by word or deed, if in fact your blood is that of your son. Several villagers STEP ASIDE to reveal: CONNOR'S MOTHER bound to an UPRIGHT STAKE atop a mound of shorn timber. CONNOR siezes with the impossible horror of recognition. CONNOR No.. . NO! ! JACOB KASE Makes the sign of the cross as he reads from a writ of execution. He stands atop a primeval CELTIC MONOLITH worn down to the form of a pedestal. Father Rainey wobbles behind him, sniffing ammonia to spell his chronic angina. KASE Through the infinite compassion of our Lord God, you are entitled one final opportunity to renounce all that is unholy, to declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins and help put an end to the darkness that has been cast upon this land. How say you, Caiolin MacLeod? Caiolin lifts her head, pale and beatific. CAIOLIN If your god should persecute me into the next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another. Shocked murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd. Kase steps up and RIPS AWAY Caiolin's cherished silver CRUCIFIX, with its distinctive wooden Christ figure. KASE (holding up Caiolin's crucifix) You won't need this where you're going. CONNOR grabs at the iron window-bars. Shakes them until the mortar chips from their moorings. THE RUDDY-FACED EXECUTIONER solemnly approaches Caiolin. Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd, he takes out a small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring. He tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest. EXECUTIONER (softly) Black powder. It will make short work of your suffering. Caiolin nods. He steps down off the pyre. Reaches for a BURNING TORCH. CONNOR strains against the bars like a madman. Mortar continues crumbling until one bar actually RIPS AWAY COMPLETELY. THE EXECUTIONER touches torch to kindling. It ALIGHTS. CONNOR tries to squeeze through the window gap. Too tight. So he winds back with the iron bar and swings with mindless fury. Iron strikes unyielding stone, SPARKING and CHIPPING... THE PYRE BENEATH CAIOLIN ENGULFS IN FLAME. Heat ripples her face, distorts her body. CONNOR hammers harder, quicker, louder. Bits of stone fly everywhere. But the bulk of it remains spitefully intact. Still, it's enough to convince ALL FOUR GUARDS to intervene. They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor with swords and axes. >Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace, Connor splits the first guard's head, catches his sword mid-air and slices into the next. Third guard's axe catches on a ceiling beam. Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack. The fourth guard drops his sword and BOLTS. THE PYRE is now fully ABLAZE. Caiolin looks out through the rippling wall of flame... . . . and smiles weakly. CAIOLIN My water horse... AS CONNOR splits the crowd like a battering ram. He reaches the pyre, hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands. Initially stunned, the townsfolk shrink back, watching Connor desperately scatter the fire. Caiolin buries her face in her shoulder, biting back the agony as... Sword in hand, Connor stretches upward, hacking away the ropes that bind her, oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs. Freed of the ropes, Caiolin begins to slump forward. Connor grabs for her arm as THE BLACK POWDER EXPLODES in a CONCUSSION of FIRE that renders any further hope of rescue futile. Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings. He throws back his head and HOWLS to the heavens. Fire dances across Connor's skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd. PANDEMONIUM breaks out. This isn't just a common witch. This is one of Hell's very own. Those few foolish enough to attack are cut down where they stand. The rest scatter in mindless PANIC. Father Rainey blocks Connor's path. Lifts his cross... . . . as he's CUT DOWN by the blind SLASH of Connor's sword. Connor steps over Rainey's body and keeps coming, driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings. Kase crouches blustering over Rainey. KASE Father... Father, please-- (tries to staunch the bleeding) Father--! Rainey's eyes open slightly. RAINEY Who are you...? KASE Your son. It's your son-- Jacob. Rainey stares back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted. And what he now sees terrifies him to death. RAINEY (eyes widen) Who are YOU? KASE I'm your-- He stops. Rainey's eyes are frozen. Dead. CONNOR returns to the flaming pyre, refueling his rage with the sight of his mother's blackened corpse. >KASE scoops up a discarded sword, leaps to his feet and CHARGES CONNOR, bellowing like a madman. >Connor whirls around with his sword, making Kase IMPALE HIMSELF on the blade. Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor's smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes. It's the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see. Connor opens his fingers and lets him DROP, the sword hilt still jutting from Kase's chest. Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber, Connor HEAVES them onto the straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly ABLAZE. In short order, the village is transformed into a giant swirling INFERNO. Silhouetted against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin's body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - ANCIENT STONE MONASTERY - NIGHT Standing outside the massive door is a MONK clad in dark, hooded monastic garb. Nothing in the panorama would suggest we've just jumped four centuries into an uncertain future... Until-- A PACK OF MOTORCYCLISTS chew their way up the rubbled slope. Fishtail to a stop. THE LEADER, a tall eclectically-dressed Jamaican, dismounts and approaches the hooded monk. JAMAICAN You people are extremely hard to find. Monk unshoulders a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN. HOODED MONK We like it that way. (pumps shotgun) Now go. The other six INTRUDERS surround the monk. His eyes flick from one to the next-- a buffet of different nationalities, all big. JAMAICAN Take your pick. Before you squeeze the trigger a second time, you'll be dead. Easy choice. Monk levels his gun and BLOWS the Jamaican right off his feet. And sure enough, he GAGS before his next trigger-pull. A very nasty SERRATED BLADE retracts into a wooden hilt. Monk drops in a heap as his assailant, a WIRY ASIAN, turns for the door, joined by the others. IN THE VERY NEXT INSTANT the heavy oak-and-iron door SWINGS OPEN with a BARRAGE of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE-- The intruders are CUT DOWN where they stand. THREE MORE HOODED MONKS appear in the doorway, wielding ASSAULT RIFLES. They grimly regard the bodies. MONK #1 Take the heads. Just in case. Saws and cleavers are pulled by the other two guards while Guard #l keeps his gun trained on the corpses. VOICE Don't bother. Really. A FIGURE stands in shadow, his face UNSEEN. We catch only a brief glimpse of a PRIESTS COLLAR. Guard #l whips his rifle toward the Stranger. Stranger diverts it with the tip of his sword. Bullets go nowhere. One slash and the guard is gone. Two more slashes and his comrades fall. Stranger kicks the body of the dead Jamaican as he steps through the open doorway. STRANGER Dont be long. INT - MONASTERY - NIGHT FOLLOW THE STRANGER through a maze of chambers and DOWN into serpentine catacombs. He KICKS THROUGH a DOOR into AN INNER ROOM cavernous and dripping, where even the air seems septic. A few dim candles illuminate A DOZEN MEN bound to complicated, almost Giger-esque chairs. Arms, legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing flats of metal BOLTED into flesh and wood. From the wild overgrowth of hair and beard, and the impossibly long, curled fingernails, it's a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years. Except for a pale CUSTODIAN standing in a corner, trembling silently. Stranger stands at the threshold, his face obscured by flickering shadows. He scans the living corpses. STRANGER So it's true. He moves slowly among them. STRANGER (cont'd) What sacrifices they made of you all. Warehoused, like rotting pieces of meat. He pauses to lift up a downcast head. Gazes into the shackled face. The eyes are covered by strips of rusted iron, the face by tangled beard. STRANGER (cont'd) Tell me-- is this the better way? I'm sure you've had some time to reflect on it. One by one, THE RECENTLY-DEAD INTRUDERS filter into the room, led by the Jamaican. Blood stipples their clothes, streaks their faces. But they are, in every other sense, fully-restored. Stranger straightens, swivels around to the terrified Custodian. Custodian backpeddles into the wall. STRANGER Which one is Connor MacLeod? CUSTODIAN I-- I don't know... They never told me names... STRANGER (low, seething) Don't. Lie. To. Me. CUSTODIAN I swear. I don't know... Stranger grabs him under the chin, lifts him to his toes. STRANGER You need to understand one thing, my gimpy friend. I don't care about the Game. I don't care about the rules. I don't even care about these other pathetic souls you lock away as a barrier to the Prize. The Custodian stares back, uncomprehending. STRANGER (cont'd) (squeezes his throat) I want Connor MacLeod. Give me MacLeod and I'll leave. And you can go right on pretending that what you do here actually matters. The custodian lifts a shaking finger. RACK FOCUS TO: THE PRISONER IN THE LAST CHAIR Even with an iron slat across his eyes, he is unmistakably Connor MacLeod. Stranger lets go of the custodian, turns... STRANGER Long time. Connor strains to lift his head. His voice comes weak and drug-heavy. CONNOR Who are you...? STRANGER You'll know soon enough. GLINT OF A SWUNG BLADE-- CUT TO: EXT - MONASTERY - NIGHT An unearthly LIGHT pulses through slitted windows and cracked mortar. TENDRILS of RAW ENERGY vein the ancient building, growing BRIGHTER until-- THE WINDOWS EXPLODE OUTWARD with a keening, animal-like HOWL. ABOVE the sky responds with SCREAMING WIND and TORRENTS of RAIN. CUT TO: EXT - PARIS - NIGHT WIND HOWLS over the City of Lights, slicing up the Seine to. . . DUNCAN MACLEOD'S BARGE docked at the quay. EXT - BARGE - NIGHT PUSH IN on DUNCAN MACLEOD, cross-legged in meditation atop the deck. He JOLTS from a series of SUDDEN VIOLENT IMAGES. A FACE, bolted immobile, wrenched in agony. A SWORDBLADE slashing into flesh. FINGERNAILS clawing wood. BLOOD flecking tile. ESSENCE. PHONE. Ringing. Duncan snaps up the receiver, sweat drenched. DUNCAN Yeah? Tiny electric CLICK... . . . then the HISS of an overseas line. WOMAN'S VOICE (filtered) He's dead. DUNCAN Who? CUT TO: A PAYPHONE, SOMEWHERE IN LOWER MANHATTAN In a driving RAIN. A woman's hand holds the receiver to her face, obscuring her features. WOMAN Connor MacLeod. He was killed last night. INT - DUNCAN'S BARGE Duncan reels with a sudden flood of emotions. DUNCAN Who is this?! WOMAN'S VOICE A friend. EXT - PAYPHONE The unidentified woman slowly lowers the receiver and sets it back in the cradle. CUT TO: EXT - PARIS, ESTABLISHING, SUNRISE Shadows crawl across the Parisian skyline as an ENGINE REVS TO 8000 RPM. STREET LEVEL POV: We PUNCH through the ARC DE TRIOMPHE and up the CHAMPS ELYSEE with a throaty FERARRI HOWL. On a WICKED DOWNSHIFT, we SQUEAL HARD RIGHT onto the PONT NEUF, stopping on a franc at EXT - NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY Duncan hops out of his Ferrari 355 Spyder, pauses before the massive Gothic edifice, then disappears inside. CLOSE ON A CROUCHING STONE GARGOYLE perched atop the highest balustrade. MOVE SIDEWAYS TO REVEAL A SECOND CROUCHING FIGURE, this one human. To many he'll be instantly familiar. Hes METHOS, oldest of all Immortals, gazing down in quiet contemplation. Methos keeps staring at the ground below, sipping bordeaux from a paper cup, even as Duncan joins him at the edge. DUNCAN Methos. METHOS so-- What brings you up here to the aerie of the lesser gods? DUNCAN I need your help. METHOS I'm out of the help business. No future in it. DUNCAN I was told Connor MacLeod was killed last night. Methos' darkens. Another one lost. DUNCAN (cont'd) I just want to know who did it. METHOS (sighs) In our world, does it really matter? DUNCAN It does to me. Methos looks down at the clotted life below. METHOS Did I ever tell you I once kept a vineyard on the very spot where they built this monstrosity? Glorious, the wine. (looks up) When did you see him last? DUNCAN Almost ten years ago. METHOS What did you talk about? DUNCAN Nothing much. METHOS Think back. FLASH TO: INT - PUB (FROM HIGHLANDER 1) - DAY Connor and Duncan hunch over the bar, pounding scotch. DUNCAN We mostly just sat around, downing shots, staring at the beer lights above the bar. When he finally got up to go, he looked at me like it was the last time I'd ever see him again. No goodbye. No handshake. Just got up and left. BACK TO SCENE: Duncan blinks back the memory. DUNCAN (cont'd) Nobody's seen him since. METHOS Describe the look. DUNCAN What do you mean? METHOS Describe it. DUNCAN It was like... FLASH: CONNOR'S FACE DUNCAN (cont'd) . . . Like every death he'd ever caused had come back to haunt him. BACK TO SCENE: Methos takes a thoughtful sip from his wine. METHOS For an Immortal who comes to abhor bloodshed, there's a solution-- a way to be removed from the Game forever. The price is unimaginably high, but you are, for all practical purposes, protected from the violence within yourself. It's called The Sanctuary. DUNCAN I don't understand. METHOS Think of those Buddhist monks who came to cherish life so much that to step on a single insect, to harm a blade of grass was a violation of their creed. They placed themselves into an extreme form of protective custody. A sanctuary of sorts. (beat) What I'm talking about is something similar. But one that doesn't allow for a change of heart. He opens his fingers and watches his cup plummet to the plaza below. Wine SPLATTERS like blood on white marble. METHOS (cont'd) Apparently it was wiped out last night. DUNCAN By who? METHOS I don't know. EXT - ABOVE THE ATLANTIC - DAY A 747 cruises at 40,000 feet. METHOS (O.S.) He left no witnesses. INT - 747 - DAY Duncan stares out the passenger window as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT sets a DRINK down. He lifts the little plastic COCKTAIL SWORD from the glass. Yanks it out of the olive... TRANSITION TO: A BROADSWORD being jerked from a fallen warrior. EXT - 17TH CENTURY BATTLEFIELD - DAWN FOLLOW THE SWORD swinging above a PAIR OF HIDE-BOOTED FEET that tramp across uneven ground littered with CORPSES. FEET STOP at a BLOOD-CAKED BODY, swathed in the shredded colors of a defeated army. On a SWIFT KICK TO THE RIBCAGE-- DUNCAN MACLEOD JERKS UPRIGHT, flailing in spastic fits. DUNCAN GAHHHHHHH! ! He blinks thickly, as if routed from a deep, disorienting slumber. Gapes up at-- A SILHOUETTE that ECLIPSES the rising sun. SILHOUETTE You've better things to do than lie there collecting flies. Duncan puts a hand to his chest, touches the worst of his several lethal wounds. Utter confusion stitches his face. SILHOUETTE (cont'd) I suppose you're wondering how a knock- kneed swordsman with your obvious lack of skill keeps living to fight another day. The figure extends a hand to Duncan. Duncan hesitantly reaches up... DUNCAN (squints) Are you an angel? SILHOUETTE I've been called that. And worse. Duncans hand RECOILS-- SILHOUETTE (cont'd) Rest assured, I'm neither. He hoists Duncan to his feet. Duncan gazes for the first time ever upon the face of CONNOR MACLEOD who smiles back with the gift of untold secrets. CONNOR I'm Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod. And like you, I have a hard time dying. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - 747 - DAY Duncan's now sitting upright in his seat as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE brings him back to the here and now. FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.) We'll be making our final descent into New York... WHEELS SMACK down onto the runway at JFK. CUT TO: A PHOTOGRAPH OF DUNCAN PULL BACK and see it's his passport, held by a US CUSTOMS OFFICER. He lowers the passport and turns to the long metal case Duncan's brought with him from the plane. CUSTOMS OFFICER Would you open the case, please? Duncan hands the Officer documentation as he sets it on the counter and opens it. Inside is an old, meticulously cared-for Japanese KATANA SWORD. Customs Officer studies Duncan's paperwork, smiles. CUSTOMS OFFICER (cont'd) Get much use for this? DUNCAN You'd be surprised. Duncan shuts the case and continues on. Next MAN in line watches Duncan exit as he hands over his passport. Hang on the PHOTO. We'll remember those steel- gray eyes. INT - CAB, DRIVING - DAY Duncan watches the passing scenery. MUSIC and LANDMARKS familiar from the first "Highlander" sweep past. EXT - NEW YORK SIDE-STREET - DAY Cab WIPES FRAME, leaving Duncan standing before the charred husk of Connor's antique store. Windows boarded, shreds of flapping police tape, the investigators have long since come and gone. INT - ANTIQUE STORE Door SPLINTERS OPEN. Duncan steps inside. In the aftermath of the firebombing, nothing has been spared. Rachel and Connor's richly-cultivated collection has been reduced to a bitter moonscape. One can only shudder at the degree of overkill that went into this attack. Duncan climbs the back stairs to THE SECOND FLOOR LOFT which is even worse. Ash and cinder are virtually all that remain of Connor's home. Pausing at the far wall, Duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry, revealing AN INNER DOOR deliberately hidden from view. He dips down, retrieves a key from under a loose floorboard and opens the heavily- reinforced door. ENTERING he finds himself in a LARGE CIRCULAR ROOM surrounded by a staggering display of ARTIFACTS drawn from centuries of personal history. We're looking at the sum total of Connor MacLeod's existance, stacked floor to ceiling. Duncan moves among the mementos, smiles as he lifts them; an old Scottish coin, pocket flask... a faded PHOTO of himself in a World War I uniform. He pauses at a painting of Connor's wife HEATHER, radiant in simple peasant garb, smiling serenely across the ages. Finally, a tarnished epee that he wields with instant familiarity. TRANSITION TO: INT - FENCING ACADEMY, RAVENNA ITALY (1627) - DAY Duncan's LUNGE misses Connor by a mile. He stumbles upright in a grand hall streaked by SUNLIGHT from floor- to-ceiling windows. Duncan and Connor face off with duelling swords, sporting black waistcoak andd knee breeches in the manner of the times. Several other elegant FENCING PAIRS spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport, a far cry from the corpse-littered battlefield seen earlier. A little mustachioed PUFFER darts between the duellists with lint brush, pail and towel as Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid series of strikes and parries. CONNOR You've improved greatly. DUNCAN You really think so? Connor executes a simple combination that sends'Duncan's sword flying one way, his body the other. CONNOR No. I'm just being gracious. Duncan recovers, sets his feet. Puffer skitters over, brushes the dust off Duncan's coat, dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair. Duncan swats him away. They take en-garde position. Connor points his blade. CONNOR (cont'd) Remember, you're only immortal as long as your head remains attached to those shoulders. Duncan lunges again. Misses and hits the deck. CONNOR (cont'd) Which in your case might not be long at all. He puts his blade to Duncan's neck. Humor evaporates. CONNOR (cont'd) What we give up to our adversary in defeat, Duncan... is evervthinq. Duncan stares up at him, uncomprehending. CONNOR (cont'd) We call it "The Quickening"-- our strength, our knowledge, our life essence-- it all flows into the victor, feeds him, makes him stronger, in ways you can't possibly comprehend. It's what drives other Immortals to kill us. And what forces us to be better-- smarter-- than the rest. He takes Duncan by the arm, jerks him to his feet. CONNOR (cont'd) Survival. Learn it. Duncan goes on the attack. What he lacks in technique, he makes up for in determination. Almost. Connor sidesteps Duncan's next lunge, swats his blade flat across Duncan's ass and sends him plowing face-first into the floor. Duncan re-engages Connor in fighting stance. Puffer races up behind Duncan again, meticulously dusts his backside. Reaches around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger. DUNCAN (whirls around) You mind?! Connor clucks his tongue. CONNOR (cont'd) Allow me. He squares Duncans shoulders and steps back. Considers. CONNOR (cont'd) Unh uh. He steps up and swivels Duncan around until hes facing the opposite way. CONNOR (cont'd) If you should ever again find yourself backside to a blade... just keep this in mind. He proceeds to take Duncan through a move that's dazzling in it's inherent simplicity-- a move that winds up with Duncan's blade whisking perilously close across Connor's throat. CONNOR (cont'd) It's a coup de fin. He catches Duncan's sword-fist in his own, holds it immobile. CONNOR (cont'd) Properly executed, even you cannot prevent your blade from finding its mark. DUNCAN Properly executed, we'll never have this talk again. Duncan and Connor's eyes lock. They break. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - CIRCULAR ROOM Duncan suddenly SIEZES UP with a strange disquiet and ringing in the ears known as THE BUZZ. It's the sense of another Immortal. He swings around, reaches for his katana and steps back through the door, swinging it closed as A YOUNG WOMAN appears at the top of the stairs. She saunters toward him, glancing around. She takes her time checking out the place before stepping up to Duncan. The ragged crop of her hair and the slashing trowel application of makeup impart a kind of crazed anti- beauty. Like a post-nuclear Barbi doll. Duncan regards her, intrigued and wary. DUNCAN Who are you? YOUNG WOMAN A friend. Those two words instantly recall the mystery voice on the phone. YOUNG WOMAN (cont'd) Or lover. Or wife. Take your pick. Memory jogs with a sudden lurch. DUNCAN Kate? YOUNG WOMAN Atta boy. 'cept I'm "Faith" now. Part of the makeover. Like it? She runs a playful finger across his chest. FAITH Funny how 'the time slips by, huh? You wake up one day and ohmigod-- Airplanes! DUNCAN Why're you here? FAITH Remember our wedding day, Duncan? I do. She takes him by the hands and leads him into an impromptu dance. FAITH (cont'd) We danced the "Highland Fling." She spins under his arm, circles back into his embrace. FAITH (cont'd) I felt like we were flying. Her sinuous body moves in perfect sync with his. FAITH (cont'd) And that we'd never come down. She spins out of his arms again-- --and SPIN KICKS him across the FACE. BLOOD spatters from his nose and mouth. FAITH (cont'd) Of course, we did come down. Didn't we? (kicks him again) Crashinq. Duncan staggers backward into a concrete stanchion. Recovers. They stand facing each other across a gulf centuries wide. DUNCAN (spitting blood) Why are you here? FAITH Isn't it obvious? I wanted to see you again. Duncan tenses at-- THE ROAR OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES. His eyes track the SOUND. It's directly BELOW him. EXT - STREET OUTSIDE ANTIQUE STORE THREE MOTORCYCLES hop the curb, SLICE through the open door to the antique store... INT - ANTIQUE STORE . . . and SPIRAL up the BACK STAIRS. INT - LOFT Duncan's eyes flick upward to a NEW SOUND, directly above him as-- EXT - ROOF - DAY A FOURTH BIKE VAULTS the NARROW GAP between buildings and LANDS. Knobby tires SLAM onto the rooftop, squirrelling wild across the tarred surface before shuddering to a stop. A jackbooted heel digs in and grinds to a stop. Biker suddenly BACKWHEELS around, BLASTS through the ROOF ACCESS DOOR and disappears inside. TWO MORE BIKERS follow suit, SLAMMING DOWN onto the roof like alien invaders. INT - LOFT Duncan reacts. But it's not just the full-throttle howl of approaching bikes. It's the BUZZ of approaching IMMORTALS. THE BIKERS now crest the stairs and fan out into the loft-- Same group we saw outside the monastery. Tricked out in everything from Keds to chainmail, they drag a variety of weapons in their trailing hands-- sword, baseball bat, mace, dao and chain-whip. The tips make a scraping noise across the floor that's deliberately unsettling. They surround Duncan, cutting off any avenue of escape. Nobody moves or speaks. Just the low staccato growl of idling two-stroke engines. Duncan takes a step backward. Looks to Faith. DUNCAN Who're they? FAITH More friends. PAN THE FACES. CARLOS from Bed-Stuy, BUG from Kyoto, WINSTON from Jamaica, SARGE from Shreveport and CRACKER BOB from nowhere in particular. And then there's CALVIN. A swaggering Immortal from the he's traded brute force in on a brand new weapon of choice. A DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA. CALVIN Make it pretty now. It's the bottom of the ninth. BIKERS DISMOUNT and CONVERGE on Duncan, swinging their weapons to limber up. Duncan backs away. This is unheard of-- Immortals packing like jackals. DUNCAN What-- it's a team sport now? CALVIN (zooming in) Whole new ballgame. THREE IMMORTALS ATTACK. They're good. Duncan's better. About three times better. CALVIN jockeys his camcorder-- GOES IN TIGHT on Duncan. CALVIN Sup with the new blood, huh? Who's gonna lay him out? Take his secret sauce? (swivels around) YOU, Winston? WINSTON, the tall Jamaican, stands off to one side watching, the lone holdout. CALVIN (cont'd) Nope. Too proud. Old school. INTERCUT - VIDEO VIEWFINDER Image lurches and jostles as Calvin mixes it up with the combatants. CALVIN (O.S.) How 'bout you, Carlos? You good for it? Carlos--? CARLOS HURTLES THROUGH FRAME. Lands hard. CALVIN (O.S.) I'll catch you later. SWISH PAN TO: SWORD sparking off chainmail. HANDS AND FEET pounding flesh. BODIES slamming into walls. BLOOD. MAYHEM. PAIN. And Calvin, catching it all, up close and personal. CALVIN (cont'd) Sarge is down. Cracker Bob's down. But Carlos got some kick. Still got some kick. Carlos crawls to his feet, oozing blood and spite. CALVIN (cont'd) Like the man says, you gotta play with the small hurts. Carlos LUNGES-- Duncan lays him out flat again, then swivels around to face-- BUG who straightens up to his full five-foot frame. CALVIN (cont'd) Say hello to my man BUG and his ugly- stick. Bug brandishes a simple metal ROD with a woven grip. Nothing much to speak of... Until he squeezes the grip-- --and SIX BLADES EJECT SIMULTANEOUSLY. The two on each end are SWORD BLADES, one for piercing, one for slashing. Jutting perpendicular to the shaft, like an insane Swiss Army knife, are twin sets of DAGGERS-- two for stabbing and two sawtoothed SWORDBREAKERS. And then there's the shaft itself, if you're in need of a good old-fashioned battering ram. CALVIN (cont'd) Like it? Came from a Tamaric swordsmith. (grins) Who smoked a lotta very wicked stuff. Bug opens up a multi-pronged BARRAGE on Duncan. Duncan adapts to the first assault-- only to find himself reacting to an entirely new set of insane moves. CALVIN (cont'd) Uhp--- Say welcome back to Carlos... Carlos cuts in yet again, swinging for the stands. He fans several times before Duncan backfists him across the nose and dumps him back onto the floor. Duncan spins back to Bug as the wiry Asian lifts his lethal metal rod again and grins. But this time as he SQUEEZES the release mechanism-- --Duncan KICKS IT, shoving it flush against Bug's chest. SNICK SNICK two PIVOTING DAGGERS slice into the dumbstruck Immortal. He falls backward WAILING like a stuck pig. A BOOMING VOICE freezes everyone in their tracks. VOICE That's enough. All eyes converge on: THE STRANGER who stands at a distance, cloaked in murky halflight. STRANGER I'm sorry, Duncan. When it comes to discipline, the first hundred years are the hardest. Duncan lowers his katana, turns to the Stranger as-- CARLOS painfully hauls himself upright and suddenly BULLDOZES Duncan clear through one of the immense loft windows. Duncan's launched AIRBORNE in a plume of shattered glass, still clutching his katana. Carlos hooks an arm around the empty window-frame and watches with unvarnished satisfaction as the body SPIKES onto an upright iron ROD jutting from the construction site below. STRANGER What was that? CARLOS (squinting) Full gainer with a quarter twist. Degree of difficulty-- not very. STRANGER I thought I told you to stop. CARLOS Yeah, well. I stopped. STRANGER (cont'd) Are you challenging my authority? Carlos does his best to ignore him. STRANGER (cont'd) Because the only way to challenge my authority is to kill me. CARLOS (turns away) Hey hey, take it easy, man. STRANGER (cont'd) Is that clear? In the split second it takes Carlos to turn back from the window, the Stranger is right there in his face. CARLOS Shit! STRANGER IS THAT CLEAR? Stranger takes Carlos' sword and yanks it uo to his own neck -. STRANGER (cont'd) Here's your chance. Carlos stares wide-eyed. Pride won't let him back down. Fear won't let him proceed. STRANGER (cont'd) Take it. You won't have another. We can FEEL the SUDDEN HAMMERING of Carlos' HEART. CARLOS You're crazy, man! STRANGER Am I? Then go ahead... (rubs his neck across the blade) Stop the madness. CARLOS Hey-- STRANGER Or walk away... in perpetual fear of your own shadow. (beat) Tell me, Carlos. Can you live with that? Can you live with the fear? Can you live with the weakness? THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-- STRANGER (cont'd) Weakness, Carlos. Isn't that why you're here with me? Isn't that why youre ALL here with me?! Face it, you're nothing but. . . (savoring) . . . cattle. Blood POUNDS in Carlos' eyes. He YANKS back the sword, CRIES OUT and SLASHES for the Stranger's neck. CLOSE ON STRANGER'S HAND as it catches his wrist and diverts the blade around to Carlos' own throat, wedging it up tight under his chin. STRANGER (cont'd) God loves you. I don't. In one vicious UP-SLICE, Stranger cuts through bone and sinew, stopping just short of a clean sever. Carlos gags and gurgles in liquid protest. STRANGER (cont'd) (whispers) They say the worst part, Carlos, is those last few seconds when you find yourself staring at your own headless body. SNICK-- He sends Carlos' head tumbling to the floor. STRANGER (cont'd) Of course it's pure speculation, since nobody ever lives to tell about it. HOLD ON CARLOS' EYES staring in pure, unknowable horror at his own body, twitching several yards away. A tiny ARC of electrical ESSENCE crackles from the neck... THE OTHERS bear mute witness to the GLOWING TENDRILS of ENERGY that stutter across the walls and ceiling. EXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW Duncan lies IMPALED on a JUTTING SHAFT OF RE-BAR as an UNMARKED PANEL VAN screeches INTO FRAME. His eyes stare sightless upward as THE LOFT WINDOWS EXPLODE with unearthly HOWLS of stretching metal and pulverizing concrete. SHOCKWAVES strafe the walls, blowing out mortar and brick. POWER LINES SNAP and LASH against the building, spitting fiery plumes of SPARKS. INT - LOFT Seen from behind, the Stranger absorbs the QUICKENING in a series of wild electro-shock convulsions. EXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW Several darkly-clad MEN jump from the panel van and race up to Duncan. With pit crew efficiency, one takes a mondo set of BOLT CUTTERS to the metal stake while the others grab Duncan by the arms and ankles. A fourth throws open the cargo door. Snap-lift... they TOSS Duncan in the back of the van. INT - LOFT, SAME Arms outstretched and rigid, head thrown back in silent rapture, the Stranger RISES slowly off the floor, suspended Christ-like in the air. BLINDING HALOES of PURE RADIANT ESSENCE engulf him, a lifeforce beyond human understanding. THE OTHERS watch transfixed. They've seen it all before, but it never ceases to amaze and terrify them. CUT TO: DARKNESS Which becomes a harsh blast of LIGHT. DUNCAN'S EYES flutter open, squint at the glare. He's strapped to the same Giger-like chair, immobilized. Standing around him are hooded members of that same monk-like order in what is, essentially, a dungeon. One of them, MATTHEW, steps forward. His steel-gray eyes are familiar. He's the one who followed Duncan through customs. As he reaches to cinch closed one of the iron cuffs with a thick metal dowel, he reveals a distinctive TATTOO across his inner forearm. One that Duncan instantly recognizes. _ DUNCAN Watchers? Matthew simply nods. DUNCAN Watchers observe. They don't interfere. MATTHEW True. And we were more than happy to perform our traditional function. Believe me, it's a whole lot easier charting the history of Immortals than it is running a day care center for them. Unfortunately our role has changed somewhat. DUNCAN Why? MATTHEW Because the rules have been broken. DUNCAN Not by me. MATTHEW You're not the one we're worried about. Matthew moves to the other side of the chair. Pegs the arm cuff and ratchets down a redundant set of bindings. MATTHEW (cont'd) One of your kind has gone renegade. In doing so he's gained himself a sizeable advantage. One that will be impossible to overcome. DUNCAN Nobody's unbeatable. MATTHEW He's surrounded himself with Immortals loyal only to him. He uses holy ground as a safe haven. And every head taken in battle is reserved for him alone, each Quickening-- hundreds upon hundreds-- taken by just one man. Yes, Duncan. He is unbeatable. Matthew pours a Scotch. Glenmorangie. Holds it to Duncan's lips like the final offering to a condemned man. MATTHEW (cont'd) Worse still, far worse, is that he's become a perversion to the Game. And if he prevails, that perversion will resonate through everything we know. For eternity. In ways we can't possibly comprehend. Duncan tugs at his bonds. Knows what's in store for him. MATTHEW (cont'd) There must always be two of your kind. As long as there are two, and they're kept from fighting, the Prize is safe. The Sanctuary must continue. DUNCAN Get yourself another volunteer. MATTHEW We had a number of "volunteers." Sadly, that's no longer the case. Another WATCHER steps up and forces an IRON FACE SHACKLE down over Duncan's head. MATTHEW (cont'd) You'll be warehoused. Hidden away. So the Prize can remain safe. Duncan struggles frantically against his bonds. DUNCAN You're insane! MATTHEW For the world, Duncan. We do this for the world... The Watcher takes two large BOLTS and begins to screw the mask directly into Duncan's skull. DUNCAN'S POV: BLACKNESS, accompanied by BRIGHT SEARING FLASHES of AGONY. MATTHEW'S VOICE (cont'd) Don't worry. The drugs should kick in momentarily. All external SOUND is slowly DROWNED OUT by the POUNDING IN HIS OWN BRAIN. A POUNDING interspersed with jarring, synaptic flashes of BATTLE. Killing. Dying. Killing again. Dying again. The recycling nightmare finally RECEDES back into NOTHINGNESS. Then, a NEW SOUND. Distant. Grind of metal on bone. Bolts being unscrewed. Iron plate lifts from his eyes, flood of LIGHT. Once again, Duncan SQUINTS up at a FACE. This time, the blurred, swimming features of a familiar Irish-American mug. DUNCAN (WOOZY) Dawson... JOE DAWSON, familiar to many as Duncan's one friend inside the Watchers, smiles back. DAWSON You look like shit. DUNCAN How... long...? DAWSON Week, maybe longer. We can't talk here. (unstraps Duncan) We gotta go. Dawson reacts to the sound of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. DAWSON (cont'd) (urgently) Now. Can you walk? DUNCAN Think so. He takes one step and pitches forward onto his face. DUNCAN (cont'd) Potent whiskey. He clambers to his feet and follows Dawson out of the chamber. EXT - ARMORY - NIGHT Dawson and Duncan emerge from a nondescript cinderblock armory, an overgrown Cold War relic recently co-opted by the Watchers. They duck some scurrying guards, plow through thick underbrush to A HIDDEN CAR and climb inside. INT - CAR, TRAVELLING - NIGHT DUNCAN You knew about The Sanctuary. DAWSON Just because I'm a Watcher, doesn't mean I'm always in the loop. DUNCAN I don't buy that. Dawson averts his gaze. Stares ahead. DAWSON I really struggled with it, y'know, the idea of keeping guys on ice like that. But I couldn't argue with the logic. Least not 'til they went after you. (squeals hard onto the main drag) Guess that put it a little too close to home. DUNCAN I owe you. Dawson slides Duncan's katana out from under the seat. Hands it over. DAWSON Do me a favor, buddy. Live to pay me back. DUNCAN What happened to the bodies? Dawson winces slightly. Keeps driving. DUNCAN (cont'd) C'mon, Joe. DAWSON Listen-- I got you outta one jam. Don't push your luck. DUNCAN I need to see them. DAWSON They're dead. Trust me. DUNCAN Was one of them Connor MacLeod? DAWSON Yes. DUNCAN Let me see the bodies. DAWSON The heads are gone. You really don't wanna go there. DUNCAN I have to, Joe. I have to know. Dawson jerks the car to a sudden shuddering stop. DAWSON Alright... Alright-- If I tell you, that's it, I'm outta here! You're on your own! I can't be a part of this, OK?! DUNCAN OK. DAWSON OK. Dawson stares at Duncan. A beat, then: DAWSON Fuck. I'm a part of it. He throws the car back into gear and fishtails back onto the road. CUT TO: A VIEW THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of a forlorn and forgotten CEMETERY. Nothing marks its perimeter but a toppled gate and some trampled barbed wire. DAWSON It was a Christian burial. Decent. They said all the right words. DUNCAN I can't begin to tell you how reassuring that is. Pull over. WIDE Dawson pulls over. He and Duncan get out of the car. DAWSON Needless to say, with a dozen unexplainable corpses, they had to go a bit off the beaten track. EXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET From here it looks like just a barren hillside littered with broken and crumbling marble. CLOSER Duncan and Dawson tramp up the shallow incline. DAWSON (cont'd) What do you think you're gonna find when you get up there? DUNCAN I don't know. DAWSON I'm not digging. Get that through your skull right now. Not these hands... CRESTING THE RIDGE Twelve freshly-mounded graves come into view, gouged into the rubbled downslope like wounds, each set off by a simple wooden cross. Duncan stops when he reaches the first grave. Stiffens. DAWSON What? Duncan remains frozen, staring, seemingly at nothing. DAWSON (cont'd) My dog used to do that with locked closets. I hate that. DUNCAN Shh. Dawson listens. Nothing but the soft moan of WIND. DUNCAN (cont'd) He's here. DAWSON Tell me I'm not here for a seance. Duncan squints. Feels the BUZZ. Slight, but unmistakable. WHAT HE SEES: A row of stunted oaks, thick and gnarled againt the setting sun. CLOSER. . . Standing against the trunk, silhouette on silhouette, is the ghostly form of a MAN. Barely discernible, his features are hidden in shadow. Duncan slowly approaches the figure. Dawson hangs back, nervous and slightly twitchy. CLOSER STILL... The figure steps up to greet Duncan. Sunlight brightens the face of CONNOR MACLEOD who smiles as he embraces Duncan in the traditional bear- crush of Scottish clansmen. DUNCAN Sorry I missed your funeral. CONNOR All told, it was a bit underwhelming. DUNCAN So it would seem. They break. The brief joy suddenly drains from Connor's face-- his eyes speak of diffuse, faraway suffering. CONNOR Why are you here? DUNCAN Ten years ago you skipped out on a bartab. Connor's expression hardens. CONNOR You need to know something... He steps up to Duncan, locks eyes. CONNOR (cont'd) Every life I touch ends. Brutally. And for no reason. It's a curse that's followed me for centuries. I can't outrun it and I can't outlive it. (beat) You're my last friend in this world, Duncan. I left for your own good. It was better that you didn't know where. DUNCAN The Sanctuary. CONNOR Yes. The Sanctuary. DUNCAN But you escaped. CONNOR No, I didn't escape... FLASH BACK TO THE SANCTUARY as the STRANGER moves toward a shackled Connor MacLeod. CONNOR (V.O.) ...I was freed. As before, the immobilized Connor stirs in a drug-addled haze. CONNOR Who are you? STRANGER You'll know soon enough. CONNOR'S POV - THROUGH THE BOTTOM EDGE OF HIS FACEPLATE All Connor can see is the Stranger's HAND as it reaches down and PULLS THE PIN from one of Connor's arm shackles. The cuff FALLS OPEN. Stranger turns away. A beat later come the unmistakable SOUNDS of SLAUGHTER that fill the room to a DEAFENING CRESCENDO. CONNOR (V.O.) I couldn't see the slaughter. I only heard it. BACK TO CEMETERY: We can still see the agony playing out in Connor's eyes. He turns away, sees JOE DAWSON still standing on the ridge, swatting at the occasional deerfly. CONNOR Who's he? DUNCAN The reason I didn't become your replacement. Dawson casually removes one of his legs and vigorously shakes it upside down. CONNOR What's he doing now? DUNCAN Sand in the shoe would be my guess. Connor suddenly gazes beyond Dawson to THE NEXT HILLSIDE and the FAINT SOUND OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES. He stiffens. CONNOR You were followed. One by one, a HALF-DOZEN MOTORCYCLISTS crest the surrounding hills and come to a menacing stop. DUNCAN Yeah. I was meaning to tell you about those guys. Dawson fumbles to put his leg back on. Hops a full 360 as he watches the intruders surround them. TWO MORE approach on foot, following the same path Duncan and Dawson took. One is Faith. The other, The Stranger. Except he's no stranger to Connor MacLeod. Far from it. Connor goes rigid. Breathing stops. His nightmare's finally taken human form. MOVE IN for our first clear look at JACOB KASE striding forward, bigger than death. His is a face hewn by Gods sharpest blade, every angle cold, remorseless, Puritannical. As before, he's clad in basic black, accented by the stark white of a priest's collar. CONNOR (ice) Jacob Kase... Connor edges back his coat. Hand seeks out the grip of his sword. Duncan grabs his arm. DUNCAN Not here. CONNOR Walk away, Duncan. Kase and Faith continue toward them. Connor's rage seems to ratchet up with every step. DUNCAN You're on holy ground. Remember the rules... Pure, radiating hate seethes in Connor's eyes. CONNOR The rules be damned. Kase stops, inches from Connor's face. Cooly regards the sword. KASE Look at you. You'd think after half a millenium, you'd learn to keep that you'd learn to keep that temper of yours in check. Gone is any trace of brogue. He's a fully-assimilated New Yorker now. Connor's fingers tighten around the swordgrip... CONNOR Just tell me where, Kase. KASE If all I wanted was to kill you, you'd have been dead a very long time ago, Connor. Something roils under Kase's controlled exterior. A rage every bit as consuming as Connor's. KASE (cont'd) But your death alone could never appease the innocent souls you slaughtered. FLASH TO SEVERAL OF GLENFINNAN'S VILLAGERS being MOWED DOWN by Connor's mindless fury. KASE (cont'd) It couldn't even begin to appease mine. FLASH TO KASE as he drops to his knees, gagging blood, RUN THROUGH by Connor's blade. KASE (cont'd) Worst of all, you murdered a man of God. Who raised me as his son. FLASH TO A FATHER RAINEY as Connor brings his sword CLEAVING DOWN on him. KASE (cont'd) ...and no punishment conceived by man can ever atone for that. AFTERMATH OF MASSACRE Scattered wisps of smoke gambol across the demolished commons, leading up to the CORPSE of JACOB KASE. KASE (cont'd) What you never could have expected was that you'd leave behind this one humble servant... Kase's body lies there as cold as the Highland dawn. KASE (cont'd) ...who would trade eternity itself to make you pay. HIS EYES snap open. And we're once again TRANSPORTED BACK TO: EXT - CEMETERY - DAY Kase steps closer, revelling in this moment. KASE Look back over the endless travesties of your life and you'll see me. Always there, waiting in the shadows. (beat) When friends and lovers are wiped from your sight, I'm there. KASE (cont'd) When those you cherish die abruptly and for no reason, I'm there. (kicks a clod of dirt onto a grave) And when a handful of misguided and pathetic idiots just happen to share your own private hell... (shrugs) Guess who? He walks a full circle around Connor. All the while Kase addresses Connor, Faith never takes her eyes off Duncan. KASE (cont'd) But if you think it ends here, my ancient friend, you're wrong. Very... Very... Wrong. Kase turns back to Faith. Pulls his sword and without warning SLICES it across her throat. Faith reflexively GASPS, stumbles backward, leaving-- A WOOD AND SILVER CRUCIFIX dangling on Kase's swordtip. FOLLOW THE CRUCIFIX as he swings it around and offers it up to Connor. KASE Thought you might be wanting this. I kept it for you... FLASH TO CONNOR'S MOTHER, bound to the stake as Kase rips the crucifix from her neck. BACK TO SCENE: Connor stares down at the crucifix now in his open palm. KASE (cont'd) For old times' sake. Kase puts an arm around Faith. KASE (cont'd) Want to find me again, Connor? Just put your hands together... KASE (cont'd) (winks) And pray. He gives Faith a little shove and they both start downhill. THE SURROUNDING BIKERS gun their engines and ride off on billowing plumes of dust. Connor makes no move to follow. Strangely silent and impassive, he's like a warrior gutted by an invisible sword. Duncan puts a hand on his shoulder. DUNCAN Whatever it is... Connor swipes away Duncan's hand, starts walking. DUNCAN (cont'd) I can help you, Connor. Connor stops, swivels back. Eyes dead. CONNOR Nobody can help me. He walks off alone, a ghost against a sea of gravestones, DUNCAN CONNOR-- Duncan watches his friend depart, helpless. Turning back, he sees FAITH AND KASE stopped halfway down the hill. They seem to be arguing. Kase turns abruptly and strides off. CLOSE ON FAITH She stands there a moment, sullenly rubbing her throat. Duncan's VOICE spins her back around. DUNCAN (O.S.) Problem? FAITH I get a bit fussy whenever somebody points a sword at me. (dry) Goes a long way back. Their eyes fix on one another. Air thickens. Buzzes with electricity. DUNCAN Just one question. After all these years. . . (re: Kase) Why him? Faith glances down at Kase, who stands waiting at the base of the hill. Considers. FAITH Because I've never known anyone who had such an amazing capacity for hate. (beat) Except me. On that, she brushes past Duncan and rejoins Kase. TRANSITION TO: EXT - IRISH COUNTRYSIDE, 17TH CENTURY - DAY Duncan and Connor ride side by side on horseback. They reach a RIVERBANK where a YOUNG WOMAN and her elderly CONSORT are detained at a crude wooden TOLL GATE. Eight or nine disreputable-looking HIGHWAYMEN surround their carriage. Connor rides up to what would appear to be the LEADER. He has the most teeth. CONNOR What's going on? HIGHWAYMAN The lady here refuses to pay her toll. CONNOR Toll for what? HIGHWAYMAN Passage over the bridge. Connor cranes his eyes, upriver and down. CONNOR I see no bridge. HIGHWAYMAN What do you think pays for the bridge? Connor considers, then turns back to the lady with a shrug. CONNOR The man has a point. Despite her sweeping auburn hair and natural beauty, we now recognize the young woman as FAITH from an earlier era. Her original name is CATHERINE MARY DEVANEY. CATHERINE These men are liars and scoundrels. Theyve preyed upon us three years running. CONNOR This true? HIGHWAYMAN A good sturdy bridge is not an overnight accomplishment, Sir. CONNOR Exactly what, may I ask, have you accomplished so far? HIGHWAYMAN (proudly) The tollgate. Duncan trots around the tollgate and up alongside Connor. He leans over to the highwayman. DUNCAN Excuse me, but by whose authority do you act? HIGHWAYMAN (holds up scroll) By deed of the King. DUNCAN Might I see that? Highwayman slowly unravels the parchment scroll. The nearly-illegible scrawl suggests random words copied by an illiterate. DUNCAN (cont'd) Does the King always sign his name with an "X"? Highwayman's cronies reach for their swords. HIGHWAYMAN He was in a hurry. All eyes hover on Duncan's reaction. Two of the highwaymen edge around behind Catherine and her elderly consort, ready to gut them both at a moment's notice. Duncan tracks them with his eyes. DUNCAN (nods) Busy man, the King. (to Catherine) I suggest you pay the gentlemen and be on your way. CATHERINE His deed is a fake! DUNCAN That's a matter of opinion. CATHERINE You, Sir, are no better than they! DUNCAN That's also a matter of opinion. (to Connor) Shall we? Connor sizes up his young protege'. Gives a dubious nod. CONNOR Lead on. CATHERINE You can't just leave! DUNCAN You're right... He tosses a handful of gold coins to the Highwayman. DUNCAN (cont'd) Good luck with the bridge. He kicks his horse into a brisk trot. Connor reluctantly follows suit. They cross the river through ankle-deep water. CONNOR I can't believe you gave those bastards your money. DUNCAN It wasn't my money. Duncan pulls a cinched canvas BAG overstuffed with coins from his overcoat. DUNCAN (cont'd) It was theirs. RACK FOCUS TO the duped HIGHWAYMEN scrambling onto their horses and riding hard in frantic pursuit. They hit the river at a gallop, kicking up giant shimmering fantails of water. DUNCAN (cont'd) By the time they reach us, the young lady and her escort should be safely out of harms way. The pursuers close the gap in seconds. Connor grins approvingly. Draws his sword and glances over at Duncan. CONNOR Shall we? Duncan FLICKS his own sword, lets the hilt auto-rotate around his open palm and snaps it vertical. He nods back at Connor. DUNCAN Let's. Together, they whirl around to face the onrushing horde. THEY BATTLE in the middle of the shallow river. Nine maniacal thieves against two sporting Immortals. The spray of water, the slashing of swords and the pounding of hooves all build to an operatic crescendo. Duncan's improved since Ravenna. He easily scatters three of his adversaries before engaging the blood-crazed LEADER. This time it's Connor who finds himself in trouble. He tumbles from his horse and goes down, losing his sword in the river. DUNCAN suddenly winds back and FLINGS his sword at his opponent like a throwing dagger. BLADE whistles past the dumbstruck highwayman's head. Which was not the intended target... . . .as we discover when we follow it's end-over-end flight. . . . . . straight into CONNOR'S OUTSTRETCHED HAND. Connor parries his attackers, drives them backward onto their asses, then swivels around and TOSSES the sword back to DUNCAN, who catches it, ducks the highwayman's next swing and swiftly sends him packing. CONNOR recovers his own sword, which is enough to send the last of their attackers into a full-on, stumbling retreat. They both stand watching as THE CARRIAGE jostles safely across the river. CLOSE ON CATHERINE as she looks back at Duncan. She gives Duncan a knowing smile that's as innocent as it is seductive. CONNOR (watching Duncan) You know that stirring in your gut? It's not just simple lust, my friend. DUNCAN I know... CONNOR Ah, but do you really? MATCH CUT TO: FAITH as she and Kase drive away from the cemetery in a late model convertible. EXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET Joe Dawson walks up to Duncan. DAWSON I feel like I stepped in on the wrong party. Duncan keeps watching the convertible until it disappears over the next rise. DUNCAN (quietly) Let's go. CUT TO: EXT - BAR - NIGHT We recognize this place. It's where Connor and Duncan shared a last drink together. Duncan and Joe Dawson now hunch over that same bar, staring into their drinks. DAWSON I swear, the man's a walking ghost. EXT - SIDEWALK - NIGHT FEET pound pavement. DAWSON (V.O.) (CONT'D) Whatever it is he's carrying around inside him, it's like he's dead already. Glare of streetlights rake across Connor's face, his eyes fixed forward as if driven by a sense more powerful than sight. Connor bumps shoulders with a passing PEDESTRIAN. PEDESTRIAN Eyy man-- watch it. He continues on, oblivious. INT - BAR - NIGHT Duncan turns to Dawson. DUNCAN There are things you do in this life that damn you for eternity. They can't be changed. And they can't be undone. You carry these things to the grave, Joe, in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, you'll find some peace there. Some relief, even if it's oblivion. (hollow smile) But Immortals don't die. We just go on reliving our sins. Over and over again. EXT - ANOTHER STREET - LATER Connor stops. Lifts his eyes to the light. A SOLITARY STONE CHURCH stands before him in a bed of crawling mist. It seems eerily out of place amid the urban blight around it. INT - BAR - NIGHT Duncan downs the last of his drink, shoves off from the bar. Dawson glances warily up at him. DAWSON Where now? DUNCAN There were two places I figured Connor was likely to go. One of 'em was here. DAWSON And the other? DUNCAN You're the "Watcher." You tell me. EXT - STONE CHURCH - NIGHT Connor climbs the steps, presses through the heavy wooden doors... INT - CHURCH . . . and prowls slowly through the dimly-lit interior. Icon SHADOWS loom large and menacing. JUMP CUT: He moves along the stations of the cross. JUMP CUT: He's stalking through the nave. JUMP CUT: Barging into the sacristy. EXT - DAWSON'S CAR, DRIVING - NIGHT Dawson's car screams past with a doppler howl. DAWSON (O.S.) It's an old abandoned church just off Canal... INT - DAWSON'S CAR - SAME Dawson's behind the wheel, gunning through narrow back streets. DAWSON . . . Perfect safe haven for a so-called priest, huh? "Our Lady of Sorrows." (dry) Kinda has a nice ring to it. He fishtails around the next corner. Recovers. DAWSON (cont'd) I'll tell ya this-- if he's going after Kase, he's in for a rude awakening. The man's untouchable. DUNCAN So they tell me. INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT Connor stops before the darkened altar, senses BUZZING. THE SHADOWED CRUCIFIX stirs. Arms lift in the darkness. Jacob Kase steps down off the cross, lingers in shadow. KASE I would grant you absolution. If I were a better man. He turns and disappears out the back. Connor follows. Right past KASE'S POSSE OF IMMORTALS scattered throughout the pews, who simply track him with their eyes but make no move to follow. WINSTON, the tall Jamaican, leans over to Faith. WINSTON You know we're next, don't you? Faith lowers the book she's reading-- the Holy Bible. Looks up. FAITH What? WINSTON Our days are numbered. You can see it in Kase's eyes. FAITH Do you believe in a hereafter, Winston? WINSTON All I know is I won't be hereafter Jacob Kase gets through with me. And that's all I care about right now. Faith leans back against the hardback pew, closes her eyes. FAITH Yeah... CUT TO: EXT - REAR OF CHURCH - NIGHT Kase strides just beyond the perimeter of the church grounds, then turns back to Connor. Connor draws his sword, moves on Kase. KASE The ancient samurai vowed never to draw blood in anger. It defiled their sense of purpose. (draws his own sword) Of course they're also somewhat extinct. He steps fearlessly up to Connor, places his neck against Connor's swordblade... . . . just like he did with a certain late Immortal named Carlos. CLOSE ON KASE'S SWORD He opens his fingers and lets the sword DROP. It clatters useless to the ground. KASE Would you slaughter an unarmed man of God again, Connor? Would that finally put your soul to rest? (low, taunting) Then go ahead. Send me home. BLOOD POUNDS with the rage pulsing through Connor's veins. KASE (cont'd) What's stopping you? Guilt? The nagging sense that maybe you, more than I, deserve to die? Dawson's car pulls up in the background. Duncan jumps out. KASE (cont'd) Or somewhere along the way did you just lose your nerve? Connor's sword digs into Kase's neck. Breaks skin. DUNCAN (approaching) Don't do it, Connor. CONNOR (gritted) Keep back. KASE (to Duncan) You heard him. No Immortal can interfere with another's duel. DUNCAN He's playing you! Step back onto holy ground before it's too late-- Kase faces back to Connor. KASE Go ahead-- what better chance than now? Take your shot. DUNCAN Don't listen to him! KASE Do it. For your sweet mother... FLASH Caiolin burns at the stake. Suddenly startled, KASE (cont'd) Your Huguenot bitch in Navarre... FLASH rears back, THROWS Suddenly startled, the HORSE bearing a FRENCH DUCHESS her to the ground, breaking her neck. KASE (cont'd) Brenda Wyatt... FLASH BRENDA WYATT ("Highlander 1") is seen walking in CENTRAL PARK. A HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER MOWS HER DOWN from behind. KASE (cont'd) Rachel Ellenstein... FLASH RACHEL is BLOWN APART in the antique store she shared with Connor. KASE (cont'd) Tell me-- do they even begin to equal the devastation of an entire village? BLADE TREMBLES in Connor's hands. Kase presses his neck even harder against Connor's blade. BLOOD trickles down his neck. KASE (cont'd) So close. Soooo close... Duncan stands by, helpless to intervene. KASE (cont'd) Look at you. Even now, you're afraid you'll lose. That's your true fear isn't it? (whispers low, seductive) Oh, it's not the dying, my friend. I know that. That would be a blessing. It's the thought of giving up your essence to me. Making me even stronger by it. One look in Connor's eyes and you know he's right. KASE (cont'd) What's wrong? (almost a purr) Don't you want to be inside me? Connor slowly LOWERS his sword... and FLICKS Kase's discarded sword back up into his hands. Kase simply smiles and takes position. Duncan can only look on helplessly as Kase takes the first offensive, driving Connor backward with dazzling -- almost casual-- swordplay. KASE I've taken more heads than you can possibly imagine. His sword whistles across Connor's face, opens a THREE INCH GASH over his eye. KASE (cont'd) Do you really want a taste of all those accumulated quickenings? Connor stumbles backward again, blinded by his own dripping blood. Knows beyond a shadow of a doubt he's doomed. Duncan knows it too. And it's killing him to watch. Still Connor won't go down easy. He manages a brief offensive, walking Kase backward on his toes. Kase puts one hand behind his back, fencing-style, and goes to work on Connor's torso, crosshatching him in blood. Connor lunges wildly. Kase parries effortlessly. Kase now opens up a BLINDING BARRAGE on Connor. It's like duelling against lightning, so quick and unpredictable are Kase's strikes. Constantly off balance, Connor still manages to NICK Kase in the cheek. KASE (cont'd) (touches scratch) I'd almost forgotten what that felt like. Thank you. He now turns it on full. Drives Connor up against a wall and pins him with his swordtip. His eyes go impossibly cold. KASE I want you to think back to this moment in the endless nights ahead. And know that every time you close your eyes, from now to eternity, I'll be there. (beat) Ripping apart the ones you care about most. He removes his sword and steps back. KASE (cont'd) It's not over, Connor MacLeod. It will never, never be over. He turns and walks back toward the church. Duncan does not step aside to let him pass-- their shoulders bump. KASE (cont'd) You, on the other hand, are on borrowed time. He continues on, past the other Immortals who have gathered to watch the unfolding spectacle. One-by-one, they turn and file back into the church behind Kase. Connor stares into Duncan's eyes as if wanting to say something. Can't. Instead, he turns and starts limping out across the empty lot. Feeling the presence of another Immortal, Duncan slowly looks over at FAITH who stands at a distance. Watching him. As their eyes meet, she, too, turns and melts back into the surrounding blackness. TRANSITION TO: EXT - DUBLIN ROWHOUSE (17TH CENTURY) - DAY A BEARDED BRAWLER CRASHES DOWN onto a wooden table. He takes the table cloth with him as he TUMBLES head over heels onto the floor in a cascade of soda bread and cabbage. Miraculously (unless you're an Irishman) he spills not one drop of precious Guinness, which he hoists in a cheery salute to: THE BRIDE AND GROOM who sit laughing in the eye of an Irish hurricane. DUNCAN MACLEOD and CATHERINE MARY (KATE) DEVANEY-- aka "Faith"-- are a stunning couple that inspire joyful madness. Things have progressed nicely since their chance encounter at the toll crossing. BRAWLER Let's have at it! They kiss to a CHORUS of BOOS. So this time they REALLY KISS. Crowd goes wild. AROUND THEM REVELERS DANCE and FIGHT with equal abandon, making it almost impossible to tell the difference. But they stop like clockwork for every new toast and testimonial. THE BEARDED BRAWLER spears his mug into the air like a royal scepter. BRAWLER Happy is the bride that sees the sun! Sorry the corpse that sees the rain! CLOSE ON BEER MUG framed in a perfect BEAM of SUNLIGHT streaming through an open window. FOLLOW THE SUNBEAM TO: KATE who smiles back with her own inner radiance. Bedecked in flowers, her brown hair sweets low over white lace shoulders and cream skin. She leans over RAUCOUS CHEERS and kisses Duncan, provoking a new RIOT of and UPRAISED GLASSES. THE PIPERS resplendent in their Celtic kilts, launch into the "Highland Fling. Kate is instantly YANKED up onto her feet and into a ROUSING JIG. Before Duncan can protest, he's HOISTED from his seat and FLUNG onto the dance floor. Duncan and Kate link arms, goaded on by a circle of shouting, stumbling CLAPPERS. With each new upshift in tempo, they spin faster and faster until they're hanging on for dear life. SIGHT AND SOUND gradually blur into a queasy sense of vertigo. But for Duncan, it's not just the headstrong mix of drink and passion. It's the BUZZ of another Immortal. He spins to a stop as his eyes come to rest on CONNOR MACLEOD who enters the room on a wave of silence. Duncan breaks away from Kate, crosses over to Connor and wraps him in a bear hug. DUNCAN About time. I was beginning to wonder. CONNOR I was on a junk in the South China Sea when I got your notice. 12 hours ago. DUNCAN How...? CONNOR Don't ask. Kate spins by on the arm of a new partner. KATE You're next, Connor MacLeod. CONNOR That better be no idle threat. Duncan watches Kate with a rapturous smile. DUNCAN Well, I finally did it! CONNOR So it would appear. DUNCAN What do you think of her? CONNOR You know that's not an easy answer. The edge in his voice is not lost on Duncan. CONNOR (cont'd) Outside. EXT - PORCH - NIGHT Connor stands with Duncan at the railing, staring out into the encroaching night. CONNOR You know she's like us. DUNCAN Yes. I sensed it the day we met her. CONNOR So you know that, like us, her immortality can only be triggered by the shock of a violent death. Duncan looks off, as if purging the thought from his head. CONNOR (cont'd) It's what makes warriors of us all, Duncan. Good or bad, there seems a purpose to it. DUNCAN Yes. And without such a death, she'll simply grow old and die like any other. Is that what you dragged me out here to tell me? Connor removes a uniquely-braided GOLDEN ROPE from his vest pocket. It catches the candlelight with the glint of a thousand silken threads as he runs it lightly over his fingertips. CONNOR Many years after I was married, I came home to find Heather sitting on a stool in the kitchen, with a knife in one hand... and her hair in the other. FLASH TO: HEATHER, early-forties, her hair shorn to the scalp. She looks up at Connor with red-rimmed eyes and a bitter smile. CONNOR (cont'd) At first I was scared. Scared that she'd gone mad. And then angry, as if she'd somehow meant to hurt me by it. BACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN: CONNOR (cont'd) When I asked her why she'd done such a thing to herself, her answer cut me to the quick. She said it was the one part of her that would not age. It would forever remain the same as when I first fell in love with her. FLASH TO: CONNOR burying Heather in a simple grave overlooking their home. Tears streak his face. He sinks to his knees in unspeakable anguish. CONNOR (cont'd) And that's how she wanted me to remember her. BACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN: Connor closes his fingers around the braid. Squeezes. CONNOR (cont'd) It's all I have now. DUNCAN I love Kate. I'll hold on to her as long as I can. That's all I can do. Kate can be seen through the window behind them, exchanging dance partners with dizzying abandon. CONNOR If that's your intent, so be it. Duncan swings over the rail and hops off the porch. Takes to the ground in long angry strides. EXT - COBBLED STREET - NIGHT Conner walks double time to catch up with him. DUNCAN Why are you telling me this? CONNOR Because I once loved a woman more than life itself. And I watched her die. Unlike you, I had no other choice. DUNCAN And I have a choice?! What would you have me tell her?! CONNOR I'd tell her nothing. She wouldn't believe you. They never do when it involves themselves. DUNCAN Then I can do nothing. CONNOR She's in the flower of her youth. Enjoy the moment and let it pass. If you think you can. Duncan suddenly grabs Connor's shoulder, spins him around. DUNCAN You'd have me kill her?! Is that it?! Is that what you came all this way to tell me on my WEDDING NIGHT?! CONNOR I'd have you do what your heart-- and our conscience-- demand. Duncan settles. Searches his eyes. DUNCAN And if it were you in my place? Connor ponders. Then shakes his head. CONNOR I thank God I never had the choice. He listens to the faint strains of music and laughter carried on the rising WIND. CONNOR (cont'd) Tell Catherine I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer. He clasps Duncan by the forearm. Then turns and continues n down the cobbled lane leading from the wedding party. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT Duncan lies sleepless in a nouveau-stark hotel room, somewhere in the bowels of Manhattan. A half-empty bottle of Glenmorangie is there for company. The door CREAKS OPEN, casting a single ribbon of light across the room. It WIDENS to REVEAL THE SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN. Duncan closes his eyes. Feigns sleep. She pads silently inside. Pulls the door closed. Duncan remains still, breathing heavily. The woman steals slowly up to the bedside. Pauses, as if quietly studying Duncan-- --then swings her leg up and straddles him. Even in the murky halflight, he can still make out the familiar painted eyes framed by a tangle of bleached hair. She says nothing, her expression lost under a veil of darkness. Only her rapid breathing betrays her tension. Instead, she suddenly leans forward and KISSES HIM. Passionately. Duncan responds in kind. AS if powerless to do anything else... LIGHTNING stitches the sky outside as-- They embrace. Bodies entwine with an urgency that builds with the STORM raging outside. ON THE NEXT THUNDERCRACK TRANSITION TO: EXT - EMPTY FIELD (DUBLIN) - NIGHT ANGRY SHEETS OF RAIN rake the countryside as Duncan slogs imlessly through calf-deep mud. Still in his wedding arb, he's thoroughly drenched, as if he's been wandering this way for hours. INT - ROWHOUSE - NIGHT The last of the guests have gone or passed out beneath toppled kegs of ale. Only Kate remains upright, her face etched with sober dread as DUNCAN appears in the doorway, rivulets of water pouring off his shoulders and brow. For a while they just stare at one another, each lost to his own sense of foreboding. Kate is the first to speak. Despite her stoic veneer, her voice comes out small and terrified. KATE If this is wrong, Duncan, tell me now. Saying nothing, Duncan slowly crosses the floor and takes her hands in his own. INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT CANDLES flicker in the storm-fed drafts that whistle through closed windows. Kate lays Duncan's rainsoaked clothing across a nightstand then turns, regarding him naked for the very first time. Duncan reaches out to touch her. She trembles. Gently, as if unwrapping an object of unimaginable fragility, Duncan removes her clothing down to a simple floating chemise. Then guides her down onto a canopied bed encircled by a hundred fresh-cut wildflowers. HANDS clasp, fingers dig into skin. Whatever refinements Kate displayed in public are now happily abandoned. She arches up under Duncan, puts her lips to his ear. KATE I'll love you forever. On an OMINOUS THUNDERCLAP-- TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT We're back in the present. Little has changed but the sheets. And the fury of their lovemaking. Each new THUNDERCRACK highlights a different aspect of their hunger-- their wet, glistening bodies STROBING FASTER AND FASTER until the act itself becomes abstracted from any sense of time or place. FLASH FRAMES stutter inside the lightning: SILKEN HAIR coursing over cream-colored breasts and a simple pewter cross. EYES similar in shape and color, that shift from painted to plain... FINGERNAILS that toggle between neo-goth BLACK and natural pink... FAITH throws back her head, biting back the shudders of release... . . . and sinks down into the bed with a drawn sigh. INT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT A SHADOW darkens Kate as she sleeps. It lingers there, deadly still. DUNCAN stands over her, gripped by indecision. The fateful choice tears at him, even as he holds a DAGGER over her gently-rising chest. His hand TREMBLES. DUNCAN (softly) Forgive me. KATE'S EYES SNAP OPEN as the DAGGER PLUNGES INTO HER HEART. For an instant their eves meet. And in that single shattering moment, Duncan knows he chose wrong. It's not just terror that passes through Kate's eyes. It's the incomprehensible pain of betrayal. Kate gasps once, jerks and settles. Lies there dead, blood pooling across her nightgown. Duncan stares down at her body, numb. DUNCAN I'm sorry... On that look we TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - HOTEL - NIGHT The pain imprints on Duncan as if he's still clutching the knife. DUNCAN I'm sorry. Whatever passion stirred Faith moments before is gone without a trace. Her eyes are as cold and empty as the dead Kate. FAITH You had no right. DUNCAN I was doing it for you. For us. FLASH TO: INT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT Kate CONVULSES BACK TO LIFE, eyes wild, insane. Duncan reaches out to her, which only sends her reeling further into panic delirium. She swats at him, punching flailing... DUNCAN Now you're an immortal. Like me. It was the only way... Words fall on deaf ears. She wrenches out of his grip. Stumbles for the door, drenched in her own blood. Leaves Duncan standing mindblown in her wake. EXT - DUBLIN STREETS - NIGHT Kate flees through wet empty streets-- barefoot, nightgown ripped and bloody, face contorted like a madwoman. Breath comes in ragged, whimpering gasps. She trips, falls. Comes up running. BACK TO PRESENT: Faith climbs off the bed, throws on Duncan's shirt, whirls back, tears streaking her face like warpaint. FAITH You wanted this! I never asked for eternity! You forced it on me! (screams) IT WAS MY DECISION, NOT YOURS!! DUNCAN Would you have really understood? FAITH Understood? Which part?! The part about never having children? Or the endless, numbing sameness of it all? (bitter laugh) Or maybe you mean the part where you wake up one day and realize you're nothing but a whore racking up faceless affairs because whole lifetimes tick by so fast they don't even count anymore! She wraps her arms around herself as if to stem the escaping demons. Duncan remains silent, taking it all in. FAITH (cont'd) Here's the kicker, Duncan. I came here for one reason and one reason only. To see if I could feel again. Anything. She walks out, leaving the door hanging wide in her wake. INT - HALLWAY Faith reaches for the stairwell door as-- --DUNCAN'S ARM LANCES OUT, holding it shut. DUNCAN (leaning in) I'm watching my best friend driven insane by something that happened four centuries ago. And there's nothing I can do to stop it. Because those people are dead and nobody can bring them back. Faith struggles to open the door. Duncan holds firm. DUNCAN (cont'd) But I'm lucky. You know why? FAITH Let go! DUNCAN I'm lucky because my crime can still be forgiven. FAITH LET GO!! DUNCAN As long as you're still alive, there's at least the chance. It could take years. Centuries even. It may never happen... Faith is now PUSHING FURIOUSLY on the door. DUNCAN (cont'd) But at least I can still carry the hope inside me. That's one blessing of immortality. There's always tomorrow. He lets go of the door and steps back. DUNCAN (cont'd) Even for you. Faith shoves her way past him and disappears into the stairwell. CUT TO: EXT - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT CONNOR MACLEOD stands on a ROOFTOP, sword in hand, face upturned to the bitter heavens. Stinging WIND and RAIN slash at his face. He doesn't even blink. CUT TO: EXT - NEAR CHURCH - NIGHT Seen through a CAMCORDER VIEWFINDER, our roving POV wends its way past a couple fixing junkies up to a GARAGE where WINSTON hunkers over his bike making repairs. Kase's church looms in the background like a veiled threat. CALVIN (O.S.) Win-ston. WINSTON Shut that thing off. CALVIN (O.S.) Hey, c'mon. WINSTON SHUT IT OFF! SCREEN BLACKS OUT as Winston slams his hand over the lens, ENDING CAMCORDER POV. Calvin sets it down. CALVIN Awright... WINSTON I'm out. I'm leaving. CALVIN You're out. You're out... You don't g&z out. WINSTON Watch me. CALVIN You saw what he did to Carlos. He's Genghis the fucking Hun, man. You live his way or you die your way. Be grateful you got the choice. Winston looks off. WINSTON We could take him. CALVIN Huh? Say how much you value your life? WINSTON Forty-three guineas. Saw the bill of sale myself. Kingston Jamaica, August 14th, 1813. CALVIN Sorry there, Cinque', but I got a bigger price goin on this unit. WINSTON I watched Connor MacLeod stand up to Kase tonight. Got me thinking. CALVIN What about. WINSTON That maybe my soul wasn't part of the deal after all. Calvin considers his point. CALVIN You really think we can take him? WINSTON The man can't stop a bullet. I know that much. But I need your help. CALVIN Yeah and who takes his head, huh? Gets that bucket fulla lucky charms. You, Mr Cool? (beat) Who's gonna be master then? INSERT - CALVIN'S CAMERA and that little glowing RECORD LIGHT... EXT - RUBBLED CEMETERY - DAWN FOLLOW CONNOR MACLEOD CUT TO: as he reaches the crest of the cemetery ridge. He sags against a solitary windswept oak, slides down until he's sitting cross-legged at the base of the tree. Eyes wide, unblinking. BEFORE HIM stand those TWELVE DEAD IMMORTALS from The Sanctuary, directly over their burial plots. Their heads are missing. CONNOR looks on impassively. Even as-- THOUSANDS MORE now stipple the barren landscape. All headless, in period dress spanning untold centuries. The forgotten casualties of an endless, impossible war. Connor nods solemnly. CONNOR Soon. He blinks. The specters are gone. TIME LAPSE ON CONNOR: DAY becomes NIGHT becomes DAY. And still he sits there, unmoved, as if ready to embrace the rest of eternity from this one desolate spot. TRANSITION TO: EXT - CEMETERY RIDGE - DAY Connor remains sitting against the tree as A SHADOW slices over him. He slowly tilts his gaze upward. Squints. DUNCAN (O.S.) There's supposed to be an end to all this, right? A final answer... Duncan slides down next to him. Gazes out at the trackless ocean. DUNCAN Isn't that the "prize" we're all butchering each other to win? CONNOR I already know the answer. The "prize"-- the real prize-- is just to close your eyes and see nothing. DUNCAN I don't believe that. CONNOR You think the Game is still about good against evil? A better world? Look around. Who among us really deserves to win? DUNCAN Not Jacob Kase. CONNOR And who's going to stop him? You? Me? DUNCAN There has to be a way. Connor looks off. Nods. CONNOR Oh, there's a way, kinsman. There's a way. But I don't believe you have the guts to take it. DUNCAN Try me. Connor stands up. Offers a hand to Duncan. Hauls him upright. CONNOR Alright then. HE SUDDENLY LASHES OUT WITH HIS SWORD. Duncan barely catches Connor's blade with his own. DUNCAN What're you doing?! CONNOR Don't you know? The better of us will take the other's gift. Pray it'll be enough. Duncan lowers his blade. DUNCAN I won't do it. CONNOR Then you'll die. Again, Connor STRIKES. Again, Duncan barely escapes with his head. And settles into a fighting stance. DUNCAN It can't end like this! CONNOR It already has. Goodbye, brother. He SWINGS FOR DUNCAN'S NECK. Steel RINGS against steel. Clansman against clansman. CUT TO: INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY Faith sits in a center pew, head bowed, deep in thought. Or prayer. Hard to tell with somebody like Faith. Kase sits down beside her. KASE You were with him. He curls his nose, as if he can still smell the sin. KASE (cont'd) Woman is a temple built upon a sewer. FAITH Glad I can help you feel a bit better about yourself there, Jacob. KASE Remember what you were when I first found you? A whore. Now look. A liberated woman. FAITH Fuck you. Kase runs a delicate finger across her neck. KASE Be grateful I don't this minute remove your pretty little heafod. FAITH (looks up, cold) Holy ground, lover. It's a bitch, ain't it? CUT TO: EXT - CEMETERY RIDGE - DAY Two figures dot the faraway ridge as the savage music of their swordplay PEALS out across the barren countryside. MOVING CLOSER, we watch these timeless warriors exchange strikes that would drive lesser men into the ground. Each gifted in his own way, neither gaining full advantage over the other... . . . they both gradually succumb to EXHAUSTION. CLOSER: Connor and Duncan finally lower their swords, panting and spent. DUNCAN (hollow rasp) Enough? CONNOR (barely audible) Enough... And that's as much as either can say as they suck back great gulping lungfulls of air. A little color finally returns to Duncan's cheeks. He mops his face with his sleeve. DUNCAN Next time I won't hold back. CONNOR Nor I. Dragging his sword like a half-ton barbell, Duncan turns and makes his way back toward the "resting tree. CONNOR closes his eyes and HOISTS HIS SWORD... CONNoR (whispered) Remember well, old friend. DUNCAN feels, more than sees, the ONCOMING BLADE. He turns into the ARC of CONNOR'S SWING-- SLOW MOTION He reacts on pure instinct, SWORD LIFTING, BODY PIVOTING with the DRIVING FORCE of CONNOR'S THRUST... FLASH TO: CONNOR TEACHING THAT SAME MOVE TO DUNCAN BACK IN 1627. FLASH BACK TO: CONNOR'S SWORD as it GRAZES Duncans side. DUNCAN'S KATANA SWINGS UP with the same vicious thrust, CATCHES CONNOR UNDER THE CHIN... Connor doesn't flinch. TIME SUSPENDS the instant before blade meets flesh... CONNOR'S VOICE The game is not about survival, Duncan. It's about living. In the end, it's all that matters. REAL TIME-- THE BLADE CUTS CLEAN THROUGH CONNOR'S NECK WITH UNSTOPPABLE MOMENTUM. Duncan CRIES OUT as he follows through, BLOOD staining his blade with the crushing reality of what he has just committed. He sinks to his knees... . . . and SCREAMS TO THE HEAVENS. The heavens answer back with THUNDER, LIGHTNING and GALE FORCE WINDS that seem to come from everywhere at once. PURE ESSENCE-- --HOWLS out of CONNOR'S BODY. DUNCAN CON-NORRRRRRR!! It SURGES UPWARD into endless SHEETS of LIGHTNING. Duncan CONVULSES at the epicenter of a GROWING CLASH between EARTH and SKY. SHOCKWAVES POUND through his skull, triggering A LAST FLEETING VISION OF CONNOR MACLEOD: Walking with Heather across an open field. He turns and looks back at Duncan. CONNOR'S EYES shine with a look of ultimate peace and transcendence. He seems to be gazing straight into Duncan's soul. And smiling at what he sees as-- A FINAL BLAST OF ESSENCE RIPS through Duncan's BRAIN. EXT - HIGHRISE - NIGHT DISSOLVE TO: Duncan stands alone on the rooftop, stripped to the waist, moving slowly through an elaborate kata. The precision of his movement belies the chaos inside him. He windmills the katana over his head, faster and faster, until he suddenly RELEASES IT-- THE SWORD PINWHEELS through the night sky, arcing out across the open space between buildings... Duncan watches its long, lofting trajectory... . ..then takes off RUNNING. He reaches the edge of the rooftop and LEAPS. WIDE Legs cycling through empty air, he traces a matching arc directly under the far-flung sword. Like a long-jumper stretching for that last inch of sand, Duncan HYPER-EXTENDS for the next rooftop. EXT - NEXT ROOFTOP HIS LEADING FOOT hits the edge-- digs in, pivots and sets. HIS HAND THRUSTS UPWARD as the sword grip SLAPS INTO HIS OPEN PALM. Fingers wrap around the ivory hilt, slowly lowering it down to eye-level. GO IN CLOSE ON THOSE EYES and see a new Duncan MacLeod. Stronger. Deadlier. A man cooly aware of his own destiny. CUT TO: EXT - ARMORY - DAY Dawson's car pulls up to the generic cinderblock building that now stands unguarded and abandoned. INT - ARMORY - DAY Dawson enters, squints into the darkness. The interior looks as if it's stood fallow for the last three decades. No giger-chair, no gothic restraints. No evidence the Watchers ever took up temporary residence here. Except for MATTHEW, who emerges from the stale halflight to confront Dawson. MATTHEW I'm a bit surprised to see you again. All things considered. Dawson just stands there, hands plunged inside his coat pockets. MATTHEW (cont'd) As you can see, we had to move on. Find a new Sanctuary. DAWSON It's wrong. What you're doing. It's inhuman. MATTHEW Ah, but they're not human, really. Are they? DAWSON Gimme a reason, Matthew. MATTHEW It's for the good of us all. You know that. DAWSON Gimme a reason. Matthew cocks his head like the RCA dog. MATTHEW Because we must. It's that simple. And if you get in our way again, there will be very serious consequences. DAWSON Gimme a good reason. Matthew pulls a gun. Aims it at Dawson's heart. MATTHEW I'm sorry to have to do this, Joe. He pulls the trigger... as TWO SLUGS pound into his chest. Matthew topples backward, dead. Dawson palms the gun still concealed in his coat pocket. Nods. DAWSON Reason enough. CUT TO: EXT - NEW YORK STREET - DAY Kase is roaring through narrow streets in a low-slung convertible, Faith at his side. With utter disregard for speed or care, he guns it madly in shrieking turns. INT - CONVERTIBLE, DRIVING Faith grips the dashboard two-handed. FAITH Slow down. KASE Adrenalin's good for the sex drive. FAITH I'm not amused, Jacob. She reaches over and slaps on her shoulder harness. KASE Thought maybe you needed a little more excitement. You know, spice up our relationship a bit. WIDE He OVERSTEERS, caroms off several parked cars, recovers... KASE (cont'd) I mean, isn't that why you went back to Duncan MacLeod? The risk? FAITH I don't know what you're trying to prove. Kase puts an arm around her shoulder... KASE Why do I have to prove anything to you? .... as his foot flattens the accelerator. ENGINE WHINES. KASE (cont'd) I can have anything I want already. FAITH Except me. And that bugs the shit out of you, doesn't it? KASE Not really. AT THE NEXT TURN it's clear he'll never make it, he's going too fast. Kase only smiles. Releasing the wheel, he stands in his seat, lifts his arms above his head and SHOUTS in exultation as-- --the car EXPLODES into the wall. It's all over in a breath. Accordioned metal, drooling radiator, and Faith, slumped over the dash. Kase lies sprawled and battered on the pavement, thrown some distance from the wreckage. He's clearly taken the worst of the impact. FAITH stirs and slowly wrenches herself free of the smoking mangle of steel and plastic. She reaches back and pulls Kase's sword free of the wreckage. With single-minded determination, she limps over to Kase's body, face-up in his own pooling blood. A disbelieving PEDESTRIAN pauses in shock. Faith gives her a twisted smile. FAITH Don't mind us. Pedestrian SCURRIES OFF as Faith lifts the sword over her head and brings it WHISTLING DOWN across Kase's neck. With inhuman reflexes, Kase awakens and catches her wrist in the same heartbeat. Eyes narrow. KASE Does this mean it's over? DISSOLVE TO: EXT - KASE'S CHURCH - DAY Kase steps up to the back entrance, alone. THE DOOR hangs slightly ajar, which clearly disturbs him. INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY Kase enters the main room to find Calvin and Sarge asleep on their pews. He kicks the first pew, awakens both with a start. KASE Who left the back door open? CALVIN Huh? Kase looks to Sarge. SARGE I dunno. KASE Where's Cracker Bob? He was supposed to be watching the back. Calvin and Sarge both shrug. KASE (cont'd) (sotto) Infants. He whirls, stalks out. INT - SACRISTY Kase enters his dark, cluttered office, SLAMMING the door behind him. FLICKS ON THE LIGHT and stops cold. A SWORD JUTS from a small wooden table... . . . right through CRACKER BOB, who lies skewered to the tabletop. WRAPPED AROUND THE SWORDHILT is Caiolin MacLeods unique silver-and-wood CRUCIFIX. The message is not lost on Kase. BOB'S EYES suddenly flutter open. First thing he sees is that sword hilt sticking rudely out of his own chest. CRACKER BOB Ah-- Ahhh-- AHHHHHHH!! KASE Shut up. He reaches forward and JERKS the sword out of Bob, and with it A SINGLE SCRAP OF PAPER impaled on the blade. It bears just one word, scrawled in Bob's plentiful blood. GLENFINNAN Bob sits up on the table, wild-eyed, as Kase calmly opens his fingers and lets the paper slide from his fingers. CUT TO: EXT - LITTLE ITALY, ESTABLISHING - NIGHT Glitter lights and milling tourists. Row upon row of gimmicky Italian restaurants. INT - ITALIAN RESTAURANT, PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT Jacob Kase and his acolytes dine at a long table set against a gaudy backdrop of faux Roman ruins, babbling fountains and plastic holly. It all imparts a whiff of "Last Supper" pomp to the proceeding. Which is not lost on the other Immortals, who glance around warily while eating, as suspicious of each other as they are of Kase. Nor does anyone miss the fact that there are no windows in this particular room. CLOSE ON WINSTON He stares into his pasta, beading sweat. BENEATH THE TABLE his fingers curl around the cold steel of a .38 SPECIAL wedged between his knees. He inches the gun upward toward the table rim as... Kase suddenly stands up in the center. KASE A toast... All heads turn. Gun freezes in Winston's lap, just hidden from view. KASE (cont'd) I see tonight as a celebration of the spirit. (raises his glass) Here's to all of you who continue to stand by me... (smiles at Winston) . . . even those who might waver at times. Winston stiffens, fears that Kase is on to him. And when Calvin averts his gaze, he knows. Still, he raises his glass. As do the others. KASE (cont'd) You are my flock. You nourish my soul. It's now or never for Winston. His moment of truth. Kase's eyes slowly drift over to meet his. SLOW MOTION, Kase tips back his glass and drinks, eyes locked on Winston. Winston responds in kind, gulping down his wine as he slips the gun back into his pocket. He shoves off from the table. WINSTON Excuse me. KASE Where you going? WINSTON Toilet. KASE Sit sit. I'm not through with my toast yet. WINSTON Can't wait. He angles for the door. KASE I'm almost finished. Sit. Winston reaches for the doorknob. Locked. He swivels back. Sees death in Jacob Kase's eyes. His death. KASE (cont'd) It'll all be over in a few more seconds. A cold spike of fear shoots through every single one of them... . . . as Kase continues. KASE (cont'd) Youve all been a part of a great quest. A four hundred year quest for justice. He lifts up an exquisitely-crafted sword. KASE (cont'd) And here, my friends, is the instrument of that justice. It's called the "Colichmarde." Finest sword known to man. The blade WHISTLES upright. KASE (cont'd) Blessed by Popes and baptized in blood. I only break it out for special occasions. He kisses the perfect cross formed by the juncture of blade and quillons. KASE (cont'd) It sings like an angel. Just listen. Winston jerks for his gun. In a SUDDEN BLUR of STEEL and BLOOD, Kase beheads Winston and dispatches the next two of his stunned acolytes with blinding efficiency. TONGUES OF LIQUID ENERGY coil up and around Kase's body. But he keeps right on coming. The others scatter like roaches. ESSENCE PULSES off walls and ceiling, SHATTERING STATUARY, HURLING FURNITURE... . ..before MERGING with the WALKING INFERNO that is now Jacob Kase. His sword BLAZES through the remaining victims, trailing STREAKS OF BLUE FIRE. One after another, they drop headless to the concrete, triggering A FULL-ON MULTIPLE-QUICKENING. THE NEXT WAVE OF ESSENCE SLAMS into Kase front on. His knees BUCKLE. ANOTHER Hits him BROADSIDE, buffeting him one way as YET ANOTHER POUNDS him from the opposite- side, rocking him back center and IMMOBILIZING HIM inside an omni-directional CRUSH of LIGHT AND SOUND that WHITES OUT THE FRAME. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY A THICK CLINGING FOG, enshrouds the rocky highlands. Somewhere along the invisible coastline below, a foghorn MOANS. The skeletal remains of an ancient Gaelic CASTLE loom spectral gray above JACOB KASE who stands before an ANCIENT CELTIC MONOLITH (familiar from Glenfinnan's town square) revelling in the changeless land of his birth. KASE (calling out) Where else could stir the blood of a Scotsman too long of this earth and too far from home? Kase picks his way across the uneven ground, unable to see beyond the reach of his own arm. KASE (cont'd) (filling his lungs) I can nae get enough of it. He draws his sword, extends it outward until the tip disappears from sight. A LOW SCRAPING OF METAL ON STONE taunts him from somewhere out there in the slow-drifting whiteness Kase's sword TWITCHES toward the SOUND. Just the FAINTEST OUTLINE of a FIGURE COALESCES BRIEFLY inside the fog. KASE Ah, what's this? Hamlet's ghost? The FIGURE melts back into silent nothingness. KASE (cont'd) I'm afraid even the cloak of fog won't help you overcome a sizeable disadvantage. A DIFFERENT SCRAPING SOUND spins him around to see ANOTHER GHOSTLY FIGURE looming over him from a narrow stone outcropping. Kase masks a slight tinge of concern. KASE (cont'd) It's always good to see two fellow clansmen banded together in a common cause. But I hope you haven't sunk to the level of a simultaneous ambush. Once again, the figure steps backward into the enveloping fog. Disappears. Slightly unnerved, Kase jerks around. No sign of anyone. Just that infernal mist. A SOFT SCRAPING of SWORD against ROCK swivels him back around to his original position. CLOSE ON KASE His nerves are starting to shred. He turns several full rotations, craning for a glimpse of his tormentors. And then he sees it... AN APPARITION WIELDING A SWORD. Kase LUNGES for it. And this time, it doesn't retreat. Swords CLANG in thunderous overture as TWO SPECTRES IN THE FOG battle for position on tenuous footing. KASE drives his adversary backward into a BLUNTED STONE WALL, leaving him no avenue of escape. Their swords LOCK UP and Kase suddenly finds himself FACE TO FACE WITH-- DUNCAN MACLEOD. You can sense Kase's bitter disappointment. KASE Not at all who I'd hoped for. CLOSE ON DUNCAN'S EYES as they flick to a point iust behind Kase's head. CLOSE ON KASE'S EYES as he realizes he's been had. He SWINGS FULLY AROUND TO FACE CONNOR-- --and sees that NOBODY'S THERE! Too late-- he SWINGS BACK TO DUNCAN-- and IMPALES HIMSELF ON DUNCAN'S SWORD. DUNCAN (through clenched teeth) I'm afraid Connor couldn't be here. But don't worry, he's with us in spirit. Still gripping his sword two-fisted, Duncan seems to surge with newfound strength. DUNCAN He gave himself for this moment. And I shan't let him down. Duncan SHOVES OFF from Kase and goes to work on him with a VENGEANCE. WHAT KASE SEES: A frightening, hallucinitory vision of a DUAL ADVERSARY-- one that CHANGES back and forth in the flux of swirling mist. As Duncan's blade BLURS PAST, Kase sees CONNOR. With the very next SWING, he sees Duncan again. Then Connor. Then Duncan. Connor. Duncan... Kase rubs his eyes with the back of his hand. Shakes it off. Can't be. Duncan buffets Kase backward with several dazzling combinations, then goes inside, tough and ugly. Kase seems suddenly overwhelmed, physically and mentally, as he's driven onto his back by sheer relentless overdrive. Duncan SLASHES DOWN for the killing blow, which Kase BARELY DEFLECTS. He SLASHES AGAIN. And AGAIN. Each time Kase barely escapes with his head intact. Duncan keeps up this relentless barrage, hacking down in every conceivable direction, looking for an opening, finding none. With each increasingly-leaden DOWNSTROKE, Duncan is losing strength... . . . and Kase is regaining his. Kase BATTLES BACK TO HIS FEET, deftly siezes the advantage. KASE (savage smile) This is not a game won on points, I'm afraid. He drives Duncan back with an answering exchange that leaves no doubt of his superior ability. In a single massive THRUST, Kase STRIPS Duncan's sword and sends him flying. Duncan lands on his back, weaponless. Kase steps up to the katana, scoops his toe under it and FLICKS IT BACK TO DUNCAN. Then waves him back to his feet. A cat playing with his prey. Both combatants square off... and RESUME. KASE That's the beauty of eternity. The fun never stops. He THRUSTS-- spiking Duncan clear through the shoulder. Duncan hangs up on the blade, unable to move. Grimaces in pain. Setting boot to chest, Kase KICKS Duncan off his sword and sends him spiralling backward. Duncan reaches out to break his fall-- --but there's no ground beneath him. He PLUMMETS OFF a SLANTED CLIFF. Bounces at fifty feet, then tumbles clear to the bottom. Kase steps up to the edge, scowls. A FRESHLY-CUT QUARRY has been hewn from the hilltop by the massive sword of modern technology. EARTH MOVING EQUIPMENT several stories tall lines the inner basin. KASE What have they done to my mountain?! He gazes down at DUNCAN'S BODY sprawled at the base of the cliff. Then starts down after him. EXT - BOTTOM OF QUARRY - DAY Duncan crawls over to his sword... . . . as Kase picks his way down the steep incline. Duncan spikes his sword into the ground and uses it to climb upright. One look at his battered body and you know this fight is over. He just stands there, hunched over his sword, grimly waiting for Kase to reach him and deliver the killing blow. It doesn't take long. Kase stops, regards him with contempt. KASE Don't make it easy. I hate that. DUNCAN Youre breaking my heart. KASE Pick up! Duncan shakes his blood-streaked head. KASE PICK UP! DUNCAN It's always been too easy for you, Kase. No reason this time should be any different. He plucks his sword out of the ground... . . . and TURNS HIS BACK TO KASE. DUNCAN (cont'd) Take your best shot. He hobbles off, sword hanging limp at his side. Kase starts TREMBLING WITH RAGE. KASE MACLEOD! Duncan ignores him, keeps walking. About now, we should have a pretty good idea what Duncan has in mind. But Kase doesn't have a clue. DUNCAN'S POV: For a fleeting moment, Connor stands before Duncan, more mist than flesh. He opens his arms wide. CONNOR'S APPARITION Remember weil, old friend. He DISSOLVES AWAY as Kase hoists sword over shoulder... KASE (cont'd) MAC-LEOD!! . ..and CHARGES... Which is exactly what Duncan expected. USING THE SAME MOVE CONNOR TAUGHT HIM-- --Duncan PIVOTS WITH the THRUST, catching Kase completely off guard and off balance. This time, no force of man or nature can keep Duncan's sword from hitting home. He SLICES UPWARD with a ROAR OF DEFIANCE... . ..and FOLLOWS THROUGH. ON KASE: He stands there, head miraculously still intact, a look of bewildered relief. Duncan simply POPS his sword butt into Kase's face. The head comes easily away from the neck and falls. KASE'S POV spins END OVER END through the air, bounces twice and comes to a rest SIDEWAYS. And that's how we first see his HEADLESS BODY, sprawled across the ground. KASE'S SEVERED HEAD blinks with sudden recognition. And now he knows. This is the worst part of losing your head-- those last few seconds of cold lucidity. DUNCAN opens his arms to HEAVES UNDERFOOT. WIDE - THE QUARRY the ULTIMATE OUICKENING as THE EARTH WALLS EXPLODE like a circle of VOLCANOES venting into the center. Duncan CLAWS UPWARD on a GROUNDSWELL OF RAW ENERGY as DIRT, ROCK, ASH and SMOKE OBLITERATE THE BASIN. The SEISMIC CONVULSIONS GRADUALLY SUBSIDE. The dust settles. And the blighted landscape falls into an unearthly SILENCE, blind to its own buried secrets. HOLD on the trailing wisps of smoke as THE GROUND SHUDDERS and DUNCAN'S KATANA BREAKS THE SURFACE. It PLUNGES UPWARD ONE, TWO, THREE MORE TIMES, pulverizing dirt and stone. HANDS FOLLOW, clawing their up way through the loosely- mounded earth until DUNCAN'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS APPEAR. As if the earth itself is giving birth to a new generation of Immortal. He rolls out onto the ground, gasping, triumphant. Reborn. One inch at a time, he slowly rises to his feet. As we KEEP ON RISING up into a FIERY HIGHLAND SUNSET. TILT BACK DOWN TO: EXT - HIGHLANDS ABOVE GLENFINNAN Duncan stands over a freshly-dug grave. Onto the simple stone, he's chisled: HEATHER MACLEOD BELOVED WIFE OF CONNOR And beneath it: CONNOR MACLEOD BELOVED HUSBAND OF HEATHER Duncan's eyes glisten with an unspeakable loss. And a comfort in knowing that his friend has finally found the peace of eternity. DUNCAN yours is the greater prize my friend. Welcome home. LINGER ON DUNCAN as we DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO... EXT - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAWN FAITH stands sentinel-like atop a bluff overlooking the Hudson River and the insignificant island of Manhattan beyond. Her trademark slashes of facepaint and hair dye have been shed like molted skin. What remains is a serene beauty that defies fashion or vanity. Her faraway eyes BLINK with a sudden, frightening clarity. THE BUZZ sets her reflexes snapping as she SPINS AROUND-- --and CATCHES the COLICHMARDE, handle first. DUNCAN follows, strolling toward her with hands loose at his side. Faith runs her finger down the shimmering blade. FAITH (considers) So... what am I supposed to do next -- kiss you or take your head? Duncan steps up to her, smiling enigmatically. DUNCAN The choice is yours. FADE OUT: THE END
